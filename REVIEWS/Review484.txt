		<shortDescription>Based on a true story, but fictional...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw "Anastasia" in the theatre the last day of November, 1997, the year it came out. I was eight, the year she is in the prolouge. Ever since, I have been interested in the story of Anastasia Nikolaevna Romanov, her life, and her untimely death.While I know the movie is not historically accurate, I don't care! The movie is fiction after all- based on a true story (of Anastasia's rumored escape and women who claimed to be her), loosely, mind you- but perhaps it is not as unlikely as it seems: when the remains of the Romanovs were discovered back in 1991, Alexei (her brother,the Czarvitch) and one of the Grand Duchesses were missing. And with age analysis of the bones, scientists believe that the missing daughter is in fact Anastasia, and not one of her sisters, Olga, Tatiana, or Maria. But who really knows what happened?My opinion of the movie is that it is wonderful. It draws you into the world of the lost Russian Princess, to a time that is "far away, long ago", that doesn't exist anymore.The music and animation are stunning, and the photo research of St. Petersburg is amazing! Take the Catherine Palace and the magnificent gate you see, as well as the city itself. The 3-D animation is amazing; you look like you could reach out and touch it! The music is truly magical; "Once Upon a December" (especially Deana Carter's version)is haunting yet beautiful. I own the soundtrack- I listen to it frequentlyto help me relax.But what I love best about the movie is the romance that occurs between Anya(Anastasia) and Dimitri. It starts out as a con, a trick for money, and turns into a love story. I think it shows that people really do have good in them, and that true love really exists. It's also heartwarming to think that a young boy who saved the girl he liked (princess or not) later helps her restore her identity and find a true place (in this case, happily together with him)."Anastasia" is really my favourite movie of all time, even though now I'm almost 15. I'd recommend it to anyone, and advise historical literialists to look beyond the fiction and let yourself be taken on a "Journey to the Past" with the romance, comedy, and magic of this story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspend any disbelief, and the movie is *outstanding*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best way to watch a movie is with suspension of disbelief - Just trust what the producers present you with and don't question it. With that, "Anastasia" is one of the most delightful movies I've seen in some time. It's like an old musical, with people spontaneously erupting into choreographed dance, but with modern dialog (And funny, at that!), an enjoyable romance, and action sequences to keep things moving. The music, while nothing to remember to the point of distraction, was perfect for humming, and even worked to advance the plot - Unlike so many animated songs put in for the sake of having a song. So it wasn't historically perfect - if it were, there'd be no story. Go ahead and feel smug that you know what really happened, but don't turn to comment to your neighbor, lest you miss one minute of the wonderfully unfolding plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic for all ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let others carp about the disservices to history: this Anastasia rises above its flaws to offer an engaging, emotionally resonant story of a girl's search for identity. Within its historical, quasi-factual context, the film presents a situation almost everyone can relate to--that of trying to find one's place in the world. Orphaned Anya's quest for her past (and, consequently, her future) strikes universal emotional chords: singing "Journey to the Past," she sets out with both trepidation and hope to find her identity and her place in the world. The haunting, poignant "Once Upon a December" sequence, one of the finest scenes in any recent film, is unforgettable, as we watch Anya's yearnings take the form of a ghostly dance with memories of a vanished life. And the final reunion where hostility melts gradually into acceptance, is one of the most moving and satisfying moments in film. Everything about the film bespeaks loving attention and quality: the magnificent animation and design re-create lavish Russian and Parisian locations (complete with recognizable artworks and cameos by celebrities of the '20s), and the screenplay balances action, humor, and genuine emotion. Villain Rasputin is clearly aimed at children, and some of the repartee between Anya and unlikely hero Dimitri may seem jarringly anachronistic, but viewers of any age should still enjoy this timeless coming-of-age story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely LOVE this movie! I am a little amused by all the people having a problem with this movie not being historically accurate. Need I remind people that this is a cartoon, not a documentary? I was actually impressed with the attention to details: Nicholas looks very much like he did in life, Anastasia's little brother's sickness is not overlooked (he is walking with a limp), 'Once upon a December's words 'Someone holds me safe and warm... ' sound so much like a Russian Gypsy song! That said, I do have to say that there are a few things that could have been prevented by hiring one Russian speaking person. Examples: When Dimitry and Anya first meet, he has a problem pronouncing her name. That would never happen. Anya is a very common name in Russia and would not be mistaken for anything else. Also, when Sophie opened the door she says something that IS NOT a Russian name, very silly. Another example would be Anastasia looking through her family album, when they make her memorize thing, remember the picture of uncle Vanya? ("Loved his vodka, got it Anya?") Well, he just looks like a common peasant, not a member of royal family.Bartok?. I wonder who thought of the name?. It is not a Russian name? My guess is that it was meant to be 'BRATOK' which means 'little brother', used to address a companion, a friend. So.. those are my thoughts. All in all, I highly recommend the movie. Not as an educational historical reference, but as a wonderful entertaining musical animated movie! The fact that is NOT Disney is actually a big plus for me!Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has the sumptuous look of a Broadway musical...delightful entertainment...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of the most beautiful animation and backgrounds in recent history are a central ingredient of "Anastasia", a charming full-length feature based on the famous title character and set against the period of the Russian revolution. Expert vocal work by Angela Lansbury (Dowager Empress), Meg Ryan (Anastasia), John Kusack (Dimitri) and many others, make the characters seem more dimensional than in most animated features. Particularly Dimitri and Anastasia, whose love-hate relationship seems startlingly real given the superb animation.The score is studded with some Oscar-nominated music and the sinister moments have the kind of villain you love to hate (Rasputin). Some of the scenes might be too intense for small children--as well as a realistic railway scene on a runaway car--but all in all, should delight young and old. Angela Lansbury's voice is especially effective as the Empress. The art of animation doesn't get any better than this! This Don Bluth/Gary Goldman production is as good as anything Disney might have attempted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie (maybe a bit graphic for young children) was still charming. It was able to make me laugh and feel with the characters during the more heartfelt scenes. I thought the animation was beautiful, and the storyline was well-developed.There weren't gaps in the plot, leaving the audience to suspend their disbelief and make up excuses as to what or why something occurred.The music was not only memorable, but it had a range of style, including haunting melodies and catchy beats. And the singers weren't concerned with sounding like pop singers, taking the audience out of the movie, which I appreciated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful movie, amazing music :D</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anastatsia is without doubt one of the best animated movies ever made, for several reasons. It's an amazing story, filled with adventure, romance, smart dialog and wonderful music. The story is set in Russia and other parts of Europe, both in the wonderful palaces of the Czar family and the french countryside. It tells the story of the lost princess Anastasia, and uses the rumors that she as the only one of the Romanov family survived the massacre during the Russian revolution. Anya, a girl with no memory of her past, meets with two men of questionable professions that promise to take her to Paris, if she's willing to try to convince the Dowager Emperess that she might be Anastasia... Unfortunately, the evil sorcerer Rasputin (the man who killed the Romanov family) also knows that Anya is alive, and swears to kill her, whatever the cost... So Anya is taken on a magical adventurous ride through Europe, to find her family. One of the best things about the movie is the characters. They seem so real, like real persons, not platonic, "a beautiful damsel in distress", "a handsome hero" end of story... The music is wonderful, better than in many Disney movies, and the story very good.The only things I don't like about the film, is the things that's dangerous about making movies about real historical events. The Romanov Family weren't the innocents victims they're painted out to be, and the fact that the story is based on that... But I've only started to think about this now when I'm older, so... Anyone who likes a good movie, rent or buy Anastasia. It's worth it. I should recommend the Swedish version, if someone here was to see it. Helen Sjöholm is the singer of Anya's role, and she is one of the best singers in Sweden...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The last time I saw this, I thought there were maybe too many songs in it that distracted the feel from the movie. But now that I've seen it again, it's clear that the songs are well written, along with the storyline.This is not based on a true story, only loosely on a few rumors that the real Anastasia survived the killing of her family. The heroine Anya is like a Disney princess who is desperate to find out who she is and where she belongs, after suffering from amnesia following the separation of her family. The villain is the brilliant Rasputin, back from the dead, intent on extracting revenge on the Romanovs, thus starting the Russian Revolution. Dimitri and Vladimir at first are looking to find the ideal Anastasia look alike in order to get the riches from her real mother in Paris.A lot of Bluth's films revolve around a journey and a couple involving some history on Russia. I really enjoyed the songs that played over the end credits, "At the Beginning" and "Journey To The Past" sung in her own way by Aaliyah, the beautiful angelic voiced R&amp;B singer who left way too soon.Brilliantly animated for its time and enjoyable for adults, Anastasia remains a classic family film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best animated movies I've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Anastasia you expect there to be a few musical numbers, a battle of good and evil, and romance. Well there is that but, it comes out so beautifully to where this doesn't even feel like an animated movie. It feels more real than you'd ever expect from an animated movie like this.Anastasia is a movie about a girl named Anya who lost nearly all of her memory about her past and her family. Now with the help of a con-man named Dimitri shes going to Paris to learn the truth about her past. While on this journey an evil sorcerer (who's the reason her family died in the first place) is out bring an end to the Romanav line forever. So as Dimitri and Anya grow closer to learning the truth about her past they must also make a difficult choice about what to do as they begin to fall in love.Anastasia is a movie that just about the entire family will enjoy. It is light-hearted, filled with laughter, beautiful music that will make you want to dance and sing, and adventure to keep you excited throughout the film. This is a film I recommend to everyone who wants to find good whole-some family entertainment to watch, because Anastasia is perfect for that very reason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is Disney Overtaken by Ex-Members?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story/legend of Princess Anastasia of Russia is an unlikely tale to be told in an animated musical. But it works, mainly because it doesn't confuse its main audience, children; but yet, at the same time, it provides enough entertainment for its older audience, adults."Anastasia" is based loosely on the same legendary tale as the 1956 motion picture starring Ingrid Bergman. Supposedly, as the legend goes, Russia's ruling Romanov family was murdered in the upheaval of revolution, and one child, Anastasia, escaped the carnage and survived to make a valid claim for the throne. Anastasia was the granddaughter of the Dowager Empress Marie (voiced, in this film, by Angela Lansbury), who herself escaped to Paris and now wearily rejects one imposter after another.Meg Ryan provides the vocals for Anastasia. The film opens with her escaping from Rasputin (Christopher Lloyd); the only survivor is Anastasia and her grandmother. She spends years in a cruel orphanage, losing all memory of her earlier days. Then as a lithe and spirited teenager, she falls into the clutches of two con men named Dimitri (John Cusack) and Vladimir (Kelsey Grammer). They both worked in the royal court and have insider knowledge; their scheme is to tutor an imposter until she can fool the Dowager Empress. The irony, which the movie makes much of, is that this impostor is, in fact, the real thing. The only minor problem with "Anastasia" is how it tries to fill in the story with an overly-evil (and truly unbelievable) villian. The ending is more than ridiculous. If the entire tale was a "Sleeping Beauty"-type-story, it might be more believable, but right as we are led to believe this story is BASED on something somewhat true and based on true events, they throw in a living-dead-monster, Rasputin, to try and kill Anastasia. Good if the movie was a fantasy set up from the beginning, but it wasn't. It was a more serious 'toon turned into a fantasy one by the end.The film's directors and producers (and former Disney artists) Don Bluth and Gary Goldman put together this film. Their film credits include "An American Tail" and "All Dogs Go to Heaven." No surprise, because the film, "Anastasia," like the other films, is darker than most fairy-tale-Disney-movies. It's more graphic, gritty and real, which is why the end is so disappointing.In a time when CGI seems to be taking over the animation world, "Anastasia" is a good reminder that cartoon films can still be made good. A "Monsters, Inc.," it isn't, but it is definitely good.I would give "Anastasia" a solid "4," but the end was ridiculous and predictable, and way out of turn for a film of its nature. It set itself up as a serious animated film, but then dropped everything and switched to fantasy. Its only blunder is this.3/5 stars -John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This blew me away!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my personal favourite of the Don Bluth movies. I also recommend American Tail, Land Before Time and All Dogs Go To Heaven. Anastasia is just beautiful, and was one of the most requested films when we had our family cinemas. A couple of years ago, I got it on video, and all those memories came back. I love this movie so much. The animation is gorgeous. The characters are well drawn, and the backgrounds and colours are stunning. There is a lot of wit between the characters. Not to mention a truly sweet romance between Anastasia and Dimitri. Whoever hated this movie, must be told, that this is so much more watchable than Richard Rich's King and I. Anastasia herself is so beautiful. The highlights were Anastasia's dream and the scene on the train. The songs are what make this movie. My favourite is "Once Upon a December" as it is so nostalgic, haunting and poignant. All the other songs are well done and move the story forward. Even "Dark of the Night". As for the story, yes it is historically inaccurate, but so is Pocahontas, and this is marginally better. It was so well told. In some Don Bluth movies, they lose the essence right from minute one, but not here. As for the voice talents, they were all impeccable. Meg Ryan was suitably feisty as Anastasia, and Liz Callaway did her singing voice beautifully. John Cusack put an immense amount of charm into his voice-over, although Dimitri was for me was the weakest character in the movie. Kelsey Grammar has great fun as Vladmir, and also check him out as Zozi in Bartok the Magnificent. Christopher Lloyd voices villain Rasputin with over the top menace, and the villain loses his body parts here. We have all had days like that. Hank Azaria is also great as Bartok.Underrated Broadway actress Bernadette Peters has a great french accent, and I had so much fun with her singing "Paris hold the key to your heart." For me, Angela Lansbury provides a completely human and poignant character in the Dowager Empress. Her prologue was so well paced, and there was a side to the great character actress that I never knew she had. In conclusion, a sweet and beautiful animation that is essential to all animation lovers. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved "Anastasia". It is easily one of the best movies directed by the great animator Don Bluth, who also made classics as "The Land Before Time" and "The Secret of NIMH". It has all the feeling of classic animated films like "Snowhite" and "Cinderella", with gorgeous animation, beautiful music, great voice performances and many memorable sequences. Meg Ryan and John Cusack are great in their roles, while Christopher Lloyd is great as the villain. This is a great for all the family, and it is shame that there aren't very much animated films like this in the recent times (The closest thing that I saw recently was "The princess and the Frog" which was pretty good)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fact that this movie is not historically accurate does not bother me - it is an entertaining animated movie, not a documentary.My biggest complaint about this movie is Rasputin. He detracts far more from the story than he adds; if you remove all of his scenes, you are left with a mature, beautifully animated movie. Rasputin and Bartok really do nothing for the story but interrupt it with annoyingly long scenes that look more like a Saturday morning gargoyles cartoon than the rest of the movie. Without these distractions, maybe the more important parts of the movie (Anastasia's and Dmitri's relationship, Anastasia's meeting with her grandmother, etc.) could have been developed more strongly. Rasputin, Bartok, their environment, and the supernatural occurrences attached to them simply do not belong in this movie, which otherwise looks and sounds very sophisticated. Nevertheless, there must be an antagonist - this role could have been filled by another group of con men with a fake Anastasia or by a realistic assassin - or *something* other than Rasputin.Aside from Rasputin, there is little to complain about - the movie is beautifully and realistically animated and has a great soundtrack, especially the haunting song "Once Upon a December". There are some truly memorable scenes between Anastasia and Dmitri, and every character (besides Rasputin and Bartok, of course) is believable and fully brought to life both as individuals and in their interactions. Definitely worth watching if you can put up with aforementioned shortcomings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply The Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen many, many animated movies featuring princesses and romance and music, most of them Disney. And after comparing ANASTASIA to all of these 'classics', I must say that I like ANASTASIA the most.First, lets address the whole historical aspect. NO, this movie is not historically correct. One would be in a world of hurt if they were to try to use this to teach a child a history lesson. I am a person who is usually bothered by major historical inaccuracies. Of course, I admit that I know very little about this time period and about these events. To someone who is very interested in these events and is very knowledgeable on them, this movie might bother them. But keep in mind that this IS a children's movie-not meant to be historically accurate. It is meant to be fun, and this it accomplishes.It is in the music that distinguishes this movie in my mind and puts it in a category of its own. The songs are simply amazing. There is not one song that I do not enjoy. Liz Callaway is just wonderful as the singing voice of Anastasia. When she sings "Once Upon A December", I get chills every time. It is such an eerie and beautiful, haunting song. And paired with the scene in which it is shown in, with the ghosts all dancing, well, it's hard not to be moved. And then there is Jim Cummings, singing as Rasputin. "In The Dark Of The Night" is also an amazing song. Very fun, yet still a bit scary. Of course, these are just two songs out of many wonderful songs. If anything, get the soundtrack, as it is just wonderful. The music blows all of the Disney songs out of the water, in my opinion.Now, the romance. Yes, of course there is romance, this is a cartoon princess movie, after all. But it is not the love at first site plot that is so familiar to Disney movies. The romance is slow and just full of tension. Never before have I been able to feel such sexual tension between two cartoon characters. But the bickering Anya and Dimitri is just wonderful. Such chemistry! It is nice to see two characters get to know each other before falling in love.Overall, this is just a wonderful movie. I remember loving it when I was younger and it had just come out, and I love it just as much today. I highly recommend this movie to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a movie to rival Disney!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anastasia is one of the best cartoon-movies of recent years. It is based on the legend of Anastasia, the daughter of Tsar Nikolai 2., and tells us what happens to Anastasia later. In 1917 the Romanov family is not allowed to rule Russia anymore, and the evil Rasputin arrests the family. However, Anastasia and her grandmother escapes, but little Anastasia loses her grandmother at the the trainstation. Later she wants to be reunited with her family, but sadly she has forgotten who she really is!? The story is excellent(despite of not being a 100% historically correct), the animation is some of the best that I`ve ever seen in a cartoon-movie, and the soundtrack is mostly stunning. A worthy alternative to Disney`s classics, and far better than most of Disney`s newer movies. 9,5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched Anastasia when i was 4 years old, and I remember falling in love with it. Now I'm 14 years old, and ten years later, I still love it! I recently re-discovered it again while it was mentioned in English class and I had to watch it. So when a friend suggested we watched an "old movie" i instantly said ANASTASIA! and she agreed. So we watched and EVERYTHING in the movie came back to me! The movie was fantastic! I admit, it is not historically accurate, but it is fine for this movie because it makes it more, "magical". This move is an all-time classic; with mystery, romance, and comedy. It is an absolutely Wonderful movie. I highly recommend that you watch it! The songs are amazing. The characters are pretty much awesome, although Rasputin may be a bit frightening. But what I really like about this movie, is the relationship between Dimitri and Anya, it's too cute. It's not like those movies where the characters are pushed into love from the beginning. But in Anastasia, love freaking BLOOMS, like it should. :) WATCH IT, ITS AMAZING! 10/10</fullReview>

When i'm upset i find myself watching this movie and within 3 minutes i am so much in a trance i forget what was wrong with me. The film is based on the possibility that Anastasia could have lived through the revolution, it shows her try to discover her true identity and find her family with the help of two men (who grow to realise that she is Anastasia). This is a great film and I would definitely recommend it to all, adults and children would enjoy it I think, and it is definitely worth watching. It is not Disney but I'm sure that they must have been pretty annoyed that they didn't get to this story first :). I give it 10/10 :D</fullReview>

Now saying that part I will like to say that one of my fav class in school was history and I LOVE this movie. It's a cartoon. And it was inspired not based on the real story of the princess Anastasia. I mean a taking bat, dead Rasputin coming back to life, I can see how somemany people will believe that this was based 100% on history.

		<fullReview>I usually am not one to see animated movies unless it's the new summer Disney musical (e.g. Mulan, Hercules, Aladdin), but Anastasia caught my eye in the previews. Just as I do with Disney movies, I do not expect realism or accuracy (just as I don't with Saturday morning cartoons), but I try to look for the artistic elements, since I plan to be a cartoonist after graduating from college. The animation is smooth and flowing, but not so much to be "cartoony", as many Disney movies are (e.g. Aladdin). The backgrounds are superb! A hundred dancing Russians in St. Petersburg amidst smoke and falling snow is not easy to draw or animate (even with a computer)! Then there's the scene at the Moulin Rouge, which imitates the famous painting with round dabs of paint (I forget what the technique is called). Even the music is commendable (Rumor In St. Petersburg and Journey To The Past are excellent!). Although I still prefer Alan Menken (who did music for Disney as of 1989, except Lion King &amp; Mulan), I found the soundtrack to be worth the money. It is convenient to compare Anastasia to Disney films because of Disney's fame, but really they contrast more -- there are few similarities. I can't say much about the accuracy of the storyline, only that I do not expect that kind of realism from a cartoon. Sure, people say "Now kids will grow up thinking Russian communism was brought on by Rasputin", but my generation supposedly was going to grow up thinking that Michelangelo was a Ninja Turtle. You have to remember that the story doesn't even apply to history, since Anna Anderson was not Anastasia, and the real Anastasia's body was buried along with the Czar in August of 1998 (in this case, the other daughter, Marie, could not be found). Aside from that, the storyline in the animated film Anastasia is -- autonomously -- enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can't stop watching it!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: Spoilers!!!I remember watching this movie as a child on a VHS, but because they are now outdated, I hadn't watched it for years. But it was not long ago I found it on Blu-Ray and bought it unsure whether or not I would find it as good a story as a did almost a decade ago. And I was not disappointed! I say ignore those people who only hate this movie because of its historical inaccuracy, I mean, is it really that important for a movie to be historically correct to be great movie? I hardly think so. I think this story line is in every way amazing! And because this was based on a true story, it encouraged me to research and read up on the real story of Anastasia. This movie is a masterpiece and clearly one of my favorites. The characters are all great in their respected roles and the one thing I particularly loved was that Anastasia, even though she found her family and remembered her past, she gave back the crown so she could be with the one she loved. How many other 'princesses' have done that?? It's a refreshing end! The songs are hauntingly beautiful - so beautiful I went out and bought the album. It's visually great to watch and even though some parts may be a bit scary for the younger audience, I would certainly recommend this as a must-watch! Such an excellent movie! I'd be watching this for many years to come!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don Bluth's excellent comeback and it's been almost 15 years since it's release!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, Don Bluth. Looks like you've found a way to make another successful film in your career. It's been a long time since you released such great family hits like "The Secret of NIMH" (avoid the god-awful sequel if you know what's good for you), "An American Tail", "The Land Before Time", and "All Dogs Go To Heaven" and even though your career later went downhill with new films like "Rock-A-Doodle", "Thumbelina", and "The Pebble and the Penguin", I've found them decent and watchable while A Troll in Central Park, although not a terrible movie, was in my opinion not a good film.Then, finally, you made a great comeback by competing with Disney yet again this time with another successful film "Anastasia" based on not only the historical event, but the 1956 movie as well. Before I begin this review, I want to say that I never saw the 1956 movie or read the historical event (I did learn it in class though, but I'm getting ahead of myself), but that doesn't take away the fact that I apparently loved this movie much like anyone else who grew up with it (So did I). I've heard that lots of people hated this movie for it's historical inaccuracies, but let me remind you that this is a children's movie since the violence from that event might be pretty graphic for younger kids. That's why Don Bluth decided to change all of that.Historical inaccuracies aside, I was enthralled by it's average, but magnificent animation and the character animation is decent. Not great, but still good. The characters themselves are well-developed. Anastasia (short-named Anya) is a likable protagonist and I liked her attempts to find out about her past. Dimitri is pretty good too with some great chemistry between him and Anastasia. Other characters including the hilarious comedic talking bat Bartok are likable as well, but the only character that I like the most is Rasputin who was by far a great non-Disney villains and is one of the most darkest ones yet along with some of Disney's villains. Even his dark magic sorcery is great which makes him very original.The story is dark, but not as dark as The Secret of NIMH and although, despite it's historical inaccuracies, it's at least good and the pacing never fails to amuse me, but the strongest aspect goes to the songs/music from David Newman with some great haunting and melodic tunes including "Once Upon a December" "Journey to the Past", "In The Dark of the Night" and more and the voice acting with some great talents like Meg Ryan, John Cusack, Angela Lansbury, Hank Azaria, and Christopher Lloyd since they fitted the characters very well throughout the entire film.Anastasia is this close to becoming a masterpiece of animation. I know lots of people hated this movie for it's historical inaccuracies, but as an animation fan, I'm recommending this to others highly as one of Bluth's best works yet. It's also great to see that it made lots of money at the box office. Thumbs up from me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great animated kid's movie! it's darker than most Disney movies, original, and extremely funny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anastasia is a movie for everyone, but it was made for children! while commenting it, I can never forget that fact. I read some reviews that declared this movie was fantasy and unbelievable, so it deserved a bad review. I find that ridiculous! Obviously it's full of fantasy... it's a fairytale! Although it's based on the story of anastasia the Russian grand duchess, the movie does not try to be biographical... For gods sake, the villain is "rotting" during the entire movie!I think Anastasia is a great fairy tale movie. it's darker than most Disney movies, original, and extremely funny. You have romance, suspense and lots of jokes (especially with bartok the bat)! All a child can wish for, but the adults will also be entertained!The songs are sweet (I like journey to the past - great song) and the singers are amazing (the actor Kelsey Grammar, who gives voice to vladimir, sings himself and he has an amazing voice). Meg Ryan and John Cusack made a good job with the main characters' voices. But the actor that deserves a standing ovation with his work in this movie is hank azaria (who gives voice to apu in simpsons, for example), he plays bartok, who is the reason for most of the laughs in this movie. The animation is not bad, but the movie is from 1997, so... Still, there are a few parts where the characters are not well draw, nothing terrible tough.If you want to have a nice time watching an animated classic, this is a must see. I like it, and I've shown it to my nephews and they loved it. They laughed a lot, and said that it was lots of fun. And that's what this movie offers you... fun, after all it's a great kid's movie.</fullReview>

And if one more person says it was to "graphic for young children" I am going to slap them. It's not graphic at all, it's funny, refreshing, and most of all, it was A CHILDREN'S MOVIE! Who CARES what the adults think... it was made for kids so leave it ALONE! And no one better be bashing All Dogs go to Heaven OR Land Before Time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story and character acting is at least as good as the best of Disney's princess movies. The animation is a little behind Disney's for 1997. No matter, Meg Ryan, Christopher Lloyd, Kelsey Grammar, Angela Lansburry and the screenplay much more than make up for it. The scene when Anastasia sings "Once Upon a December" is amazing. Lacey Chabert is in this too. She's the singing voice of Anastasia at the beginning of the movie. She also does the talking voice of Anastasia in the extras segment. The true history of Anastasia is horrible and unforgettable. It always is disturbing to see the true history of a fairytale...entertainment built on a tragedy. I would prefer that the story's characters have different names and take place somewhere else. Although then, we wouldn't have the desire to go back and learn the truth in many cases. As a fictional story, the movie is great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the longest time I thought this was a Disney movie. I mean even my mom believed it was. Took a lot of convincing but now I know it's not. Although it is a very expensive ripoff. Just kidding. I've actually always liked this movie. I would have given it a ten but not sure if it really deserves it. This is one animated movie that isn't Disney that I still like the songs now that I'm older. Still like everything about this movie...well except maybe the bat. I know he was for the comedy but I never really liked him. In my opinion it's a really great animated family film. I really like this film and probably always will. I know the true story about what happened. When I consider the two even though the movie shares the name I consider the movie and the true story two completely different things. True children that see this movie are in no way getting the truth but why would they want it. Don Bluth obviously never meant for it to be like that. My opinion, considering the subject manner and what he was trying to do I'd say he did a really good job. If children really want to know the truth behind the movie I suggest they look it up when they get older. Either get mad from it or not I think Don Bluth did a really good job on a story so tragic. It's very slightly similar in my opinion to what Disney did to the Little Mermaid.</fullReview>

It didn't take long for Tzar Nicholas Romanov and his family to be murdered and replaced by the Bolsheviks.That was the end of Tzarist Russia in 1917.But this film is something else entirely - a beautiful romance between a peasant palace worker and the impetuous and excitable Anastasia Romanov. This is a journey through life, a quest for truth on a road less traveled.Young Anastasia has no recollection of her past, but she is soon won over by a charming swindler who takes her to Paris to meet up with the Empress of Russia.

		<fullReview>i first saw this movie when i was about 11, roughly when it first came out, and it was enchanting and in some ways i believe it is the first thing that drew me to the mystery behind the Romanovs disappearance in 1918. i watched it again, having just got back from Russia on a school trip last week, and was slightly disappointed, although not really surprised that it wasn't as true to life as i had first thought. still, it presents the story in an enchanting, magical way that could draw younger children into the mystery without even knowing it, and at the same time is just a great feel-good movie for the entire family.the animation is amazing and the scenery is breath taking despite the lack of true historic content. but, really its not fair for me to say that when it isn't really a historic film, it's "based on" historic events, not re-telling them, and that gives it that slice of originality which so many of the current available films lack! For what it is "Anastasia" is a beautiful film about finding yourself and surviving the odds. and the songs are great too!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No offense, but I'm sick and tired of this crap on how historically innacurate this movie was and how it's hardly subject matter for children. Well, I say,if it's so dark, don't let them watch it-and save it for your "mature" self. Think about it-we all know that Anastasia died when she was a little girl and, ok-Rasputin didn't sell his soul and didn't have a talking bat for an accomplice. First off, if we know out history, we're not being corrupted by this little twist on history, and second of all-they are at least making an effort tohave it suitable for children. Instead of a bloody massacre, just think of it as a sorceror's doings. Having said that-I like to focus a lot more of the lavish designs and costumes and love story, for it is all enchanting in a Pygmallion/My Fair Lady sort of way. It's a story that has been used in many movies: A guy decides to make over an ugly duckling into a beauty and falls in love with her. This one's fresh for it has a Parisian/Russian twist and contains some snappy dialogue. However, although Meg Ryan's voice is nice, I would have liked a more graceful one. Anyway-5 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bluth blazes brightly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once it seemed as if the animators at Disney were the only kids on the block. The appearance of Don Bluth's Anastasia blazes with creative fire, or, to change metaphors, with scintillating wonder, like one of the diamonds in Anastasia's tiara. Among the groups who viewed this film, the dramatic intensity of Rasputin's initial appearance was often mentioned as being rather overwhelming for some smaller children. Therefore, do not be deceived by the G rating. Even so, it does set the stage rather nicely for his chilling appearance to Anastasia later on. The voice characterizations are enchanting! The chemistry between Ryan and Cusack is magical! And the writing? There are delightful one-liners. Having watched this with over 50 children of varying degrees of television experience, the reactions were generally positive. Most commented on the outstanding fluidity of the animation, particularly the sequence featuring the song, "Once Upon a December". Some adult viewers were particularly touched by that song. It is indeed understandable why these songs were nominated for awards.Perhaps others, jaded by less skillful animation techniques, will pass off this animated masterpiece as just "another cartoon", however, it was a joy to watch, a pleasure to listen to and a film one can enjoy again and again...without apologies. I won't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anastasia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anastasia is a decent non-Disney animated film, inspired by almost every other Disney animated film. But it's not quite there. In fact, in its weaknesses, Anastasia bolsters everything that is good in Disney. (Forgive me if you're annoyed by the comparison to the aforementioned studio but the crew behind Anya obviously alluded the "Magic Kingdom" while making this film so it's inevitable for me to compare):Songs - when I'm watching most of Disney's films, the musical numbers are usually the highlight of the film. Here, it's quite simply, a bore. The songs drag too long, they lack any sense of wit, and they're bland. Every time I sensed a song was coming up, I yawned.Animation - things get better here. While the characters never move as believably or smoothly as their Disney counterparts, the backgrounds are often breathtaking. However, that aspect is not even either. The CGI effects were handled pretty badly and do not mesh well with the rest of the picture. A great example would be the train-wreck in the first half of the movie. The train, the backdrop and the billowing smoke don't look like the same image. The same goes for the crashing waves, magic dust, etc. I wish they didn't experiment with CGI so heavily because the result looks crude. I wouldn't be so picky about it but by 1997 the guys at D were pros at this. It should have been used to the minimum. Characters - Anya is fairly likable and Meg Ryan does a good job. But that's about it. The villain, who's supposed to be the most fun characters is dull and his demise is pathetic. The whole climax is bad actually. The sidekicks are silly, too. Thank god they're mute!I will applaud the filmmakers for undertaking a fairly complex story and managing to turn it into an animated film, even if there are historical inaccuracies along the way. You can't have it all. Something else that stuck out to me throughout the movie was many gratuitous moments that kept dragging the story. Most of the film was spent on preparing Anya and the rest (her reunion with her grandma and the battle) was squeezed into the last 15 minutes. I'm giving Anastasia 6/10 because despite its drawbacks, I still appreciate the amount of effort that was put into it. It's a decent film that I can surely understand why people would love, but to me it's just not good enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Absolutely Wonderful Movie That I Believe The Whole Family Will Enjoy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my 2nd favorite animated movie of all time, right after Disney's "the Hunchback of Notre Dame". Heres a quick summary of why (without any spoilers!)1). The characters are livelyMost animated movie characters don't convey much of a personality. This movie is a wonderful exception. Anastasia has a slightly cynical and adventurous attitude voiced with wonderful spunk by Meg Ryan, and her lines don't have to explain her emotions for her. All of the characters converse in a realistic and amusing way, and this movie has the best dialogue by far than any other animated flicks.2). It understands its audience (&amp; its audience understands it!)My young cousins (age 3 &amp; 6) understood everything that went on in the movie, and they could not stop discussing it in vivid detail. I don't exactly know how the creators managed it, but they made it understandable to their target audience without having the characters or a narrator explain every little detail.3). The "Animated Kid Film Requirements"-Cute but not sappy romance {CHECK}-A vile and awful villain that makes the children shudder {CHECK}-Animal sidekicks {Two checks}-Great visuals and outstanding animation {CHECK 10x}-Action scenes {CHECK}-A lovable hero/heroine {CHECK FOR BOTH}There are many other things that I adore about this movie, but sadly I have a word limit and I'm not sure if I'm going over or not. My only regret about this movie is that I just saw it for the first time on Wednesday, and it came out in 1997.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I owned this film for several years as a child and loved it! Unfortunately it has since got lost or sold, but I have the best memories of it, and still remember some of the songs. Other reviews have said there's nothing in it to interest a child, but that was definitely not the case for me or my sister. The historical accuracy doesn't really matter, it's just a film and I didn't even know it was based on a true story until I was 12. Once Upon a December is a really beautiful song that still gets stuck in my head sometimes even though I haven't seen the film for 7 or 8 years. The only problem is it can be a bit scary. I can't remember details but Rasputin and the spirits did scare me quite a bit when I first watched it.</fullReview>

With this clearly we have been spoilt as the music, drama, adventure, emotion,and acting is seemingly far too incredible to be in just a simple animated family film.The story is excellently crafted and follows a lost Russian princess (voiced splendidly by Meg Ryan)brought up in an orphanage and later picked up by two shifty con-men (John Cusack and Kelsey Grammar really bring these two to life) on her journey to finding her past as well as her throne and loving grandmother (passionately voiced by Angela Lunsbury) with the deranged and vengeful villain Rasputin (who is made extra chilling by Christopher Lloyd) and his clumsy little servant Bartok (Hank Azaria manages to get a few little laughs out of us with this character) in hot pursuit of her.Much like the likes of 'The Lion King' (1994) this film has a huge impact and a great deal to offer. It is definitely well-worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably one of the best cartoon tales ever, 'Anastasia' is funny, exciting, romantic, and just plain awesome.The movie follows the story of Anya (Meg Ryan), an orphan who received amnesia from hitting her head when she was eight years old, with only a strange and beautiful necklace as a clue to her past. As the pendant has the sentence 'together in Paris' on it, Anya concludes that her family must reside in France, and so hooks up with two con men, Dimitri (John Cusack) and Vladimir (Kelsey Grammar), who decide to pass her off as the lost Romanov princess Anastasia to swindle the Dowager Empress (Angela Lansbury) out of the reward she has offered for her granddaughter's safe return. What the conniving pair and orphaned urchin don't realize is that Anya *is* Anastasia, and her family's undead confidant Rasputin (Christopher Lloyd) is bent on destroying her, and so eradicating the Romanov line forever.What a brilliant tale this is! Who cares if it isn't historically accurate? It's not meant to be, and there are quite a few little historical details anyways, like the paintings, and physical similarities between the cartoon characters and the real people (like the ghost of Anastasia's little brother Alexi walks with a limp, etc). It's meant to be a fantasy, a bit of wishful thinking. And there have been other takes on this story, so why bash this one?As well as this, the songs are extraordinary. 'Once Upon a December' still sends shivers down my spine even after all these years of being a steadfast fan of the film--even as a teenager I catch myself humming the tunes of 'Journey to the Past', 'In the Dark of the Night', 'Rumour in St Petersburg', and especially the uber-catchy 'Paris Holds the Key (To Your Heart)'. The humour and romance walk hand in hand with this one--though a lot of the laughs come out of the wicked Rasputin (only amusing because he's falling apart) and his bat side-kick Bartok (voiced by The Simpsons' Hank Azaria, so he's automatically hilarious), the funniest parts of the movie (I think) are generated by the bantering relationship between Dimitri the con-man and Anya/Anastasia. They are constantly arguing and insulting each other, even when faced with mortal peril, which makes their 'unspoken attraction' (as Dimitri's partner Vladimir calls it) even more adorable and real-seeming. All in all, 'Anastasia' may not be the perfect film, and sure it isn't historically accurate, but it is superb all the same!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Disney movie not made by Disney.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: First-rate animation, terrific voice cast and brilliant old-fashioned storytelling.It's hard not to mention Disney when it comes to talking about "Great Animated movies". They really started it by the way, and they perfected it. Anyone who even tries to challenge Disney (and eventually some did) will fail in comparison. Oh! Did I say anyone? Turns out, there is at least one film that manages to stand up and turn out to be a worthy successor. This is 20th Century Fox's animation studios pet project ANASTASIA, a brilliant, colorful and fast-moving romance adventure that, at some point, is a reason for the Mouse House to get a little worried. With colorful animation (rivals any of the studio's recent creations), tuneful music and no lack of energy (be it as an adventure, a romance or a comedy), ANASTASIA takes a big chance, and succeeds magnificently.It's probably best to mention that ANASTASIA is helmed by director/animator Don Bluth, who once had work at the Mouse House, and after leaving, tried to challenge Disney's work with his own efforts with other studios. His animated efforts, save THE LAND BEFORE TIME, weren't exactly worthy sit at the Disney throne. Despite some charming intentions, Bluth's fairy tales specifically THE American TALE, much-maligned ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN and the by-the-numbers PEEBLE AND THE PENGUIN didn't reach the height already visited many times by Disney. Simply just comparing Bluth's works to Disney's works says it all. Simply the mention of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and THE LION KING will have these rival films running for cover.But Bluth's found his BEAUTY IN THE BEAST with this one, and while not everyone will apply, ANASTASIA is a brilliant Disney successor, sometimes actually better and more mature than some of Disney's works (Shhhh! Don't say it out loud but I kinda like it a little more than BEAUTY AND THE BEAST). The animation is an improvement over Bluth's latter efforts, which can easily be described as a poor-man version of Disney animation. The animation here is far better, a marvelous fusion of the new computer-animation and the old traditional paper-and-pencil method. The final effect is outstanding and vibrant, if not nearly flawless. The voice cast is brilliant, living up to the tradition that the only way to drag adults to see an adaption of a fairy tale is to see a big-star name on the top billing. The cast in ANASTASIA are brilliant in lending their acting skills as voices to animated characters. The standout is Meg Ryan, as the voice of orphaned Anya (with singing voice by Liz Callaway) who may just be the long-lost-but-rumored-to-be-alive Grand Duchess of the title, who rivals any Disney princess simply for her spunk.As Anya's own leading man, a love-hate relationship (a more topical subject for a G-rated effort) with con man Dimitri (voiced by John Cusack, singing-voice by Jonathan Dokuchitz), who plans to get all the money and acclaim he wants when he delivers a convincing Anastasia stand-in to the very-worried Dowager Empress Marie (the great Angela Lansbury). On the other hand, Christopher Lloyd offer his voice to the evil monk Rasputin who wants to avenge his infamy by cursing the Romanov family. Assisting him is his Albino Bat sidekick Bartok (voiced by Hank Azaria). Apparently, the villain is where the film might get its flaws. Whereas Disney villains pack a strong punch, Rasputin is your garden-variety villain. He's a creep, an evil wizard who has command of evil goblins and critters at his own disposal. He's a distraction to be sure, but thanks both to Lloyd's eccentric energy and the animators limitless imaginations (Rasputin's little demons are quite original, not to mention bold and a little scary, for an animated film), he's a welcome distraction.Overall, the Mouse House is still on top, but ANASTASIA may be one of the few non-Disney movies that gave them a reason to worry. Rating: ***** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think Anastasia is a charm of a movie, uniting action, romance, the evil vs. good factor, and family into one fantasy. The quality of the animation is fairly average but the characters are well developed. The story is about a young orphaned girl (Anya), whose dream is to have an identity and a home. On the road of twisting options and possibilities, she takes a stop into the lives of two witty conmen, Dmitri and Vladimir. They make her consider the possibility that she is the infamous long lost Princess Anastasia, daughter of Empress Marie. You can't blame them, because she strongly resembles this beautiful duchess and only remembers small bits and pieces of her past. Proud of his polite persuasion (most of the time he's "bossy"), Dmitri thinks that he's finally on his way to earning a lot of money, until he falls in love with her?What unwinds from here, are some desperate murder attempts on Anya by the funnily evil Rasputin (well voiced by Christopher Lloyd), and some truths soon to be exposed, as Anya bridges the gap between past and present.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best animated films I've ever seen- and I've seen quite a few. This one stands out above the rest. It never fails to impress.This is the story of Anastasia, princess and air to the Russian throne. She is separated from her family while she is very young as the Russian monarchy is overthrown by the evil Rasputin. Then, ten years later, the Dowager Empress (Anastasia's grandmother) offers 10,000 rubles for her return, and Dimitri, the old palace kitchen boy plots to hire a girl to pretend to be Anastasia and get the reward. EHo should he find, but the real Anastasia, long-lost at an orphanage and with no memory of who she really is. And as Dimitri and his friend take Anastasia to try and meet her grandmother, Rasputin plots to destroy her.Despite all of that, it ends up being one of the better movies of it's year, and one of the greatest of all animated. Meg Ryan, John Cusack, Kelsey Grammar, Christopher Lloyd, and Angela Lansbury contribute fine voicing to the animated characters, and their voices never seem awkward. However, it's the great music and songs that steal the show. Liz Callaway's singing for Anastasia is especially breath-taking.Of course, the animation itself is great. It never looks fake or falls into unrealisticness as so many animated films do. It only compliments the witty and touching script.Ultimately, what makes Anastasia so good is the story. It's a story that connects and moves us all This is an example of what good film-making is: it's funny, entertaining, and very sweet. And really, the songs are great. I love it! 8/10 stars!

		<shortDescription>An excellent historical animated musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a market so outrageously dominated by Disney, "Anastasia" appears as some kind of lifebelt for other animation studios.With a price-tag of over $50 million, "Anastasia" is a costly, very ambitious animated musical but it never gets pretentious about his family-pleasing issues or its historical depictions. And that's why it works so well.One of the few family-oriented animated movies depicting historical characters (something that Disney do not dare to do), "Anastasia" begins in 1916, where we meet young Russian princess Anastasia who gets a special gift from her grandmother, the Dowager Empress, during a prestigious royal party.Celebrations are abruptly shortened when cruel charlatan Rasputin takes profit of the party to set off his curse upon the Romanov family. Every historical buff knows what happens next: the Bolcheviks take upon the power and recall the country the USSR, but as it's a family movie, it attempts to make the viewer believe that the Russian Revolution is caused by Rasputin's curse.Anastasia is removed from her grandmother and ends up in a orphanage where she lives for ten years. She then encounters Dimitri and his companion Vlad who decide to guide her to Paris in order to find back her family.The historical and political contexts would never have been part of a Disney movie. But the production team of Fox Animation Studios do a terrific job with them. It never gets too complicated for the young or even the older viewers and it never gets too simplistic for the educated minds. We see men wearing caps with the hammer-and-sickle logo and we see Soviet passports, while we never get too deep with that. Except for that lovely quote: "That's what I hate about this government. Everything's red." But we hardly see red in this movie. Animation is sometimes half-satisfying but the animators never try to be minimalistic. This is particularly evident when you watch a scene such as the initial party in the St. Petersburg palace. Only a fraction of the people present in the background do appear alive while the others are simply still shadows or drawings. But in a live-action movie, that kind of scene would have requested hundreds and hundreds of extras and a very expensive set.And with the quality of the animation, we could really feel ourselves in pre-Depression Russia, German countryside and fantastic Paris. The feelings of the 1920s are very present until we arrive in Paris. Once in the City of Light, some of the places look too much modern, such as that Chanel store in a paved street. It feels too much anachronistic, even if it's well drawn.Three main action sequences are also included. Primo, there is the doomed train ride where Rasputin's evil 'spirits' attack in the snowy forest. I couldn't stop myself from watching the sparks flying, the fire invading the locomotive and the explosion at the end of the sequence.Second, the boat 'rescue' where reality is mixed with Anastasia's childish dream world until she's saved by Dimitri.And third, the climatic confrontation between the two main protagonists and the dismembering half-dead Rasputin. The dizzying moves and the animation techniques employed give an almost-real mood to the action.Those three sequences have something in common: they're all adrenaline performances that will satisfy the action-hungry viewer and they're all gentle enough to fit with young children. The case of the stone winged horse at the end is questionable but the rest isn't.What definitely makes "Anastasia" a children's movie is the abundance of musical numbers. And while there isn't any song that will become a part of legend, the overall score is enjoyable enough. But, instead of forcing itself to look like a typical Disney musical, the production team seems to care more about the story and the animation, which is a wise move because of the great storyline.The movie "Anastasia" could be compared to Lenin: it's the leader of the people against the supreme ruler (Nicholas II for Lenin, Disney for "Anastasia). I don't say that for looking anti-Disney though. And with the amount of computer-animated movies made recently, "Anastasia" is one of the greatest late entries of the traditionally-animated movies.

		<shortDescription>Beautiful animated feature allegedly based on the true story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plot in a nutshell - at the beginning of the 20th century, Russia is thrown into chaos when Czar Nicholas and most of his family is killed thanks to a curse by the evil "sorcerer" Rasputin (voice of Christopher Lloyd), but one daughter, Anastasia (voiced by Kirsten Dunst as a child), manages to survive, for better or worse, but with amnesia. Years later, the adult Anastasia (voiced by Meg Ryan, once of one of Hollywood's most sought after actresses, her career now in a state of severe disrepair thanks to her much over publicized fling with Russell Crowe), known only as Anya, is released from a Russian orphanage with no memory of her past, her only clue being a necklace with an intimate message written on it that indicates Paris as a place of importance. In trying to get to Paris, she falls in with two charmingly lovable scoundrels, Dmitri (voice of John Cusack) and Vlad (Kelsey Grammar); the two con-men intend to present an "Anastasia" lookalike to the Duchess (voice of Angela Lansbury), the last surviving member of the Royal Family, who is holding meetings with girls claiming to be Anastasia in hopes of finding the real one so that they can get the reward money she's offering. Initially unaware that Anya is the real Anastasia but merely assuming that she is an uncanny lookalike, Dmitri &amp; Vlad decide to clean Anya up and present her to the Duchess. Along the way, long buried secrets are revealed and unexpected feelings arise as the nearly dead Rasputin and his bat sidekick Bartok try to destroy the trio.Beautifully animated feature courtesy of Don Bluth, you'd almost swear this was one of the great Disney features. Strong animation is complimented by competent voice acting by the big stars, notably Meg Ryan throwing out her perkiest voice possible. Historically inaccurate, but who cares?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Enjoyable, and Not to Mention, Absolutely Divine Music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe I was about 7 when I saw this movie in theaters for the first time. At let me tell you, I am now 16, and still after 11 years, the movie just doesn't get old. This is film is just absolutely lovely, and is great for all ages! Even though the facts and history shown through out the movie isn't always correct, that still shouldn't stop you from loving the characters, story, and above all, the music! The music is probably some of the best I've heard in a long time. Liz Callaway, who plays Anastasia's singing voice through out the film, is simply phenomenal. The other songs sung by Lacey Chabert, Jonathan Dokuchitz, and Jim Cummings are wonderful too! Two songs that really moved me (and which I still sing in the shower almost everyday) are "Journey to the Past" and "Once Upon A December." I promise you, you will be constantly singing those two songs everywhere you go after watching this film. That's probably why "Journey to the Past" was nominated for an Oscar in 1997!Besides the music, the characters are lively, unique, and can easily get attached too. Both my younger sister and I who both adore this film, admit that one day we hope to be just like Anastasia. :-) Of course there are other characters that are just as interesting and imperative to the plot line as well. Dimitri is polite and dreamy, while Bartok the bat is silly and hilarious! The acting voices being provided really help portray the characters as well! Christopher Lloyd does a great job playing the voice for evil character Rasputin. While Angela Lansbury does a lovely job playing the elegant and sincere Dowager Empress. The animation is not amazing, for yes there have been better, but it's still satisfying and nice to look at. Not to mention, the story is one you will want to know over and over again!So please watch this film when you have the chance! Especially you families with young children. This is definitely a film that all of you whether age 6 or 35 will enjoy. =)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a movie! They did such a good job on this film, it's unbelievable! The characters actually looked like real humans! The plot was well thought out, and based on the Yule Brenner, Ingrid Bergman movie, "Anastasia". I've loved this movie ever since I was a little girl. This can be watched by both young, and old audiences. I have looked up the royal family, etc., and they have all been cartoonized, and look very much like the real people. The art, the palace, everything is so realistic. Even a picture they have in the movie is the picture drawn by Anastasia, when she was a little girl. This is a great movie, and not a waste of money at all! This really makes you think... what happened to the Romanov family?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever since i was a small child i have lived in a world of fairy tales and imagination. After i watched Anastasia for the first time i remember thinking to myself, "disney really out-did themseleves this time." I was totally shocked to discover this was not a disney film. (Maybe this explains why i was a little confused. You see, although many people have commented that this film does not match up to those of disney's, i think it is much better.) Many have also said that this film gets on their nerves because it is not historically accurate. But let me tell you a little secret: i had no clue about anything that had to do with the real Anastasia before this film. After watching it, i then began to get interested in the real story. I believe this film does a great job introducing children to the story in a more mild way. Then later on, when their ready to know the truth they can do the research on their own. At least this film will get them interested in the story itself.The music in this film is genius. If you want to check to see if the music fits the film, see if it helps to carry the story along in a unique way. In a book for instance, an author can use exposition to explain the details. In a movie, what could normally be boring chatter turns into an intricate song which helps to tell the story. Anastasia does this with excellence. Throw in a stellar cast of voices and a beautiful scenic backdrop, and you've got an A+ film.I do have to agree with others about the villian of the film. This could have been handled in a more classy way. But this is the only flaw i find with the entire movie. Go and rent this one people! You wont regret it.</fullReview>

The musical score includes "Journey to the Past," my favorite song from that particular film. It talks about seeking a home, love and family. Another one that is perfect for the holidays. I do not mean just the movie's theme song, but everything about it. "Anastasia" is a movie that you can watch over and over again. The film has historical values, plus it can warm your heart. Can most cartoons do that? I am not really sure. If it is about a certain figure in Russian history, certainly "Anastasia" can do all the above.I absolutely love Liz Callaway's singing voice as part of the soundtrack. Her voice is absolutely gorgeous! I have heard it constantly, several times inside my mind. She warms your heart also.Oh, I just love the holidays.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie for adults to watch with older kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My 11-year-old daughter and I watched *Anastasia* together and enjoyed ourselves immensely. The color was lush, much of the animation was excellent (almost Disney-quality), the music was enjoyable, and the voice talent was fantastic.The fact that it is historical fantasy was not a problem, because it prompted my daughter to ask relevant questions about the history behind the story, and then want to go get out the Encarta to learn more about what really happened during the Russian Revolution. This is why myth and legend is so important in any culture, and the writers of this movie did a fine job of highlighting the mythological elements of this story without disrespecting the history behind it.My daughter, who is old enough to sneer at her younger sisters' infatuation with Barney and Sesame Street, sighed at the first song, thinking - as I did - that this would be another example of a sappy kids' song interrupting the story rather than moving it along. We were both pleasantly surprised. She also commented that she thought the "scary" aspects of the story - including life &amp; death action moments and a particularly evil villain - might be troubling for very small children, but she handled it fine (as would any child over eight or nine, I think, as long as a trusted adult is watching too). And the anachronistic but snappy 1997 dialogue with its facetious humor helped to keep this adult engaged and amused. Meg Ryan, John Cusack, and Angela Lansbury were fun, but Kelsey Grammer and Hank Azaria IMO stole the show. Both were so "in character" that I didn't place their voices until halfway through the movie, and didn't even mind that niggling feeling you get when you hear a voice you recognize but can't identify.One final comment, which my daughter made me promise to include, and that is that she wonders why with such beautiful color, the animators chose that lackluster yellow for Anastasia's gown in the final, climactic scene. She has a point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It won't fail to move you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, I must admit that I only decided to see this movie because I'm a huge Meg Ryan fan, but after seeing Anastasia I can't remember a film that moved me more. Fox have out-Disneyed Disney with this masterpiece, a superb blend of romance, comedy and adventure set to some of the best visuals ever seen in an animated film.The stellar cast of voices is certainly worth the big bucks which it must have cost Fox to land them. Meg Ryan and John Cusack are both excellent, but Kelsey Grammer steals the show as Vladimir, with some fine singing and a decent Russian accent to boot.Where Anastasia beats most Disney films is in the music. The songs are simply exceptional and stay in your head long after the movie is over (that's not a bad thing, trust me). Liz Callaway's 'Journey To The Past' and 'Once Upon A December' are my personal favourites, but the entire soundtrack is worth buying, something you can't say for most movie soundtracks.A lot of these comments here criticise Anastasia for it's historical inaccuracy, which I find totally ridiculous. It's an ANIMATED CHILDREN'S FILM, not a history textbook. Don't try to analyse the accuracy of the portrayal of the Romanov family or anything like that. Just enjoy the film for it's magical story, enchanting music and dazzling visuals.10/10...an absolute must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What do you get when you put together greats like John Cusack, Meg Ryan, Kelsey Grammer, Christopher Lloyed and others, with extremely detailed animation and a fun and entertaining story filled with a beautiful soundtrack? You get one of my absolute favorite animated videos "Anastasia"! I love it even more every time I watch it! And, the more you watch it the more of the little things you notice, like the wonderful facial expressions of the characters at different points of the movie. I constantly find myself singing to the catchy songs. A great movie that everyone (Not just kids!) should see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to start out by saying this is my Life Movie. The very first time I saw it, I knew it was special. I couldn't believe how enchanting it was. The emotional depth swept me off my feet as Anya and Dimitri found the true meaning of home, love, and family. Although this is an animated movie, this movie was aimed at teenagers (like me). And if the movie doesn't impress you (which I have no idea how it couldn't), the music definitely will. This is a must see movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie! The score is amazing! I have to laugh at all of the people giving bad reviews over historical accuracy. Let me explain something that may help you get beyond this. This is what is called a piece of historical fiction. In other words, they took the fact that there was once a grand duchess of Russia named Anastasia, and basically made up everything else around it. Nowhere does this movie indicate that it is supposed to be about Ana Anderson, the woman who claimed to be Anastasia (and was not). Yes, we all know Rasputin was not a rotting corpse, nor was he even still living at the time of the imperial family's abdication and murder. For goodness' sake, it's an animated fairy tale, not a historical documentary! Get over it. We all know Anastasia was murdered along with her family. And as for nit picking about linguistic accuracy, having a degree in foreign language, myself, I find it absolutely hilarious that someone mentioned several inaccuracies in pronunciation but never once mentioned that the name "Anastasia" is actually pronounced "ah-nah-STAH-see-ah." But once again, get over it for goodness' sake! This movie is fantastic if you can sit back and enjoy it for the fairy tale that it is and not get caught up in trying to criticize the fact that it is not real.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first reason I loved this movie was because the voices for the characters were actually singing. They didn't have two people for the same part, as in; Dimitri Singing Voice, or something. Linked to that reason are the songs themselves. They are over-the-top without being cheesy, a feat rarely achieved in most animated movies. The second reason I like this movie is because it has a great romantic plot line. There's none of the corny "true love's first kiss" crap that you see in a lot of Disney fairy tales. (Note to evil witches: if you're trying to poison a princess and there's even a possible cure... find another poison.) The one thing I didn't like was the villain, Rasputin. He was over-the-top, but not in a good way. I know it's an animated movie, but it was sort of based on a real story, and and undead corpse that can basically pull itself apart at will isn't exactly 'realistic.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captures a bit of that Disney magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I adore Disney's peak era animation films: The Lion King, The Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid. Anastasia, by Fox Studios, sets out to capture that same blockbusting brilliance, and achieves some of it. Anastasia has a strong visual look, headstrong protagonist, entertaining sidekicks and a memorable villain.The film isn't very original, the best stuff feels like a rehash of aforementioned Disney classics. The thing I like best is its realistic feel - the story takes place in 20th century Europe, not some faraway fairy kingdom. There is some magic connected to Rasputin, the bad guy, but it fits in the setting.The songs are alright. The ending has some pretty complex and emotional conflicts, not everything is black and white.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anastasia is a delightful and captivating musical. Most movies don't pay total homage to history,they borrow from it and give the story their own colour. The characters are convincing in their portrayal, Dimitri is a scoundrel with a heart of gold and Anya is a princess who's roughed it in the world. The royalty in her seeps thru in flashes from time to time. Rasputin is simply fiendish obsessed by his hatred of the Romanovs. The score is beautiful(Once Upon A December, Journey Into The Past by the late Aaliyah). The way they play out the scene where the Grand Duchess and Anya finally meet and their memories take over is a showstealer anyday. The bonds and recesses of the human heart are too strong for even a sorcerer to eradicate.Dozvidanya to the Romanovs, I think not!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film, except for...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...the historical inaccuracies. There are numbers of them, such as the czar family celebrating its 300th anniversary on the Russian throne in 1916, when in fact it was in 1913; Anastasia's being about seven years old at the time of the revolution, when in fact she was sixteen... The list of historical inaccuracies can, unfortunately, be made quite long. BUT! Disregard this and look at the film as a fairy tale or adventure instead. Then you have a great film with all the ingredients of a classic: Adventure, horror, comedy, romance, evolvment of characters, etc. and I'm sure you'll love it as much as I do. I won't grade it, since I'm lousy at that, but I'd urge anyone who's looking for the above mentioned features and more, to give this film a chance and be moved by it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anastasia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's put it this way. I am an adult who loves animation and this film does not disappoint. I saw it in the theater when it first came out and, even though it's not historically accurate, I loved it. I STILL love it and watch it every time it comes on cable as I am doing this minute.I saw the first Anastasia with Yul Brynner and Ingrid Bergman and I loved that one as well. We now know, thanks to DNA results that Anna Anderson was not the Grand Duchess Anastasia. We also know that Anastasia's remains were discovered. But it doesn't change the fact this film was well made, the music is catchy (especially Once Upon a December, my favorite song) and it has a happy ending.The cast is star studded, Meg Ryan as Anastasia, John Cusack as Dimitri, Kelsey Grammar as Vlad and Angela Lansbury as the Dowager Empress all voice their characters well. Christopher Lloyd as Rasputin and Hank Azaria as Bartok the bat are absolutely wonderful as the bad guys.When I watch or read any historical fiction, I always want to go and discover the truth about the main characters. This film is a perfect example of that. So even though it is historical inaccurate, what could be so wrong? There are books, articles and documentaries on the real Rasputin and the Romanovs which will lead everyone to the truth if interested. That's what historical fiction is all about in my opinion.Enjoy this wonderful film and forget that it's not historically accurate. It's great for kids and adults like me who love animated films. Hats off to Don Bluth for doing a fantastic job.Watch and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Under-Appreciated Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Allow me to just say that I've only ever seen 4 Don Bluth movies: The Secret of NIMH (which is an instant classic, mind you,) An American Tale (which is underrated,) The Land Before Time (although it's been years since I've seen that one) and Anastasia. Of these four movies, Anastasia is easily Bluth's most interesting and under-appreciated. But before I get to why that is, let's give a little run-down of what it's about:Anastasia, much like DreamWorks' The Prince of Egypt, is a modern retelling of an event in history. Just like The Prince of Egypt, it's a very liberal one. This means that it's not trying to be 100% accurate, but rather one meant to appeal to a larger audience while still showing respect to the source material. In this instance, Bluth is playing on the alleged rumour that Anastasia, the youngest of the Romanov daughters, may have actually survived the Russian Revolution that caused the Romanov family to be murdered. As Anastasia tries to escape with her grandmother, she's knocked out-cold, loses her memory, and is separated from her to not be seen again for a good decade.Fast-forward 10 years. Anastasia has been living all this time as Anya, an orphan brought up in a foster-home run by an irritating old woman. As Anya decides to make her way to the city and find a new job, she bumps into a con-man named Dimitri. Dimitri, along with a man named Vladimir, keep hiring women off the streets and training them in the ways of the Romanov family in an attempt to pass them off as Anastasia to her real grandmother and earn the reward for finding her. Anya, desperate to know who her real family was, goes along with it, but little do the three of them realize the irony of the situation and-ultimately-the dangers awaiting them from an old foe long-thought to be dead.Now that I've set that up, it's time for me to tackle the complaints:The first issue that people have with this movie is that it's a cheap knock-off of Disney. It's not. It's actually an expensive one, costing over 50 million dollars to make. That being said, that's not exactly a bad thing; after all, The Prince of Egypt was also a knock-off of Disney, and yet it was still a well-executed one that surpassed The House of Mouse in many ways. In the case of Anastasia, it doesn't quite surpass Disney in quality, but it still has enough substance that it can work on its own. Not to mention that, when you compare it to the other movies that Bluth has made in the 90's, it seems like he's actually trying this time.Another complaint that keeps being made is how this movie is historically-inaccurate. Once again, it's not trying to be. It's based off of a rumour that suggests that Anastasia may have actually survived the slaughtering that took the lives of her father, mother and siblings. Of course, it's never been proved that she actually DID survive, but that's why it's called a "rumour" and not a fact.The third, and perhaps biggest, complaint involves that of the villain. People have called him the biggest insult to the real Grigori Rasputin, whose personality doesn't match that of the Rasputin in the movie in the slightest. Once again, I'd suggest not taking that too personally. Ramses in the The Prince of Egypt wasn't anything like the real Ramses II either, yet he was still a very fleshed-out and interesting character. While the Rasputin in Anastasia is disappointing in other ways (especially in his downfall,) he's still given enough character that it doesn't matter if he's not true to history. Besides, I hear very little complaints about Hades in Disney's Hercules, even though the original story had Hera in that role.In terms of the movie itself, it's a lot of fun to watch. The animation is still stunning by today's standards, the soundtrack is excellent (even though one of two songs aren't so memorable) and the voice-acting is top-notch. I was especially pleased that Dom DeLuise wasn't in this movie, as-despite having been a Bluth regular for quite some time-he's quite irritating and has almost-always gotten the role of obnoxious comic-relief during his career (he's been replaced by Hank Azaria, but that's only a minor nitpick.) Aside from having Christopher Lloyd as Rasputin and the ever-so-excellent Jim Cummings as his singing voice, the real highlight-for me, at least-is Meg Ryan as Anastasia. I don't recall her being in any animated film before or since, but I'd gladly go watch it if she is. The story in Anastasia isn't perfect-there's the odd flaw here and there-but I have to give Don Bluth credit for actually trying this time. And you should check it out too, as it's a great movie that encompasses just about everything that made Bluth one of the greatest animators of the 20th Century to begin with.Final Score: 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Recently seeing Anastasia for the first time, and now it's easily in several of my top lists.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had only recently seen Anastasia through Netflix when I was on vacation, and it's easily won my heart ever since. I had first mistakened the movie to be from Disney, because everything was fantastic in story and quality. The animation, characters, effects, music, and feeling of the movie was perfect. Usually animation can be a bit skippy, but this film's animation was very smooth and fit in with the realistic image of a live film. The personalities of the character's expressions and voices were spot on and enjoyable. I loved how Anastasia and Dimitri constantly acted towards each other from beginning to end, and how their feelings changed for each other throughout the film. I'm also usually not one for romances, especially in animation, but I fell in love with this one. I'm a fan of Anastasia x Dimitri, they're an excellent couple. The sarcasm throughout the movie was a winner for me, too.Now, usually I don't like the soundtrack animated movies give out. I tend to like skipping over scenes where a character decides to break out into a musical out of nowhere. However, Anastasia came across differently for me. I love both the music sung directly and/or indirectly from the characters, which is not often. Lately I have been going through an obsession with Anastasia and the music was a key point for me. I loved to listen to all of the songs multiple times.Each character created an outstanding part in the film. I feel each other, even the cameos, had a very good story and plot to be in there. Even Puka, who played the creative part as a sign for Anastasia to go back to her old town. The characters were fun to watch and carried out a great emotion, which can be hard to do sometimes.Overall, Anastasia is an outstanding film that warms the hearts of many. It's typically an unnapreciated film, but it deserves all of the respect and praise it can get. I can personally say, even though Anastasia is not a Disney princess, I still count her as my favorite princess if I'm ever asked. Anastasia is also one of my favorite romances, animations, and overall films of all-time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An animated classic based on a true story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the 80's, Don Bluth made some good classics like, "The Secret Of Nimh", "The Land Before Time", "An American Tale", and one of my favorite's, "All Dogs Go To Heaven".But in 90's, his career started to go downhill. But one day, 20th Century Fox asked him to direct an animated adaptation of the Broadway show, "My Fair Lady" or do a film about Anastasia Romanov. He decided to do a film about Anastasia Romanov. The result: A great comeback for Don Bluth and an animated classic.The animation is great, the songs were great, the story was great, and the voice acting was great. Meg Ryan does a good job as the independent, Anastasia. Christopher Lloyd does a great job as the evil, Rasputin. Hank Azaria does a good and funny job as Rasputin's bat sidekick, Bartok.Overall, "Anastasia", is a great animated film that's worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice family film all about family and who you are</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have liked this movie since it came out although I bought it on DVD 6 years ago for Christmas. The movie is set in the year 1916 and a young princess named Anastasia is suffering from amnesia as she tries to get on the train with her grandmother. 10 years later and Anya is now in an orphanage and she is trying to find her family. The only clue she has is a necklace which reads 'Together in Paris'.So she meets two con men one who used to work at the palace and the other is a friend of Dimitri's. As the two con men agree to help Anya find her family romance blossoms along the way for our heroine and you can probably guess the rest for yourselves. I can't believe that many people mistake this for a Disney movie because its actually a 20th Century Fox movie NOT Disney. Packed with great actors Meg Ryan,John Cusack, Hank Azaria,Christopher Lyold and great music from Liz Callaway, Anastasia is the perfect film to watch at Christmas and its worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched the movie a few minutes ago. It's one of my favorite animated romance movies. How they met each other, go through adventures together, and Dimitri realizes Anya IS Anastasia and he doesn't accept the money plus risks himself to rescue her is so beautiful and they fall for each other. My favorite song from the film in the end credits the song " At the Beginning" from Donna Lewis and Richard Marxx. Thinking about it now, I think it'd be a great idea if they re-made the movie, but with actors instead of animation. I'd totally love to see that. Who else agrees??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have heard all the comments that this movie is historically incorrect. That's a good point, but not one that should affect the viewers opinion of the movie. You can go on and on about how bad you think the storyline or animation is, but if you insist on disliking the movie because of it's factuality (or lack thereof), then you must not have grasped the spirit of the movie. The spirit is what counts. And before people go and think that I really do think the animation and storyline suck, I Don't. I have no problem with the animation, and I'm always a sucker for a good romance, which is what this movie offers. Somehow it seems more.... mature than a Disney movie. More 'grown-up' so to speak. I don't know why, but I think it deals with the relationship on a deeper level, or maybe I'm crazy and it's exactly like any Disney relationship... either way, it was still very good and I'd recommend it to anyone. Unless you don't like animation, catchy songs, cute little puppies and ridiculously handsome con-men that you can't help but fall in love with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always been a big fan of Don Bluth, mainly because of his old school animation. But this movie was so amazingly perfect in my opinion, from the story to the songs. It almost feels like a Broadway show and it wouldn't surprise me if it is. I will say they kept the story fresh and alive throughout the entire film. But I loved the songs most of all in this movie especially "A Rumor in St. Petersburg," for that particular scene looks and feels like a live Broadway show. What I really admire though is the transition Anastasia goes through from the beginning feeling doubtful to where at the end she is bold and fearless.

		<shortDescription>An excellent animated film, another in a long line of masterstrokes from Don Bluth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Anastasia' is the story of the last hope of the Romanov family, the Grand Duchess Anastasia. This orphan has no knowledge of her royal heritage. The film chronicles her attempts to find her true family, hindered by an undead enemy of the family, Rasputin. Enter a couple of con men intent on collecting the reward for the finding of the Duchess, and you have a ray of hope for the princess. Needless to say, one of the men is Dimitri, a young man who inevitably falls in love with the princess.The animation is spectacular, creating a classical feel that has been absent for a long time, but has never left Don Bluth's films over twenty years. The introduction of 3D animation for props and effects is more of a curse than a blessing, since the technology isn't advanced enough to achieve believabilty. Add to that superimposition that looks pasted terrible when a character handles a CG object, and the result is a film that isn't so visually ravishing as the purely traditional ways of past Bluth films. The story is based on a true story, but is completely distorted to create a happy ending. The filmmakers may not have had much choice, since the amazingly successful Disney films never end in tears. Contradicting this is the outstanding quality of Bluth's older 'All Dogs Go to Heaven', which features an ending anything but happy.Despite this, most of the film is particularly anti-Disney. It's characteristically dark, dull and in places frightening. The contrasts are stark but fitting, as Anastasia dreams of a heavenly time with her family, whilst a cut to reality shows her in a precarious position on a ship in a storm. This is spectacularly successful, pulling off the same atompshere and feel as Chernabog from 'Fantasia', so incredibly long ago. Somehow, this 'Anastasia' sequence is even more frightening than the 'Fantasia' finale, since Anya's family's smiling faces have an eerie, menacing quality behind them, although the actul expressions are perfectly joyous and welcoming. Somehow, the atmosphere tells you: *Don't believe them. Don't go any closer*. 'Anastasia' is another film undoubtedly destined to be a classic, a throwback to the glory days of Bluth animation, those first four films: 'The Secret of NIMH', 'An American Tail', 'The Land Before Time' and 'All Dogs Go to Heaven'. The inbetweens may be high quality, but the Bluth cartoon reached its zenith in the eighties. Let's hope for more of the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anastasia is every little girl's dream, a beautiful princess of a large country brought to the throne at last, if only real life had ended up this way. Meg Ryan adds appeal to the charming Anya, an orphan since she was little who has no idea who her family is and John Cusack as Dimitri, a young con artist, out for the reward for the Princess Anastasia's safe return to her grandmother, the Dowager Empress Maria Fiodorovna in Paris. When Dimitri and his partner, Vladimir (Kelsey Grammar) find out Anya is the princess, or at least possibly is, they talk her into going with him, and convince her that she is Anastasia. They teach her to waltz, to walk properly and the history of the family.But Anya finds out that it was a scam and packs to leave when who should visit but the Empress herself. She finds that she is Anastasia and after defeating Rasputin (who's been out to get her from the start of the movie) Anastasia and Dimitri elope.Rich in animation and music, the songs are a haunting reminder of the actual Grand Duchess Anastasia Nicholaevna, and her downfall as well as her siblings and parents. I studied the case in Russia for three years, and ought to know. Scraping bones for DNA isn't fun, especially when they're as old and mutilated (by acid) as I had to. The movie brought spunk back into that poor girl.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful film, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anastasia is an absolutely gorgeous cartoon musical, perhaps the last really amazing work in the classical form of the genre. The songs, especially "Once Upon a December," were thrilling and their presentation was astounding. The character animations are astounding, and the expressive qualities were incredible. The voice cast is stellar as well (and seems particularly matched to the animation). And all of the locales are incredible, from the Russian palaces to the marvellous sequence where Paris by night looks impressionistic.All that said, the history is really lackluster. I understand it's a "G" rated film, but the view of the Russian Revolution is...ugh. If it had portrayed this realistically (it's possible for Czar Nicholas to be sympathetic - he was a wonderful family man, but no good as a ruler), the film would've been elevated to a completely different level. It's a shame that it skimped here.Then we have the villain of the piece. Honestly...it's a terrible distraction. Rasputin is like a villain out of a completely different film, tacked on to create a conflict. His inclusion really stops Anastasia from transcending the typical fairytale reality of Disney's animated musicals...the story, the real character story, in Anastasia was far more interesting. Had the villain scene been cut, it could have been told even more clearly and vibrantly, and perhaps the genre would've gone somewhere instead of kind of slipping off into never-never land. Ah, well. It's worth watching, don't get me wrong, but don't go expecting the film to be uniformly good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unexpectedly good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don Bluth seems to be a relic left over from the old days of Disney. His cartoons have that unmistakable old Disney feel to it. And the storylines are also pretty Disney-like. Some people might say that's a good thing, but I think that's a bad thing. Sure the old cartooning style was beautiful, and the old storylines became film classics. But the idea of good filmmaking is to come up with something original and new. Okay, so Anastasia doesn't break from the old that much. It has some spectacular special effects. There's way too much singing in this movie. But overall, it doesn't do it too badly. They could've gotten rid of the whole supernatural aspect of this movie, and spent time showing the two heroes, Vladmir and Dmitri, trying to train a very rough Anastasia on the ways of being a presentable royal lady. But they totally ignore this aspect of the story. It could've been good for some laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give me a break, this was a fantastic film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a student of animation, I found Anastasia a spectacular feast for the senses. While the rotoscoping was at times a bit off-setting, this was the ONLY flaw I found.I could only stand to read through a few of these reviews because, first of all, this is NOT a Disney film. Sure, its quality rivals many of Disney's latest, but it's definitely not. Don't go to Disneyland and look to get your picture taken with Anya and Dimitri because it just won't happen. Second of all, this movie never set out to be historically accurate. If you want historical accuracy, watch a documentary. This is a CARTOON, a fairy-tale. Sure, they took a tragedy and made it into a love story, but look at Titanic and Pearl Harbor. Take this film for what it is, open your mind and look past your intellectual snobbery and you will find that Anastasia has a LOT to offer, despite modern voices with American accents and Broadway-esque music (which I actually found delightful from start to finish, from Oscar- and Tony-nominated Flaherty and Ahrens). As for those who complain that Rasputin is too dark, that he sold his soul to the devil, I ask this: Don't you imagine Ursula from the Little Mermaid did something of the same sort? How about Jafar? How about Scar who killed his own brother? How about Clayton from Tarzan? Will you let your children watch these films?I don't mean to rant and rave, I only mean to invite these readers and message posters to take this film for what it is and not get hung up by historical inaccuracies, the same reason why many people hate Pocahontas (one of the most romantic and spectacular Disney films to date).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Animated Film ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I truly believe Anastasia is the Greatest Animated Film ever! The main characters have very enjoyable, with wonderful dialogue plus witty banter quite reminiscent of some the finest romantic movie comedies. Warning: Possible spoilers. Let me start out by writing that Anastasia is a wonderful FILM, not just a wonderful animated film.Forget about whether the movie is historically accurate. It is after all a fantasy but within this fantasy you can actually believe that it is feasible. This is a movie that I can see being played by a young Meg Ryan, a young John Cusack and of course Kelsey Grammar who does a superb job as Vladimir who is one of the two con artists in the movie along with Cusack's character Dimitri.The plot is that the young Anastasia survived the attack on the Russian Royal family but was believed to been dead all these years. Her grandmother, the Dowager Empress Marie, played by the wonderful Angela Lansbury offers a huge reward for the return of her beloved granddaughter. Two con artists, Dimitri (voiced by John Cusack) and Vladimir (voiced by Kelsey Grammar) decided to hired a "fake" Anastasia to cheat the Dowager of her money. By coincidence they stumble upon the real Anastasia who is suffering from amnesia. They train her to pretend to be Anastasia not knowing she is the real Anastasia.Anastasia is a very strong young woman who can fend for herself. Even though the movie is set in the past she is the epitome of the independent modern woman of today.The strength of the movie in my opinion is the wonderful dialogue and banter between the characters. There are great subtle touches in the movie. The characters expressions during many scenes indicate the emotions of the individual characters at that moment in time. I found the characters to be very real considering the situation they are in. You don't find this very often in many movies, much less animated movies.It's a beautiful looking movie but the dialogue and music is so good that I don't have to see the movie to enjoy it.The voice cast is a who's who's of Hollywood with people like Meg Ryan, John Cusack, Kelsey Grammar, Christopher Lloyd, Angela Lansbury, Hank Azaria and even a young Kirsten Dunst. They work together almost flawlessly. You wonder how good a real life feature film would have made if the same cast was used. Obviously I do mean a younger Meg Ryan and John Cusack at the appropriate ages.The singing talents are excellent with Liz Callaway (the singing voice of Anastasia) doing a superb job as she always does, Jonathan Dokuchitz (singing voice of Dimitri) also doing an excellent job. Angela Lansbury, Bernadette Peters and Lacey Chabert do a fine job. Kelsey Grammar is also surprisingly good in doing his own singing. The songs are wonderful with my personal favorite "Journey to the Past" but "Once Upon a December" is also superb.It is not just a film for children but it is a film for all ages.</fullReview>

The cast was perfect, the dialogue was hilarious, and the story was an interesting twist of an old idea.

		<fullReview>It is the claim that Anastasia is a 'historical' film that makes it an atrocity in the eyes of critics. Had the main characters been renamed, and the movie advertised as the FICTION it is, the reviews would have been much more favorable. But considering that this film receives much harsher criticism than Disney's also historically innacurate flop Pocahontas, it seems there are still some that love to snub and tear apart the non-Disney 'peasants' of the animation industry. That said, this film is indeed a "diamond in the rough": engaging, visually beautiful, unique, and believable.Critics seem to ignore that this story has something that even the best disney films can't offer: a realistically developed romantic plot. Disney often glosses over the important points in the development of a relationship (Disney formula #1: fate magically throws two beautiful people into one conversation-less 'date,' and suddenly they're ready to marry and live happily ever after). Even in my favorite disney films, Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, the courtship is either glossed over in a single song, or the characters are madly in love after one chance encounter. Dmitri the con man is no prince charming (but I gotta admit he's pretty hot for a cartoon), and Anastasia can be quite a brat, but they both mature and grow in three dimensions. We get to see their childish spats, experience the awkward first moments of realization (the first dancing scene on the boat is precious...reminds me of my first date), and finally get a sense that these two truly care for each other, flaws and all. It was a refreshingly mature take on romance by a cartoon. (quoting Sam Neel) "we love not by finding the perfect person, but learning to see an imperfect person perfectly."Other than that, I thought the story line was decent, and the songs were good enough, the animation often breathtaking. Also, if there was an award for 'best costumes in an animated film,' I think this would be a winner.Other characters: Rasputin makes this movie something u definitely don't want to see after a big lunch...as far as villains go, he's good for laughs but not essential to the story (although his existence makes the nightmare scene that much more powerful). Who cares if Bartok is unnecessary...he's adorable! The relationship between the grandmother and anastasia could have been better developed. Vlad had some important parts, but he was almost unnecessary. Sophie needed to cover up! On a sidenote, I don't see why cute superfluous characters and lavish musical numbers are associated only with Disney; If i'm correct, pre-Little Mermaid hits like "An American Tale" and "Land before Time" were 'guilty' of it too. Ah well.Don't get me wrong, I love disney too, Anastasia is a refreshing reminder that Disney CAN be outdone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historically correct? Ha! Entertaining? Yes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the least historically correct films I've ever seen. No, wait, Pocahontas was even more so. I don't even think Disney researched that subject before sharpening their art pencils. Anyway, the thing with Anastasia is that Don Bluth put a lot of fantasy elements into it, to the point where I really felt there were two movies before me. One was a realistic musical, and the other featured an evil sorcerer who dances with his bug minions in the depths of hell. Now I know the real Rasputin was into the dark arts and such, but probably not so much that he could bring unicorn statues to life. Oh, and speaking of which, that was the only scene where I threw up my hands and said, "Okay, that's enough Bluth. You've crossed the line." When a satanic unicorn is smashing up a bridge and trying to step on Anastasia, that is when you know the storyboard meetings went awry. Other than that, I like this movie and would give it a B+. Some of the music is great, the sidekick isn't necessary but at least keeps his trap shut, and the animation is fluid and traditional Don Bluth. But why is it that in every DB movie there is one character whose mouth just flaps and hangs to the ground like it isn't connected to a jaw bone? It looks weird when Kelsey's Grammer's character is seen with this giant mouth while everyone else looks like an actual person. The only music number I didn't buy was the opener, A Rumor in St. Petersburg. It was just too Disney, what with all the 'wacky' Russians. I did like Rasputin's In the Dark of the Night, however, a decent villain tune that you can hum. All in all, this is a good rental if you're into animation and need something to watch every now and then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably the best non-Disney animated feature that has been made in the movie industry. The voices match the characters well (though it is rather strange why the main characters do not have Russian accents since the characters are all from Russia). Meg Ryan voices the courageous and charming lost Russian Grand Duchess Anastasia while John Cusack voices the poor, con-man Dimitri. Together they must leave communist Russia and reunite Anastasia with her grandmother. The holy monk Rasputin, voiced by Christopher Lloyd and his comical bat friend, Bartok, voiced by Hank Azaria would rather see the Russian princess dead with the rest of the Romanov family. Rasputin may be a little scary for younger viewers since he keeps falling apart--literally. Bartok adds much well-liked humor to the movie. The songs are astounding and have superb musical depth. The animation rivals that of it's Disney competitors. Here's another great film for director Don Bluth. A nine out of ten on my personal scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very pleasant surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, after seeing the name "Don Bluth" attached to this movie, I had visions of singing roosters and gardening trolls running through my mind. I was also convinced that I would have to suffer through Dom DeLuise or Charles Nelson Reilly (whose name I didn't know at the time, but whose voice I sadly recognized) at some point in time. Thankfully, this movie lived up to none of my expectations! This was such a surprisingly good movie! Although I liked it overall, let me express some dissatisfaction I had with it first. The animation, although very good overall, sometimes seemed a bit odd, especially when characters tilted their heads a certain way. Also, it seemed that the whole supernatural element with Rasputin was somewhat unnecessary. Couldn't the conflict simply have come from Anya trying to prove herself to be Anastasia? And even with the whole Rasputin thing, did we really need Bartok? I mean, did he really have a useful purpose in this movie? He had virtually no role in the movie except to offset Rasputin's dark character. I was especially angry that Hank Azaria, one of my favorite actors, was put in this thankless role. Although at times the movie grew a bit Disney-ish (headstrong young heroine, cute/funny sidekicks), it was rather enjoyable overall. The animation was very good for the most part, especially the train wreck and the scene at sea. The voice acting was great; I especially enjoyed Kelsey Grammer as Vlad and Bernadette Peters as the maid. Even Christopher Lloyd and Hank Azaria made the most of their rather unnecessary roles. Most importantly, though, it made me somewhat rethink my opinion of Don Bluth as he is now. I will not think solely of pebbles and penguins when I see that he has a new movie out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anastasia is arguably the best piece of work from Bluth's studios, proving that someone other than Disney can create a captivating animated feature. In fact, Anastasia has it all: a smooth and flowing storyline (despite the hocus-pocus with historical events one expects from such movies), stunning artwork, and a memorable song ("Once Upon a December") that Disney only wishes it could slap on one of their soundtracks. If you liked "The Little Mermaid" and haven't seen this one, it could be a good bet on a cold winter's night!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Critics aside, this is a good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel that Anastasia is one of the best animated films I've seen; and believe me, at twenty years old I grew up watching animated films from Disney and the like. The premise is that in 1923 the Romanov family was overthrown in the Bolshevik Revolt which plunged Russia into Communism. In this animated version, the villain is the former advisor; Rasputin. Most critics of this movie feel that this character is unnecessary and fictional. There is some historical basis for the character, and if one pays close attention it is stated that he planted the seed of hate which caused the uprising. Villains are necessary for a children's movie; and before you criticize too much, this is a children's movie. The story picks up ten years later with orphaned Anya setting off to find her past; and consequently, her future. Along the way she is guided by con men Dimitri and Vladamir, both of whom were formerly connected to the royal court. Even though the historical context is lacking, and as a child care provider I can say this, you cannot have such a tragic story presented to children. To hold their interest, it has to include a fun plot, cute characters, and a story that is fresh and exciting. All things in life don't have happy endings, true, but in a child's idealic world, we should not kill their innocence. Anastasia is a fun family movie that makes you feel good and also gives you a good taste of Russia and Paris in the thirties. I loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Total historical changes aside, this is one excellent movie. The movie supposes what if Anastasia survived the Bolshevik Revolution. Anastasia and Dimitri interaction blended well. Kelsey Grammer did well as the voice of Dimitri's pal Vladimir. I didn't recognize that it was Kelsey Grammer, nor is Hank Azaria's Bartok. The villain Rasputin didn't come out as interesting as I would have imagined though. Still, he managed to have a scene showing his evil when he almost got Anastasia off the ship to drown. You might notice how Anastasia, Dimitri and Dowager Empress Marie are so realistically drawn. Anya and Dimitri in particular have this particular expression based on their cheeks. The CGI is well-done when rendered as a background or surrounding the characters react to but feels out of place when it is an object to focus on (such as the train). Once again, overall, an excellent film. I give 4 of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, a film that challenges Disney.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought the film was good. The romance was magical and the songs were surprisingly well brought forth. The villian was neat to look at but his motives and actions seemed a little weird and a bit unexplained--Jafar(Alladin-) was much better even though Rasputin was fun to look at. One scene where Rasputin and his animals were singing and the smoke and effects reminded me of Scar's Be Prepared. The actions sequences were okay but the main thing that affected me emotionally was the story of Anastasia finding her past and the whole gentle love relationship. I just don't find magical villains and cartoon action sequences all that exciting or scary anymore---a realistic villain like Frollo(Hunchback of Notre Dame) are usually much more effective because thy are more human. Rasputin was just weird but I did love Anastasia songs, dreams, and personality. My complaints about the film is that Disney's animated sequences look a bit better than this, they are more cartoon and this is more humam-less creative/colorful. I also didn't like the ending with the two bats--I think they should have ended it with the two humans kissing then blackout. Overall good movie--much better than disney's recent Mulan. It also had the usual Disney side kicks, villain, love, and action sequences. This movie can easily be compared to Aladdin with the person finding a place with love and a villain to conquer and the side talker of the situation and the rich and poor. The story was a bit predictable but it was still nice watching. I think it is better to not know the historical facts because it loses the belief and emotion of the story when someone is sitting there knowing that this isn't what really happened--that Anastasia's life was more of a tragedy where she really was alone and not gentically linked to the rich family. It would disturb me if I knew this before the movie . Just watch the movie and treat it as it is--just an entertaining cartoon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All around the boards here I've seen people complaining... about everything: the historical accuracy, the names, the accents - everything!!! Seems like people are just NOT happy if they don't see exactly what they've been taught during History classes, on screen. Too bad for them, that's what I say.To be honest, Anastasia is not a movie about historical facts. It's rather "a few historical facts mixed in and modified to form a great story". And yes, the story is good. It grips you and keeps you watching till the end.The characters are very nicely outlined and their evolution throughout the movie is very good. Especially Anya and Dimitri (since they are the main characters). The love story between the two is quite cute itself; and secondary characters such as Bartok or Vlad set up a funny comic side to the movie as well.The songs are a true jewel. I still find myself singing "Once Upon a December" out of the blue sometimes. Yes, they are haunting. And they have some things that few modern animated movies still have in point of music: nice lyrics; rhythm; musicality. I think that after viewing the movie you'll want to get the soundtrack as well :P Now about animation: WOW!!! It looks and moves just like a Disney cartoon. That's why so many say it actually belongs to them (It doesn't. It's property of 20th Century Fox and was directed by the great Don Bluth). Really, the animation is flawless.All in all, I give Anastasia a 10 star vote. Why? Well... I don't care how well it follows historical facts - I just like it as it is. If you also don't pay attention to such things and just want to see an enjoyable family movie, Anastasia is a perfect pick. Don't listen to anybody who may flame it, 'cause that really isn't necessary here. Just give it a try. BUT if you want to use the movie to find out what happened to the Romanov Family or to the actual Grand Duchess Anastasia: don't bother. You'll probably go to History class saying that the czar was killed because of a nasty wizard.Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far from historically accurate, but still a good family flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the late 1990s, we had two animated movies that were based on a certain event in a country's history. In 1995, Disney gave us an American "history lesson" (and I use that term loosely) with Pocahontas, but in 1997, 20th Century Fox did exactly what Disney did, except give us a look at a bit of Russian history (again, using the term "history" loosely) about the daughter of Czar Nicholas II, Anastasia Romanov, simply called...well...Anastasia. However, one thing to consider when going into this film is that this is a family picture ("kids movie" for short), so if you're looking for a true-to-life history lesson a la a PBS or History Channel documentary, you might as well throw that out the nearest airlock.In this film, Anastasia, voiced by Meg Ryan, is a princess that went missing for several years after the attack on the Romanov family during a party, which was led by the Romanov's former confidant Rasputin, voiced by Christopher Lloyd of Back to the Future fame, who is an undead, evil sorcerer in this movie. Anastasia, now with a case of amnesia and dubbed Anya, eventually joins two con men, Dimitri (John Cusack) and Vladimir (Fraiser's Kelsey Grammar), who are convinced that she really is the missing Romanov princess, and travel to Paris, France, where her grandmother, the Dowager Empress, resides, to hopefully reunite them, all while Rasputin is seeking her unfortunate demise.I won't judge this movie on historical accuracy, as all (or most) of us can tell that the general audience for this film is younger children, though adult audiences will also be entertained, since there was a lot of effort put into the creation of this film. That, and I wouldn't dismiss it as a "Disney knockoff" right away, because the directors of the film, Don Bluth and Gary Goldman, were former Disney animators, so it's easy to confuse this for a Disney picture like Beauty and the Beast. As a family film alone, it is pretty damn good. The artwork and animation is great, the songs are enjoyable, and the voice acting is pretty decent.The film was such a success that it became co-director Don Bluth's comeback after a slew of mediocre to bad animated films he directed throughout most of the decade, and his highest grossing film to date. Not only that, but it warranted a direct-to-video follow up film starring the villain's sidekick, Bartok the Bat (voiced by The Simpsons' Hank Azaria in both films).Overall, the film serves as a great choice to have playing during a family movie night, unless you're extremely picky on historical accuracy, in which case, go do something else for 97 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is very special to me because it's a movie that my grandma and I used to watch together before she died. I feel like I am Anastasia sometimes because I lost my grand mother however I can't find mine as easily as she did. I love how Dimitri started to remember her and then fell for her all over again. The music is amazing and the music box will always be iconic. I actually have my own music box that is special to me because it keeps me close to my grandma. My favorite song will always be "Once Upon a December" and every time I hear it or sing it I start to think about her and all these memories start flooding back. This is my absolute favorite movie ever and I will never get sick of it. I always use the kids as an excuse to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This musical cartoon movie is a guilty pleasure for me. I kinda like it. It's a Shining Tsar!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although communists had killed the entire imperial Romanov family in July 1918, including the Grand Duchess Anastasia by shooting squad, for years, afterwards, communist disinformation fed rumors that members of the Tsar's family had survived. The conflicting rumors about the fate of the family allowed impostors to make spurious claims that they were a surviving Romanov. The most famous, being Anna Anderson who claim to be, the long-lost child of Tsar Nicholas II, Anastasia. Because of this claim, the purported survival of Anastasia has been the subject of both cinema and made-for-television films for years, now. After all, the earliest adaptation of this myth, was made in 1928, was called 'Clothes Make the Woman', follow close by 1956's 'Anastasia' and 1986's television film, 'Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna'. However, since 1997's 'Anastasia', is the most famous adaptation movie of this myth. Its gets the most criticize. Produced by Fox Animation Studios and distributed by 20th Century Fox, this animation musical directed by Don Bluth &amp; Gary Goldman tells the legend of Grand Duchess Anastasia (Voiced by Meg Ryan) escaping the execution of her family, during the height of February Revolutions of 1917; only to find herself, an orphan living with amnesiac. With the help of a couple of con men, Dimitri (Voiced by John Cusack) &amp; Vlad (Voiced by Kelsey Grammar), she hopes to reunited with the last reminding family member, still alive, Empress of Russia, Maria Feodorovna (Voiced by Angela Lansbury) in Paris, France. However, the banished mystical former royal adviser, turn sorcerer, Grigori Rasputin (Voiced by Christopher Lee) thinks, otherwise, wanting to destroy the last member of the House of Romanov for revenge. Without spoiling the movie, too much, since the film is more, about the urban myth of Anastasia than true actual historical events. I allowed myself to enjoy the movie, because I took it, with a grain of salt and also the fact that, at the time, this movie was made. Anastasia's body hasn't yet, been discovered. Her body wouldn't be found until 2007, if you were wondering. Because of that, I was able to get through this film. However, I can see, why some historians can't look pass that. There were some moments in the film, even I, somewhat found, pretty jarring. First off, the film's urban legend of Anastasia's survival does not related, with the real-world supposedly 'real' reports of Anastasia's escape. After all, Anastasia was indeed, presented, during the Yekaterinburg massacre, as seen in historical Cold War archive photos. If anything, if the real Anastasia would had survived the shooting, due to the diamond corsets, her body would be still, cover with bayonet scars, bullet holes, and some sulfuric acid burns. It wouldn't be a pretty sight. Since this movie couldn't show that, it felt more like white-washing, changing history than showing what could possibility happen. It's wasn't the best choice in my opinion. After all, the whole, attempted train escape with her grandmother, Maria Feodorovna from the Winter Palace, felt a little too far deep in the fictional settling, since both of the characters weren't in St. Petersburg in real-life. In truth, during the February &amp; October Revolution, Maria wasn't really near the royal family. She heard of the murders of her son's family, while hiding out in Crimea. Maria didn't escape until 1919, after the urging of her sister, Dowager Queen Alexandra. She fled to London, then to her home country of Denmark, not Paris, France. None of this, was ever explain in the film. Not only that, does the movie, not explain, what happen to Anastasia's family. The movie also makes Anastasia, way too close to her grandmother than their own murdered family that she rarely cares to find out. In truth, Anastasia rarely saw the former Empress, as Maria was spending a lot of time abroad when Anastasia was a child. They have little to no connection. Another big inaccuracy is the age of Anastasia, during the Revolutions. She wasn't eight years old, when the events happen. She was seventeen year old, when her family was executed on July 18, 1918. However, the biggest historical accuracy is what they did to Rasputin. Rasputin wasn't a sorcerer nor was he, a Communist. If anything, WWI, fatigue, and harsh punishment for protesters, were the leading factors to the Romanov's downfall. In real-life, Rasputin kinda love the family, and the Romanov love him, back, after he help them with the problems with Nicolas II's son, Alexei's hemophilia. After all, the Romanov's children kinda died with amulets full of Rasputin photo in their pockets in Yekaterinburg. Was he, a child molester, rapist, &amp; womanizer? Who knows? All, I know, is that he wasn't as evil, as this film make it, out to be. In the end, the Royal family never truly betrayed him. Instead, a group of nobles coaxed Rasputin out of his house, and murdered him, by poison, shooting, and tossing him, in an icy river. Despite the fact that this movie shat all over Russia's history, the animation is stunning. Another is the voice acting. It was all wonderful. Meg Ryan and the writers got Anya right. Lively, mischievous, and sharp. Full witty remarks sometimes hit sensitive spots. That's sounds like the real Anastasia. However, the real Anastasia was nasty to the point of being somewhat evil, like tripping people and throwing rocks. Despite that, the supporting cast was just as great. Another thing, all of the music from the film is beautiful to listen to. I love the songs, 'Once Upon A December', 'Journey to the Past', and 'In the Dark of the Night'. They're all in my IPOD playlist. Overall: While, this movie indeed carbon copy, of the Disney Princess formula. I still love it to death. I think the movie gave enough actual history and respect to allow this film to fly pass the levels of 1999's 'The Legend of the Titanic', awkwardness. So go check it out! It's a lot of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Fox Animated Feature Ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is absolutely the best animated feature that I have ever seen in my entire life. I saw it many times, and I really love it! I've really got to say this. This is absolutely going for global warming in my country. Let's grade this right away. And as for Bartok. @&amp;$^ you, Bartok. Animation: A- Characters: A Story: B+ For Kids: YEAH! Music: B Voice Acting: A Overall: A-. That's why I freaking love it. Wheeee- hoodoo.Oh. And Another aspect that adds to the feel of the movie, is that gender means very little. There are female characters like Anya and Sophie but you don't really realize that until after you watch it a few times and even then it has little effect on the way you view the film. Due to this, there's also no mention of a nuclear family which would really be pathetic in a setting like the ice age.All in all, Anastasia is a great movie and is proof on how much effort was put into traditional animations before Lilo and Stitch, Atlantis: The Lost Empire and The Princess and the Frog came out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anastasia (1997) is honestly one of the greatest animated films of all time! Meg Ryan and John cusack voice their characters wonderfully, their voices really fit the animated characters well. The script and screenplay is awesome, very well constructed. This movie is of course very family friendly, and it's also very smart and clever, it really shows the writer's talent. I adore the visual effects too, the animation is very state of the art, and the effects are cool looking and a pleasure to see. Rasputin is a great character too! He is the films villain, and he is written very well! He is funny when he needs to be, menacing when he needs to be. His cute little bat assistant is hilarious! I absolutely loved his character, he brought lots of cute amusing anecdotes and lines to the movie. The chemistry between Anastasia and Dimitri is electric! I love the great romantic chemistry between them. Angela Lansbury was cast perfectly to voice Anastasia's grandmother, and her character was written beautifully as well, when they sing once upon a December together, oh my gosh, chills!! The musical numbers are fantastic too! I really love the songs, they just click and work well with the scenes they are in. 10/10 for Anastasia! Will always hold a special place in my heart!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie, very literally, dozens of times. It is one of my favourite and most watched (and most listened to) musicals! Anastasia must journey from St. Petersburg to Paris to discover whether or not she is the missing princess but more importantly, she must sing songs along the way. Aided by con-men she takes a journey to the past to help her find her future. This movie has beautiful animation and a brilliant soundtrack!&nbsp;One time my brothers girlfriend borrowed this DVD without telling me and I spent weeks trying to find it. I made a post about it on&nbsp;Facebook, she saw it and felt bad that she had taken it. Luckily I own more than one copy of this DVD and I was still able to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time i watched this movie, i was 10. Now, i am 22 and i still love this movie. I don't know why people don't give good enough rating for this movie ( maybe because it's different from it real story or because the story it's not quite deep? i don't know since, i don't read the history. Even though it is different from the real story, we should keep in mind that this movie is a fantasy movie not a biographical one. It is targeted for younger audiences, so you can't blame the writer to imbued the story with magical things ).As a kid, i watched this movie as a love story when a lost princess who tried to get what has been lost and found much more precious things along the way.The story line is quite simple ( and i do not know that this movie is based on true story, up until now ). It's a story about Anna, how was growing as an orphan, not knowing or remember who she is. Then someday, she went on a journey with 2 man, Dimitri and Vladimir ( and a dog ) to find her real identity. Fantasy, Love, Adventure, History,you can find thus mix of feelings in this movie. The song is beautiful, i listen it a lot when i was a kid.Overall, i think it's worthwhile spending your time to watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully rendered.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love a good animated story, and "Anastasia" delivers in all departments. I often get a little annoyed that high production value animation is reserved for female-market-driven films, because as the Japanese anime industry has show, boys and males in general like good animation if throw in some action (gunfights, heroics, and so forth). But here in the US of A, most of the animation is aimed at kids and females.Even so "Anastasia" has a good number of action scenes, but the thing that really sells this film is Don Bluth's and his crew's attention to character emotive detail. When Meg Ryan voices cheerfulness or distrust or some other emotion, we actually see the character move and gesture to reinforce those emotions, complete with facial expressions. I mean, wow, that's what great animation does. This is something that Disney could have, and should have, produced, but Maverick-animator Don Bluth carried the torch for a not-so-historical film regarding Czar Nicolai's youngest daughter.The salespoint for this film was that it was historically accurate. Accurate in that some lady in Paris tried to fob herself off as the long lost princess before passing away (I seem to recall the committed suicide, or some such, but am not certain). It's accurate in that she may have been part of a plot to gain fame and money by touting a big lie. The real truth is that the Romanovs were killed by revolutionary Red Army forces in their own basement; gunned down with rifles, and that not a single soul survived. It was also reported that the girls dresses were so laden with metal and gems that it took several rounds to bring them down. That's the ugly truth about the killing of the Czar's family, and the even uglier truth about the Soviet Union, whose founders perpetually cried foul for all of the Czar's deliberate ignorance of his people's pleas for better treatment under the law. One might say each gave birth to the other.But, history aside, this film, for all of its liberties taken with the fraudulent Anastasia and actual story of the Romanov's, truly is a great work of animation. The CGI is not overused, and rendered where needed, while the hand drawn characters are the usual high quality as they express emotion in perfect sync with the voice talent. The crowd and party scenes, the action sequences, the more intimate character driven scenes, the nightmare and dream sequences, all make for a really dazzling visual story telling style.Again, my one gripe is that they don't do the same thing for male oriented action films. Oh well.It's not Disney, but is worthy of Disney and Disney praise as it was produced and directed by a former Disney employee.Definitely worth a night's rental, and it strikes me as a good date movie too.Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching a spin off to this called 'The Secret of Anastasia' and it was similar to this in the aspect that it included the story of the Romonovs. I was born in 1997 so I couldn't watch it when it first came out. I was searching for the spin off earlier this year so I could watch it and I found this film and I can say it was one of the greatest discoveries I've made. I love musical films and this one didn't disappoint. I love how they portrayed the love story of Anya and Dimitri and I love the music that goes with the film. I've always loved the story of the Romonovs and especially the disappearance of Alexei and his sister's bodies. History, especially German and Russian history, has always been a love of mine and this film contributed to it. However, if you don't like history, it doesn't matter as the story is still amazing in itself and you don't need to know about the history of it anyway. I would recommend this film to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catchy, funny and adorable!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whilst growing up, I watched this every single night, I knew all the words to the songs, I could of probably acted out the whole film. A few years ago I re-discovered it, whilst helping to sort out the old cupboard. I decided to watch it, as I remembered how much I used to love it. And afterwords I could totally see why. This film, (even though, it is an animated film, and I'm fully aware of that), is actually the most romantic and adorable film I have watched. Every time I watch it I just can't stop thinking about it afterwords. I did think it may be because of my love for it when I was little, but this film just causes you to feel so happy afterwords. I watched it with my younger cousin who is 4 years old, (sort of as an acceptable form of watching it) and as expected she loved it too. This film, honestly doesn't get enough credit at all. No one knows about it, yet, when anyone watches it, they automatically love it! What also makes this film so much better, it that it is loosely (only in a tiny way) based on a real story, and it you research what it is based on, actually links with the film well. The songs are catchy and imaginative, the script is witty and funny, and the outcome is so romantic and adorable. Amazing film, defiantly worth a watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magical for both kids and adults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite animation movies. It is beautiful and appealing to both children and adults.The story is not historically accurate, but I would think any adult, even the ones not familiar with Russian history at all would sense that there is no truth in Rasputin selling his soul to put a curse on Romanovs. Yet I am sure this beautiful movie would awake interest in people regardless of age to find out more about it. And it is also obvious why. Which kids would want to sit through the details that lead to Russian revolution, the main story of the movie isn't that anyways but the legend of Anastasia.The greatest strength of this movie is the animation. It is so beautifully mastered together with amazing colors and use of shadow. They also went a big way to be accurate in details when it comes to the settings, mainly the palaces. The story takes mainly place in St Petersburg and Paris and both places get a spirit about them I was especially in love with Russian scenery. So much magic and beauty about it. Not just in the palace but the beautiful snowy are out of the city as well.The cast to give voices to the characters is amazing. Angela Lansbury was a perfect choice for the Empress Marie. All the other main characters were also very impressive considering their star status.The music is another important element for the movie. The songs have a big variety and are beautifully sung. My personal favorite is Once Upon a December. They also did so well with collaboration the voices of the singers with those of the actors. Except for Kelsey Grammar who as I read mastered to sing Vladimir's songs on his own. I would love to go see it on stage as a musical.And as I sad it is a wonderful movie for both kids and adults. It follows a well known princess movie formula which children love. But even so the main princess is an exceptionally strong female character who does a lot of brave things in the movie and for the most wants to find herself and her roots. The evil scenes of the movie are also appealing to children, Rasputin's character was sure created to entertain them including the little bat that is his buddy. And adults enjoy more the artful animation and the music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disneyfied Russian History Minus the Disney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie by Don Bluth is very similar in style to Disney films of the period. It is a very fanciful take on the Russian Revolution, which happened not because of discontented people and bad rulers but because swell rulers were magically undone by a villain who without explanation hates them passionately. This magic follows the amnesiac Anastasia as she teams up with a couple of likable grifters.At times the movie is quite enjoyable, although I always felt like it was falling a little short. The comparisons with Disney are hard to avoid, and while it does some things a bit better than Disney did in this period, Disney still tends to do more things better. One strength of Anastasia is its princess, who has more personality than Snow White or Sleeping Beauty. In her spunky determination she is more akin to the princesses Disney has pumped out in more recent years, making her ahead of her time. But while she has some personality, I would say she has a lot. The love interest is also likable but fails to be memorable.Still, the likability of the leads makes the plight of the protagonists more affecting than many Disney films of that period, and there are moments when the movie is downright touching.On the other hand, Bluth is not nearly as good at villains. Rasputin is evil, and his first appearance beyond the grave is amusingly perverse, but he's not remotely scary, never come close to someone like Malificent.The animation is quite good, and there are moments when it is really quite lovely, but again, it lacks the memorable scenes that distinguish Disney's better (and sometimes even lesser) films. There is something off about the basic structure of the film. Rasputin's pet bat seems shoe-horned into the film just because they wanted him, and he's never essential nor particularly amusing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not Historically Accurate to Have a Talking Bat or an Undead Rasputin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you HONESTLY think that this movie's going to be historically accurate, think again. Aside from the points in the title of this review, in real life Anastasia died with the rest of the Romanov family on July 17, 1918 in Ekaterinburg, Russia when they were all shot by order of Vladimir Lenin himself. So any and all criticisms about the historical inaccuracy of the film are ultimately superfluous.Harsh reality aside, this animated adaptation of the 1956 film of the same name holds up pretty well after all these years. The story of a young girl being picked up by con men who want to pass her off as the Duchess and claim the Tsar's fortune is nothing new. But Don Bluth and crew manage to make it surprisingly refreshing with some bright colors, fun characters, mild but tense action scenes, and one of the most perfect love stories I've seen. Heck, the romantic leads don't even say "I love you" once; they leave it entirely up to the animation, the music, and the superb voice acting. THAT is what film is supposed to be: showing instead of telling.The characters are great, better than some in the Disney movies this film borrows from. Anastasia herself is a wide-eyed but hopeful woman whose banter with Dmitri, a con man who's afraid of admitting he's not such a bad guy after all, is the best part of the movie. Vlad is a lovable yet hopeless romantic, thus the perfect best friend for Dmitri. Angela Lansbury as The Dowager Empress Marie is, well, Angela Lansbury. Nothing that new, but NEVER anything bad.And then we have Christopher Lloyd as Rasputin. He's... 50/50. Sometimes I buy him as this hate-filled, despicably evil sorcerer, other times my mind momentarily flashes to Christoper Lloyd in a recording booth. And most of his scenes are plagued by Bartok the Bat, voiced by Hank Azaria. Bartok's not annoying or anything, but given that he does all of ONE thing in the film, his presence is no doubt due to the producers feeling that Rasputin and his awesome villain song were too scary. Gee, a villain that scares people? UNACCEPTABLE!Aside from "In the Dark of the Night," the rest of the songs in the movie aren't that memorable. They're not BAD songs by any stretch, they just don't go as far with the lyrics or the tune as Rasputin's villain song. The only one I remember distinctly was Once Upon a December, and only by name. But, seriously, why isn't David Newman getting more work these days? His score in this film was spectacular, enough to give Alan Menken a run for his money.Overall, while it may not my favorite movie or the the BEST movie I've seen, there's nothing really to hate about this film. It was thoroughly entertaining from start to finish, and that's really all a movie needs to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>reasonable imitation of Disney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Russian Tsar and his family are cursed by the evil Rasputin. When the revolutionaries break in, Anastasia escapes with her grandmother. However she couldn't hold on as she is left behind at the train station. Ten years later, con men Dimitri and Vladimir are looking for a young girl to pretend to be Anastasia and con the old Dowager out of her reward money. Anya follows a dog to St. Petersburg in an attempt to get to Paris. She stumbles onto Dimitri and Vladimir. She has no childhood memories and was found as a lost 8 year old child.This is a good effort for Fox Animation and is comparable to contemporary Disney fare. It looks visually beautiful and won't get embarrassed by any comparisons. The voice work is fine but Meg Ryan is a little too old to play the teenager. Hank Azaria needs to be funnier. The songs are very Broadway but none of them are memorable. It's ever so slightly disappointing to not have Meg Ryan sing. It's also tough to basically skip over most of the Russian revolution by making Rasputin an evil wizard who caused everything. It's mostly fine as a reasonable animated family movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watchable but not that good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was OK I guess, the songs were good and not as annoying as they are in most movies. The main story is about a "former" princess who has to leave Russia to reunite with her grandma after the Russian revolution. For my personal taste the characters are too one dimensional. This made it hard to really connect with the characters. There is one thing that really bugs me about this movie. The villain is kind of a sorcerer what really doesn't fit into the early 20th century setting. The sorcerer has little to nothing to do with the whole plot. Literally all scenes he is in are childish, annoying and are not really essential to the movie. I think in the middle of the picture there are 45 minutes without him appearing. The story of the princess going to Paris overcoming obstacles and finally finding love would've worked better without his distractions. The story is standard from beginning to the end I've seen it done better but I've seen it done a lot worse too. I think if you are really into romantic animated movies with singing and all that stuff you are going to have a great day. If you are not into that (like me) you probably won't have that much fun but you might find yourself actually enjoying some scenes if you don't mind that the movie doesn't give a f... about history.(Even though I am German I watched the original English version)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Journey to the Past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a kid the unsolved mystery of Anastasia always fascinated me, it was much like with the Elvis sighting stories because of the possibility of what if. It made me wonder what if somehow Anastasia did survive and was still alive, may'be she lost her memory and doesn't know or she choose not to be found. Despite the fact this mystery has been solved recently in 2007, it didn't delude the mystery that fascinated me so much, because questions and the possibilities we draw up are most of the time what we thrive on in life than the answers themselves.This film is one of my favorite animated films that I personally think is under the radar.The animation by one of my favorite if underrated animated directors Don Bluth is top notch in my book as usual. Like the livelihood of the movement, the background animation is great capturing both 1900s Russia and Paris beautifully. But mainly I like the character designs which make them stick out.The music is just beautiful, the songs are excellent and memorable. Two of my favorites are "At the Beginning" which is a romantic song. However my favorite song is "Journey to the Past" which is just beautiful and has a range of emotion because it's simply about Anna's journey to find her past to find home.But to me it's the story and characters that power this film.I really like the story, like with the film "Bubba Ho Tep" it plays on the what if concept of Elvis still alive. This film is pretty much a fairy tale but in a contemporary reality which I don't see much, except may'be in the TV show "Once Upon a Time".The antagonists are solid, Rasputin (voiced well by Christopher Lloyd one of my favorite actors and voice actors)he's a villain you love to hate as he has some really good lines. He's pretty much just simply a power hording psycho that is just bent on getting power in the worst possible way.I even like the subordinate villain Bartok voiced by one of my favorite voice actors and underrated actor "Hank Azaria" (yeah for the record I'm a Simpsons fan) he's just a fun and cute antagonist you don't hate, he's just fun and funny has some of the best lines. He's sort of a villain for hire, doesn't care about his boss's cause or even his boss himself; he's just a person (or bat) that is just doing what he's paid to do but also has enough common sense to walk away.I really like the protagonist Anastasia (voiced well by Meg Ryan), she's beautiful inside and out, she's got charisma, sweet, but also really feisty, can hold her own against danger, but most of all just has this unwavering hope that she will find something in her life to make her whole, which all the more makes her someone we want to bet on to win because after what she's been though she deserves it. But she's a character you do feel a slight sense of pathos for as she's simply a person that is lost and is in need of home and love in her life. From what we already know of her past it's actually really sad, since most of her family has been deceased for some time which means she literally has no home to come back to and the fact she can't remember them very well is awful. Personally I feel what she's really looking for isn't so much the past, but it's really her own destiny, it's not so much just a home she's wants but her own life to be able to create and call someplace home.Demetri (voiced well by John Cusack an actor I like) is my favorite character in the film because he's a protagonist but an unconventional one. He's sort of like the last guy you really would bet on to save the day, he's obviously not perfect but sometimes these kinds of protagonists are the best kind let alone interesting. He's the kind of guy that looks out for number one, is wanting to get rich quick despite breaching ethical boundaries, and he's a bit of a user. He's kinda funny, he's got some sharp charisma which means he got some of the best lines. But to me what makes this character likable is thought the journey and his time with Anna he does grow in character and does the right thing.I really like the chemistry between both Anna and Demetri, this is one of those romances that actually work as both interact and warm up to one another which I think is believable. I even like that dance scene between them which was sweet. We then see as Anna is gaining some happiness in her life again, Demetri is beginning to change his mind about the scheme and he not just is beginning to discover the true identity of Anna but is having genuine feelings for her, which makes him realizes that there really are more things more important than money and it's not what he really needed after all.In a way you can say this is a story of redemption for the character as he's had a shady past that he himself isn't proud of, by completing the mission to return and protecting Anna he may also have a home of his own as well, since he himself just like Anna is without a home and love. Both were in pursuit of different things but were really in pursuit of each other.Overall this I feel is a great animated film that like any great mystery is worth uncovering.Rating: 4 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anastasia, 1997 This is a movie that will forever remain iconic in my opinion, for its original use of storyline for something based off reality. I was a child whence I first saw this film, and was intrigued and learned the words to every song, falling in love with them more and more as I grew up. Thank goodness that I held on to loving this movie, never to forget it, because it seems that nowadays the things that once meant so much to an audience is diminishing to clichéd moments of over-told and repetitive story lines that make no use of character development to further interest the audience, or the use of imagination to create something memory-worthy, when you look back to think about it, you think three words... that was amazing. This is a movie that if you saw it as a child, rekindles something in you that throws you back into that moment you first saw it when you watch it again once you've grown up, if that makes sense. It's just a movie you can't outgrow because it holds something for all ages. I'd recommend this movie to anyone looking for an escape from the new "modern" garbage animated films that are invading the art of film and destroying the concept of what a movie truly is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this in my childhood. But i couldn't finish it. So after 10 years i thought to watch it completely . Now this movie looks silly. Even though its entertaining with its musical and the good nostalgic animation. It will be a joyful ride for children. Anyway its lovely to watch it as a small kid. Meg ryan and john did well.I am giving it a 6/10. Though i would have given 9/10 if i were a 5 year old kid.The music so soothing and good to hear. i am giving my rating mostly for the music and the songs. After watching , i feel like singing for each and every moment of my life.The ending is so predictable. Like every other happy ending movie they lived happily ever after.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anastasia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the time of release this seemed like it was bigged up quite a lot, I saw trailers all over the place, so when I got the opportunity to finally see it I wasn't going to miss it, from directors Gary Goldman (producer of All Dogs Go to Heaven) and Don Bluth (An American Tail, The Land Before Time). Basically Young Anastasia the Grand Duchess (Kirsten Dunst) barely escapes the siege in Russia, but when her grandmother The Dowager Empress Marie (Angela Lansbury) boards a train, she is left behind with a bump on the head that takes away most of her memory. Ten years later, Anastasia (Meg Ryan), or Anya, has grown up in an orphanage, and the only clue to her past is a necklace reading "Together in Paris", she realises she has to somehow get there and find out who she is. Con artists Dimitri (John Cusack) and Vladimir (Kelsey Grammar) are trying to get their hands on a big cash sum by bringing The Empress her found grand-daughter, and they unknowingly find the real one. Meanwhile, power-mad sorcerer Rasputin (Christopher Lloyd) sacrificed his soul to have the royal family killed, but as the princess is still alive this has not been fulfilled, so he has been living in limbo and falling apart for the past ten years, so with the help of minion Bartok the bat (Hank Azaria) they set out to kill her. Rasputin attempts to kill Anastasia, travelling with her two companions, with a train line with missing track, and on a ship during a stormy night, but without success and they reach Paris. Over the time they have spent together, Dimitri has fallen for Anastasia, and he remembered being a young servant to the royal family, so he knows she is the real Grand Duchess. When she finds out about the con he and Vladimir planned, she storms out and misses her chance to meet The Empress, but with Dimitri's persuasion they are eventually reunited. Not long after finding out her identity is true Athe princess faces Rasputin himself, but of course he is defeated by his source of power being destroyed, and in the end Anastasia and Dimitri express their feelings for each other. Also starring Bernadette Peters as Sophie and Liz Callaway as Anastasia's singing voice. This is not apparently accurate in terms of the history of the Russian Revolution, but it doesn't matter, the voice casting is reasonable, the animation is pretty good, and the story is okay, overall, not a bad animated musical fantasy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Music for Stephen Flaherty, Lynn Ahrens and David Newman and Best Song for "Journey To The Past" (also nominated the Golden Globe), and it was nominated the Golden Globe for "Once Upon A December". Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very polished animated fairy tale from Fox</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ANASTASIA is a very polished, A-grade animated film from Twentieth Century Fox that was clearly meant to compete with the highly successful Disney animated musicals of the 1990s. This movie looks fantastic (visually speaking). The animation is impressive and the handful of songs are well done (with a couple standout musical sequences). The voice cast is headlined by Meg Ryan, John Cusack, Christopher Lloyd, Kelsey Grammar, and Angela Lansbury.In a turbulent period of Russian history, a young princess is lost. Years later, a young woman who can't remember her past embarks on a journey to find her family, and find out if she might actually be the missing princess. She is persuaded at first by a fortune-seeking conman, but an evil sorcerer, long thought dead, seems to think she is the real deal, and he sets out to end the royal line once and for all.This movie is not too "kiddie", so it may be enjoyed by the entire family. There's action, intrigue, and a historical setting. It has its moments of darkness and, except for a couple animal sidekicks, the animation aspires to realism, not cartooniness. The characters act like live action characters, for the most part. The animation just adds that certain visual flair to the storytelling.What I find most disconcerting is how the film takes actual world history and makes complete fiction of it. Rasputin is given magical powers and made the primary villain (a darker, more evil version of Jafar from ALADDIN). The details of the Bolshevik Revolution are glossed over and the events of the imperial execution are changed to facilitate what becomes a fairy tale of historical fiction.I know other animated films have taken liberties with history, but this one just irked me for some reason. I understand that the fantasy makes for an entertaining story, and I understand that tying the fairy tale to a factual historical background makes it all the more intriguing, but there's something about using real people's names and real events and twisting them into a made-up story that doesn't sit well with me. Children who watch ANASTASIA might be confused when they take World History in school, that's all I'm saying.The movie itself is pretty good, and the fairy tale is intriguing, if not true. The period setting (Russia in 1917 and again in the 1920s) is rather interesting to see in animation. The blend of 2-D animation with CGI elements (grand staircases, ballrooms, trains, etc.) looks nice. The musical scenes have some cool animation, particularly the haunting "Once Upon A December" sequence. The romantic fairy tale story is okay (made more memorable by its more modern setting), although the villain sub-plot feels almost extraneous.I never gave this film a chance when it came out, but it is a high-quality animated feature, on par with the likes of Disney's films. I was surprised. If you're curious, check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A epic and decent rival film to Disney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Anastasia" isn't Don Bluth's first attempt to compete with Disney, but it's certainly one of the most epic ones. While the movie was heavily hyped back in 1997 to be a really competitor to the Disney film, it certainly had the same feel and tone as a Disney classic. However, in spite of that component being a strength, "Anastasia" is still watchable on it's own merits, but it's still hampered by some flaws which makes the hype unnecessary.As with Richard Rich's "Swan Princess" from 1994, "Anastasia" is more or less as watching a Disney film without the famous and promoted Disney logo appearing on its opening. Ironically, the creators of "Anastasia" followed the same habit as Disney by making a film based on grave, historical events, turning back to it's accuracy and rather focused on the legend. Sounds like a part of the typical Disney-formula, but even for a non-Disney film, the many components of the formula actually works on this film.Most of the time, "Anastasia" provides as a cute and charming flick, filled with catchy Broadway songs by Stephen Flaherty/Lynn Ahrens, which actually sounds like they could been on a Disney flick and a decent score by David Newman. Anastasia herself, wonderfully voiced by Meg Ryan and nicely sung by Liz Callaway, is a surprisingly spunky and funny heroine, with a personality who outshines the Disney heroines. While her love interest Dimitri, despite his sex appeal, is less interesting, he's given a solid voice by John Cusack, which shares a good chemistry with Ryan's voice. Kelsey Grammar is endearing as Dimitri's sidekick Vladimir, Bernadette Peters is charming as the Empress cousin Sophie, while Angela Landsbury provides a great performance as The Empress.With the exception of some badly drawn townspeople, the animation is lush and gorgeous, especially on the palaces and the architecture. The film opens with a dynamic and exciting action sequence and most of the action scenes are like that. Although some of the lines are a bit clichéd, the characters has a few amusing comments along the way."Anastasia's" flaws ultimately lies in it's predictability. Even for a kid movie, the story has no surprising twist and turn. The film becomes a bit sappy and boring during it's third act. While the villain Rasputin does provide some of the exciting scenes, he still comes off as a less compelling villain compared to the Disney baddies. His sidekick, Bartok the bat, has some amusing moments (and it's brilliantly voiced by the recognizable Hank Azaria), but still doesn't become the charming villain sidekick that he could have been. And the predictable love story between Anastasia and Dimitri feels as a forced and rushed, in spite of the lovebirds shares a good chemistry.Those components prevents "Anastasia" to live up to it's full potential. However, the film still makes a watchable and entertaining effort for both kids and adults. While this film may not be one of the best animated movies ever made, it still is a worthy competitor to Disney and demonstrates an art-form that nowadays is considered as rare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A peculiar landmark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anastasia was a sort of landmark picture, in its own ironic way. It was a production that showed you what animation really could be, and simultaneous;y demonstrated why it probably wouldn't happen in the foreseeable future. The story of Anastasia (as it was laid out in the 1950's play) is made beautifully, brilliantly, thrillingly. Grafted onto it, in an all-too-obvious and sadly misguided commercial strategy, is the bizarre subplot of the supervillain Rasputin and his sidekick, the albino bat Bartok. The movie-studio logic that instigated this bit of narrative frankensteining is patently obvious:animation means child audience children need good and evil to root for Evil needs a sidekick to talk about his evilness with Merchandising needs a character to sell to the boys (Bartok) or it'll just be a girl-flick and we'll lose half the money. Alas. Movie studios have to chasae a buck, they need it to keep making movies. Sometimes, they do it intelligently and great film-making results. This is the other way they pursue it, studio logic at its most craven and cowardly. The entire Rasputin-Bartok aspect of the movie is godawful. The notion that Bartok might somehow be appealing is appalling. The integration of the two aspects of the movie is virtually non-existent. Large animation projects are generally executed by several different teams working concurrently, and integrating the the different segments with some stylistic consistency is part of the art of the supervising team. It is utterly absent here. In a way, that's a good thing, because it keeps the "bad movie" from tainting the "good movie."But the message is all too clear: "we can't just make a good drama or romance in animated form, because we can't trust anyone over the age of 9 to come to an animated film. So if it's animation, we have to pander to children." And in their eagerness to pander, they made the supposedly kid-friendly part of the film so bad it's insulting to any audience of any age.Which is a real pity, because the Anastasia story, the real one, is an excellent movie that advanced the art of animated narrative.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There seemed to be a reincarnation undertone to the movie. In my opinion it is incredible that Anya can forget her life before the orphanage. But when she returns to the old palace, she begins remember fragments of her past. This is akin to someone experiencing deja vu because of a past life. Also when in the old palace and speaking with Dimitri she says "Were you a vulture in a past life?"--an overt reference to reincarnation. A lot of the movie seems to deal with the issue of remembering who one is. I gave the movie an 8 out of 10 because, although I enjoyed the storyline, I thought the characters were too shallow, i.e. their personalities weren't explored deep enough. I wish there was more dialog between the grandmother and Anya to know more about their relationship. But like I said before, overall its a good movie</fullReview>

Just some accents would have been enough. and no real convincing idea of the Russian setting or communism rising up as it should have done. I know this isn't Doctor Zhivago but there should have been at least SOME idea that the Bolsheviks were rising up.Romanticism was obvious but then again...it's entirely fictional and thus able to do what you want with it.I also read the original script and thought that some opportunities to make it a little bit more interesting were lost such as:1. Proper references to Bolshevism 2. Cameos from Stanislavski and Yuri Zhivago.However, the look was good, it was enjoyable and the animation was impressive, especially since it was one of the last hand drawn animations to come out from Disney.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ANASTASIA: 20th Century Fox Productions, 1997.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first and most important note to make on this movie is its Historical inaccuracy -- something that will inevitably be its downfall. Truly, the movie is captivating and well-spirited, a joy to watch, but if one previously knows the true History involved, they will be automatically pushed into a higher form of criticism when viewing.They did try, however, to add in small snippets of actual pieces of History, but this falls short compared to the disloyalty they placed towards the more severe of events involved. It's best to look at this in two ways, Correct and Incorrect.Correct:1) For the most part, Tsarskoe Selo (Tsar's Village : Finnish) was drawn correctly, although it seemed to me that they made a majority of action happen in Catherine Palace, whereas the family would have (fled? actually taken) from Alexander Palace.2) The Children's rooms had a touch of reality, Anastasia &amp; Dagmar escaping into the wall -- which did exist in the rooms, a passageway to the kitchen.3) Rasputin's death -- he did, after many other tries, eventually die when drowning in water.4) Pooka was a nice addition, as a majority of the family (aside from Olga and Marie) all loved dogs and had one of their own -- Anastasia owning two.5) The family was all included, although Tatiana was the only one easy enough to pick out. Marie and Olga looked exactly the same. Alexei also looked as he was at the time, though in the portrait, he had sunny blonde hair -- which he did not have in reality. Nicholas looked as he did at the time, and Alexandra did not, though close enough.6) Although I am taking a blind leap into this one, I assume that in the song "Once Upon a December," when singing about "painted wings," it is referring to the fact that Anastasia and Marie had butterflies painted on the borders of their wall.7) Clothing. The period clothing of the Edwardian, later Flapper eras seemed to have been fairly accurate, the styling and classes all accurately portrayed.Incorrect:1) Surely the most annoying thing above all was their pronunciation of Anastasia. In reality, Anastasia is said as (Ahna-stah-se-ah), as opposed to their saying of it, (Ana-stay-sah).2) Often times, they would use Princess over Grand Duchess -- a great blunder, as it was always said that a female of Russian Royalty (generally daughter to the Tsar or marriage to a Grand Duke) was called "a Grand Duchess, greater than any Princess."3) Rasputin's general part and plot in the movie. To me, it seemed as though his character was completely changed, his History reversed, only so that they could have a driving force in the movie. And truly, his participation wasn't even needed, the romance carried the story enough. For one, he was not an enemy to the inner Romanov family, only to the outer Romanov family. He loved them and vice-versa. How they decided to make him the enemy, I don't know.4) I was disappointed by the portrayal of Dagmar (Dowager Empress Marie), who in reality, was quite a strong figure of fiery personality. In this, they made her a weak woman, unable to live past her tragedies -- sad indeed.5) The largest and most important -- the entire Russian Revolution. They made it seem as though Rasputin was the founding base of war, and it might be true that he was a factor, but certainly not the main cause. The Russian Revolution could be called a coup d'etat, the working class of Russia forming union to go against the Royals, but it was mostly a transitional period of old Russia changing to new Russia.As for general production, Animation and Musical background: The story was a smooth one, with believable characters and a believable relationship that was formed in good sport. The dialogue was often sharp and to the point, though noticeably unfamiliar to the actual period of time they were in. The animation was often well, although the CG seemed to stick out and not blend with the cel animation, often distracting one from the scene. The songs were catchy and nice to listen to, aside from Rasputin's. I particularly liked Journey to the Past, Once Upon a December, and At the Beginning(ending title).Had this movie been created without the Russian History attached to it, I am sure it would have much better reviews and fanbase, but it's hard to accept something so inaccurately portrayed. If anything, the viewing of this could initiate curiosity towards looking into the actual History of it all. If viewing this with your children, it would be good to point out the special features of accuracy, as well as pointing out the inaccuracy.Also, be sure to remember that behind this simple movie, there was a unfortunate, sad History played out by real people.(6/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A break from the old Bluth drivel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After nearly gagging over All Dogs Go To Heaven and Land Before Time, I cringed when my daughter pulled Anastasia off the shelf in the video rental shop. But other than the unnaturally big eyes (like the velvet paintings sold at gas stations), the animation was fresh and charming. And other than Rasputin's ghastly number, the songs were catchy. "Journey to the Past" and "Once Upon a December" touch a nerve with their themes of yearning for home and belonging, without being needlessly maudlin.Okay, the history was fuzzy. I expected that. Filmmakers can be forgiven for taking a legend (that Anastasia survived the massacre of the Romanoffs) and running with it. And if it sparks a few kids' interests in the real Romanoffs, so much the better.The train wreck is exciting, Dmitri is conniving and charming, and the ghostly waltz scene rivals the ballroom scene from Beauty and the Beast. Finally Bluth produced a film parents could watch and enjoy along with the children.</fullReview>

To the film's defense I must say that I saw it in German unlike most other animated movies I watch (I'm really sad I missed Meg Ryan and Hank Azaria). The character design was BEAUTIFUL, but there was this line between nose and the corner of the mouth just a little too often, making the heroes look older sometimes. The background painting was most colouful und very detailed, letting Disney's Mulan (which appeared about the same time) look a little trist sometimes. The character animation was nice, but definitely NOT Disney-like, as it was based more on real-life-movement than on animated gracefulness. The computer animation (like of the boat or the train), were a little bumpy if you paid close attention to it. But what spoiled a lot of the film was that big parts of the story were just completely illogical. Most children won't mind, but grown-ups are bound to notice. Moreover, Rasputin was just the most unnecessary bad guy I have ever seen in film history. Just keep your expectations low !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfect Disney Duplicate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I didn't know better, I would've assumed Anastasia was a Disney film. It perfectly duplicates the Disney formula, with nearly as much success. Containing all the ingredients of a superb Disney movie, Anastasia can't stack up with the best of animated fairy tales, but it's an enchanting film regardless.Anya has been an orphan from the age of eight. She knows nothing about herself, and is determined to find her family, whom she believes to be in Paris. And it seems she just might make it to Paris when two con men (Dimitri and Vladimir) volunteer to take her there, under the condition she pretends to be the lost princess of Russia, so that they can collect the reward money for finding her. Little do they know what Anya actually IS the lost princess.This is not a particularly original tale. The story has been told time and time again. And while Anastasia may still produce a sense of deja vu, it also manages to make the story feel fresh again.All of the best qualities of a good Disney movie are here, in just slightly inferior fashion. These qualities being: memorable characters, great songs, excellent animation. There are others too, but these are the qualities Anastasia best duplicates.Anastasia is a slightly snarky (but not annoying) damsel, that has much more personality than most other Disney princesses of the time. Dimitri is the scoundrel that (predictably) falls in love with the title character. Vladimir is a jolly and round man, who provides most of the film's humor. The villain, Rasputin, is wonderfully wicked, and has a nasty habit of falling apart at times. A hand here, an eye there, that sort of thing.The voice cast is good, without being quite great. The two standouts are Angela Lansbury as the Russian Empress, and Christopher Lloyd as the villain.The songs are marvelous, though the interesting rhyme schemes take some getting used to. "Journey to the Past" is a magical number, accompanied by great music and spellbinding lyrics. "Once Upon a December," this fairy tale's music box/lullaby song is pleasant, and could've been a spot on parody of any of Disney's songs of the same nature."Rumor in St. Petersburg" is distinctly Russian, and at the same time, evokes memories of the "Belle" number in Beauty and the Beast (though it's not nearly as good). "In the Dark of the Night" is a fantastic villain's song, with some great accompanying chords and music that really make the song. And "Learn to Do It" is the film's most comedic and easily likable song, with quick clever lyrics (and includes a sweet reprise shortly afterwards).The animation is good, and almost great. There's lots of detail, and pretty good character designs. The main problem is that there's no sense of depth. This leads to some pretty cheap looking segments here and there that could've used some polish. Occasional use of CGI is subtle and not distracting, but enhances the animation.The score, composed by David Newman, has all the elements of a good fairy tale or fantasy score. It's not as playful as most Disney scores (appropriate for the film's slightly darker nature), but it certainly gets the job done.While I wouldn't put it ahead of most Disney Princess movies, Anastasia makes for a worthy rival. Great songs, memorable characters, and a touching story makes Anastasia a winner. I can't say I was expecting much from this Disney look-a-like, but you can call me impressed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The animation world has been taking off the last couple of years and that is cause for rejoicing among writers. With Anastasia, we have a new studio, Fox, entering the big-time, and they've done a nice job with the animated Broadway musical form that Disney, until now, has owned.Like live action, animation depends above all on structure and genre. The first and most important choice for the animation film is whether to base it on the myth, fairy tale, or drama form. I believe for animation to have the greatest commercial potential it requires the fairy tale form. Which is why the choice of the Anastasia story is at first peculiar. This drama, presented years ago in an Ingrid Bergman movie, is predictable, slow and unappealing to children.Not to be hemmed in by historical truth, the writers of Anastasia, the animated movie, make a number of changes to turn this drama into a myth/fairy tale. First, they begin with the Sleeping Beauty opening: everyone is having a grand time at a communal event when the uninvited evil guest, Rasputin, appears and curses the proceedings. This allows the writers to use the unique powers of animation to present social landscape, in this case the aristocratic world of kings and queens. They also get to rewrite history; instead of having to explain those messy, boring details of Communist takeover of a corrupt, brutal czarist state, they get to blame it all on an evil spell. (I always suspected that was the real reason anyway.) Now the writers get to use a myth foundation for the desire line: Anastasia wants to find her home. But the writers wisely avoid the episodic problems that plague the myth form (and substantially hurt the success of "Hercules") by layering a second genre, love, onto the story. Anastasia's second desire, which occasionally conflicts with the first, is Dmitri. He becomes the second opponent (and first ally), and they experience all the classic love story beats on their journey to Paris. Instead of encountering a number of successive opponents, the lovers' conflicts unify the middle of the script.Having Rasputin return from the dead as the main opponent also solidifies the fairy tale form and avoids the episodic problems of myth. The writers use the Wizard of Oz trick of having the opponent watch the heroes on their journey and send minions to waylay them. This strengthens Rasputin as the central opposition and sets up the final battle. The writers also use the Disney comical ally trick with Rasputin's bat, Bartok, easily the best character in the story.Anastasia defeats Rasputin in the battle and she and Dmitri have self- revelations. Anastasia learns her true identity and her preference for love over riches, while Dmitri turns down the money for the woman he loves.Anastasia shows that craft is as important to the success of animation as it is to live action. The writers know their myth, fairy tale, and love story genres and how to blend them in a seamless single strand. The characters begin with clear needs and end with self-revelations and moral decisions. For animation writers the lesson is clear: storytelling is king.FOR MORE REVIEWS, please visit www.truby.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing about once learning the history of the downfall of the final Russian royal family is that maybe at times, I can tend to be a little surprised if there are any new allegations in regards to one of the daughters of the Romanov family - Anatasia. This was once being discussed in my History textbook before (though not really so much into detail as it's not part of the syllabus). About whether Anatasia really survived the Bolsheviks' killings.General conclusion - she never survived at all.So when back then this was shown on the television like few years back (it's already after my History classes), I had actually heard so much about the various factual errors it had surfaced in this animated movie. Okay, maybe occasionally I will jump out and say this is not right and all that, but then eventually I thought, I am watching an animated movie anyway. I just need to sit back and enjoy...I have to really admit, the presentation is kind of nice as I was watching. Abadoning all those what I had learnt in my History classes for once (lol), I do actually kind of enjoy it.Maybe I am one who is trying to be open when facing with such things, but it's all up to oneself to decide anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>my curiosity for Anastasia was cured for a moment, then came back more strongly right after the credits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The heavy mystery of Anastasia was delightfully twirled and enhanced with Don Bluth's 1997 adaptation. Surprisingly alert and classical, this movie was determined to capture the haunting and vibrant world of Russia and Paris. The name Anastasia has become as generic as Titanic and Evita, but it is her story's unrequited ending that has kept readers and researchers quite entranced. Going for this angle, and cleverly exploring the woman that has been, and will be, Anastasia, this movie carries a certain air of old-fashionness and socio-historical commentary all wrapped into that bittersweet animated theme. The all-star cast provided the glamor that the film needed. Lyrical dialogue and thematic songs continuously built the story and provided simple yet satisfying action, conflict and realizations. Dimitri was an excellent character to be added to Anya's story, he provided that other layer of conflict that didn't push romance into the package, but made it bloom so naturally. Rasputin was so carefully created into a trademark villain, his appearance and nature very essential to his metaphor - a living corpse. All characters were well-developed, contributing to the energy and excitement of the story.I rushed to the theaters almost seven years ago because I knew of Anastasia, and I came out of the theater wanting more of her story. Flipping through Disney channel during the past weeks made me realize how the magic of Anastasia still gripped me, how very daintfully the animated film was made that it puts hasty musicals today in competition. Anastasia was a great experience indeed, one that is fit for any adult audience and one that is enough to stir the wonder in children all over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>but... this movie was made by 20th Century Fox. not Disney. It's true; I own the video and checked. And though Disney will forever reserve a special place in my heart for providing such wholeheartedly educational entertainment and more to families everywhere, I'm afraid and sad that Pixar is starting to unearth Disney's top position as the ruler of animated films. I'm aware that Pixar is working with Disney but even Pixar sees how much it's contribution is worth in making mucho $$ for the films they both produced. e.g. Toy Story, A Bug's Life, and more importantly, Finding Nemo). Last time I heard, Pixar demanded they get a larger part of the profits or get paid more, whichever one they actually asked for.Hopefully Disney can surge back up on its own again... I saw Home on the Range. It was actually pretty good but maybe not as attractive and appealing as Finding Nemo and not quite as original as their other old classics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...'Anastasia' is not a Disney film, my good friend. It was released by Fox Studios. Let's hear it for an animation house that can create something ten times better than the swill that's being produced at the Mouse House these days. But hey, I can see how you'd get the two confused: big stars doing voices, stellar music, and a storyline that completely butchers the actual history it's based on. Sounds like Disney to me, too.Regardless, 'Anastasia' is an amazing film and is a must-see for anyone interested in smart, well-crafted fairy-tales. My only caution is for parents with small, easily-scared children: Rasputin is portrayed as quite a scary villain, despite his wise-cracking sidekick Bartok. Hell, I'm a twenty-year old university student and he still creeps me out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that Anastasia is one of my favorite non-Disney cartoon films. The animation is superb, the characters are so REAL,and Dimitri is HOT for an animated person.I love the songs except 'In The Dark Of The Night'&amp;'Rumor In St.Petersburg'.I found it annoying that you couldn't tell the older 3 Grand Dutchesses apart at either of the times they showed up. The only disappointing part is the amount of Historical mistakes:*the Romanov Family was not destroyed on the night of the 300th anniversary of their rule. That was the night of Nicholas's Corrination! *There is NO mention of World War 1.Russia was Heavily involved early in that. *Alexi wouldn't have been at the ball. I highly doubt Empress Alexandra would've been present either(She wasn't really into parties) *The Romanov's were in the 'house of special purpose' when they were massacred in the basement. *historians aren't sure wheither Anastasia OR Marie survived. They can't find Tzarivitch Alexi's body either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie should have never been made into a cartoon for children to see. First of all, the real life story of Anastasia is terrifying and unsolved. The movie does not include the fact the the real Anastasia was never found and was not reunited with her grandmother, as was shown in this movie. But on a worse note, instead of changing the whole story to fit with the happy not real ending, they made many scenes too much like real life for a children's movie. When I saw this movie, I personally found it too scary to watch as a young child. This was the wrong story to make into a movie, and worst of all, it was done poorly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>warning possible spoilersI know about the real history of the Romanovs , its possible the real Anastasia survived ,because two Romanov bodies are missing , ALexei and one believed to be Anastasia or Maria. THe movie was great , however if FOX is going to change history they should go all the way and let her keep her crown and Dimitri. I feel the plot was wasted by the ending. She goes on a journey to Paris to find out if she is Anastasia or not. Vlad trains her to act like a Romanov. She meets her grandmother and finds out she is Anastasia. Marie throws a big ball and dresses her in a beautiful gown and crown ,all for nothing!!! She never goes to the party or even returns to her life as Anastasia. At the end she doesn't even look like she cares if she is Anastasia or not. Sadly a movie who's plot and effects by the characters is wasted by a lousy ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, but silly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit I like this movie a lot. It's one of my favorite animated movies. This being said, here's what's wrong with it:1.) Completely historically wrong. My history teacher had fun assigning us to do a comparative: Choose a historical fiction movie and contrast it to the actual events in question. I used this one. I had fun.2.) There didn't need to be a villain, and yet there was one. Nothing against the actor, because in fact he rocks, but the character he plays just has no reason to exist /at all/. I own this on video and I fast forward through every scene with Rasputin in it whenever I watch it every time. It's just so dumb to have a villain with the incredibly cute storyline they had already.3.) The animation--been there, done that, got the T-shirt. The characters themselves, with their fantastic facial expressions, were wonderful. Dmitri and Anya and Vlaad and their facial antics are fabulous fun to watch. But...what the heck were they doing with the intermeshing of the weird bizarre computer 3-d along with all the pretty stuff they already had? It threw me. (Not to mention Anastasia's magic lengthening shortening hair...it's always a different length whenever she puts it down. Always long, but never exactly the same length. Struck me as a little, well, off.)Other than that, well, the movie was great. It was just fun, you know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie but historically screwed up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an Anastasia reseacher, I have to say that I love this movie. It's one of the best Bluth animated films to date (It's a not a Disney, folks, which is refreshing). The only drawback is that the movie isn't historically accurate in almost every aspect. Now, it's expected that some historical stories will be altered a little, but this story was broken apart. Letr me list the historical wrongs:-Anastasia was not killed (kidnapped) as a child, like in the story. She was 17 years old when her family was killed.-Ana Anderson was not an orphan. When she revealed that she thought she was the lost dutchess, she was found trying to jump off a bridge. There was no Dimitri or anyone like him either, she was entirely on her own.-Ana spent her entire life battling for recognition as the lost Princess. As a young girl, she never fell in love nor was she returned to any family member. All of Anastasia's family had perished.-After Ana Anderson died in the early 1990's, it was discovered after DNA testing that she had NO blood relation to the Romanovs. This proves that the Anastasia animated story is totally false.Not to nit pick, but there are still more historical flaws in this film. In any case, I loved it very much. I highly recommend it as a family flick with a heartwarming ending, just as long as people know the historical background.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though I did see this film at a relatively young age, I only watched it once and hardly remembered any of it. I quite enjoyed it this time around, with the exception of a few of the songs. Most of the song were pretty catchy though, I still have that "Paris Holds the Key To Your Heart" one stuck in my head! The plot was interesting and exciting, despite criminally straying from the source material. Last but not least, Rasputin made a great villain, hats off to Christopher Lloyd for yet another great performance! Hank Azaria was also great as Rasputin's comic relief bat sidekick, Bartok. He later got his own spin-off which isn't nearly as good as this film, needless to say. Overall, if you like animated films this is a must-see! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasant, not great - Bluth's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd given up on Don Bluth. He struck me as a decent animator who had risen to his level of incompetence when he became a director, producing sugary, ill thought out kids' movie after sugary, ill thought out kids' movie. I still think this is more or less true. But `Anastasia' was an unexpected pleasure.For a start, Bluth is more than just a `decent' animator. I wonder how he managed to find the time to produce and direct the film, AND animate Anastasia (the character) so soulfully. In some ways Bluth's style is now very old-fashioned, but it's still his style, and he gives Anastasia at least as much charm as the story requires her to have.The film as a whole I'm willing to cautiously endorse, too. The basic idea - of a con artist whose latest `forgery' is genuine - indeed, he even knows it's genuine, without knowing that he knows it's genuine - is strong enough and well enough handled to sustain the film. A pity Bluth ignores it so often. His biggest detour from the main story is the needless supernatural villainy, which leads in turn to needless (and ugly) computer animation, and a needless sidekick: Bartók, the bat. (Why name the bat after a Hungarian composer? Is there some joke I'm not getting?) That sidekick is probably the single most disastrous character in the film. Bluth is unable to decide if it's a reluctant villain, a thorough-going rotter, a sweetie, or merely something with a silly voice. It's the kind of `character' one often encounters in his films.So is Bluth STILL, in my estimation, a director of sugary, ill thought out kids' movies? Well, one out of three. `Anastasia' is not (in the deadly sense of the term) a kids' movie, and it's not sugary. But it IS ill thought out. Bluth really needs to hire someone to write and direct for him, so that he can concentrate on drawing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Americans do it again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched the 1997 movie "Anastasia" on a recently released laserdisc pressing. You know, I never cease to be amazed by the cavalier attitude with which the American entertainment industry treats other cultures and values. The opening words of the film say it all: "There was a time, not very long ago, when we lived in an enchanted world of elegant palaces and grand parties. The year was nineteen-hundred and sixteen and my son Nicholas was the Tsar of Imperial Russia." What is ever so conveniently never mentioned is that this "enchanted world of elegant palaces and grand parties" was created by a repressive and reactionary aristocracy at the expense of unimagined misery for untold millions of peasants and workers. And when that repression finally reached its explosive breaking point in 1917, the movie circumvents and trivializes it by introducing preposterously supernatural causes, without a hint of any underlying social injustice. Of course, Fox Studios defended itself by pointing out that it was in no way dramatizing historical events, but was intent upon creating a children's fantasy. But I have to wonder how Americans would react if a Russian film company marketed an animated children's fantasy about America's old South as an "enchanted world of elegant plantations and grand parties", a world that is rudely shattered when the "vile" abolitionist John Brown, who has supposedly struck an unholy alliance with Lucifer and the blue-coat brigades of Abraham Lincoln, interrupts a grand ball thrown by the genteel President Jefferson Davis at Richmond, Virginia, to celebrate the investiture of the gallant General Robert E. Lee as the commander of army of the newly born Confederate States of America. With a satanic leer from within a swirling cloud glowing in venomous green, John Brown spews out an apocalyptic curse of upon the cream of Southern gentry and their fledgling Confederacy. What a breathtakingly dramatic vision for the root causes of the American Civil War with which to impress young inquisitive minds, eh? But what about the reaction of the Afro-Americans whose ancestors paid for this "enchanted world of elegant plantations and grand parties" with generations of harsh bondage, to say nothing of today's legions of Civil War buffs and local historical boards on both sides of the Mason-Dixon line? Why, no problem! Just imagine their collective sigh of relief after they are comforted by a spokesperson of the Moscow movie mogul with some soothing remark like, "Now, folks, relax. Our film is definitely not depicting historical facts. It's just a fairy tale for kids." It's amazing how a re-assuring explanation like that can make all the difference in the world!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anastasia (1997): Dir: Don Bluth, Gary Goldman / Voices: Meg Ryan, John Cusack, Christopher Lloyd, Kelsey Grammar, Angela Lansbury: Beautifully detailed animation with a story that isn't quite as lively. Set in Russia 1916 where Rasputin causes a revolution by casting a deadly curse upon the Ramanov family. After ten years young Princess Anastasia remembers nothing of the event yet ventures to Paris because of a locket given to her by her aunt. She is accompanied by a con man named Dimitrie who wishes to earn the reward money for her safe return. Obviously they fall in love and Rasputin will threaten a return. History established before formula sets in. Directed by Don Bluth and Gary Goldman who previously collaborated on All Dogs Go to Heaven. Meg Ryan gives personality to Anastasia with more input than the flat screenplay offers. Christopher Lloyd provides comic anger as Rasputin but the role is cardboard and beneath his talent. John Cusack voices the soul seeking Dimitrie in what appears to be a prop. Viewers are not surprised when he hooks up with Anastasia and they may not care either. Kelsey Grammar voices Dimitrie's companion in another drab character. Finally, these films cannot be complete without involvement of Angela Lansbury who cannot save it either. The animation is dazzling and it is an attempt to animate the classic story, which in itself falls flat. Score: 3 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>20th Century Fox hasn't really had much luck when it comes to competing with Walt Disney Pictures in the race to release the year's best animated film. First it was "Ferngully: The Last Rain Forest" and now it's this 1997 take on the events surrounding the alleged disappearance and reappearance of Princess Anastasia during the Russian Revolution in the 1910's. It's definitely not the right kind of story to bring into an animated format. Historically inaccurate on practically all counts, as most animated films based on historical fact are. The only plus is the animation. 20th Century Fox got some of the best animators they could find (including Don Bluth) to make this film and the animation is splendidly lavish. It's a shame that such great and colorful animation couldn't go into a film where it would be more appropriate.</fullReview>

Rasputin, an evil monk trusted by the family to cure their son, betrayed them and was instrumental in their downfall. But, over the years, rumours surfaced that the Czar's daughter Anastasia had survived the massacre that had claimed her parents, brothers and sisters, and it was hoped that she would one day return to the fold. You know what that story needs? Songs! Ohhhh, a 1, 2, 3, 4, life has been grim since the revolution, la la la de daaaaa! Disney wannabe Don Bluth then jollies things up further by making Rasputin a rotting corpse who spends the film falling to pieces and bantering with a comic relief bat.

Even though Dimitri is not what you would find in a hero or protagonists he really knows what happened and is willing to do any thing to get the money.

		<shortDescription>Wrong But So Very Wonderful ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To all fellow history buffs out there, while this film is historically inaccurate-it is far more entertaining. After all, when we go to the movies, don't we deserve that.The animated version of "Anastasia" is marvelous. The singing, dancing and music are beautifully done.John Cusack and Meg Ryan are wonderful doing the voices of the heroine and Dmitry, a man who as a child, had gotten Anastasia and her grandmother out of the palace.Angela Lansbury should be made the Queen of animation. Between her role in this as the grandmother, (the animation looks like a very stern Bette Davis) and as Mrs. Potts in "Beauty of the Beast," this great actress should just go on and on.The staging and the song about December are great.Christopher Lloyd's voice as the horrible Rasputin is as evil as ever.So, for now, throw out the inaccuracies and sit back and enjoy. Furthermore, this comes to you from a retired history teacher!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's okay, but *really* padded.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to love this movie. Really. I guess I did like it but something about it feels... off somehow.I'm thinking the main problem I had was with Rasputin. Simply put, the movie did not need him. He looked like he was there just to give the effects team something to play with. The heroine's emotional conflict is SO much more interesting that there really is no room for an actual villan, much less an evil wizard (and his musical number is just a big disapointment; I was expecting something out of a Tool video and ended up with something that wouldn't scare Hanson).There were a few other things that irked me. The fact that Anastasia has about six different (reacognizable) actresses and singers doing her voice was distracting to say the least, and the computer animation didn't meld that well with the cell animation. The Paris number was just pointless; it was just there so they could have Bernedette Peters sing something.So cut all of that annoying stuff out and you have got the start of a great movie. As it is, I'm sorry but "Anastasia" is just a pretty good one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ALEXANDRA WOULD BE APPALLED!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Had the real people involved in the real tragedy somehow been able to see this...Alexandra would be "APPALLED." (that was her favorite word it seems to scold her impish Anastasia and Aleksey)Nicholas would be INFURIATED.Olga and Tatiana would be SHOCKED that this received such praise.Marie would love the romantic aspect of it, bless her flirtatious heart.Anastasia would probably find it funny.Aleksey would most likely have mixed emotions.Had either of the latters miraculously survived as some believe, if they ever saw this they would proabaly burst into tears in the revolution part.I, however, loved this movie, when it first came out. The more I look into the lives of the real people, the more I am ashamed to watch this. I have not watched the movie in its entirety for about two years. And I don't want to. Worth the money I paid for it, yes. Score and songs are awesome. But the historical inaccuracies and the fact that it's aimed at 4 year olds disturb me. The real Romanovs, at least the adults, would be appalled.Some movies are art, some are entertainment, some a little mix of both. This I just consider entertainment, a distraction from the real world's troubles. But the character of Rasputin was unnecessary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wonder how an animated version of the Columbine Massacre Would go over...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So fox is able to make an animated movie about Anastasia. They should be so terribly proud of not only marketing but mocking the brutal slaughter of a young girl and her entire family. They even killed the dog. I wonder what the American reaction would be to an animated fairy tale of the Columbine Massacre. I'm sure it would be marketable, but it would be equally tasteless. What bothers me is that young people see these things and often believe there to be some truth to them. There isn't in this case. Anastasia was killed with her family. Anna Anderson, who claimed she was Anastasia, has been proven a fraud. The movie had a happy ending, Anastasia and her family didn't. I wish those claiming that it's a "must-see" or is technically great would stop and think about it. They might also want to stop and ask themselves "How would I feel if this had been my family that they are making a mockery of in animation?".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made but a complete lie....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are LOTS of spoilers in this review. Read only if you want your illusions shattered! When the 1950s film "Anastasia" was made (starring Ingrid Bergman), there was still a lot of doubt as to whether or not the woman who claimed she was the Russian Princess Anastasia was her or a fraud. Some people who knew her swore that this was the princess. Some saw her as a complete charlatan. This controversy alone would make for a good film. However, by the time "Anastasia" was remade as a cartoon in 1997, the real facts of the story were much more clear. Anna was NOT the princess but a sadly deluded Polish lady. Genetic testing showed conclusively that she was NOT the princess--this was without doubt as her DNA did not match living relatives. Yet, oddly, the studio STILL made this film and promoted a lie!! So, while the film is reasonably enjoyable and well made for a non-Disney feature cartoon, it is 100% wrong--and promotes a lie. Speaking as a retired history teacher, I find all this very disturbing....By the way, after the cartoon debuted, the actual graves of Anastasia's family was found but her remains were not there. BUT, a short time later, her remains were found and there is zero doubt that the princess was killed almost 100 years ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have studied the subject of the fate of the Russian Royal family for years, and quite frankly, I am surprised the current Russian govt. didn't sue FOX for this movie! The long list of historical lies includes 1) The Romanovs celebrated the 300th anniversary of the dynasty in 1913, and they did NOT throw a ball. 2)Anastasia was 16 in the year the movie starts in. 3) The Tsar abdicated before the Revolution even happened, and went through a long imprisonement periodbefore he was secretly executed. 4) Rasputin was murdered long before therevolution. But to give such a lie as to say that Anastasia WAS found, THAT is inexcusable. Why FOX would remake the 1950's film is nothing short of baffling. They attempt to turn it into another silly children's quest movie. And they even fail at that! Rasputin, instead of being ominous or mysterious is presentedinstead as a bungling nincompoop, and not ONE bit of terror comes from him.Bartok, while he gets some laughs, is mostly just annoying. The visualchoreography is overdone and derivative, especially the "Final Battle." Theaction is overplayed, but the animation is spectacular. The train wreck sequence is extremely exciting, and one sequence actually IS scary: The nightmare scene. However it is the idea that is scary, not the character behind it. The dialogue is witty and well written, Meg Ryan, Angela Lansbury, Kelsey Grammar and JohnCusack give great performances, and the Ahrens/Flaherty score is stellar. But this movie is extremely dissapointing, to say the least.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PROS (well, there are NOT very much of them):1. There are some funny episodes.CONS:1. Almost doesn't correspond to real history. And this is really funny (at first).2. Too much illogical links. For example, Anastasia's grandmother escaped from Russia with no luggage, but later we find out that she keeps family pictures in Paris. Another example: Anastasia leaves orphanage in new and clean clothes and has a GOLD MEDALLION on her neck!!! (Hm, it is DEFINITELY a FUNNY fairytale).3. 'Horror' parts of the film were too fearful for little children (though funny enough for adults).4. Part of the film was animated by computer... and the more I had looked at it, the more it irritated me. Especially moving cars; they looked just like toys. First, 3D-animation of 'Anastasia' stands out of 2D. Second, it is not high quality 3D. Think it would be much better if there were NOT 3D-animation at all.5. Not impressive storyline... well, to tell the truth, very standard storyline.6. Standard Hollywood film. Hey guys, Russians are NOT Americans, they talk different, do different. And they have another music! After 'Anastasia' I'm even afraid to watch 'Mulan' - I can imagine what Hollywood had left from China culture there!VERDICT:Bad film.

		<fullReview>Despite its beautiful animation, "Anastasia" falls flat on its face due to an extremely bad script. To date, the only good movies Don Bluth has ever put out are "The Secret Of Nimh" and "An American Tail" (only the original, not the godawful sequel). There is practically no character development and the final conflict between Rasputin and Anastasia makes absolutely no sense.I especially found the music to be horrendous, especially the tune that plays during the scene in Rasputin's lair with all the bugs and worms singing (I cringed in terror every second during this scene). The only good song was probably the one Anastasia sings herself.If Don Bluth is going to continue churning out such inferior material, then Disney really has nothing to fear. If you really want to watch an enjoyable non-Disney animated flick with good music and story, try "The Prince Of Egypt" from Dreamworks!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Animated children's movies should really stick to real fairy tales rather than manufacturing them out of grim novels and grimmer history. Making a fairy tale out of one of the grimmest of twentieth century events and completely destroy any resemblance to well documented history is a crime against history, its victims and the children it grossly misinforms. Rasputin was not a supernatural evil wizard/demon. He was killed before the revolution. He had no part in the murder/assassination of the Romanov's or Anastasia's fate. Where is the Leninist terror? Where is the truth about what happened to Anastasia's family, even if even now no one can be completely sure about Anastasia herself? This movie is being made in an era when the Anastasia/Anna Andersen hoax on which the Bergman movie was based has been exposed via genetic testing. There is no excuse for cluttering children's minds with such nonsense given the cruel brutal facts of history.This is not a classic fairy tale, nor a bible epic, it is just a really contemptible idea for an entertainment vehicle. There is also no reason it could not be translated to a fiction time and place without connection to actual events and then be a successful movie without the baggage.What's next?The happy holocaust survivor a la "Life is Beautiful" complete with singing, dancing camp inmates, and humorous bumbling guards? And perhaps big smiling ovens!How about the adventures of a sweet young thing with a big princess attitude that barely got out of the World Trade Center with her hunky young hero just before a giant flying demon Bin Laden reduces the buildings to rubble with blast of his powerful satanic breath?Rating of 2 is for the unquestionably good looking product and the work of the voice actors that was wasted on it, leaving some room at the bottom for totally unredeemable works.The movies should stick to established fairy tales, and leave making up modern ones to politicians and their spin doctors, for example: We come as liberators, that's why we are building a dozen or two permanent bases in your country!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this movie came out, my kids made me take them to see it. Knowing the story before hand, I was wary of going in the first place. I mean, really! Why take such a tragic and controversial story and turn it into a light-hearted film? For this same reason, I have refused to go see many of the more recent Disney animated films. Little did I know that I was going to see an animated film that made even the worst of Disney's animated "classics" look flawless.Perhaps the biggest problem with this movie is that it isn't a Disney movie at all. No, this one was made by 20th Century Fox, by the famous ex-Disney team of Don Bluth and Gary Goldman. Unfortunately, without the heavy-weight comfort of Disney Studios to guide them, they ended up with a fumbling bit of work that has only the voice of Meg Ryan in the title role to give it any class whatsoever.We all know the story. A girl, who may be the only living heir to the Russian royal family after the revolution, tries to find out if she really is just that. Many versions of this story have been filmed in live action. Some better than others, but all point up the tragic mystery of the roots of an orphan. This film gives a happy ending where there is none. Granted, lots of the more recent Disney films have done the same. I believe that children should know that some stories don't have happy endings - or at least ones that have semi-happy endings, with a bittersweet after taste. One good example of this is Disney's "Jungle Book" where, although the child returns to live with humans, the animals who cared for him lose a friend.The difference here is that at least the Disney films have at least a few tolerable songs - some even memorable ones. Pocahontas is a good example of this. A truly tragic story, that at least had one excellent song to promote it. This film hasn't even that small claim to fame. So, my next "thumb down" goes to the score of this film. And I use that term lightly, since the music is one junk yard of forgetful tunes with overly sweet lyrics.The animation reminded me of early Disney films. Two dimensional characters on a background that tries to be three dimensional, but fails to make the grade. At least even the early Disney animators could make beautiful backgrounds for their films. You would have thought that animators would have learned by 1997 to give a bit more even look to these films. Disney has tried and, to some extent, succeeded. Not so here. So, where some animated films have a visual beauty to assist them, this one is lacking again.Finally, when one looks for a film to take their kids to, they want something that is entertaining but with at least some sort of a message. I still haven't figured out what kind of message this film sent my kids, and I certainly wasn't entertained.In sum, I wouldn't recommend this movie for either adults or children. There is nothing to recommend it. The story is badly distorted, the music doesn't grab your ears, the animation is third rate and it neither entertains nor teaches us anything. If you have to see this film - make sure you're brain dead first, and then, only take your youngest kids. They'll never know the difference. Or will they?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is always room for cynicism in the world. However, to make a children's movie out of the monumental tragedy of the Russian revolution is something entirely new in the annals of history. We may safely leave aside the historical factors, such as Rasputin becoming an enemy of the Romanov family, such as the Romanovs being good and well beloved rulers, such as the Dowager Empress, Maria Fedorovna being a gentle and kindly woman (known as Dagmar the Furious in her native Denmark) and such other petty nonsense. But to make of this historical event a children's story, to make of it an industry of children's books, clothes, games, music, shoes etc . . . that is unforgivable? Won't the blood splash when they walk in those shoes? What are we to expect next? An interactive children's game called "Death Camp" with little figures in striped uniforms running away from teeny-little German shepherds? Who knows. Now, over eighty years later it will, perhaps, be possible to forgive the makers of that revolution. But it is impossible to forgive the foul scum who did not even pause before making a cake out of the monstrous mix of ash and blood, who did not stop in their cynicism and made a game out of the most tragic event of the twentieth century, and the one that spawned all others, including WWII and the Holocaust. For the people who made this film, there can be no forgiveness, for at some limits, even cynicism must come to a halt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there is one medium that is so frequently guilty of mangling a perfectly good story, it is animation. This is not the prerogative of all animation, but "Anastasia" is, if anything, guilty to the last.Foregoing the film's decision to eschew historical accuracy (already well covered by other comments here), we are left with a movie that is practically barren of redeeming features. Though lushly designed, the animation throughout falls flat. The character animation is, for the most part, stilted and inexpressive, and sits awkwardly alongside the 3D computer animation. The all-star voice cast and often quite adept dialogue does little to rescue the faltering script, nor do the obligatory songs, which although can be fairly enjoyable, are eminently forgettable. Dredging further from the barrel of animation staple we are presented with cute animal mascots, and the ludicrous, utterly repellent villain figure of Rasputin, who is practically superfluous to the story's requirements.It is astounding that a film with so few redeeming qualities could have come from Don Bluth, the same stable that produced the darkly fantastical "Secret of NIMH" and the endearing "An American Take" films (arguably amongst Bluth's best work), but it just goes to show what can go wrong when someone tires of making films about talking mice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst animated movie ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do you have to ask why? First off, it was terribly historically inaccurate. "Hellboy" did a better job of making Gregori Rasputin a villain. The movie begins with Rasputin coming back from the dead and placing a curse on the Romanov's, which according to this movie is the real reason behind the Russian Revolution. Rasputin was trying to save Russia, and if anything his death brought about the end of the monarchy. He was murdered (overkilled is more like it) by nobles who feared the Czar was placing too much trust in him. The Czar had placed him high in office, even though he was a bit of a charlatan. Every bit as stupefying, they then play on the old conspiracy that Anastasia survived the massacre of her family. However, records show that the Bolsheviks had the entire royal family being held prisoner in a house in Siberia. While the rest of the family was slaughtered, conspiracies believe that somehow Anastasia escaped the firing squad. In closing, not too long before this movie came out, a woman who had long claimed to be Anastasia (and many people believed her) was proved by DNA to be a fraud. This was worse than "Hercules" and a terrible and shameless attempt to change the turning point of the 20th century into a little girls fairy tale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first watched this movie, I hated it. No, not because of what everybody seems so concerned with, the "historical facts". I don't care about the historical facts, there are no such things! History is truly written by the winners, and thus, it is completely partial, what means there are no "facts", just filtered and prejudiced points of view, not to mention that it's impossible to know everything of anything, much less to express all of it with our imperfect symbolic languages and media. Also, everything is relative, it's impossible to see clearly from the inside, and as part of this universe, no one will ever be able to see "The Truth" of anything (well, maybe jumping out of the universe using a transdimensional hyperdrive, but I doubt any organic creature could survive the quantum leap...) In other words, asking for a movie to be "faithful" to partial and, mostly, useless "historical facts" is just plain dumb. If you believe the TV news are closer to History than, say, the Greek Mythology, then I know who to blame for Bushit's incoming apocalypse.Anyway, what really got on my nerves was the characters' singing! Well, no, I didn't know it was a musical until it was too late, nobody warned me! I wouldn't have minded for a song or two, but there were so many of them! The beginning is wonderful, captivating. The details of the scenario, the quality of the painting, the design of the characters, I liked everything. Then, suddenly, they stopped acting and started singing! And after they had started, they wouldn't stop! There are no more than a few minutes of acting before they start another song! And the songs are awfully boring!The result is that, after an hour of movie or so, I started turning the volume down every time they were singing (the songs didn't add anything to the story, anyway). I watched all Fred Astaire's movies, I love "Singing in The Rain", so I usually don't have a problem with musicals, but I couldn't cope with "Anastasia"! Please, don't judge the movie for its factoids, because it's not a National Geographic documentary. Be warned, though, that it's a (boring) musical, there is not much story in the plot (it would be an excellent 30min short-movie if the songs were cut off).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank God We Have Disney!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We can be happy to have these very noble Disney cartoons. It's the only kind of film, in my opinion, that still has the right to paint characters black and white. I think, human beings feel the desire to have some characters to love and some to hate in movies, but nowadays such primitive characterizations are frowned upon by the critics. Luckily, there are Disney's cartoons, where you don't expect anything else, where you can, without problems, paint good people beautiful and cute and evil people grey and ugly. Thus, every material can be turned into a film for children. In this special case, of course, historians won't be quite happy to hear that it was Rasputin who expelled the Romanoff family...With the characters in ?Anastasia`, I had to laugh. Anastasia and Dimitri are a screen couple that doesn't fit into a 1920s Russia at all. They reminded me rather of George Clooney and Michelle Pfeiffer in ?One Fine Day`. I say only one word: emancipation! So, time also left its mark on the Disney movies. We have to accept that, but we will, as long as they keep the old-fashioned touch they always had.Yeah, there's another thing left. I've mentioned this in other comments. To all the synchronizers in the world: Please, don't dub songs! It always, always sounds false and amateurish. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have absolutely no problem when studios animate history. I first became defensive when Disney produced "Pocahontas" but under further inspection, I found the tale to be quite endearing and heart-warming. It may have not followed the historical path, but since when have animated tales EVER followed the original details? Besides, the studios received the last laugh when hundreds of children flooded the public libraries when they were planted with a passion to learn far more about their American culture.But what atrocity has 20th Century Fox produced? There is a fine line between what is just and what is down-right evil. Ever look straight at the motives of Rasputin, the villain? The man is simply out for blood. No motive. No explanation. He wants a complete and undeniable obliteration of the Czar and his family. He doesn't want power, riches, or other worldly possessions...just the humans' souls. In one vividly depicted scene, Rasputin trades his soul to the devil (as his flesh is sucked away revealing his grotesque skeleton) for the ability to destroy the Czar.Furthermore, the film leaves much to be desired within the animation department. How convincing is the characters movements (and voices)? "Little Anya", as Anastasia the orphan is called, leaves an orphanage kicking up snow and tripping over her own feet as she chases Pooka, certainly Fox's attempt at the cute factor dog. Most distracting, however, is the studio's computer generated images. They fill most every scene...and really don't fit. Within the most intense or pivotal scenes, up pops some type of computer image which dashes all hopes of the scene's full impact. They are absolutely distracting and, since most of these objects practically fill the screen, one can tell that the objects don't belong. I admit, computers have done wonders for the animated feature, but when the sight makes the audience think, "say, that's made by computer, isn't it?" their thought about the plot is lost and the scene discredited. When a train wreck appears in one scene, it's shaky movement lessen the attention to the main characters, Anastasia and Dimitri. "Anastasia" is definitely not the eye-candy of the 1997 cinemas.Of the songs, none are really memorable, except "At the Beginning" which is played during the final credits. The animation that accompanies the film's songs are quite unnatural and, upon inspection, actually seems as if the characters are walking in circles while talking to themselves. I'm quite the admirer of both Bernadette Peters and Angela Lansbury. Their voices are unique and emotional, providing the animator with an enormously colorful palette to draw from. I don't know how both ended up with such flagrant songs, not to mention the bland, unmoving personas/lines. One scene which will forever remain in my mind is when Dowager Empress Marie (Lansbury) has her cab hijacked by Dimitri. As her voice regally demands that the cab be stopped, her motions barely reflect the insistence within Lansbury's voice. What a waste of two exceptionally talented actresses.Had Fox devoted more attention to quality, this film would have reached the status of the incredibly brilliant "Pocahontas".</fullReview>
