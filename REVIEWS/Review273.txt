		<shortDescription>Must-see documentary for anyone who eats</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is said that if you like eating sausage, you better not see how it is made. If you like eating meat, don't watch an animal being killed. If you have your fill of fruits and vegetables daily, don't think about the pesticides that coat them.Our modern society has sanitized the presentation of food so that we can blissfully ignore what we should be concerned with: where food comes from, how it is raised, picked, handled, altered, transported and sold. Instead our attention is focused only on the awesome number of beautiful packages on market shelves, the unblemished fruits and vegetables available year round. In our increasingly artificial world appearance trumps taste, price trumps provenance, and industrialization gives us a false sense of safety.It is therefore opportune to have the release of "Food, Inc". After you see it, you'll probably not shop for food in the same way. You may even change the kinds of food you eat. Not enough to convince me to become a vegetarian, but the ubiquitousness of corn and its derivatives, stated multiple times in the film, has made scouring of package labels a routine. The easy rule of not buying anything that contains more than five ingredients more frequently obeyed.The film contains material that has already been brought out by others, for examples, (1) the problem of genetically modified seeds crossing into properties that do not want them and (2) the appalling conditions in which farm animals are kept. Some material is stressed too much, for example, the whole issue surrounding the tragic death of a kid from a very virulent form of E.coli and the attempts to establish regulations that might prevent such deaths. Individual cases are worth mentioning, but systemic and widespread issues are more compelling. The death of one is no doubt a tragedy but the impairment of thousands is of greater social consequence.The issue of food regulation in general is a subject that I would have liked to see more of. The adverse effect of more regulation (as per the example above) can be too much regulation. The subject is briefly broached by the "good farmer" (Joel Salatin) who kills his chickens in the open. Ironically those chickens are likely to be more healthy and tasty. Regulation may eliminate this practice. Regulation can therefore have a negative impact on food culture. One of the best example of this is preventing the importation into the US of many delicious young unpasteurized cheese from Europe or even the marketing of such cheese by US producers. How many get sick from those cheese compared to the number of sick from peanut butter or spinach?The film unwittingly projects a bit of naiveté in a couple of places. The segment about an individual being sued by a food conglomerate and essentially losing for lack of money is not news. This is a capitalist system: more money, better lawyers, almost certain victory. Yet the point is well taken that the food conglomerates are behaving in thuggish ways and acting with the protection of a complicit government (the best money can buy). But again, uncontrolled capitalism generates monopolies and they will fight tooth and nail to retain control and squash any semblance of competition. It's the logic of the beast. This not limited to food. Since voting habits have brought the US to this state of affairs, our only recourse as consumers is to eat bananas, and only bananas, for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It's called the Chiquita Diet.In any case, this is a must-see documentary. The director is to be commended for having the courage of tackling this very important topic.Don't forget to buy a five gallon basket of popcorn dripping with oleo and a big soda with plenty of high fructose corn syrup before going into the screening room. It may be the last time you do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The message of 'Food, Inc.' is that most of what Americans now eat is produced by a handful of highly centralized mega-businesses,and that this situation is detrimental to health, environment, even our very humanity. The ugly facts of animal mistreatment, food contamination, and government collusion are covered up by a secretive industry that wouldn't talk to the filmmakers or let the interiors of their chicken farms, cattle ranches, slaughterhouses, and meatpacking plants be filmed.Informed by the voices and outlook of bestseller authors Eric Schlosser ('Fast Food Nation') and Michael Pollen ('The Omnivore's Dilemma'), this new film is an exposé that offers some hope that things can be made better through grassroots efforts. True, Kenner points out, Monsanto, Smithfield, Perdue, et al. are rich and powerful. But so were the tobacco companies, and if Philip Morris and Reynolds could be fought successfully, so can the food industry. The fact that the vast Walmart is switching to organic foods because customers want them shows people vote effectively with their pocketbooks every time they buy a meal.Other documentaries have covered this ground before. The 2008 French documentary 'The World According to Monsanto' (2008) focused on how that company, with government support, monopolizes seed planting, and Deborah Koons' 2004 'The Future of Food' went over similar ground. Jennifer Abbott and Mark Achbar's sweeping 2003 film 'The Corporation' (2003) touched on Monsanto's monopoly too. In more general terms, the ominous, narration-free German documentary 'Our Daily Bread' (Nikolaus Geyrhalter, 2003) delivered 'Food, Inc.'s' message about dehumanized factory-style food production with a European focus. Richard Linklater's 2006 'Fast Food Nation' grew out of Schlosser's book about how bad and disgusting American fast food is and how it undermines the health. These are all good films, and there are and will be lots more. As this new film mentions, exploitation and malpractice in the meat industry were exposed as far back as Upton Sinclair's 1906 muckraking book, 'The Jungle.''Food, Inc.' is a populist and practical film that speaks with the voices of farmers, advocates, and journalists, and focuses on food, what's wrong with it, and what we can do about it. Kenner offers lots of practical information and appeals to everyday people. The film goes back to the Fifties to show how the rise of fast food contributed to centralized, less diverse American food production. MacDonald's now much of the chicken, beef, potatoes, and many other foods produced in the country. The film explains that only a handful of companies control not only most of the beef, pork, chicken, and corn produced in the US but most other food products as well. Moreover not only is corn the major feed given to food animals, but a surprising amount of the tens of thousands of products sold at today's supermarket -- that packaged junk racked in the center of the store that Atkins and now Pollen have told us to avoid, are also derived from corn. Because of the way certain food products have government support, hamburgers are cheaper than fresh vegetables. Kenner focuses on a low-income Orozcos who both work and feel forced to rely on fast food meals because they fill them and their kids more economically than fresh produce bought at the market.The new industry has developed chickens that grow bigger faster with more breast meat. They're kept in closed dark pens. The story is the same for all these poor mass produced critters, crammed together in great numbers, filled with antibiotics, deformed, suffering, ankle deep in their own excrement, brutally killed. The film has good footage of the big southern meat producer, Smithfield, showing how the new mega-food industry feeds off of exploited low-wage illegal immigrants who it treats as expendable, just like the animals.An important spokesman in 'Food, Inc.' is an organic farmer (you could just say a stubbornly old-fashioned one) called Joel Salatin of Polyface Farm in Swoope, Virginia, who's also an author, though the movie doesn't mention his books. His cattle are grass-fed and watching them, we realize that's the way nature meant them to be. They roams free, living a healthy life, trimming back the grass while fertilizing it so it will grow back. Cattle weren't meant to live on corn, and doing so has led to infection. The industry solution to such problems is not to change back to earlier methods, but to add more chemicals. They're doing crazy things like adding bleach to hamburger filler to keep the burgers from being poison.It's hard to keep a balance in such a documentary but Kenner tries. That Hispanic family is important. Slow food and organics have been a thing of the rich, as their dilemma illustrates. There could be more focus on everyday people and their difficult daily choices. The Walmart story is important too: Walmart customers are everyday people. It's easy enough for well heeled families to buy boutique produce at farmer's markets. Average Joes don't always have the time or the money for that. Also important is Barbara Kowalcyk, who works in Washington with her mother as an advocate for stricter laws. Her 2 1/2-year-old son Kevin died in 12 days from a virulent form of E. coli after eating a hamburger on vacation. She wants not sympathy but control of an indifferent industry. Carole Morison is another vivid voice: she is a southern chicken farmer who lost her contract with Perdue for refusing to switch to dark enclosed tunnel chicken coops, the latest in a series of enforced "improvements" that lead to more production at the cost of more cruelty. She also explains how the farmers in thrall to these big companies are kept in debt like indentured servants. Armed with witty, clear graphics and ironically bright color, 'Food, Inc.' has a chance of gaining more converts to "slow," organic, local food and opponents to crooked food regulation and monopolistic industry. This seems one of the most balanced and humane treatments of the subject yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After the first death, there is no other</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that foodborne diseases cause approximately 76 million illnesses, 325,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths in the United States each year. If you are the mother of two-year-old Kevin Kowalcyk who died in 2001 after eating a hamburger contaminated with E. Coli, however, statistics do not tell the story of crushing personal loss. The tragedy of Kevin's premature death spurred legislation (known as Kevin's Law) introduced by Rep. Anna G. Eshoo, D-Palo Alto, that would give the U.S. Department of Agriculture the power to close down plants that produce contaminated meat but it has failed repeatedly to pass the U.S. Congress because of opposition from the meat industry. E-Coli outbreaks and other food-safety related issues are discussed in the outstanding documentary Food, Inc., directed by Robert Kenner, a film, graphic in part, that may leave you with a severe case of indigestion. Kenner is an unabashed advocate for greater food safety and the film with commentary by Eric Schlosser (Fast Food Nation) and Michael Pollan (The Omnivore's Dilemma).attempts to convince the public of the shortsightedness of the mega-corporations that dominate the food industry and their "faster, fatter, bigger, cheaper," method of increasing profits often at the expense of public safety. Representatives from food-producing giants such as Monsanto, Smithfield, Tyson and Perdue that control our food supply were invited to be interviewed for the film but declined or did not respond to Kenner's request. According to Schlosser, "The industry doesn't want you to know the truth about what you're eating - because if you knew, you might not want to eat it." Interviewing farmers and ranchers, Kenner learned that they are mostly at the mercy of mega-corporations like Monsanto which have increased their share of the soybean market from 2% to 90% in the last decade. Monsanto developed their own custom gene for soybeans and now threaten their customers with lawsuits for patent infringement if they save their own seeds to use the next year. The film observes that part of the reason why the food industry is so hard to regulate is that many of the government officials currently assigned to watchdog roles were once employed by the companies they now monitor and notes that FDA food inspections have plummeted from 50,000 in 1972 to 9,200 in 2006. Other subjects covered are the treatment of cows that are forced to eat corn instead of grass (which then goes into Coke, high fructose corn syrup, diapers, decongestants, and batteries) and the dreadful conditions of chickens that are herded into darkened cages before they are slaughtered. On that subject, Kenner interviews Carole Morrison who was unwilling to jam her chickens into cages without sunlight and, as a result, had her contract canceled by a giant chicken conglomerate who refused to have any further business dealings with her. Also discussed are the growing rates of diabetes in young people, the soaring incidence of obesity, and the use of low paying illegal immigrants to work in the food processing industry.In spite of the horror stories, however, Food, Inc. is not depressing and Kenner seems more interested in educating the public than frightening them. He shows that people can make a difference by citing the tobacco industry as well as the efforts of an entrepreneur from Stonyfield Farms who sold his line of organic products to Wal-Mart and a Virginia farmer who insists on raising animals with dignity and respect. To the strain of Bruce Springsteen singing Woody Guthrie's "This Land is Your Land", advice on how individuals can make a difference include ? buy locally, shop in farmer's markets where possible, seek out quality and organic products even if they cost a bit more, and be sure to read the labeling to learn where a product comes from and the ingredients it contains. Food, Inc. by itself may not be the catalyst that will preserve our health and well being and make food taste the way it did fifty years ago, but it is an important start and should be seen by anyone who eats, that means all of us. As the director puts it, "I think we're beginning to see the dangers of this inexpensive food that these big agribusinesses are producing. And the more we can see the cracks in this system, the faster it's going to fall apart. I'm hoping that this film can help people to start to think about it?People are becoming much more conscious of their food, and the more we think about it, the more good food we're going to get." I'll vote for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Documentaries I have seen in a while, and Canada can learn a lot from this mess....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did you know that it only takes 48 days for a chicken to go to market. Is this natural? This film explores how food is grown, and the concerns that people have, such as the e-coli outbreak that seems to happen every year. I am a lover of meat, but after this film you will want to change some of your practices like switching to Organic etc. This film also explores demand for certain products that are not Genetically modified.We all have to eat but we can make decisions based on facts, instead of based on perception. People need to be aware that their consequences may have dire repercussions, so if you need to eat, and we all do, then go out and see this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>stuff to know, whether you like it or not... if you like it, I don't know what to do for you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Food, Inc is essential viewing even though it's not a great movie. Much like An Inconvenient Truth its facts and accumulation of information trumps style or overall craft. This doesn't mean that the director isn't making a bad film or doesn't have some clever visual cues and transitions or know how to combine interviews and archival footage, since he does. But it's the precious interviews he gets, and just leaving the theater knowing that American food (or just stretching worldwide) is run by four corporations and that the farming industry as is advertised as "the American Farmer" is in deep trouble.It's separated into sections, and each one has something interesting. The one that got to me personally was the section on chickens, how they, like cows as well, are genetically engineered to get bigger a lot faster than they used to, and how the working conditions are at best hazardous and at worst untenable. We see one woman interviewed, the only one who bucked her corporate bosses, to let the cameras in to the state of the chicken coop. Even if one hasn't seen a regular chicken coop before, the state of this place, the stark and dark mis-en-scene, gives us a picture of how it is. As someone like myself who likes a good piece of chicken every now and again, it made me about as guilty as imaginable.But perhaps that's part of the point of Food, Inc - get us informed to the point where we're scared s***less. The downside may be the reach; while Inconvenient Truth had the boost of a Vice President, the big names in this documentary are authors, one of which wrote Fast Food Nation (and, surprisingly, eats a hamburger on camera, from a diner of course, and speaks about how burger and fries are some of his favorite food to eat despite the horrors of the fast food industry). So it's difficult to say how many people will see this who don't already have some idea about the atrocious conditions in slaughterhouses, the outbreaks of E-Coli that affect countless people including little Kevin as seen in the film, and Monsanto's patent of a soybean seed that they genetically altered. Between that last part alone and a little factoid made about Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas, it's no wonder one leaves the theater flabbergasted.There is some hope the film provides, however. A Virginia farmer, who treats all of his livestock with care and feeds them right (not copious amounts of CORN, which, by the way, is practically coming out of your ears as you read this), gives a few moments to reflect on how the ideal of the American farmer, of what they can give to the community and how they can try and be reasonable with having to do the inevitable of killing living things for food. Hell, the director even has Wal-Mart's one really good moment in the documentary sun in years with its endorsement of organic products. But whatever you're own persuasion on food- be you a hardcore vegan or someone just coming from McDonalds before the movie starts- Food, Inc can make some sort of difference, if only for the information. I know I may not stop eating certain foods, but I'll never forget to give another look or a double take on what's in it- or what may not be there at all. This movie is good, valuable stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Food, Inc.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recall a story where a teacher had tasked her students to draw a picture of a chicken for art class, and to her surprise, one of them drew a chicken fillet. I suppose the point here is that we've become so detached from the origins of our food sources, save for the form they take when already in the supermarkets, cured and prepared with ready to cook/eat processes becoming the norm of our daily lives. And with periodic cases of food scares and poisoning, this film takes a look throughout the food chain of today, and although it's rather US-centric, it still has plenty of relevance here since after all, we import almost everything.With technological research applied to our food sources, be it the humble grain or to the meat to satisfy all us omnivores out there, the drive of course is to produce enough to feed all the mouths, although sometimes things get done out necessity, and spiral out of control when the pressure's there to produce food that can grow faster, fatter, and to shorten the time it takes to get to the dining table.Directed by Robert Kenner, this is a documentary that followed some of the points that you would have become familiar with in films like Fast Food Nation, whose writer also provided an interview and laid the foundations of our predicament quite squarely on the MacDonald brothers, who had revolutionized the way food gets prepared, presented, and sourced. Kenner cleverly sections the film into digestible chunks, each focused on aspects of the food chain and the products themselves. The stark images and footage on how animals are treated as products in an assembly line subjected to the mass production (killing) process, will definitely shock you into thinking ? that cannot be right, nor humane. Will it make you swear off meat? Probably.In fact, the picture got painted in very bleak terms, where food conglomerates continue to grow in size and profits, resulting in the power they have over consumers, politicians and the likes, where choice and options are but a facade on shelves because the brands and products all belong to common parents. Corporations exists for profits, and are not responsible for consequences arising from their drive to make money. Everything else that resulted from that drive, whether or not a negative impact on society and human lives, can be considered collateral in their goal to feed the earth, and profit from it. Naturally, none of the conglomerate representatives wanted to be interviewed for the film, and that comes with no surprise, especially when their underhanded tactics in dealing with opposition, and corrupt practices get exposed through hidden cameras.And in some ways, the film too makes you feel a little guilty for being part of the fuel on the demand side of things. With demand comes the opportunity to supply, and make money, and corporate social responsibility is still something relatively new as a buzzword that has plenty of room to be translated into action.But the film is not all noise in complaining and presenting a doomsday scenario, and that's where the film earned merits in providing workable alternative solutions rather than just barking up a tree. It balanced the issues on what we could do, and engages the audience to be catalyst for change, making one realize that one has the power to skew demand to more acceptable methods of production, rather than one bred on convenience. It's not all serious nature here, as Kenner does inject enough well-placed humour into the documentary so that it doesn't come off as too heavy-handed in treatment, in pointing the loaded guns of blame onto others.Food, Inc. is an incredible documentary about where our food comes from, and for those without an inkling of knowledge, it would be worthwhile to sit through this film and get some enlightenment. More importantly of course, is to take action to prevent our stomachs from becoming just repositories for Salt, Fat and Sugar. Highly Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Faster, fatter, bigger, cheaper." A farmer describes fast food folly.Although I would like to call Food, Inc. a horror film, I must relax my delicate eating sensibilities to call it a disturbing documentary. Images of little chickens hanging like laundry on conveyor cables above fast-moving assembly lines and cows patiently standing knee high in feces have changed my attitude toward grilling.Robert Kenner's Food, Inc. isn't half the fun of a Michael Moore doc in which the infamous director savages everyone from auto execs to neocons. Kenner is more credible because he doesn't viciously pursue any one official, just the food industry itself (and McDonald's more than any other), which has become oligarchic and impersonal, endangering the quality and safety of consumers. Unlike Moore, Kenner has no sense of humor.Like almost all documentarians, Kenner smartly offers ways to change the barbaric methods and marketing of food. In truth too little praise is given to the food giants that have provided good nutrition and cheaper food in an amazing harvesting that can feed the world. Narrator/interviewer Eric Schlosser (Fast Food Nation) and scientist Michael Pollan (UC Berkeley) modestly present their cases for food abuse such as the demand in corporations like McDonalds for "faster, fatter, bigger, cheaper." On the point of treating animals with kindness, the documentary has encouraged me to consider vegetables.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a food monoculture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Kenner's movie is a perfect illustration of F. William Engdahl's book 'Seeds of Destruction', which explains how international agribusinesses are trying to monopolize vertically and horizontally (and profit from) food production on a world scale.The world's food chain is built mainly on heavily subsidized and, therefore, cheap corn. In fact, all humans chew corn the whole day long from bread over meat (all animals are fed with corn) to deserts and drinks. Transnational corporations are even trying to learn fish to eat corn. Corn becomes nearly a food monoculture. A particular transnational company even developed through genetic engineering highly efficient corn seed which it patented, thereby creating a nearly seed monopoly. Buyers cannot use the produce of the seeds as plant seed for future harvests. The company's own inspection force controls with hawk eyes that its clients buy new genetically modified seed every year. Some of the company's supporters and former directors occupy key positions in US governments and government administrations (FDA).The movie shows the disastrous effects of intensive farming on animals, as well as the health and environmental risks of diminished standards at livestock farming and slaughtering houses. Fortunately, some biological farmers show more respect for their animals and for their clients.At the end of the movie, the makers give a perfect list of recommendations for those wishing to eat 'healthy' food.This movie is a must see for all those who want to understand the world we live in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With family run farms pretty much a thing of the past, institutional farming has pretty much taken over,and the dim,dark &amp; dismal effects are omnipresent. There is an epidemic of food borne illness,due to cattle being exposed to over use of steroids to make them grow fatter, faster (and this also includes chickens,pigs,etc.),not to mention GMO corn,grains,etc. Robert Kenner's eye opening film, 'Food,Inc.' manages to shine at least some light on some pretty unethical practices that are being undertaken by corporate owned &amp; managed farms. The likes of Eric Schlosser (author of 'Fast Food Nation',which was made into a semi fictional film a few years back)is featured in interviews,along with Michael Pollan. Many fingers are pointed at guilty parties doing the dirty deeds of the farming industry,along with some pretty unpleasant footage of unethical practices (i.e. abuse of farm animals, although this film doesn't take up any kind of vegetarian/vegan agenda of it's own---the viewer can make up their own mind just what they prefer to eat). Much to my surprise,there is little discussion of the mad cow disease epidemic (or,BSE)from a few years back (only a passing reference). Rated PG by the MPAA,this film contains some unpleasant footage of animal abuse,as well as a rude word,or two. Okay for older children who care about what's on their plate for breakfast,lunch or dinner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there is any truth to the saying "you are what you eat", then the USA is in big trouble. You don't have to be a doctor, farmer or a nutritionist to see that way too many Americans are fat.Not big boned.Not with glandular problems.Not with genetic predispositions.Just fat, plain and simple.But, like trying to buy clothing that has no connection to Asian sweatshops or any product not directly connected to oil; finding wholesome foods that are delicious and nutritious is difficult.After seeing the documentary Food, Inc. if you are planning to go to dinner, you may find your appetite suppressed or at the very least, you will reconsider your choice of restaurants.Food, Inc. from writer/director Robert Kenner is a documentary that looks at the huge corporate run food industry and how, through a series of small, not even necessarily conscious steps, they have become purveyors of cheap food that is no longer wholesome, nutritious or even tasty, and how the big food corporations are now making more money than they ever have before at any time.But the real price is paid by us, the consumers. We pay for it in a significantly greater risk of food borne illness and in generally poor health from crappy products that are way too high in fat, sugar and salt.Now, anyone familiar with Eric Schlosser's book Fast Food Nation or Michael Pollan's book The Omnivore's Dilemma is already familiar with many of the arguments put forth in Food, Inc. Both Eric Schlosser and to a larger extent, Michael Pollan were consultants on the making of this film and they appear in on screen interviews as well, but reading about the unsanitary conditions chickens are raised in is one thing; actually seeing them is another.Food, Inc. makes the point that if you only look at the picture labels of food items in the supermarket and take them at face value, you would think that your bread, meat, cereals and dairy products are all made on small farms by happy wholesome farmers.Food, Inc. shatters that delusion absolutely, completely and totally. Unless you actually buy your food from a farmer directly at his farm or roadside stand, you are getting over-processed crap from huge conglomerates who make more money now than at any time in American history, yet they are providing us consumers with more crap (literally in many cases) than at any other time.The big food conglomerates all say that the public have irrational ideas about where their food comes from and that's why they don't want anyone to see how they actually raise the crops and animals that feed us and they are right. If people saw the truth about where what they were putting into their mouths came from, there would be riots.Food, Inc. tries to show us that truth and it is hard to swallow, even though director Kenner presents his material in a calm and straightforward manner.I was particularly disturbed by a sequence where a meat processing company, in order to cut down on E-Coli bacteria in their product mixed their meat with another product that was simply ground beef and bleach, yes bleach, combined with beef to kill the bacteria.This made more sense to the food company than finding a way to cut down on the amount of cow feces mixed into the beef to begin with. Something is definitely wrong when my hamburger has to be mixed with Clorox to be safe.Contrary to what the food conglomerates think, there is no mental disconnect between the public knowing that the cows and chickens raised on farms for food are going to be killed, but no reasonable person wants to see any individual animals suffer unnecessarily.Seeing these big food conglomerates penning up animals hoof deep in their own excrement, chickens packed to the point of suffocation and force fed vitamins and antibiotics to make them grow abnormally fast and large and don't even think about the pigs, they seem to get the worst treatment of all.In the case of beef, it is almost a complete monopsony. Since McDonald's is probably the single largest purchaser of beef in the USA (maybe the world) as the single buyer, they pretty much have control of the market. Therefore, they can demand that anyone who sells them beef conform to their standards for meat.What's good about this is it makes for a uniform product.What's bad about this is it makes for a uniformly bad product.This is why a Big Mac tastes exactly the same in California as it does in New Jersey. I for one don't think that's a positive outcome.But Food, Inc. is not just a lecture on the horrors in hamburger. The film actually provides you with some options on better eating that are easy to follow and can make you feel empowered. We don't have to be passive consumers, there are things we as individuals can do to make sure we get the good food we deserve.But there are some moments in Food, Inc. that are truly sickening and I don't mean the shots of sick "downer cows" being ground up into Big Mac meat or the deformed chickens who can't even stand because of their unnaturally large breasts, no the moments that are the most sickening come from the all too human food industry Public Relations douche bags.Hearing their convoluted double-talk about how the conglomerates well funded attempts to fight having to label where their food products actually come from or whether they have been irradiated or have been genetically modified and how all of this is really just the food companies fighting for your right as a consumer to choose, is more nauseating than a mouthful of fecal contaminated cow slurry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depressing and Disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I got back home from watching the utterly depressing documentary Food Inc., I booted up my computer to check my email, and the first headline I saw on the news site I use as my homepage, was a report on an outbreak of E. coli. The bacteria were apparently found in a sample of that vital staple of the modern American diet, chilled cookie dough. At that point, some dozen or so people were sick. I'm not sure which type of E. coli this report referred to specifically, but it seems there is a modern type of E. coli which causes internal bleeding in its victims, is often fatal and apparently didn't exist until we started pumping cattle full of corn (instead of grass or hay) to fatten them up faster. One of the film's most compelling 'stars' was a mother whose toddler died of E. coli infection after eating some hamburgers.To be honest, Food Inc. didn't really tell me anything I didn't know already, which is why I didn't give it 10. Meat production is no longer about happy smiling farmers chewing on straws, beside their plump, warm-bodied cows in sun filled, grassy fields. Or even about Marlboro smoking cowboys riding the range on trusty steeds, to round up stray mavericks while the sun sets over the western horizon. It's about feces encrusted cattle jammed cheek by jowl into manure filled feed lots, mile after mile after smelly mile, while we pump them full of subsidized corn, growth hormones and antibiotics and process them like so many slabs of raw industrial protein. And when we do process them, (a job usually carried out by cheap immigrant labor because none of us squeamish meat eaters want to do the job) the manure randomly falls off the cattle's hides and onto the meat where it festers until we cook it ? or fail to cook it ? and eat it. But don't worry, soon we may have a way to make sure no nasty bacteria remain on the meat?.we're going to wash it all with another chemical to kill the bugs ( I forget?but was that REALLY caustic soda - sodium hydroxide? - Lovely eh?) Food Inc. doesn't just look at beef production, although that's probably the most compelling part of the film, because watching a mother try to recover from the death-by-food-poisoning of her toddler, by turning into Erin Brokovich and taking on the might of the food industry AND the government, is fairly riveting stuff. Food Inc. also looks at the chicken industry, GMO soy beans, and the ludicrous subsidies that have made nutritionally poor fast food far, far cheaper than anything remotely healthy. Like fruit and veg, whole grains or humanely produced meat. And not only that, the subsidies have underwritten the cost of grain exports (via NAFTA) to the extent that producers in developing countries can no longer compete in their home markets, putting farmers in places like Mexico out of work. So what do they do? They migrate ? often illegally ? to the USA to work in meat processing plants.And if you are a farmer trying to grow non GMO soy beans ? or any crop really ? please don't be silly enough to do it anywhere downwind of a GMO field, because if stray pollen happens to land in your field, and the mighty seed company finds evidence of their genes on your patch of ground, boy are you in trouble. Quite how you keep your crop GMO free under these circumstances is beyond me. But should anyone out there want non GMO food ? well we can always import it from another country. And we do. Meanwhile Big Seed is putting out of business a centuries old small industrial practice that helps farmers save seed from year to year. If this were happening overseas, we would call it fascism.And in this manner, following individual cases, Michael Pollan (author of the excellent Omnivore's Dilemma) and maker of Fast Food Nation Eric Schlosser, show us how food production has strayed from being about producing, well, food, and has become a huge industrial operation controlled by a frighteningly small number of big businesses. Never mind Eisenhower's 1961 warning about the Military Industrial Complex. Why did no one warn us about the Agricultural Industrial Complex? The European Union's past obsession with industrializing food production is at least understandable given the horrendous WW2 shortages which led to rationing which continued for years after the war. But when did America ever have rationing? Truly a frightening and depressing movie. I'm a lucky middle class person. I have a garden where I grow veggies and I can afford to buy organic eggs and meat. I know not everyone can. But there must be some way to break this ludicrous vicious circle. When we see the people who are now existing on fast food use money they could ? and should ? be spending on fruit and veg to instead pay for their prescription drugs to treat the diseases they get ? from eating fast food ? something snaps in my head and I wonder if the whole world is totally and utterly bonkers? And on it goes.But, as the small scale organic farmer said as he processed some home grown chickens and pigs through his family run business (where people come to buy genuinely farm raised, grass fed meat after a 3 or 4 hour drive), "Don't say you can't afford $3 a dozen for organic eggs when you're standing there with a 75c can of coke in your hands?.." Exactly. Eat less ? mostly greens as Michael Pollan (approximately) says.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant exposé of food industry cover-up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Food Inc. is the new brilliant documentary which should shock all Americans about what has become of our food supply. It begins with the camera slowly panning through a supermarket, focusing on row after row of sanitized food products. The point is made that there are only a few multi-national corporations who actually produce the vast majority of food products seen on our supermarket shelves today. They seek to lull a complacent public into believing that the food we eat is wholesome and is produced in the simple spirit of our agrarian forefathers. Of course, we soon see that their marketing seeks to cover up a much more sinister reality.Food Inc. first focuses on chicken production. The filmmakers got a hold of one chicken producer who raises chickens for Tyson Foods, perhaps the largest poultry provider in the country. The chicken producer was more than willing to show his behind-the scenes-operation until he was told by Tyson to shut up. It's obvious they didn't want him to show how the chickens were raised?thousands of them shut up in a building devoid of sunlight and being fed with cheap corn products to fatten them up. Today's chickens were contrasted with the chickens of yesteryear and today they are twice the size. They were able to interview a woman who raised chickens for Perdue. She apparently was fed up and refused to go along with Perdue's directives to raise her chickens using mass production techniques. But even with her more humane efforts, many of her chickens were dying due to antibiotic resistance. The woman herself indicated that she had developed health problems as a result of contact with these antibiotics. One of the film's revelations I wasn't aware of, was that these small businessmen are at the mercy of the conglomerates and if they don't do what they say, they'll be put out of business.Another segment involves a food safety crusader who lost her three year old to E Coli contamination after eating a tainted hamburger. She sponsors "Kevin's Law", named after her fallen son but gets little support in Congress due to the lobbying efforts of the food industry who have prevented passage of the bill.More shocking revelations abound including an extended segment on just how pervasive corn has not only been utilized as a cheap source of food for livestock (leading to the proliferation of manure that gets into our food supply) but also how it's used to create new processed food with little nutritional value. We also meet a lower middle-class Hispanic family who can't avoid eating fast food even though they're aware how unhealthy it is for them. The father is suffering from early onset Diabetes which is becoming one of the fastest growing health problems linked to eating unhealthy meals of processed food. The family not only doesn't have the time to shop for better foods but they don't have the money?so they end up going to McDonald's instead.Immigrant workers are also exploited by the multinationals who used to recruit farmers in Mexico who could no longer compete against the big food producers in the U.S. They shipped the workers here in droves where they're now economically dependent on these corporations despite working in horribly unsanitary conditions. Now with anti-immigrant sentiment running wild, a few token workers are rounded up everyday to appease the public and the corporations are never charged with hiring illegal help.The most shocking information we learn is the role of Monsanto Corporation monopolizing the soybean market. As a result of a Supreme Court decision, Monsanto now holds a 'patent' on their genetically modified soybean. They've ended up destroying the careers of small farmers by suing them for violation of their patents (Monsanto's soybean ends up as part of the farmers' crop so they're accused of infringement). What's worse is the long line of government officials, former Monstanto employees, who are now (and have been) in the highest positions in the Food and Drug Administration responsible for food safety oversight. Ten years ago, there were 50,000 food safety inspections a year?last year the FDA only authorized 9,000. And these officials weren't only appointed during the Bush administration. President Clinton also had a healthy share of these former Monsantoites working at the FDA.While Monsanto is clearly the biggest villain among many, Food Inc. attempts to highlight more productive people in the 'system'. One interview focuses on an organic livestock producer who feeds his cattle grass and not corn. While it's clear he treats his livestock better than the conglomerates, I'm not a believer in the idea of 'compassionate slaughter'. Why eat meat at all? There's also an interview with the president of Stonyfield Farms, famous for organic yogurt. He ended up selling out to Walmart but he feels it was a good thing since 'better' products were made available to the public on a mass scale. Again, the sale of any kind of dairy products (organic or not) is not a good thing in the long run for one's health. Food Inc. attempts to end on an optimistic note. It's up to the consumer to choose more healthy food. The example of successful consumer action is cited in the case of the tobacco industry which was brought down after the public woke up to the deleterious effects of its products. Until the public is willing to look behind the veil of unhealthy food production in this country, they will continue to enjoy bad meals at McDonald's and other nefarious 'restaurants'. Food Inc. is one of those rare documentaries which can open peoples' eyes?and that's not easy to do!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary does a good job educating the consumers on how food is produced,packed and marketed in U.S nowadays. By going back repeatedly to how it was before it shows us how much it has evolved and also the effects of those drastic changes on food prices, American eating habits and ultimately on their health. The movie does all that without ever going over the top or becoming apocalyptic, which seems to be a trend for these type of movies nowadays,it does call out the greedy mega food corporation and the state officials for not arming the regulatory agencies better but the consumers are also at fault here for not informing themselves enough on the content of the products in order to choose what's best for their health not just for their wallet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Food, Inc. The Movie Brilliant eye opener is all I can say. Food scares, Government controlled (no surprise there), extremely informative and captivating are words I'd use to describe this movie/documentary.My family and I have been aware of the benefits of good food for years. I've even turned a few times to veganism but every so often my body craved animal protein so I'd respect it. As a result, I wouldn't call myself a vegetarian (maybe part time if that's still respectable). My family however has remained meat eaters. My choice there has always been protein from poultry. I do not eat beef or pork. Again, it isn't something that is eaten on a daily basis in our family anyway. Variety is the key.We wanted to watch the movie however were scared (as a lot of people I'm sure) that we'd never want to eat meat again. It actually didn't do that at all. What it's changed is where we buy meat and who we choose to support. Regarding the corn situation, it's always been a concern due to corn intolerance in some of us. The corn story told in the movie had a major impact on my partner. He was so angry at how Mexicans were unfairly and poorly treated. Working in the meat packing industry himself, he knows the dedication and hard work it requires from their workers. Oddly enough we don't eat products from his company so hush? don't tell anyone?lol Lastly, we are talking about getting a Blue Ray DVD player next year. Although we don't have it yet; my first blue ray DVD that I will get for myself, despite all the great movies available, is this movie. Even the kids 7-9-11 loved it and watched with great attention.It had a huge impact on me and my health (IBS). With all the new changes in our diet and lifestyle I feel so much better now than I have in the last 20 years since I was diagnosed when I was 14 years old. This movie is not just about the meat and the corn but it's about all foods and the impact on ourselves, our planet and future.Thanks to everyone who worked on this film.Best regards, Pascal Labillois Toronto, Canada</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is broken into segments ranging from the seed, farmer, product, animal, FDA etc.Each segment could easily be an hour and half movie. I could understand that may be a little overwhelming, for that I would recommend watching another documentary "King Corn" first which is about corn.I found the "King Corn" knowledge helpful because "Food Inc" is so crammed with info that little things like why we grow so much corn and soybeans are just mentioned as subsidies without delving into too much detail. "King Corn" will fill in these gaps.However subsidies aside "Food Inc" is quite impressive in showing the Tyrannical Empire our food industries have become and how they control the farmer, the seed, the worker and even how they are regulated.Fantastic film.I would also recommend "The Real Dirt on Farmer John" it's a bit of a biography but entertaining and informative about how locally grown healthy food is not out of your reach.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Food inspections dropped dramatically under the Bush administration. I'm shocked. What would you expect when you appoint someone from the food industry to head the agency that inspects food.Food is big business now. There are few small family farms,; most food is grown according to spec. You do it the way the food giants tell you or you are out of business.I used to live where 25% of the beef in America is fattened. There were one million cows a year coming through a town of 15,000. They stood all day in ankle-deep shite.And, don't try to diss the industry or their lawyers will come at you like a ton of bricks. It was fun to see everyone trying to get on the taping of the Oprah show while she was in town being sued. She can afford big time lawyers that you and I can't.An interesting question: Why can you buy a double cheeseburger at McDonald's for 99 cents, and you can't buy a pound of broccoli for that price? Not all food questions are answers, but there is enough information here that you will be an informed consumer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There have been many documentaries to hit the scene in the past few years that have impacted its audiences in one way or another. Some of become a cultural phenomenon and have hit home especially because it's been things we have experienced either first handed or we ourselves deem them "important." Fahrenheit 9/11, Bowling for Columbine, Super Size Me, and even March of the Penguins are things that we "think" our government places up on top of their priority lists and our filmmakers of today are tackling. I will say this, and I can't see myself saying it again for some time; this is the most terrifying and important documentary I have seen in years.Telling of the hypocrisy and nearly despicable life we lead everyday because of what corruption does and how far it goes up in our society, Food Inc tackles the subject of the food industry in a way I've never experienced before. There are so many important points that the picture makes, telling them in a film review wouldn't be enough nor do it justice. I can't explain it thoroughly or good enough for any of you to understand. Just know, according to the film, we are living as prisoners in a very scary country. The economy is bad but this has been going on long before it turned downward. This will definitely make you think twice before placing another piece of anything in your mouth.The film, directed by Robert Lenner, explores all sides of the spectrum. Forget Democrats, Republicans, all of them, this film shows how everybody's hands are dirty. From a death of a child, to a certain governor of California vetoing something that could have changed our perspective on food forever, Food Inc. Tells it all. In the most beautiful and simplistic style of documentary film-making I have seen all year, Kenner's keen eye to detail and structure of the picture is extraordinary. The Documentary Oscar SHOULD belong to Food Inc. period.Food Inc is so brutal in its delivery yet it remains fundamentally important the entire film. Cheaper food is not the bargain but this food for thought is. Food Inc. is one of the best films of the year.****/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ready to eat? You might think a little bit more about how your food got to your plate. Good doc that's interesting and informative.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We've all heard and know the dangers of food in this country from hearing news health reports and seeing films like "Super Size Me" and reading books like "Fast Food Nation" who's author appears in this film. Yet still we Americans love the good old sweet, and sugar and delicious taste of food that's put in our supermarkets and restaurants. However after watching this doc "Food, Inc." you will think a little bit more about what your eating the next time as this film shows the wicked process that many foods go thru before they reach your mouth. Most chilling is how the industry is controlled by corporations who are more interested in profit and making money than people's health.Starting off it shows and even interviews many chicken farmers who tell the horrifying tales of how chickens are hit and injected with steroid to be made bigger and fatter before slaughter so that it's more tasty and fatter when it hits the plate of a hungry mate. Also interesting and yet gross is how cows are shot up with hormones and then given the ever popular and tasty corn syrup before they are butchered. This all happens before they are processed to meat which due to the injections and chemical infections causes cases of death and other food sickness from being poisoned to catching diseases. Most disturbing is the words from a mother who lost a young son after he eat three hamburgers and became infected with death.Still you see during the film it's an on going fight with the food industry as it's powerful and very cunning for the very way that they fight traditional farmers by making them use their own corporate chemical seed. As one farmer is nearly bankrupt in his lawsuit against a company as he tries to save his own plantings of original seed. And still as many fight and lobby congress many from the food giant companies are lobbyist and heads of committees and with their interactions with politicians always bills are passed in favor for the food companies.Too the industry is clever as it's use of corn syrup in everything makes for the need to make those products more cheap than lets say organic food or home grown. And you see how the food factories work their workers to death for low wages too as they profit more from the more beef that's butchered with fewer employees.This film is interesting and informative it shows just how greedy and money hungry the food industry is. As money is put over health, it was interesting to see how the process of food is done and very revealing was the premium the industry puts on corn syrup. And very cruel to see was the slaughter of pigs, cattle, and chicken yet even more cruel was the injections and feeding of corn and hormones before slaughter. Yet the film does show hope by showing the world of organic food, and it encourages us to lobby congress for better food laws. Most telling was that of a Virginia farmer who still raises food the old fashion way with environment and grass weed he stays away from the process of high tech injections. Good doc that will make you feel guilty the next time you eat, as when you buy out of the supermarket next or take that bite off of your plate you will think about the corrupt and nasty way it was processed even though it still taste juicy and sweet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Food for thought that's not too tough on the stomach</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Kenner's documentary "Food, Inc." sounds like something you've heard of before. When Eric Schlosser's book "Fast Food Nation" first woke America up to the horrific way that fast food meat is processed and Morgan Spurlock's documentary "Super Size Me" exposed the deadly health concerns of too much fast food, most Americans began to associate fast food with unhealthy food. The organic food movement began to take off and most well- educated Americans began to take what's in their food more seriously. But it hasn't been enough -- "Food, Inc." breaks down why in this highly educational investigative film.The documentary highlights the problem on a corporate scale. Although we appear to have a wealth of options at the supermarket, just because we're not buying from the big companies or going to the fast food restaurants as much doesn't mean we're not buying from the same process. The food industry has changed so much over the last 50 years because of the big companies that the way cattle, chicken and pigs are raised have completely changed. The battle for healthier and safer food goes beyond choosing fast food.Kenner visits chicken farmers who are basically controlled by the big industry names. Not moving toward more engineering and efficiency is cause for loss of contract. These farmers are constantly in debt to meet these standards imposed by the major brands and thus have to meet them in order to work out of debt. He talks to a soybean cleaner being run out of business by Monsanto, the company that engineered a pesticide-resistant soybean and won the right to enforce that patent so that no farmer could save an unused engineered bean.The strength of the food lobby and the business people making the policy decisions in government is incredible. Kenner shows us how protected they are, reminding us of when Oprah was sued for saying she wouldn't eat another burger on her show and had to fight forever before winning the case. The disconnect between the decision-makers and the farmers is vast."Food, Inc." also tries to inform us as much as possible for ways to instigate change, rather than let us be completely overwhelmed by the apparent lack of control both the public and farmers have over food production. There are people out there fighting (such as the mother- turned-advocate of a boy who died of e.coli infection) and there's proof that consumer choice can drive even the giants like Wal-Mart to do things like only provide milk from cows without growth hormone. It also doesn't lean on the many possible gross-out factors. If you've been eating processed meat all your life, you won't come out of this film saying "I'm going to be a vegetarian," but you'll be wiser when it comes to your food purchases and who you support (namely organic and local brands) when you are at the grocery store.Food production has changed so much that it feels like "Food, Inc." is opening up a huge can of worms in terms of just how much is wrong with the process, but the awareness that it will create in each of its viewers is enough to justify the documentary's broad scope.~Steven C Visit my site at http://movimusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Food, Inc. is an essential film that might truly be the start of change in our country. The film seems like it is one-sided, but ultimately the film tried to gather more points of views from companies and from workers, but they all declined to give interviews. While the film does not present issues that we are not already familiar with, it did teach me new facts. I was surprised to learn that Corn makes up most products, and how E-Coli is the result of the cows being fed corn, and how a young child died from being contaminated with E-Coli from burgers. The film is an essential viewing for everyone, and while we have heard some of these things before, it opens our eyes even more. I, for once, will actually start looking at all my food products and will be more careful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was another documentary a few years ago similar to this one called "The Future of Food". They're very similar. This one is also pretty good and produced by Eric Schlosser who wrote "Fast Food Nation". He's also in the movie as a talking head. Some of the same questions are asked. What happens when a few large corporations control our food? Why is our food becoming less and less safe? The answers are pretty much the same. Government agencies like the FDA in the US have been corrupted by the food industry itself. Insiders are now in government and have no interest in more regulations.What happens when the main motivation for anything becomes money and nothing else? The system no longer provides any benefit to the people it's supposed to. But what's more important than our food? It's one example of a corrupted system where we're being held hostage. Organic foods are available for those who can afford them. It's still not enough though.Many of these organic food companies have also now been acquired by big food corporations like Kraft. I don't see it working out as the soul of the original company will disappear in the name of greater profit.Part of the problem with these mega food corporations is that they're so large that safety and a quality product are no longer feasible.The documentary is pretty good. Informative and well made. It's good to see Schlosser in another movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I put 10/10 because this information is invaluable. And it's about time a major distributor has taken on such topics. The food industry certainly has it's reasons, especially the almighty dollar, and to be fair I think this movie kept that into perspective. Yet demonetization of these multi-national organizations was inevitable because of the undesirable effects of such gross over production.The movie was tactful and at times utterly horrifying. To me, this was nothing new. The movie lacked essential information, was riddled with questionable assertions, contained a few logical fallacies, and was completely adulterated with naturalistic philosophy. It also tows the global warming line as well. Aside from it's shortcomings, it is going to be powerful in its own right to those who are new to the subject.With such backing and credibility, hopefully this can reach those in the darkness. Our modern social climate is inundated with massive propaganda, so much that many have began to seek answers amidst the chaos. To those I hope this is but a small step to a much larger journey. In all assurances, the rabbit hole is much deeper.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While most documentaries purport to be non-biased, some clearly are not. Most of Michael Moore's films come to mind as films with a specific agenda other than non-biased information- sharing. Food, Inc. also joins this category.The movie documents the many ways that modern food production has shifted from the smaller farms and the like, to large mechanized, automated production facilities. The film demonizes the large corporations that own these operations, because you know all large corporations are evil. The film also bypasses the fact that such increased efficiencies result in lower cost of such food. Because of these intentional oversights which would be countermeasures to the clear thesis intended, I cannot recommend this film.That being said though, I doubt that I will ever eat another mass-produced hamburger again after seeing this movie. Sure, the film presents the worst version of such mass-production, but since one cannot tell whether the mass-produced burger (or chicken or pork ) came from such a facility, you will find yourself thinking twice as well before taking a bite.</fullReview>

Unfortunately although at the first thought mass production of foods, and improvements in technology to help produce these foods may seem great; there are many down falls to these newly developed strategies in industry. We may think that our food comes from a 'farm', but in reality it's coming from a factory. In the meat industry, feeding methods for animals are built for speed rather than effectiveness and animals are held in extremely inhumane and unsanitary conditions. These sorts of situations are breeding grounds for dangerous microbes, which can be extremely dangerous to the human body. To show the severity of these kinds of microbes, Kenner incorporates the story of Barbara Kowalcyk in the documentary; whose 3 year old son died from a bacteria poisoning after eating a hamburger. These very unfortunate events do happen, and there is no real surprise as to why. Kenner presents statistics showing how much fewer FDA food safety inspections are being conducted in present days relative to how many were down 40 years ago. Not only do they not inspect as much, but if they do inspect and do find a problem they have no right to close the factory down. A new law, Kevin's law, is now being pushed for in order to give the FDA the right to close down these unsanitary factories.With the huge demand of meats by fast food restaurants such as McDonalds, the industries have no intentions of slowing down methods of production and changing up strategies because it will hinder their revenues. Their current methods of production are the reason why meat is so readily available, and why fast food restaurants exist. If not for such processing a 1 dollar hamburger would not be possible. But not all is well with the availability of such cheap fast food. As Kenner points out, it is cheaper to purchase a hamburger at a fast food joint than it is to buy a pound of broccoli or even a couple pears. This whole idea of cheap, unhealthy food is believed to be the underlying reason to such high obesity levels.In addition to high obesity levels also come high percentages of Type 2 diabetes. The price of corn has dropped drastically due to its mass production and government subsidization. After much research, scientists have developed methods of turning corn into many different types of sugars and chemicals that allow for cheap processing of foods. Among those corn sugars, for example, is high fructose corn syrup. This relatively new sugar has allowed for cheap production of sweet sodas, which are very often over consumed and only raising the levels of obesity both in adults and children. Statistics show that 1 in 3 Americans born after 2000 will contract early onset diabetes (Kenner, Food Inc.). This rate is even larger among minorities, most likely due to the higher percentage of poverty. Throughout the documentary Kenner tries to provide a fair trial for all the 'players' of the food industry that he examines. Unfortunately many of the meat industries observed, like Tyson or Monsanto did not agree for an interview. For this reason, I believe, they were not able to defend their perceivably unprofessional methods caught on camera. If they both were to send a representative however, the documentary would have left a more positive view of them. Tyson's chicken coops and Monsanto's slaughterhouse were given a bad reputation in the documentary for their under-par conditions. Contrary to many critical documentaries, I did not get the feeling that Kenner was biased or forcing the negative things onto the companies in terms of internal conditions. A perfect example supporting this is the entering scene to the documentary; you see one of the main speakers throughout the documentary, Eric Schlosser, eating a hamburger while mentioning that 'my favorite meal to this day remains a hamburger and french fries' (Eric Schlosser, Food Inc.) This shows that this documentary isn't aimed at building a taste aversion towards meat or trying to get the viewer to never step into McDonalds again. It is mainly aiming to build awareness of the lack of information we as consumers get about our food and where it comes from. However, I do believe that it was unnecessary to point out Monsanto's methods of employment and bring in the immigration scenes. This topic strayed from the main idea, which was supposed to be food and food production.I do believe that Kenner should have included more about specific FDA inspections and statistics. I am left with more disdain towards the FDA than I believe is necessary. Barbara's section about her child along with some short points that Kenner makes only provide a negative aspect of the FDA, but I am sure much good has been done by them in the direction of food safety and factory regulation. All in all Kenner does a great job providing the watcher with a fairly unbiased documentary teaching us that we should have a say in how the food we eat is made. Even more so, the government should step in and fight beside us the people rather than the companies, power is already in the hands of the companies; the support is needed on Our side.

		<shortDescription>More than a wake-up call</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Food, Inc. starts off strong with a curious intro that raises some questions some of us may not have asked themselves before, questions relevant even if we are not customers in America. The rest of the movie also focuses on the particular American food-production ecosystem but is applicable just about anywhere else I believe.Special props to the few intimates who stand up, and have the courage to voice their concerns, even in the face of financial destruction.Food, Inc. is a wake-up call that ideally also wants viewers to react, because it gives a strong message that the companies are not the only ones culpable. The real problem of the documentary is how to move the customer from awareness to action, and in my opinion it did a very good job at this. The documentary switches between revealing and criticizing the corrupted system, and some inspirational stories of people who stood up and acted. In the end, I was certainly convinced of the impact of our daily decisions. It's good to see the makers correctly identified the root of the problem and take pains to influence it, instead of just focusing on the sensation that revealing malpractice brings."So every scope by the immoderate use / Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue, / Like rats that ravin down their proper bane, / A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well this is the sort of movie that gets bad reviews from people who haven't seen it. How tiresome and such efforts are always so transparent especially when discussing a film that's full of surprises!This movie more than any other I've ever seen has left me anxious to look into what my options are food shopping in the big city. It's also just a beautifully made movie. I really am surprised at the "Featured" review that says it's all content and has no style/production value or whatever. The people who made this movie took enormous pains shooting it. The use of graphics is just right, the pacing is perfect. They couldn't waste any time cause there was so much to tell and they managed it beautifully, beautifully. It ends just like "Habana Holiday (Yo Soy Malo)" in that a series of pre closing-credits order you around :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Making a documentary is tricky business. Making one that takes sides is even trickier. There is no pre-existing compact for journalistic integrity and big business is almost too easy to matter. These guys find an approach that touches home. They do it in two ways I think, and the skill with which they navigate this is enough to recommend this.The first is how they found a way to get our attention. Big business is stealing from you and oppressing people. Well yeah. They buy elected officials to make laws that not only benefit themselves but do so with utter disregard for the health of the nation and its people. They are destroying the land and the populace....These are such open truths that even though everyone other than an interested party would know, it is one of those things you decide to just live with. Perhaps you even rationalize it away with some story. Who knows what, in today's myth economy? But watch, what these guys do is hit each viewer. It is not just the planet, the nation, the economy, the constitution... It is you they personally harm with every meal. And you have no escape. These guys found a way to fold in the viewer.The second thing they engineered was the finale. Most other documentaries of this type seem to aim at simply making you angry. This one goes further. Think you are powerless? You are not; you control the market. Want to do something? Do this and this and this...Compare this to "King Corn," which did a better job of actually telling you some scary facts.It almost seems comically simple. And it is almost a waste of the power of cinematic engagement to limit it to merely this. But see? The idea is to fold the viewer in by narrative engineering, and then once they have you, they change you. Now as it happens, I willingly accept this contract in this case. But I can see that this same device is being used elsewhere for goals every bit as nefarious as the offenses reported here by agribusiness.Which is the culprit? The availability of power, or its abuse?Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but thin on specifics and not as convincing as journalism should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love a good documentary and I'm all too willing to believe that corporations are stuffing us with unhealthy food. Food Inc. goes a fair way towards demonstrating this. However, I have a spider sense for propaganda, which is why I don't like Michael Moore. Propaganda emphasizes the feelings of individuals instead of talking about impact, highlights individuals instead of using solid statistics, and lets dangerous implications dangle instead of exploring them.Thus, we learn that there's far much antibiotics in chicken. Is that bad? I don't doubt it, but how? We learn that there were two e.coli outbreaks on one day of filming. Can we get statistics on how many people are hospitalized or die every year? The film says that half of all minorities born in 2000 or later will get diabetes. Firstly, that's a forecast, not a fact. But it's not sourced. Who's making that forecast? The film mentions in an off-hand way that manure gets into beef, then lets it go. How much?I personally have no problem with processed food or farmers going out of business because of market forces. Why is it a problem that farmers can't rip off Monsanto's seeds? Don't patents expire in 9 years anyway? The film doesn't connect the dots here and doesn't make a good case.For issues that I have reason to agree with, such as that crop subsidies are clearly bad, the dots aren't there either. The film stops with saying that corn products underlie most of our foods, without saying how that contributes to poor health.Ultimately, I think Food Inc. has a very compelling topic but just isn't a very clear documentary, unlike Supersize Me and An Inconvenient Truth, which get to the point. I feel educated but I also feel a little manipulated. And the final two minutes are way too preachy. It's very much like the film was not made to convince but to play to an audience that's already convinced. Ironically, one of the people interviewed (the president of Stonybrook Farms) mentions the futility of preaching to the choir.I'll give Food Inc. a 7 out of 10, sort of a wish-I-hadn't-seen-it 6 with a bonus for being on an important topic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Monsters of Monsanto</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing in this film what Monsanto is doing to the American public, our food supply, our farmers and seed cleaners is still haunting me and I can't stop thinking about it. It is shocking that we are eating genetically modified organisms and don't know it. Why hasn't the media been covering any of this??? I don't know how we would have found out this information if we didn't see this movie. I can't believe they want to feed us cloned meat with no labeling requirements!!! Monsanto is anti-life and anti-democracy, they are diabolical monstrous criminals. I think people would be protesting in the streets if they knew what this company has been doing in secret to our food. The film is worth seeing just for the information about the situation with the farmers and the stealth poisoning of our food with GMOs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Food for thought and social activism. In the film Matrix the plugged into the system human bodies were fed through the pipes the liquefied remnants of the dead ones. Of course it would be a big leap and stretch to compare with it the products the corporations create to feed the population, but it makes you think and see the metaphorical analogy.The most valuable in this film is the counter-positioning of the human vs. dehumanizing. The whole film leads to the suggestions at the end. Social activism and voting through the cash register is the main point of this important documentary. The comment by "williamzim2000" seems appallingly simpleton like, but the sophisticated one by "rasecz" misses the above point entirely as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eye-opening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to write an essay on local and organic food. As a starting point I watched this movie because it seemed to be very close to my topic. I am rating this movie an 8/10 because it is actually very eye-opening. While it may be a very biased review on the Meat packing industry because Michael Pollan is an all natural food activist, it does its job, and does it well. There are things about this movie that if you think about it, you know it is truthful. The meat packing industry does play a HUGE role in our world. The representatives from these companies are also ones that are wholly in charge in DC. They don't want the secrets of the meat industry getting out, which is why there is such little knowledge on the entire process. People know that animals are mistreated and that there are huge flaws, but by watching this film you really learn a lot about them. It is a very graphic documentary at some points, so viewer discretion is definitely recommended. All aside, this is an excellent documentary and is actually helping me to change my eating habits. Not going completely vegetarian, but eating more locally produced options, from places that I know and that I know i can trust with treating animals justly, and not using harmful chemicals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a good documentary, but not the best of all ones.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the documentary "Food, Inc," filmmaker Robert Kenner take the audience out from the dark they live in by revealing many but all of the facts concerning food industry in the USA. For instance, the documentary starts with mentioning modified food and how food industry's companies don't want us to know the truth behind what we eat, because if we try to follow our food chain we will know how this small group of people are taking the control of our food system, which often empowers them to abuse animals, American farmers, workers, the environment, and us. The documentary focuses on how such companies even got to the point where they may produce contaminated food just to achieve their major concern; making big profits. Moreover, Kenner does not satisfy with only lifting the veil on those surprising facts, however, he addresses some solutions to the consumers.On one hand, I think "Food, Inc" plays a good role in many parts that resemble its strengths. Such parts are relied in the given brief description about the mentioned companies that make it easy for the film watcher to keep up and track the documentary. In addition, "Food, many facts and shows all the related facts in details, which makes the audience feel like they are not anymore sitting in their seats. Moreover, "Food, Inc" does not satisfy with only addressing food crisis, however, it suggests steps for the audience to take. A good powerful point to add is that all the mentioned points are facts and are addressed to the audience without any bias. A major weakness I find is that the film fully focuses on American food manufacture and gives no space for any food manufacture worldwide. Not only this, however in my point of view, it doesn't even discuss all the food manufacture in the USA. Form here, we can judge that this film concentrates on some parts and does not even mention other ones which makes the film not well demonstrated. Moreover, I find that the name of the documentary does not satisfy its components. Indeed, this film gives over attention to food companies as companies and administration, and to the farmers who work in this field Such as Tyson. Moreover, I find that the film stresses too much on some material such as the death of a kid from E.coli. Furthermore, one of the major weaknesses that "Food, Inc" has is the lack of real solutions. Solutions in this film are given but are not on a deep level to make the audience take important decisions. Besides, those solutions fail to be used by numerous people that this film is addressed to.All in all, "Food, Inc" tries to draw an image about the food US. I see the film important and I encourage everyone who lives in the USA to watch this must-see documentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great informative doc</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a wide-ranging look at the world of modern food production and consumption. Since the 1950s, the farm has changed from the pastoral family-run to multi-national industrial production. The fast-food chain revolutionized consumption. The style of cheap and uniform food leads to the same philosophy spreading throughout the system from start to finish. This also looks at safety and ethnicity of the food system.This is great information being pulled together into digestible nuggets. The subject is so wide-spread that it's impressive the movie is able to be understood. It can be overwhelming but the movie keeps it all straight-forward. I would like more time explaining excessive antibiotic use but I can understand that it's too complicated. The personal stories are very effective at giving humanity to the material.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Centuries ago, our food came from, what was planted in the garden and animals that were born and raised on your own land. Now in the 21st century, most consumers don't even know where their foods are coming from or how it is being produced and made. In this documentary, it focuses on the production of animals that become meat that consumers buy from the market. This film shows the process of the animals being born and up to death. Starting from an egg and turning into chicks these chickens get injected with hormones, so they could grow faster as well as become plump so then they can be put in markets. While watching this I felt disgusted as well as thinking that it's time to raise my own animals. I felt so bad for those chickens that were injected with so many hormones that they couldn't get up and walk. This film showed so much animal cruelty towards each animal. The workers just grabbed the chickens however they wanted and treated them however. Many chickens died due to being stomped on by other chickens. Watching this made my stomach turn. This almost made me want to become a vegetarian, but I love my steak too much. Seeing these chickens get injected with hormones, and added preservatives I don't think this is good for our health. I see that this generation is starting to get sick at an earlier age, while the generation before them doesn't have a lot of health problems. I think that the hormones that are being injected into our meats are causing more and more people to get sick every day. We are what we eat, and knowing that we are ingesting foods that are being processed or injected with hormones or other chemicals we are just harming ourselves as well as our bodies, and this could affect our next generations as well. When it comes to health if I had a choice and the money I would raise my own animals and have my own farm and garden that way I know where everything came from, and be able to maintain my health. The purpose of this film in my point of view is to let Americans' and meat eaters are aware of how their food is being produce and what happens on these farms. It's to open our eyes on how much an animal has to suffer in order for someone to stay alive and survive. I guess I would call this survival of the fittest. We live in a world where surviving is all that we try to do, but I feel that as a society we waste more than and take in more than what we need to survive in this world. I feel that we are wasting a lot because on a chicken majority of people don't use the neck, feet, head, and organs. They only eat the white and dark meats. But the organs, neck, feet and head can be edible as well. This is something that needs to change, and by making this film maybe some people would be more aware of what they are eating, how much they are eating, and wasting. In conclusion, I am horrified by how these farms are organized and ran. I feel that these chickens and animals that were used in this film are so helpless. Maybe we should start doing what Japan does to their cows giving them a massage and beer so when they die it's not a waste of effort into raising them. This film was an eye opener for me. I feel that I would have to make sure that I make enough food just for that day and waste so much. I feel like I'm in the wasting category, but after this watching this film I'm going to try to maintain and decrease on my intake on meats. I think this is a film that everyone should see, some people might even become vegetarians after watching this film, but I totally recommend it. Society needs to know where their food comes from and I think this film did a great job on telling me how our food is produce before we buy it at the store.</fullReview>

It was a good watch when it came to unraveling the mystery of how many bad food processing practices came to be and how it impacts us everyday citizens. It also shines a light on the abuse of farmers and the high costs it presents. This is a very informative documentary. A good watch It is important that we know what this is about.

		<fullReview>food inc was a very nice documentary which tells us about the way the meat we eat is treated. i learned from this documentary that chicken, cows, pigs are all fed with corn which is not a good thing for them because of the fact that corn makes them grow fat and bigger. Normally cows are not supposed to be fed with corn. They are herbivores which eat grass and not corn. At least the video makes people who are interested in how the meat we consume is been treated, fed,and taken care of, be aware of. From what i was taught cows are not supposed to be feeding on corn,because they are herbivorous animals which feed on grass. Due to this overfeeding, the chickens die due to overweight, they can't walk properly.</fullReview>

The movie showed peoples story about how people had got sick from food poisoning and etc . What really shocked me was the food company who was caught with salmonella invasion in there food , they didn't even like make awareness so that other people will not get . The mother of the son who died from a disease from food they didn't really do anything about it . They continued to process there food the same way and the mother was very upset about .

		<shortDescription>Food - Inc. is a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a really good movie if you wanna learn a few things about the food industry and how much money the businesses make and how they farm their food. I learned a few things myself. If you like food, then you wanna watch this to see what you are putting in your mouth, this movie explains a lot about good food and what chemicals are on the food. E-Coli being one of them, is a harmful poisoning you can get from eating food, if you get E-Coli then that means the food company that the food you are eating is not doing part of their job, because they are suppose to put ammonia on the foods to kill all the E-Coli bacteria so nobody will get E-Coli anymore. I recommend this movie for anyone who likes food, or wants to work in the food industry so that they will know what they will be up against and how much money you will make.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really loved the movie . it was good , they should make a part 2. the movie taught me a lot the movie allowed me to consider what Im putting into my body The film posits that the industry doesn't want us to know the truth; Pollan states that there is even an effort afoot to make it illegal to publish photos of any industrial food operation. Yet despite the fact that the subject matter could easily lend itself to a grim, preachy or even alarmist attitude, Food, Inc. succeeds by engendering an uplifting spirit of hope in its audience. The film documents how government agencies act in collusion with agri- business, and have gradually eroded the stringency applied to regulations and inspections. This comes as no surprise as we are shown a parade of individuals who graduated from big-Aug lobbyists to government officials.</fullReview>

The movie overall gave a lot of information we need to know about the different process that they need to do about the way they get food</fullReview>

The directors really dug deep into the industry to show us the secrets they keep. They show how they treat the Workers, animals, and environment. Other people affected by the food industry are also farmers. The film also shows that the big names in the food industry can be defeated and proved wrong. You must watch to see how it all unfolds and to be exposed to the behind the scenes to the food we purchase and eat everyday.

I also didn't know how many chickens and hogs were killed to make the food that we eat in our everyday life. There are slaughterhouses that kill thousands of hogs and chickens a day. I also didn't know how dirty our food is. They sued a man just because he tried to stand up for the people who didn't know any better. I feel like there is so much more i could learn from more of their videos. I believe they should put up more videos to inform people of the hidden things in our society that people try to hide.</fullReview>

The person said that every consumer should be concern about what's inside their food because they will never known.

		<fullReview>In all, this movie was very informal. It really made me understand how the industry works and how unfair they can be. I liked how they didn't sugar coat any of the information they gave, really explained how this game is played. My only disliking for the movie was of how they explained some things. This movie can be confusing for children 18- and I'd appropriate it more if they simplified some of the information.Other than that I'd say that this movie makes you want to promote change and find out what you're actually eating. It's scary to know that you are eating/consuming. And it's even more scary to find out that the industry honestly doesn't care. i also think the movie was a little unclear, and they don't get right to the point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a really great movie that I believe that should be shown to all Americans in general. This movie really shows you what actually goes on in factories and how they do things and how things can be mass produced with many products being shipped out a day. And alright this sounds like a good thing, most of the things they do to achieve this goal is honestly wrong and can really damage the human. To be able to mass produce for example, they mutate that animals and give pesticides to the crops to allow it to grow even up to over night. These pesticides that they use can mess with the body and even kill us as they show in the movie where this little boy eats two burgers, later getting sick with e. Coli and then during I believe about 2 weeks later, leaving the mother devastated enough to fight against what companies do to the food that will be shipped it to consumers. I hope you like this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a excellent movie which talks about different and dangerous methods using to raise animals. It is against nature the ways we choose to fulfill our demands like giving steroids and other feedings to animals. As we all know that demand of these food is raising like Chicken products and so these methods are used to fulfill demand. It is dangerous for our health to take these calories in daily life. The effects of these stuff people see in long run. The thing which makes it in demand is that it is cheaper and bigger. Corn is the main product which is almost used in every product. The movie also show farms on which animals are raised naturally. It also tell us the problems farmers have because they cannot fulfill demands of company. We also get to know that consumers doesn't even concern about their food and don't even know that what is in their food.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rated "Food Inc." with an 8 because it wasn't the most exciting movie, however it was necessary for the education and awareness of people who are concerned about what they eat/ what goes in their food, and for those who would want to know what's going on in the food industry that they rely on. This movie really opened my eyes to the agricultural/food industry and how our food are overall "prepared" for our consumption. It also showed me all the diseases that can be contracted by the workers who, despite doing their job, are actually harming those who purchase the products, which is not in the best of conditions. Something else that I found intriguing was the number of well known companies who promote their food as being wholesome and "ok" for consumption, are, in actuality, not. I hope others will view this with an open mind and understand the dangers of our everyday food products/industries.</fullReview>

It showed the farms that had chickens and how they were grown.]They were grown with corn that had hormones. It said how most of the workers were undocumented. It had lots of interesting facts about how food is made. There were workers who would get infections by cutting the pigs because there would be bacteria and it would get in there nails.</fullReview>

It's able to show us exactly what is going on in the world of the food and how the consumers are being controlled by these demanding companies. It's able to show us how farmers and people who have lost because of ill produced food and food that is easily contaminated are treated. It also is able to show how pigs and cows and such are treated and slaughtered. Its an eye opener and even shows that these things will go to court and farmers will lose thousands trying to fight back and win their right to farm and produce. Even if things are said and done loosely on TV or even in state the large food corporations will take someone to court just as they had done with Oprah. It shows how hard it affected farmers and also as said in the movie one farmer had to give up the battle because they weren't able to pay their legal bills. It shows us consumers how scary the food world can be and what happens to the workers and farmers behind the scenes.</fullReview>

Even in the film, farmers and other providers of these big companies feared giving out any information because they did not want to be sued or fined.That in itself is madness and is ridiculous. Anything said about these major food corporations should be heard and not wiped off the face of the earth never to be exposed. All and out this was very informal and i defiantly recommended it to anyone who wants to know the truth about these food industries and their lies.

I feel everyone should watch this movie but this movie is not for squeamish people. This is the real deal no cut cards. The people in the documentary are not actors. Everyone is playing themselves. So it was shocking that the workers can come in everyday and deal with these conditions. Also in this movie they talked about why its necessary for food to be clean and sanitary.

This movie makes me want to plant my own garden and start growing my own healthy foods instead of buying foods from the grocery store or eating out.

For example a cheeseburger, cost less than a head of broccoli which i think is ridiculously stupid, like they don't even care about nobody health or if they have enough money to even spend on healthy food.

The gruesome and unethical treatment of animals and workers alike should be dealt with in America and those behind these conditions should be dealt with by the court of law. The treatment of the workers in the food industry is not only wrong but unconstitutional. Making people, actual living humans, work in a factory where they get cuts and can easily get infections from the items they handle, i.e pig guts and blood, and the bacteria that builds under their nails from dealing with the poorly treated animals can causes the workers to catch deadly infection, which is unfair treatment.</fullReview>

It shed light on how things are made, what are the dangers, how much things aren't being organically grown anymore, etc. If anything, it made me want to turn into a vegetarian! Ugh, and the way they treated the animals as if they didn't have feelings. Honestly, why isn't the government monitoring anymore? I hope a movie just like this one can be released in the next few years, an update on how productions are like now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a really good movie and it really open your eyes and makes you think that what is happening around you and how are you being double- crossed by the food industry. This movie makes you wonder what you are paying for and what you are consuming which is so called organic food. After I saw the movie, I have made up my mind to try my best to stay away from fast food. I would rather prefer home cooked food. All the secrets of big food industries and meat industries are revealed in this movie. So this movie is really something you should watch for your own knowledge and you should know what you are paying for. I think this movie should be used to educate students in high schools and tell everyone about these dark facts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*MAY BE A SPOILER* This movie really opened my eyes to the evil in the food industries. i really like how we get to see inside of the cases that food industries cause and how much trouble uncooked food can bring. I also liked a lot how it explains how important it is to know what is inside of your food I did not like the pace as to which this documentary was filmed it felt a little too fast for my liking. The movie was cool and exciting at some points i looked how the talked about things of the past and how the government works with this too. i wish they could make a part 2 for this movie because of how influential this movie can be unto so many people in America</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Food, Inc movie is great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Food, Inc is a very good movie. It displays the process of food with much detail. I think it explains the good, the bad, and most importantly the truth. The gives different perspectives of the farmers, consumers, etc. This movie gives a great view of the whole food industry here in the world. It lets us the consumers know what we are putting in our bodies as we consume the things we buy in stores. It shows the entire process of food manufacturing, from picking the right food to raising it to actually processing the food in the factories and packaging them. Its important to know these things for ourselves. For our health and everyone else. Its also important to know that we can change the whole food industry and not be afraid of the big companies just because they are huge and have a lot of money. We just need to vote and make a change.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary was a really informational film that got me thinking about what I eat now on a daily basis. It can really change how you eat and what you buy in the stores, and can tell you a lot of about how your food is made, processed, and how major companies took over. If you are really curious in what and how your food is processed and made, then i recommend that you watch this film. It tells you many different types of categories that tell you what happens in the supermarkets.What I also found interesting is that the cost of food that we think is cheap is actually really expensive. The film has different people they have interviewed and some companies that declined to be interviewed because maybe they didn't want to comment about how they are processing there food. The movie also contains some somewhat sad parts that can touch your heart to the core. The abuse the workers and animals receive is not right and unfair. This treatment extended to the farmers as well. They are getting sued for no reason what so ever by doing what they do best. I've learned basically that you can change the food system. You can just choose to buy different foods with the words "organic". Don't buy from the big name brands as much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a good movie especially for people who are on diets or want to be healthy like athletes. My mother for example always looks at labels of the food she buys to see if its healthy but when she sees this movie she will know the truth. I would recommend this movie to people that are trying to be healthy and people who has diabetes because it can be dangerous if a person with diabetes eats anything he wants without reading the labels and the calories. For me personally i loved the movie i thought it was excellent because i know how the companies make food and there secrets. No spoilers but you will be surprised when you watch this movie and you'll like it because you'll also know the secrets. This movie affected me so much because again i was so surprised when saw this movie because company are not nice as you thinks, when you'll see it you'll know what i mean.

		<fullReview>Between the old timey folk music, the grieving mother of a dead child, the horrific footage from farms usually found in a PETA advertisement, and the continued use of the phrase "multinational corporations", Food Inc. fell into a hole that many other documentaries fall into with me. I understand that the definition of the genre is to convince others of a certain opinion, but there are several ways to go about that goal that don't also insult the intelligence of the viewer. I felt as if Food Inc. failed to take advantage of any of those methods. It is manipulative and pulls at your heartstrings whenever there is a void of data in its argument, and it casts technology as the villain in a world that is greatly improved by it everyday. It is awful that these chickens are treated the way that they are, but in the same breath I think that these chickens wouldn't be alive at all if not for these chicken houses. We are breeding more chickens in order to use them as a product, not treat them as pets. To treat Monsanto as some ultra powerful company fails to account for the frailty of power in today's society, where entire "multinational corporations" are struck down in a heartbeat by a new technological innovation. Progress is ugly, but it is progress, and nothing that Mr. Kenner said could dissuade me of that opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're looking for a nice movie to watch after a dinner date with your sweetheart, this is definitely not the film of choice. However, if you are wondering what exactly your last meal was made of, then you must listen to what this documentary has to say. The purpose of this film is to expose the truth of the modern food industry and to show consumers just how the food that they consume everyday is made. This film is divided into several chapters dedicated to points along the commercial food chain. From industrial feedlots where millions of cruelly crammed animals scurry about in their own waste until slaughter, to the chains where millions of consumers gobble down industrially produced meat, and an occasional serving of E. coli bacteria. I love how this film shows everyday farmers doing their jobs to supply for the big companies. The average chicken farmer invests over $500,000 and makes only $18,000 a year. 32,000 hogs a day are killed in Smithfield Hog Processing Plant in Tar Heel, N.C, which is the largest slaughterhouse in the world. This really makes you consider what and where our everyday food comes from. In fact, 70% of processed foods have at least one genetically modified ingredient. I would have loved to hear what the big companies had to say for the film, but I understand why they declined to be interviewed. I would decline to be interviewed too if people knew the truth about what my company is doing to these animals in order to make their food. It also annoyed me how quickly it jumped to and from different topics. It is understandable with such a brief film, but as this goes on, it leaves you wishing to hear more about what the farmers have to say. Overall, I think this film is outstanding. The general public needs to know --and has the right to know-- what is in the everyday food that they consume. I would love to see an updated version of this film to see where America's food production stands currently. However, the bad news is, more than likely nothing has changed and may have gotten worse since this film. So the next time you take your hot date out for a meal, ask yourself: "What is this food made out of?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After you see the unsanitary habitats cattle are in, the horrible way Tyson treats the chickens, and the way our farmers are cutting corners and are basically being forced to work. You seriously may not pick up a fork for days after watching. I advise you to stop eating and stuff your face before watching the stunning, heart-wrenching, stomach-turning documentary by Robert Kenner called Food Inc. You will be amazed at how blind and helpless we are as a people when it comes to the food we eat every day? well every 20 minutes if you are like me.The documentary starts us off in the aisles of grocery stores, but very quickly shifts to the slaughterhouses and seeds that make a large portion of our foods. This is when the film very strongly establishes its side and position in this argument. Talking about how these multinational corporations have monopolized the food market. The four main meat-packers Tyson, Cargill, JBS, and National Beef control 80% of the beef market. Also how they have cut production costs in order to really bring in major profits regardless of the side effects of their "optimization of production". An example of this "optimization of production" is how they have cut the time it takes for a chicken to grow from a few months to now just 49 days. These chickens cannot walk because their legs and internal organs are not fully developed and cannot handle the weight.We learn that farmers are basically forced to overproduce corn, which goes into , coke , diapers, sweet &amp; low , Motrin , and cattle feed just to name a few. Just in case you may not know cattle does not naturally feed on corn. Cows are built and have always eaten grass until now. A researcher with his hand literally inside of a cow's stomach tells us that cows that eat only corn produce a very deadly form of E.coli. A very horrific virus that killed one of this documentary's most touching subjects little 2 ?year old Kevin Kowalyck. The act in which no company apologized for until this day.The movie is definitely not for the faint of heart. There are horrible statistics that will make you think we are all doomed paired with videos that will make you cringe. Videos like herds of dirty feces covered pigs squealing helplessly as they are being pushed to their grim final destination on the "kill floor" in a slaughterhouse called Smith-field. A company where they also push half-alive cows around with forklifts. This wonderful place also provides jobs to illegal immigrants and then gets them arrested after a certain amount of time of employment.My only criticism of this documentary is that it was completely one sided. Although the director did attempt to get the companies to talk, all of them exercised their rights and plead the fifth. The involvement of the meat-packers and slaughter houses would have really set this movie over the top and gotten it the publicity I feel it deserves. Other than that this was a very powerful yet disgusting film that everyone should watch immediately.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Food Production Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When people think about documentaries they may expect to watch something with a lot of information presented in a boring fashion. Food Inc. is not like this in the slightest. This brought a new way of asking ourselves about what we eat. This documentary goes deep into the roots of the production of our foods we find in the supermarkets. It is surprising that it has taken this long for people to really wonder where our food comes from. Food and nutrition is such an important factor in our wellbeing so everyone should have access to information about where our food comes from. This documentary gives us a closer look into what our "healthy and nutritious" foods are really made from. Robert Kenner goes deep inside the food production industry and exposes the many flaws of the mass production of food.The layout of Food Inc. was very unique. It was broken up into chapters that had new central ideas each time. I like the way this documentary is laid out. It gives you an opportunity to understand exactly what each segment is going to focus on. The only flaw with this is that there aren't very good transitions between points. I found it interesting to see how the animals that we eat are treated. It is disgusting to see how cramped and dirty these places were. I cannot believe that we end up eating something that is filled with hormones and are so dirty. Food Inc. shows mind boggling video footage of the chicken coops and cow slaughtering farms that draws in the viewer's attention quite closely. To feed the growing demand, the farmers today are expected to grow enormous chickens in a limited special area. The documentary states that most chicken's today have not seen daylight or been able to walk in an open area. The evidence that the documentary uses to support its argument being the video footage showed from one farm. The director notes that most farmers are not allowed to show where they raise their chickens because they are afraid of the corporations that control them.The documentary not only shows the outrageous ways in which our food is handled but also the mistreatment of the workers. The contributors to the documentary do a well job in explaining how certain agricultural jobs work and who exactly is in charge of putting food on our tables. The documentary uncovers the truth about immigrant workers and states that they are lured into the United States with a promise of money but soon learn that that money is covered in sweat, blood and tears. The undercover video presented in the documentary shows just how tough some of the food industry jobs are. The documentary also exposes how big corporations take advantage of poor immigrant workers just to keep their costs down and profits high. According to the documentary, the big food industry corporations take illegal immigrant workers, mostly from Mexico, and knowing that they are not going to unionize or complain they exploit their rights to get the most labor out of them for the least amount of money. Their stories go unheard of because they are afraid of getting deported even thought their sufferings are quite significant.The documentary states that the unnatural growth of the chickens is not good for our health and that the way the chickens are grown today is completely different from the way they were grown a hundred years ago. The documentary does, however, lack further scientific evidence on how this unusual growth in chickens has a negative effect on our health. It is also mentioned in the documentary that antibiotics given to chickens could pass on to humans but this is not backed up by a scientific study. It is my opinion that such a claim needs to have factual proof behind it. With the argument of illegal immigrants and workers rights one could argue that it is the immigrant's responsibility not to accept those kinds of mistreatments in the work place and refuse to work in those conditions. It is understandable that some illegal immigrants are desperate for work and will take on any job but this solution of worker mistreatment cannot be easily solved without their cooperation. Overall, I felt that the documentary could have used more scientific proof to back up such strong claims. However, having such a powerful documentary out for the public to see does empower us to look further into how our food is made. More than that, this documentary allows us to question the government agencies that are in charge of controlling what we eat. Prior to Food Inc. we were taught to believe that what the FDA approves is harmless and made with proper steps by people who are treated equally.Finally, Food Inc. also indicates how our food production is connected to urban development and that space is not only a problem of urbanization but a problem that also affects food production. The documentary not only poses a question of how the food is made but how much do we value our space. Is it really necessary to give such little space to the animals that we plan to eat? Are there any solutions to this problem when large corporations are so powerful? Who's responsibility is it to tackle these problems. These are many of the questions I thought about after finishing this documentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary insight into the world of food</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Food Inc. is an expository documentary that was released in 2008. This film exposes the terrible acts that the American food industry is doing. There's a lot of things going right in the film, for example: at 93 minutes long, the documentary is chock full of facts and interviews, that really open the viewers eyes. The imagery used in this film was clever from the start. The film starts off with the obligatory pre-credit roll. However instead of just being the normal boring black screen with white letters, the production staff's names are presented as if they were in a grocery store. They utilized the names for isles, packaging for food, and other sorts of items you would find in an American grocery store to hide the staff members' names in. The film starts off focusing on the meat packing industry as well as the fast food industry. Both industries are closely related. The fast food industry controls about 70% of all beef, chicken, and pork consumption. The film presents an excellent exposé on the very secretive fast food/meat packing industry, much like the very popular documentary Super- Size Me. However unlike Super-Size Me, Food, Inc. dives into the food manufacturing process itself, and not just the industry alone. The filmmakers conducted multiple interviews with chicken farmers for a few different meatpacking companies. This segment is probably to me, the most important in my opinion, as an avid meat lover. I think it also presents the weirdest scene in the movie, when a man is seen sticking his hand into the stomach of a cow. After the film talks about the meat itself, it focuses on the animals used to produce the meat, and the diet they consume. Cattle the source of beef, are by evolution required to eat grass. However in the modern meatpacking industry, the cows are fed a diet of corn. The reason being is corn fattens up the cows faster than grass. But this carries a potentially grave consequence. The bacteria inside the cow's stomach grow resistant to antibiotics due to the unnatural corn diet, thus evolving the e-coli viruses inside the meat. The images of the cows are disgusting. The cows literally stand knee deep in their own feces for hours on end. This is the food we eat. This films hits you hard with cold hard facts, it's frightening. The next segment is cleverly named "The Dollar Menu". This segment focuses on the correlation between the fast food industry and America's health problem. By far out of the entire documentary, this segment contains the scariest facts. 1 in 3 children born after 2000 will develop early onset diabetes. This statistic literally made my jaw drop. The feeling this documentary gives me almost makes me want to stop watching and hit the gym. This film makes its point crystal clear, that there is obviously something extremely wrong with the USA's food system. As the segment continues, the film focuses on a family who helps explain why the fast food industry is the only option for some families. The growing cost of fruits and vegetables is so high that feeding a family is very difficult in the modern world. To many a 99-cent cheeseburger is the only option. They mention the irony of how a person can get an entire cheeseburger for 99 cents; yet they cant even get a head of lettuce for 99 cents. A very well done segment, the use of a family really makes one sympathize. After this segment, the final two segments focus on organic food. More and more people are buying organic food each year, and it is a growing industry. This half of the film has a much more hopeful tone. The previous segments smacked you with hard facts and dark secrets. The final segments give one hope, that there is still time to make a change; that even the average consumer can tell these corporations to enough is enough. I think this part of the documentary seals the deal on the message being given. The film proceeds to interview a local farmer who raises his own livestock, and sells the meat on his own. While not many facts are given this time around, the interview provides an insight on the modern farmer. Many farmers are forced into sighing contracts that basically sell their lives to corporations. What's even more outrageous is that companies can actually copyright seeds. That's right. Companies can copyright how a seed is planted and handled. If a farmer were to violate this copyright, he or she would be prosecuted. The companies who copyright these seeds even have lists of farmers who have or are violating the copyright. The documentary shortly ends after these segments. At the end of the film, one final push is presented. The filmmakers leave it to the consumers to make the change happen. For the consumer to stop buying into these evil companies, and show them that we want healthier food, and longer lives. Using vivid imagery and eye-opening facts, I think Food Inc. accomplished what it wanted to happen. Overall I enjoyed the film. Documentaries are always a hit or miss with me, either you keep me interested, or I find it boring 20 minutes in. This film does not disappoint. It's a very well made film, and you can tell how much effort was put into making it. It's not very often that a documentary impacts me, but this one did. It definitely has changed the way I look at the food we eat today. If you make me cringe, make my jaw drop, or even get me disgusted. You've obviously done something right with your documentary. This film ranks among the best documentaries I've ever had the pleasure to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Food Inc.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Food Inc., a 2008 documentary, reveals shocking secrets of food processing. Directed and produced by Robert Kenner, this documentary even influenced food policy decisions. Many Americans don't know where their food comes from, which is exactly what the big food industries would like to hear. The documentary's main focus is that the agricultural business in America produces more than just harm upon animals, but also to the environment and its consumers. Big food industries are gladly risking the lives of consumers at the cost of money and power. Local groceries have food packages, however, they fail to provide sufficient enough information for consumers to make healthy and smart choices. The documentary is informative and capturing. Its simple objective is to reveal to the common consumer the secrets that are deliberately placed out of reach for them. Director, Robert Kenner, is not intimidated in stepping in and questioning big industries. His documentary is very visual and straightforward. He uses personal and touching pathos appeal to show the dangers of our food industries. For example he shows the inhumane torture that meat factories infringe on animals. Cows are hurdled into insufficient pen sizes. They do not see the sun or grass from the day they are born until the day they are slaughtered. Their hooves are often blackened from standing in piles of feces. Images of inhumane treatment reveal that animal cruelty is the price we pay for cheap meats. Another example, reveals the same message when Kenner, flashes an alarming picture of a chicken from 1950 after 68 days, compared to a chicken growing in 2008 after 47 days. The chicken from 1950 is surprisingly smaller than the one from 2008. Chickens are lined up and stuffed drugs that help them grow bigger for the food industries to make more money. They are bred and drugged to grow so large that often their organs cannot keep up and heart attacks and deformities are common. These scenes are very engaging as the viewers start to question the farmers themselves and therefore are dragged into believing that what the documentary is trying to portray is in fact the truth. Another idea explored in the documentary, Food Inc., is how deadly the food can be for consumers. Nowadays, there are approximately 47 thousand products in a grocery store. Out of these products, four companies control seventy percent of them. This can be harmful for consumers financially. A Hispanic family is shown in which they describe their struggle between buying groceries for the whole family and medication for the diabetic father. However, Food Inc., overlooked the importance of having cheap food available for struggling families. For example, the documentary gives the statistic that one and a half million Hispanic farmers lost their jobs due to all the debt due to corporations. Although these laid off families would be satisfied with healthy choices, they unfortunately cannot afford them. Big corporations are guiltily for animal cruelty and unhealthy food, but they are able to provide them for cheap and in big bundles for such families. Most should be aware that, cheap foods often lead to harmful affects to the bodies of consumers. Kevin and his family were on vacation when he died. His mother, Barbara, is very emotional during an interview and cries as she recites "I don't like talking about this but if I don't tell my story nobody will know and this will never be stopped." Two-year-old Kevin, contracted E.coil from eating three hamburgers from Jack in the box. After her tragic loss, Barbara, was very aggressive in getting out and onto the news in order to change policies to prevent such further tragedies. "Kevin's law" was proposed to the U.S. government and would give them the power to completely close down any factories that produce contaminated meats. It is very inspiring to hear how one person could make a huge difference and crack in the system of deflated hope in our agriculture system. One topic that was abruptly spoken of, but not in enough detail, was the impact of food industries on our environment. The average food product travels about 1,500 miles to grocery stores. This results in usage of monstrous pick up trucks and diffusion of green house emissions. However, the entire documentary is not dark and gloomy. Director Robert Kenner uses his environmental philosophy in order to suggest changes that every individual can make to save ourselves from the pit of corporation destruction. The future of food industries heavily relies on the choices each consumer makes three times a day. For example, if we choose to buy locally we are saving truckloads of processed foods from traveling over the country and we are eating organically. Overall, the documentary Food Inc. was impactive in showcasing many alarming facts that most Americans are unaware about. The issue taken away from the film is that food industries are a political issue. This is similar to the issue we once faced with tobacco laws and regulations. The documentary was showcased as a way of opening our eyes to the differences we, as consumers, are able to make. Visual "behind the scenes" camera recordings were made for a pathos affect upon understating the harms. However, I do wish the documentary was not so aggressive with blaming farmers for the bad food productions. They are forced into such business because they need money to live of off. They are not the "bad guys." Also there was a large support and praise for Walmart in this documentary. This makes me as a viewer skeptic in the fact that Walmart is a big corporation and will do anything to keep their prices low. I do not believe that Kenner should have focused so much documentary time on such a place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Be careful with what you eat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love tasting all kind of food from different countries and I'm also interested in how things are made. Therefore, it was not a surprise if my eyes were caught by the title of this documentary. Before, I used to eat whatever is labeled as food without questioning. Since I came to the U.S., I've learned from the news that we should be more considered and aware of what we're eating. Unfortunately, the information that I'd learned was not enough to persuade me to change my way of eating. After watching Food Inc. documentary, I was informed about how the food industry affects not only our health, but also our rights.There are so many ugly facts that are hidden from us about the food industry. According to Food Inc., "The industry doesn't want you to know the truth about what you're eating, because if you knew, you might not want to eat it anymore." On packages, we always see a farm house, beautiful green grass or wheat field, fruits are juicy and fresh on the tree, etc. By looking at these packages, we totally ignore what we should concern with, such as where the food come from; how it is raised, processed, handled, transported and sold; and what is in our food besides the main ingredients. A quote from Food Inc., "There are no seasons in the America supermarket.", was like glass of water which had thrown in my face and awoke me. I used not to bother asking myself why there are all types of fruits and vegetables available all year round in the supermarkets. The answer is many type of fruits are picked from somewhere across the country and ripen with ethylene gas. We believe all the food we eat comes from the farms but in reality, "it's not a farm, it's a factory.", stated by Food Inc. The top meat companies have become dominant in the food market. "In the 1970s, the top 5 beef packers controlled 25% of the market. Today, the top 4 control 80% of the market." Chickens are redesigned to grow faster, bigger with more breast meat, and they are raised in houses which block them away from sunlight and literally provide no space for them to walk, which also happens to cows and pigs. Many chickens get sick and die because their feet cannot support the weight of their bodies. High fructose corn syrup is one of many products that made from corn and it's contained in almost every food products. It tends to be used to substitute regular sugar because it's cheaper, it makes food taste better and creates good texture. Besides those advantages, high fructose corn syrup is one of the main reasons that lead to diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Corn is also used to feed chickens, cows, pigs and even fishes in order to reduce the prices, which means more customers. The documentary informed us about E coli which was not only found in beef, but also in spinach, apple juice, etc. It also talked about a tragic death of a 2-year-old boy named Kevin, who was a victim of E Coli after eating a hamburger. As I stated earlier, the food industry affects not only our health our rights. The industrial food system began in the 1930s, when McDonald Brothers opened a new form of restaurants which called the drive in. Despite of their huge success, the McDonald Brothers decided to reduce the costs and simplify. They fired the car hobs, got rid most of the things on the menu and created a new way to run restaurants. They brought the factory system to the back of the restaurants' kitchen, where the workers were trained to do only one thing, got paid low wages and easily to be replaced. Having low income, workers, especially immigrants, cannot afford fresh food. They decide to eat fast food because it's much cheaper and faster, which increase their chance of having diabetes. In meat factories, workers have to work in poor condition which covered with blood, faeces, urine, etc. The workers got infection in their fingers nails due to cutting too many guts. According to the document, meat packing has become one of the most dangerous jobs in the U.S. The farmers were kept under control and forced to follow the meat companies' requirements due to their debts. Besides the workers, the consumers are also affected. Our rights are to eat food that is safe, to know what is contained in it and to be protected. But it seems like the food industry is way too powerful that our rights are being ignored. "This isn't about what we're eating. This is about what we allowed to say, what we allow to know. It's not just our health that at risk." ? a quote in Food Inc.These are only two in many significant points that brought up in this documentary and I think they are really helpful. Food Inc. shows us many ugly hidden truths about the food industry. I used not to care about what I ate because I thought everything was healthy and all natural. Food Inc. also informs us about our power as consumers to change the system. "The battle against tobacco is a perfect model of how an industry's irresponsible behavior could be changed". I believe this documentary should be shown more widely because so many people don't know about these facts. Though in the end, the documentary suggests us to buy organic food and support local farms, which I totally agree with, but my question is, "How about low income workers and family?" As I know, organic food is more expensive than "regular" food. Being in a low income family, I can't afford organic food even though I want to eat healthy and change the system. I think the documentary should have included a solution for this issue. Works cited: Food, Inc. Magnolia Home Entertainment, 2009. Film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you eat food this is a must see documentary!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Food Inc. documentary directed by Robert Kenner shows the many problems in the food industry. The documentary displays the facts in a straight and simple manner. After seeing the film, it made me think twice about what I was buying at the supermarket. My family and I started shopping at Whole Foods and the Fresh Market because we are more conscious about the food we eat now. Last year I saw this film for the first time and it got me thinking about organic foods. The documentary talks about choosing organic over inorganic frequently. I also did an essay for school on whether you should choose organic or inorganic foods because the film got me interested in which one to buy. I thought this was a good documentary because it made me take action and it made me tell other people about it. The director achieved his aim which was to change the way you think about your food. What made the film affective was the use of actual footage of the chickens and cows. I think it's disgusting how the animals are being treated and slaughtered. The documentary was made years ago and there still aren't people changing the way they are being slaughtered or kept. Also, this documentary reminded me of the movie Supersize Me. Supersize Me is directed by Morgan Spurlock, it shows him eating McDonalds for a month and he documents his weight and health. There's one scene that reminded me of Food Inc., which was when he talked about how McDonald's chicken McNuggets are made. Kenner used the same animations as Spurlock and I think those kinds of visuals really hit home to the viewer. Overall, I thought this was a good documentary that informed the viewer on the issues in the food industry. I recommend this film to every person because I think everybody should know where there food comes from and how it's being made. We never think about where our food came from. This film will definitely change how you view food.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A raw, eye-opening documentary going behind the scenes of everyday foods majority of Americans consume.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Food is the fuel to keep our bodies functioning properly. It is an essential part of life, and without it, we as a species would not thrive. Food, Inc. is a disturbing, eye-opening documentary about how most of our everyday food in the United States is made. Directed by Robert Kenner, they go behind the scenes of major food companies and their day-to-day operations. The average American never gives much though in what they eat. Usually, everyone drives up to the nearest McDonalds for lunch and orders a burger, fries, and something sweet to wash it all down. Before freshman year of high school, I would have done the same thing, but high cholesterol in my family forced me to rethink what I put into my body. I stopped eating red meat, and my family thought that it as a good idea and started to do the same. Over the summer, I worked at a juice bar and that got me thinking more and more about what I eat. For our job training we had to watch a documentary called Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead, and ever since then I've been watching as many food and health documentaries as I can. Food, Inc. exposes what happens behind the scenes of major food companies in America. From "farms" to being processed. It opens up a lot of discussions and thoughts about, not only our health, but our morals as well. They not only explain what goes into our everyday foods, but they politics behind them, and how many lives they have and will ruin.These industries purposely hide the truth from consumers in order to gain more money for themselves without thinking about the repercussions. Three to four companies control almost all the meat production here in America, monopolizing and changing the way to raise animals and crops in order to mass-produce them for the country's growing needs. Not only are they abusing these animals, and genetically changing plants, but also viewers get a glimpse of the miss-treatment and manipulation their workers and farmers endure as well.Food, Inc. also focuses on the background of processed food, and how almost all foods in a typical grocery store contain either corn or soybean. They then talk about the snowball affect of the growth of corn and other ways they incorporated in the food industry. It emphasizes the lack of control most consumers have when buying food for themselves and for their families. They believe they have plenty of options, when in reality they are only buying from the top three or four companies or they all have the same genetically modified ingredients in those foods.Many people believe it is just fast food meat that's not healthy, but the truth is, the same companies who make the meat for burgers at McDonalds, also sell them at the supermarket. Not only does this affect the health of consumers, but also it has a major impact on the environment and the role of the government and these major food companies. It questions morals and what people can do after watching this documentary.Because of the mass-production, there is a massive contribution to the pollution in the air and water system. The production process from farm to grocery store emits tons of carbon, from transporting goods, and methane, from animal feces, into the air. The runoffs from factories find their way to underground streams and rivers, contaminating water supplies. The pesticides and fertilizers are mostly petroleum based. Spraying these harmful chemicals to hundreds of acres of crops adds not only pollution to the air, but can be toxic to surrounding areas around them. The government is doing very little to regulate the rules and regulations because these big companies have so much money and connections, they gain all this power over other companies and people. They provide very little information about what goes into the food most Americans eat everyday, and will do anything in their power to keep the truth from getting out. The farmers interviewed, who work for the Tyson, Perdue, and other big companies all believe we should have the opportunity to learn how they raise their livestock. Unfortunately they were all confronted by company representatives and changed their minds about letting the camera crews inside the chicken houses. I wish I had seen this documentary a lot sooner. It brings up topics beyond food and into politics and the role of the government. It touches up on sensitive subjects about censorship to the people and interviewing both sides of the story. Food, Inc. has converted me, like many others who have seen it, to becoming a vegetarian. My family buys little to no processed foods, and every day we are learning more and more about the foods we should and should not eat. Compared to other food documentaries I have seen, Food, Inc. provides the negative truth and shocking facts with proof to back them up. The documentary is raw and well crafted. It is separated into different parts but they all come together as a whole. It is by far my favorite one. Other documentaries start of very interesting but get super bland as they go on. Whereas, Food, Inc. captures the attention of the audience by going into different topics and subjects no one has thought of going into. Although it is one sided, it is the side we have not been exposed to, and for good reason. Everyone should know what they put into their bodies every single day, and this documentary explains that, and more. If consumers saw how their steaks and burgers were made, there would be no more mass-production of meat and genetically modified foods. In other words, this whole industry will need a drastic change.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Food inc. documentary had its primary focus on the food perspective for people in our country. It was a investigation on where our food actually comes from and how it is actually made. They highlighted the fact that the food that people ate were getting different and the curtains of what people ate came down. In other words they did not know what they were eating anymore as times goes on due to the fact that people want things faster. Food production in the urban life is important because it affects everybody and in this documentary the concerns are serious and important to look at and understand. Concerns they mentioned were how are food is produced now and how the root of the problem which is the ani9mals are being affected to. These concerns will affect everyone in the country and which is why food is a big concern for people. Especially for the way it was produced and made for people because the Documentary shows how it was made in bad conditions. This documentary made sure it expressed the problems and concerns everyone should have. Evidence in the documentary were given in order to have people really think about the problems and try to do something about it. A concern they mentioned was E coli and this is a disease that is caused because of the meat in production. They used this to express how industries actually worked and how people are getting affected by it. They mentioned how the food is important to everyone and industries find ways to make a lot of it and what makes the most money, and they don't care how it affects people and I believe this isn't a good thing to do to people. This is a big concern that the dopncumentary also expresses and I believe is important.One of the main arguments that this documentary has is that Farms are not like how they used to be anymore because of the way industries control them due to debt or even production of food. Industries of big companies make sure they get what they want so they use farmers in order to do that by giving them debt and making farmers have no choice but to do as they say. The industries have farmers do things that are unhealthy for the animals and faster. Making farms more into a factory than an actual farm. This really interested me because it shows the ignorance in these industries and the only care for money rather than the people in our country. The food and the way it was produced as shown in the documentary really cause a lot more problems then u would think. For example the bad production of food also cause diseases like E coli which caused people to die. So this main problem caused more problems than expected. It also cause things like fast food which cause people to be obese and have a lot of health issues and a disease like diabetes. These problems should be a concern for people because it can affect your family and friends also. Industries in this documentary showed a lot of their ignorance on how much they cared for the money over the people in our country. For example how they treated their animals by feeding the animals something cheap rather then what they are suppose to eat. Corn was a major thing they used for animals to eat like cows, and their really suppose to be eating grass. But the industries didn't care but to make money fast by using the cheapest way of doing it. This really concenered me a lot because people arnt aware of these cheap ways industries are using just to make money. The health of people are not a concern for the industries and which is bad on their part. In the documentary it said that if a disease was present they wouldn't find a way to stop it but find a way to not have it by making it differently and inventing new things to keep the system going. In the documentary it mentions how a mom had a son affected by E coli and she then went to go fight in court to have other people be aware of it. They then got approved for a law called, Kevin's law. This law had gave the right for the main department to shut down a industry if they kept giving out disease because of their meat. So this was a big deal for me because it showed that if you really fight for a right to change these things, that it could really make a difference. Therefore, I believe people should look at this concern and to fight to help each other be healthy. This documentary shows that The people are being affected because of these industries and which can affect not only some, but all people as well. People can get a disease and die.People who don't know about what they are eating is a big concern and can affect everyone who is eating these industry products. The country and even countries are being affected because of the people getting ill or even dying. It is a problem and the documentary shows that. It is a problem because people are getting ill for the simple fact that they cannot know what they are eating. This is a big problem and which shows how the food industry is important for the urban environment. The food production is also important and how its made because it can affect a whole big amount of people which is not a good way to live. This documentary really shows how much industries really care and how people really don't know what they eat in depth. This is a big concern for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Food, Inc.: The truth behind food production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is commonly said that if you like hot dogs, do not ask what is in them. We come to the conclusion that it is meat, but what kind exactly?The authors of "Food, Inc." show the public the truth behind the food production companies and how they have engineered our food to for mass production in order to produce "BIGGER, FATTER, FASTER and CHEAPER." Majority of us have put all our trust into the food industries that we forget to ask questions like: where our food comes from, what is in our food, how is the food grown, how it is handled, shipped and sold to the public. We come into grocery stores overwhelmed with the adversity and choices we have laid out in front of us. However, if we took some time to actually do our research and understand the business behind what we are consuming, we would come to find out that majority of our food is made from only a hand-full of crops. The release of "Food, Inc." has exposed the harsh reality that we are all, in a sense, running away from. After seeing this film, the way you shop for food, what you eat, and how you think about the food industry as a whole will be changed. This documentary shows how over the years, America has turned into a centralized and mechanized food industry business, and how it is destroying our health, our animals, our environment, and even the destruction of humanity. The fact alone that major food companies would not speak to the producers or would not allow for the filming of their slaughterhouses, chicken and cattle farms, and meat packing factories shows that the cover up of something bad is taking place. This documentary reveals the truth behind these four major industries and what is happening within their facilities, and that is food contamination, animal mistreatment, worker mistreatment, and government control. The most compelling parts of the film are depicted within the conditions under which the animals are living, what they are fed, and how they are treated and the corruption of the government towards its people. The food industry has become very controlling and territorial of its boundaries and business. Small business owners who are working for larger companies such as Purdue, decided that something has to be said about this mass production in order to contain the removal of people from what is happening in the world we live in. One chicken farmer, Carole Morrison decided to reveal the conditions in which chickens are living after her contract got canceled because she refused to keep her chickens in small, dark coups. Over the years, chickens have been modified to grow bigger, therefore containing more meat, but unable to walk a few steps without falling to the ground. They are kept in dark closed pens, away from the sunlight, and packed into tiny spaces filled with feces, antibiotics, and pesticides, and then brutally killed. Cattle are being taken away from their grassroots of consuming what they initially need in their diet (grass) to consuming corn because it is cheaper and the over production of corn is encouraged amongst farmers. The feeding of corn to cattle leads to development of E. Coli in the stomachs of the animals, which leads to the transfer of the bacteria through fecal matter which the cattle are buried knee deep in everyday. Kenner offers information about the food industry that is personal to millions of people around the world. With fast food restaurants growing and the poverty levels increasing as well, these people are affected directly. With E.Coli being a problem within our meat, what I found interesting is what was being done about the issue. Instead of the companies reevaluating their production methods to rid the farms and animals of the bacteria, the simply modified the problem. In order to contain E. Coli, ammonia based meat fillers were produced and put into hamburger meat. The mass production of meat also leads to the combination of all sorts of parts of the animal coming together into one meat source. So truthfully, the labeling on the food is not true to its extent. Kenner also draws on an important aspect of humanity. The owners of slaughterhouses and these major food industries set up shop in specific areas. Since the need for workers is at a high amongst these slaughterhouses and food packing industries, the need for cheap labor is also at a high. The location of these industries is not accidental. The government turned a blind eye when mega- industries were bringing undocumented families into the U.S. in order to work in terrible conditions for a very low wage. Smithfield, another major meat producer, shows through hidden footage the exploitation of low-wage undocumented workers and how they are treated as disposable objects, like their animals. These companies control these people because they know they can not afford to move to other areas and this is their best shot at keeping a job. That is why conditions are kept at a minimum, wages are kept even lower, and mistreatment is an everyday occurrence. Capitalism is at its finest in this country and the same goes for the mega-corporations. These multi-million or even billion dollar corporations are using their money and power to control the competition. Small business owners are being sued for their life savings and then some for what? So these companies are seen as those "not to be messed with". As time goes on, people are "starting to see the dangers of the inexpensive foods" that are being made and with more and more cracks in the system. With constant attention and the help of everyone around America watching what they buy and reading labels, change can happen. In that way, Kenner shows us a light at the end of the tunnel. The major tobacco industries were also said to be untouchable, but let's all remember what happened there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfortunately True</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw Food Inc. I was skeptical. However, as a result of two years of independent research since I first saw this movie I reluctantly and unfortunately conclude that the facts presented are not fabricated or over dramatized, but are terrifying realities. What's even scarier is the fact that the food industry shares the same mentality portrayed in this movie with the pharmaceutical industry. I suppose that should not be a surprise as both industries are "regulated" by the FDA, affectionately also know as the Fraud and Death Administration, i.e. the agency that supposedly is commissioned with the task of protecting our health. It is heartbreaking to find out that the country we citizens truly love, is being run in collusion with people who really don't care about the individual. What happened to "...by the people and for the people?" Sad</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Food, Inc. Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Food, Inc., directed by Robert Kenner is focused on informing the public of how the food they are consuming is produced with the hope of motivating a change in the way the business of agriculture and food production is handles in the United States. Kenner's concerns as presented in Food, Inc. are important because the manner in which food being consumed by the people in our country is information which food producing companies deliberately keep hidden from the public. People no longer know where their food came from and know even less about what is actually in the food they are eating and the purpose of this documentary is to raise awareness and spark a revolution is the way our population is being sustained.People have become in a way acceptant of the food made available to them and two of the main reasons for why this is true is because, one, there is a belief that there is no other possible way of feeding the human population and/or, two, there is no way to change the production methods of the food industry because of the power of the gigantic producing companies.One must think that there is no other way to come close to feeding everyone without using the factory method of producing food. In the documentary, there was a segment where a farmer named Joel Salatin showed the viewers his traditional way of farming and explained how it was all around better than industrial food production found everywhere today. His main arguments were that it was much more cost efficient, sanitary, and that it was true and honest food. He presented a very humane way of producing food as he had a relationship with his animals and produced real, nutritious, and healthy food. When asked if the world could be fed using his method of faring he responded: "Of course." At first, you may completely disagree, but there is some truth in his argument because the idea here is putting the emphasis on local farming. Obviously the radius of people he is able to feed in much smaller than, for instance, Tyson Chicken, but now imagine many local farms where a clean and natural way of producing food was used. This is the following argument to be discussed as it was a significant point made at the end of the documentary. If people supported local growing, the means of production would change significantly. There is evidence of the ability of local farms to attract people as shown people traveling to Joel Salatin's farm to get his high quality product. People are becoming increasingly aware of what they are eating and now it is time to put the pressure on the food industry; but the question is how? The answer is by voting through the food you buy.At the end of the documentary, Robert Kenner proposed a method to spark change and it revolved around people to realize and use their power as consumers. There was a whole section on exercising your right to vote at the cash register. While it seems ineffective, if everyone began to do it, change would start to happen. The power is in the numbers. There was a large emphasis throughout the documentary to demand and push safety standards, tradition food production and consumption, and overall good wholesome food.All throughout the film, it is evident that Robert Kenner is trying to give the viewer an inside, first-hand look what is actually going on in the food industry to reveal to us why we would be wary about what we are, or think we are, eating. Unfortunately, although the efforts by Kenner, the viewer still gets the sense of a curtain being drawn between what we see in the film and what actually happens behind closed doors. This is due to the refusal of participation by the large food industries in there very evident efforts of deliberately keeping the public in the dark. This exemplifies the argument that the focus of corporate farming in the United States is to make most profit possible, with the quality of the product being put on a back burner. This is not because of the farmers, but because of the large corporations which essentially own a farmer's land. Robert Kenner experienced this first hand as he conducted original research by tracing where his food came from and conducting fieldwork in farms all over the United States. Food companies continuously declined to participate in the film and a large amount of the budget was used for legal issues with Robert Kenner protecting himself from the very same companies that feed us.Food, Inc. is a great documentary in the sense that it provokes a reaction from the viewer and achieves its purpose of informing the public of the fact that deception dominates the food industry. There are many great arguments made in the film but the solution proposed at the end is not foundationally strong because of the financial dynamics on our society. The biggest problem in the food industry is that the heads and CEO's of these corporate giants are making decisions about food when they themselves are not the ones growing it. Farmers are seen a tools, not advisors, which is a huge mistake. These is a similar dilemma in the food availability to people of different incomes. Sure organic products may be available at stores and according the Robert Kenner, if everyone buys those locally grown organic products, the food companies would be forced into change. It's a great idea, but it's not very functional because people of low-income are not going to buy those products even if they want to. Agribusiness runs on the poor, with the rich making the decisions and our capitalistic society allow that. In order for change to be made in the way the food industry is run, the poor need to be given a voice and the power needs to be shifted to the consumer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast Food, Production, Corn, and the Effects of the Industry on Farmers and Low-income Families</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Food Inc. is a documentary that explores the current food industry. The aim of the film is to open the public's eyes to the food industry. This film is important ethically for the sake of the animals, farmers, and workers and for the sake of the public's health. Food Inc. makes many important points but the ones I will re-visit are fast food, production, corn, and the effects of the industry on farmers and low-income families. Food Inc. argues that the food industry changed with McDonalds fast food. To cut their costs and promote efficiency, McDonalds downsized by changing the kitchen procedure. They hired workers to do one simple task in an assembly line manner. This way the labor was menial was low pay and easily replaceable. Today McDonalds is the largest meat and potato purchaser. Since McDonalds calls for all of it's product to taste the same, be cheap, and produced at a fast rate, the food production industry had to change it's procedure. The way of farming has changed to become more factory-like. Food Inc. highlights chicken to illustrate how meat is produced. In 1950 a chicken was raised and slaughtered in 70 days, in 2008 that span was only 48 days. The propriety of chickens changed as well. Now farmers no longer own their chickens, large food companies own the chickens. In 2008 there were four companies that control 80% of meat. Those being: Tyson, Swift, Cangill, and National Beef. Because of this monopolization, Food Inc. argues that even if you do not eat fast food you are consuming food from the same process because it comes from the same companies. The documentary interviews two chicken farmers. One under contract with Tyson, whose chicken houses are closed off from sunlight. The farmer says the chickens never see sunlight. He cannot allow the filmmakers inside of the chicken house because Tyson seemingly intervenes. Out of a dozen chicken farmers only one allowed the cameras into the chicken house. This farmer worked with Perdue. She said she wasn't surprised other farmers neglected to show their chicken houses for their own sake but that she herself felt morally obliged to show it.Her chicken house is apparently rare in that sunlight is not barricaded. So many chickens are crammed in that the floor is not visible. The farmer remarks that the house is very dusty and filthy with chicken pieces. Hormones accelerate the chicken's growth too much to be strong enough to walk more than a few steps. The farmer picks up many dead chickens from the ground saying that is normal. Perude workers come in the middle of the night of take all of the chickens to the processing plant sick or not.Food Inc. explains that farmers have to pay $300,000 for the chicken house. In addition the company will demand upgrades to the chicken houses. This keeps the farmers in constant debt. The average chicken farmer makes $18,000 a year. Here I ask why farmers have a contract with a major food company in the first place. I presume it is so because the companies distribute and provide the processing and packing process. The film also features a free farmer who appeals to dedicated customers. His scenario is ideal. However our the majority of our society is not accustomed to going out to farmland or even a farmer's market for meat so the fast food corporation continues to thrive and apparently exploit farmers. The food industry's expanded use of corn is important for the industry. Corn is "cash crop." It is easy to produce and highly profitable for it's newly engineered uses. High fructose corn syrup is one among the many scientifically extracted ingredients used as additives and processors. These ingredients are widely found in all kinds of products not even only in foods. Corn is also used to feed livestock. Livestock does not naturally eat corn. Cows for example, should be eating grass. But feeding them corn is easier, cheaper, and more efficient because they gain wait faster in containment. Put by Food Inc., cheap corn equals cheap meat and cheap meat is why Americans consume so much of it. The film shows the endless acres of corn in the Midwest. It is a display of all the land that could be used for free-range farming. Instead it is used for corn and humans and animals are all fed corn. Corn processed into something like corn syrup is sugar. Humans were evolutionarily adapted to want sugar and fat during times when sugar and fat were rare. Now sugar and fat is abundantly available everywhere for low prices. Every 1 in 3 Americans born after 2000 will get early onset diabetes. Not only is diabetes painful and scary but also financially burdening. Families who cannot afford to buy healthier food than fast foods certainly endure hardship when a family member contracts diabetes. It's easy for someone to argue that parents should make better choices than fast food when feeding their family. But as the family featured in Food Inc., demonstrates; a bundle of broccoli is more expensive than a cheeseburger. The father of the family has diabetes and his medication puts a financial burden on the family. Pay for his medication or pay for vegetables, is the choice the family is faced with. The conclusion of the film encourages people to use their food purchases as votes sending a message of demand for change to this very powerful industry. But what about families, who are hungry, do not have the money to spend, time to cook, and naturally are most satisfied by sugar fats? It is not so easy for them. Food Inc. however, is doing the important job of educating people on this very important subject. Food Inc. opens people's eyes to the way food is made and to evaluate the food choices before them every day. Our choices in food could bring justice the abused animals, abused farmers, and abused consumers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review For UPP 101 Professor Ivis Zambrana</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Food, Inc. is a film directed by Robert Kenner. It focuses on the issues that are present in our current food system in the United States and how the food system has changed overtime. The main topic of the film seems to be industrialization. This film breaks industrialization into sub topics such as fast food chains and GMOs. Two more important topics that are touched upon are health and affordability of food. The film opens with how supermarkets are giving customers a false image of what they are receiving. When you walk around a grocery store you will see pictures, paintings and labels with farmers. There are phrases such as "straight from the farm" written everywhere. But in reality that food is not coming from the classic farmer that customers are made to believe they are coming from. Another problem with supermarkets that the film discusses, is the year round availability of vegetables. There are certain seasons that different vegetables are available. However, the supermarket overshadows that by having all vegetables available at all times during the year. This is because of GMOS, a topic that will be further discussed later on.Farms are not what they used to be because of industrialization. The film shows footage of many "farms" that they visited. What used to be farms, have now been transformed into mass producing factories. A few companies are controlling the food system. The film states that "In the 1970's, the top five beef packers controlled twenty five percent of the market. Today, the top four control over eighty percent of the market." The top few companies are controlling the entire meat industry and changing how the animals are raised. The food we are consuming is becoming more and more dangerous. Fast food chains are bigger than ever and in turn they need large suppliers. The film visits the farm of a man named Vince who has a poultry house for Tyson. They are kept in a poultry house with no lighting. Tyson would not allow him to let the camera crew in, probably because they knew if the public saw how they treated their animals then they would boycott their products. The next farm they visited was of a woman named Carole, who is a Purdue farmer. She allowed them to go inside the poultry house which was an open style house so the chickens could have fresh air and light. However, she describes the space as dirty and she says it's "not farming, it's mass production."While industrial farms are becoming a norm, there are still farmers who stick to traditional farming. This allows people to have the option to purchase their products from a local farmer who doesn't have to farm the way a larger company wants them to farm. Joel Salatin is an example of this. He is one of the few local farmers left that are sticking to traditional values of their product, customers, and what happens to them. The film points out that the FDA is conducting less inspection than they used to. The FDA and USDA are supposed to be enacting laws to ensure that the food we are consuming is safe. As shown through this film, this isn't necessarily the case. This is what leads into how the food system is affecting our health. This brings up the question: can we really trust our government to enact laws that will protect our health? When you take a close look at the food system you begin to wonder if the main priority is to provide us with healthy and affordable food, or if it is to do whatever they have to do to make the most money. There has been an increase in the amount of e col breakouts. Instead of e col showing up in meat, it has begun to show up in vegetables such as spinach as well. The way people are eating is also causing them to be vulnerable to other diseases such as diabetes. The film states that one in three children born after 2000 will get diabetes, and one in two minority children will get diabetes. Barbara Kowalcyk is a food safety advocate who is trying to push the USDA to force companies to make sure the food we consume is safe for us. Her son had died from an e col infection. She now wants to make sure that food standards are set in place so something like this doesn't happen again. The film interviews a family about the food they eat. They eat fast food more often than not because of the affordability. It is easier for people to purchase fast food because most of the items are around one-three dollars. While vegetables and other organic healthy foods have high prices, making it harder for people to easily purchase them. The family in the movie made a point that you can buy something from a fast food restaurant for ninety nine cents, but you can't buy broccoli for ninety nine cents. It's a sad truth, but our food system has made it highly difficult for people to be able to buy organic or healthier food items. GMOs tie into everything else that the film has discussed. To start off, GMOs are a product of industrialization. Because factories are mass producing, they are injecting crops with different chemicals to make them grow the way they want them to grow. Corn is one of the main crops that is genetically modified. You can find some form of corn in many products that you wouldn't expect to find it in. For example, corn can be found in ketchup. Overall, this film will educate you on the current state of our food system. It opens your eyes to the many problems that exist within the food industry. The film does have gruesome footage. It was hard for me to watch at some points because of the blood and the butchering scenes of the animals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern Muckraker Robert Kenner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Food Inc., director Robert Kenner takes a muckraker's approach as he examines the ways in which health and safety are overlooked and ignored when it comes to food production. This shocking expose shines a dim light on the many unfortunate truths about large scale food production taking place daily in the United States.Our nation's entire food production is controlled by only a few multinational corporations. These companies put profit ahead of consumer health and wellbeing, causing the nation, as a whole, to suffer. Kenner highlights the fact that only four companies control 80% of our meat today whereas in 1970 six companies produced 20% of our meat. This giant shift throughout the years is as alarming as the presence of contamination and lack of nutrition in our food today. Perhaps the most saddening story in Food Inc. is the story of a young, healthy boy who ate an E-coli contaminated burger and died only 12 days later. The lack of regulation and standards when it comes to reducing pathogens in meat are what prompted groups to fight for the legislation of Kevin's Law, in memory of the boy who died from E-coli.This documentary exposes the fact that industries don't want you to know the truth about what you are really eating. In Food, Inc., only one "farmer" agreed to filming in their chicken houses. The reality is that food is produced in factories, not farms. Corporations have taken sickening steps to generate profit. Food, Inc. pulls on viewers' heart strings as clips of large numbers of cattle forced together in tight spaces are shown and chicken houses of thousands of chickens living in complete darkness for their whole lives. A standard chicken is born and grows fully in three months which has been cut down dramatically to 48 days. These chickens are also fed genetically modified food to make them fatter, faster. It is hard to shake the inhumane and unsanitary conditions imposed on the livestock. The cruel circumstances that these animals have to endure are hard to watch at many points in the documentary, but the effect this food production has on human beings has taken an even more devastating toll.Food, Inc. opens with the thought provoking sentence, "The way we eat has changed more dramatically in the past 50 years than in the previous 10,000 years." Now, more than ever before, we are oblivious to the food we put in our bodies. Kenner jokingly states that there are no seasons in the supermarket anymore. Any type of food is available year round, thanks to genetic modification. An alarming 70% of processed foods in American supermarkets contain genetically modified ingredients. Nowadays, our food is drowned in sugar and refined carbohydrates, leaving the list of what is okay to buy and eat rather short. For many people though, the quickest choice is usually the one that wins, every time. A hungry family in the documentary is fed by a fast food restaurant for only $11.42. Although terribly unhealthy and high in calories and carbohydrates, it is the most cost effective decision for them. A trip to the grocery store only discourages the family more, as they do not have enough money to buy the expensive fruits and vegetables. We are subsidizing food that makes us sick. Because of subsidized corn, it's less costly to buy the double cheeseburgers and sodas instead of the non-subsidized head of broccoli.Who we are as a nation is redefined as we become overwhelmed with a large population of obese. By 2030, 42% of Americans will be obese. If that isn't a wake up call, I don't know what is. It is sad to learn about the large number of obese children as well as the rising rate of diabetes in the U.S. In a teen advocacy group portrayed in the documentary, almost everyone raised their hand when asked if they knew somebody with diabetes. It quickly becomes a reality check as we wonder if healthy homemade meals are now a thing of the past.Food, Inc. details the ways in which corporate giants look for ways to increase efficiency and profits with destructive consequences for consumers. This jaw dropping expose revealing e-coli contaminated beef, chickens too large to walk, pesticide flooded vegetables, and ammonia washed beef are only a few of the factors that make up what's become of modern day food production. These grim and unsettling facts lead to a long list of health issues including obesity and diabetes as the most prevalent. Although unfortunate to learn more about the often overlooked factors that affect animals, workers and consumers, it is informative nonetheless. After an extremely eye opening 90 minutes, the film ends with a positive message to its viewers. This unhealthy food system can be changed by the people living within it. By purchasing food from companies that treat its workers, animals and consumers with decency, and buying organic, locally grown fruits and vegetables we can pave the way for future generations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whether You're Health-Conscious Or Not, You Have To Watch This.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Entering through the back door of the fast food industry &amp; exposing the ugly truth about the American agribusiness that's controlled &amp; run by corporates, Food, Inc. is one of the most intriguing documentaries I've seen for it covers one of the most essential issues existing not only in United States but the whole world, and is as entertaining as it is enlightening.Food, Inc. takes us on a tour that shows where &amp; how the food that we buy &amp; eat on a daily basis actually comes from and that the entire food industry is controlled by a bunch of multinational corporations which exert more control over others by producing large quantities of fast food at low prices which results in enormous profits, and that their major emphasis is on money rather than health of its consumers or quality of its products.This documentary is not only an exposure of the widespread obesity &amp; health-related problems existing around the world but also shows the clever implementation of corporate farming's business model which subtly controls what we eat &amp; how we eat, has near-complete disregard for the health &amp; safety of food, animals, employees or even consumers, and how even the government chooses to ignore it despite being aware of this problem.On an overall scale, Food, Inc. exhibits that it's not entirely the fault of consumers who are drawn to fast food in their ever busy lives for they are tempted to go for these unhealthy options, thanks to its low price model &amp; instant gratification. Although this documentary majorly discusses the existing problem in America, it can be applied to many other developed &amp; developing nations as well. Health-conscious or not, Food, Inc. is for everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary focuses on the disturbing truths behind the mass production of food.Though food seems to be in the fore front of people's minds, food safety is not. "Food, Inc." tells a compelling account of how disturbing the seeds; feeding livestock with food that is unnatural to their diet; to shocking ways of processing food; to the awful treatment of hardworking farmers and honest workers. The coverage is comprehensive and simply shocks viewers right to the core.I admire the courage of the filmmakers who decide to stand up and speak against the food industry. I am guessing they may be facing a lot of lawsuits, all for the sake of exposing the shocking truths. "Food, Inc." is a must watch for everyone, and hopefully people will become more conscious of the choices they can make to help the farmers, workers, animals and the planet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Piercing the veil of the food industry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies, even if you do not agree with what it has to say, that everybody should at least set aside some time to watch, if only to know where their food is coming from. Okay, much of what is said in this film applies to the North American food industry, but it can be very easy for those of us elsewhere (such as Australia) to simply say 'this doesn't apply to us because our version of the FDA has a lot more teeth than than in the United States'. All I really have to say to that is 'don't think the revolving door of politics does not exist here in Australia, and just because we have a Labor Party, does not mean that they are not in the pocket of big business either.' Okay, it may not be the case that millions of us in the developed world are dropping dead because the food that we are eating is tainted and poisoned, but it could also be a case of a slow death due to excessively unhealthy eating. Granted, ever since I read 'Fast Food Nation' my consumption of fast food has dropped dramatically, however I have not started a healthy eating regime either. I still eat a lot of processed food, and also note that there is the case that our vegetables no longer seem to have any seasons. Whenever I go into the supermarket there is always lettuce and there are always tomatoes on the shelves.My concern though has to do with the idea of food security, and in particular GM crops. We talk about GM crops as a means of feeding the world, but in reality there are still millions of people around the world who do not have enough to eat on a daily basis, yet here we are in the developed world throwing away bucket loads of food because it is always going off. It is not that which is my concern with GM food, but because the whole technology seems to have been rushed into the marketplace. Also, with the problem of cross pollination, what if it turns out that our genetically modified food does turn out to be poisonous? Will we actually have any untainted canolla or soy beans left. Further, these modified plants are also destroying some of our important insect life, such as bees. Bees are actually vitally important in allowing plants to reproduce, and if our bees are being killed off because of GM plants, then that is going to have an enormous impact upon our food security.The other aspect of this film is how we are moving into what I call a neo-feudal society. It is a society where we are not necessarily tied to the land but rather we are enslaved by debt. It is not the case that we live in debt slavery because of the luxuries that we desire, but a debt slavery because we have to go into debt merely to survive. The film opens with the chicken farmers who are forced to go into thousands of dollars worth of debt to continue to upgrade their farming facilities so that the meat companies will continue to give them contracts, but the value of these contracts are never enough to actually enable them to ever pay off that debt. It simply seems that there is no money in being a farmer any more, and that the Jeffersonian idea of the free farmer living off the land has been destroyed to be replaced by the peasant farmer being subject to the corporate lord.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Food is our way of life. It keeps us alive. The question is whether it is keeping us alive and well. After having watched Kenner's documentary, I have come to the conclusion that the well being of the people is under threat. As Joel Salatin states, "Even if you don't eat at a fast food restaurant, you're now eating food that's produced by the system." The system, meaning the food system, of which "We the People" (Jefferson) should have power over.What is the meaning of that phrase, "We the People," if "We the People" are threatened, if "We the People" are the ones suffering at the cost of the food system's hands. They are stained, stained by the blood of the people.While most would like to point the finger at Congress for the food industry as it is now, we as the American citizens need to remember that we elected those members to Congress. "We the People" need to remember that this our country and we can make the difference. We can make the change. We can lobby, and send letters to are state legislators and senators and representatives in Congress.Let us make sure that the, "government of the people by the people for the people, shall not perish from the earth" (Lincoln).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All About Food Production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Food, Inc. is a documentary directed by Emmy Award-winning filmmaker Robert Kenner.It examines the current state of America's food supply, and suggests that the over-industrialization of food production is making the nation sicker by the moment. Also,it analyzes the proliferation of chemical additives in "natural" foods, looks at the relationship between the lack of nutrients in the American diet and the nation's rising health care costs, and offers tips for system detoxification.The film's first segment examines the industrial production of meat, calling it inhumane and economically and environmentally unsustainable. The second segment looks at the industrial production of grains and vegetables(corn and soy beans), again labeling this economically and environmentally unsustainable. The film's third and final segment is about the economic and legal power, such as food label laws of the major food companies, the profits of which are based on supplying cheap but contaminated food, the heavy use of petroleum-based chemicals, and the promotion of unhealthy food consumption habits by the American public.For most Americans, the ideal meal is fast, cheap, and tasty. This documentary examines the costs of putting value and convenience over nutrition and environmental impact.It explores the subject from all angles, talking to authors, advocates, farmers, and CEOs alike. If eco- docs tends to preach to the converted, it presents its findings in such an engaging fashion that it may well reach the very viewers who could benefit from it the most: harried workers who don't have the time or income to read every book and eat non-genetically modified produce every day.Also,it presents a broader picture of the problem, and if it takes an understandably tough stance on particular politicians and corporations and its just as quick to praise those who are trying to be responsible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Food Inc is an interesting documentary regarding corporate farming and the resulting destruction of the environment. This is a frightening expose on the production of our food supply in the United States which is run by giant conglomerates and not ma and pa kettle of yesteryear. Family farms are mostly a thing of the past, and the way that our food is produced is not sustainable. Using pastoral images of beautiful tracts of agricultural land with narration explaining the radical changes over the last fifty years; and not for the better, Robert Kenner does a magnificent job translating the book by Eric Schlosser to the screen. Factory farming, with long assembly lines produce vast amounts of food as quickly as possible, leading to dangerous conditions, for both the animals and the workers. Monsanto, alone, controls 90% of the soybean market, and is one of five companies in a monopoly position. The politicians are paid off by lobbyists, and so nothing is done about the situation. Monsanto, Tyson, and Perdue all refused to be interviewed for the film. Food, Inc. is a real eye opener.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People in the United States eat at least three times a day. People in the United States have also been in a hurry and on the run more often, there are less home cooked meals being eaten. This has increased a higher demand for more quantity and less quality. The food industry hides their approach to achieving these high demands. The quality of food is lowering with each chemical injected into the animals,"natural" no longer means natural. The top four industries in the United States now control 80% of the beef market, all hiding the same things from consumers. This shows an unbiased opinion of the farms and the industries both involved in the processing of our food. It shows us the things we aren't aware of that is happening with the processing of our foods, including the animals involved in them. everyday we want to believe the things we hear, this shows that sometimes the unknown may be better than the known.</fullReview>

The biggest shocker of the entire video was the fact that Junk food is actually cheaper than healthy foods, to think that a company would be putting junk food at a higher price instead of vegetables or fruits.

I just think everyone has to know how inhumane the food industry is. The source of food and the way we eat has changed dramatically. Farmers these days are more like slaves and are worked by the giant companies who control the food processing. Farmers with just two chicken houses spend $500,000 a year. They only make about $18,000 a year. The companies they work for are constantly demanding the farmers to buy new technology. Corn is in absolutely everything. It's in Coke, batteries, juice, meat, fast food. It's used to feed the animals we eat. Cows, pigs, chicken, even fish are eating corn. People can go and buy a burger for 99 cents, but a head of broccoli for $1.99. America has pushed people into eating the bad calories and the stuff that isn't good for us instead of vegetables and fruit because it's cheaper. Some people just don't have the money to buy the healthy stuff. Type 2 diabetes only affected adults. Now it's affecting children at epidemic proportions. The average farmer used to just feed 6-8 people. Now they feed up to 120 people.</fullReview>

The documentary was very informative about our food industry. The way that our food is made and where it comes from is a serious problem. The main food manufacturing companies do not care about the health of the consumers but simply finding the cheapest way to produce their products. The companies are looking for a way to make as much money as possible and will sacrifice the health of others to do so. The majority of the food that we consume is filled with hormones and chemicals that are causing serious damage to our bodies. The animals that are used to get our meat from are treated inhumanely yet, companies cover this up because they do not care. The way the food companies are ran is causing major issues in our country. This problem needs to change before it becomes impossible to fix.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Food Inc. was an interesting documentary about the way our food is raised, produced, and packaged. It gave an inside look on some of the things that big food companies do to their animals and plants. It showed the horrifying conditions of chicken farms, the inhumane treatment of cattle, and the awful working conditions for the people who handle the food and packaging. It was a very engaging and informative video. It caught my attention and made me want to make a change. The images shown can really speak to you and make you realize how cruel the food industry is. I enjoyed that they tell you that the companies declined being interviewed. Personally, I believe that speaks more truth than an interview ever would have. I liked that it was unbiased and left it up to you weather you should care or not. It was easy to watch and I learned a lot of things that I have been ignorant to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The food industry isn't something everybody is regularly thinking about, but they should be. After viewing this documentary, my eyes have been opened on what I am putting in my body. The inhumane animal treatment is displayed in this documentary, but that fact alone did not change my mind about how and what I eat. This is a must see and everybody should be educated on what harmful chemicals they are putting into their bodies daily. Especially since the rates for disease are so high in America. This documentary went as far as trying to get interviews with specific companies, but nobody wanted to comment. That shows they are hiding something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was shocking and informative. My favorite part was when they talked about how each time your food item is scanned at the supermarket you are voting. I saw this film last night and today I voted at the scanner. I struggled to find what I wanted such as organic meats, beef, turkey and chicken. I had a hard time finding foods without corn derivatives in it since they said most corn in the USA is genetically modified. I live in a rural county. I will have to go into the city for my meats I guess. I would rather eat vegetarian than eat inhumanely treated animals. I don't mind eating meat, but from now on it has to be raised nicely and organic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The food industry is about as tough, rough, and nasty as any industry out there. For all of us, this is about the food we digest every day particularly with the pork, chicken, and the meat industry. The documentary covers a lot in the short time and it could have added another hour as well. The cast is real farmers including chicken farmers who once farmed tobacco. Now, the South is covered with chicken farms where hundreds of thousands of chickens are housed in inhumane shelters. The big companies send inspectors to make sure that their farmers are keeping up to their standards which included dark windowless barns for the chickens. One female farmer insisted on keeping her barn as is with the windows and lost her contract. The poultry business is huge and it's biggest clients are the fast food industry. The documentary also shows the organic industry coming large as well as more humane standards. I would highly recommend this film for students in health and science classes. There is no vulgarity. There is the breakdown of the poor workers' conditions just like the cattle that they're hired to slaughter, cut, and slice. The chickens and cows are being fed hormones and antibodies to get bigger fast. Watch this documentary and you'll get an education.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Food, Inc. (2008)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Food, Inc. presents a world where food has become business. It's quicker and cheaper to eat unhealthy processed food, than it is to eat natural food. Food is produced on a production line and genetic enhancements to natural resources has allowed companies to patent their products. It's scary and familiar, but Food, Inc. brings together a number of topics concerning food that will hopefully make a difference. It doesn't ignore the fact that food is business, but it shows how the never ending chase for profits can result in health risks of a very severe nature. This isn't some treehugging animal loving film. It's mainly a film about humanity and how corporations mistreat the environment, nature, their workers and the animals.It may be a little one-sided, but only because the big corporations refuse to take part. This could be some kind of terrifying futuristic world, unfortunately it's all too real.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Throughout most of 20th century people smoked cigarettes. Now that industry is almost defunct because people understood the health risks involved in smoking. The battlefield has now shifted to the staple food industry where no questions are allowed on how our food supplies are being produced. In this movie what scared me the most was how Monsanto was eradicating all the competition they get from local seed cleaners. They just sue the seed cleaners and with their mega million dollar resource beat their competition to the ground by financially depriving them with millions in court fees. But we are to blame also. Our diet has shifted so much to promote these types of food to be the main stream food source. But we have thousands of alternative food items that are both healthy and nutritious. I notice this when I go to Asian food markets. I see at least three times as much types of food that I can use for meal which gives me more varieties of food I can eat every day.It used to be that Americans ate the best food in the world, but now days, I really think Asians eat cheaper and better food. Their diets aren't so much dependent on meat, corn and processed corn items. The whole world was addicted to tobacco, and it seemed that its grip was eternal, but within single generation that bondage was broken. Same can happen with genetically modified food, and broiler processed meat.There're always an alternate ways of living, and new generation of people seem to come in and change the trend. I think time will come that people wouldn't want to eat so much of these manufactured food items, and shift will occur to a different style of diet.Everything takes time, and we need to see what will happen in the long run.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Food, Inc. is daring and sometimes very hard to watch as it exposes the truth on the beginning stages of our food, how it is handled, where it is taken, etc. Filmmaker Eric Schlosser states that he is shocked that we have to resort to making documentaries on the whereabouts of our food. Shouldn't we all have a right to know? Well, Food, Inc. believes we should know and know explicitly what is put in our foods. The first act of the film is devoted to showing the industrial packing of meat such as chicken and pork. We are taken inside a chicken farm where the chickens are fattened so much they can't move. They live in utter darkness, worrying about their fate and their future. It's disheartening to look at, but it's the reality of what we eat. The second act dives into the industrial production of grains and vegetables, and goes as far as claiming that the way we do it now it unsustainable. Corn is now found in so many foods it's appalling. It's even found in our diapers. Run and tell that.The final act is the most disheartening of all; it's a look at the food libel laws. We see how companies stock up on cheap meats even though it's a higher risk those meats are contaminated and unsanitary. The promotion of unhealthy food as been circling our nation for the last several years and the documentary makes a strict note of that as well. It's a dog eat dog world we live in, and we're all just waiting to get sick or throw it all up.I've seen many freak out over this documentary and worry that this is all true and that we're going to eat ourselves to death. Food, Inc. is taken to the extreme, and I have no doubt parts are fabricated to look bigger than they are. I believe the treatment of the chickens is exactly how it is portrayed in the film, and that cows are subjected to stand and stew in their own manure for days on end. But keep in mind. This is labelled an "activist" documentary, so how much do you think is fabricated? Every documentary is biased and the filmmakers neglect to show both sides of the argument.I'm not hear to preach how eating processed food or "the normal way" is the right thing to do. But I'm hear to say I do it. Even after seeing Food, Inc. I will still eat steak, pork, chicken, etc. Why? Because of the most crucial reason why many Americans, who are aware of the poor conditions of these animals will to; we can't afford it. Shopping at Jewel-Osco, a local grocery outlet in Chicago, Illinois, they have about an isle devoted solely to organic products. The prices? Sky-high. It's not just Jewel, other outlets like Dominicks sell organic food for high prices as well. My family can't afford to purchase organic food every week when we go shopping. We simply can't.That's where Food, Inc. fails as a documentary in a way because it is quick to throw out harsh fact after harsh fact, but doesn't answer the most burning questions; how are we going to fix all this? What can we do? What can they do? Is there anything we can do? The documentary never says. Of course, we could give cows grass to eat and makes chickens free range, but do you think any industrialist in the food industry is going to want to change what has already proved itself to be a very successful process? Also during the third act, we see a family that has resorted to eating fast food almost every night because of low income. That's one other problem Food, Inc. doesn't seem to make note of. The film is so hellbent on getting us to convert to an organic lifestyle, but it neglects to mention how we will finance this huge change, go about it, and how families with financial problems will be able to afford this. It wants the best and the safest, but doesn't answer burning questions vital for such a monumental movement.But I'm beating the film to death. Food, Inc. is provocative and a very enriching documentary talking about something we have a right to know about; the contents of our food. It is filmed wonderfully, and the shockers it shows us we've only heard vaguely about. On its shell, we see its explicit and show-it-all nature, when dissected, we see it's holey and in dire need of some answers.Starring: Eric Schlosser and Michael Pollan. Directed by: Robert Kenner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Important film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This goes into the ugly truth of America's food, and the numerous problems with it. It consists of interviews with experts and regular people affected by it and real-life footage from various businesses(some of it shot in secret). Issues gone into are the lack of regulation, the way it went from farming to an industry, the dangers of production(to workers as well as those who will eventually eat it(!)), and the trouble of finding affordable nutrition. This provides a very fair(unflattering, yes, but it's sadly quite accurate) look at the issues, backing up and sourcing every claim it makes. It isn't overly manipulative, yet it manages to really move you(the story of Kevin is particularly devastating), get you emotionally involved. Even if you don't care about the well-being of the animals(or, along the same lines, nature, the environment) and you don't sympathize with the poor people forced(economically) to do tough labor for minimum wage, you can't shrug off the subject of this, because it's about what you put in your body, what you feed your children. It's compelling, focused, well-paced and nicely arranged. An important part of what makes this work is that it's not hopeless, we're encouraged to help improve the situation and given realistic ideas for what to do. There is a bit of violent, bloody, disturbing content in this. I recommend this to everyone old enough to purchase what they consume. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Business Serves Up Unpleasant Truths</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Winner of three awards, Food, INC, follows in the footsteps of Fast Food Nation and Super Size Me, exposing the underbelly of the beast that is the Big Food Business. Director Robert Kenner draws several key distinctions about how food is massed produced in America.Big Food Business's assembly-line approach to farming has changed not only the way farming is conducted but also controls the diet of America as a result. Producer of Farmaggedon and American Meat, Joel Salatin sums up the dilemma facing today's farmer, who has traded control of their own farming business just to stay afloat."A culture that just uses a pig as a pile of protoplasmic inanimate structure, to be manipulated by whatever creative design the human can foist on that critter, will probably view individuals within its community, and other cultures in the community of nations, with the same type of disdain and disrespect and controlling type mentalities." As a result, large food companies like Purdue, Cargill, and Monsanto keep American farmers on a short lease, depriving them of even the most basic of entrepreneurial rights enjoyed by all American business-owners ? that of freedom on how to run their own business.This shifting from quality to quantity has Americans suffering from more type 2 Diabetes, cancer, hypertension, obesity, and sudden death from an ever increasing array of scientific assaults on farm animals and crops.Author Michael Pollan sadly notes that: "There are no seasons in the American supermarket. Now there are tomatoes all year round, grown halfway around the world, picked when it was green, and ripened with ethylene gas. Although it looks like a tomato, it's kind of a notional tomato. I mean, it's the idea of a tomato." The one bright light in this tale of culinary woe is rise of the small independent organic farmer and the organic food movement's progression from small health-food stores mainstreaming into the larger food store chains. Food Inc. follows a popular organic yogurt and its successful migration onto Wal-Mart store shelves.A "must see" for everyone on the planet who cares about what they eat!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Food, Inc. is a must see documentary film that keeps the viewer connected to the plot. The film begins with a grocery store scene and explains an idea known as "the curtain." The curtain represents all the information the major food corporations have successfully kept from consumers. Everyone should know where his or her food is coming from. Rather than being ignorant about the corruption in the food industry, I am now educated to its many problems. One being the company Tyson, (one of the biggest meat packing companies in the world), has made unjustifiable changes to animals. They redesigned the chicken to have large breasts through hormones. This was permitted by our own government, which is affiliated with Tyson and the entire food industry. Tyson and almost every other major meat packing company is trying to hide what really goes on in their factories that we presume to be farms. This is why every major company declined to be interviewed and show their factories for this film. I was engaged throughout the entire film. I had been reluctant to see it because I heard it made people "never want to eat again". I realized that is completely wrong. It does provide some disturbing scenes where you can see how animals are being abused, but these are some of the most important scenes. Many people are eating these animals and deserve to know about what exactly they're eating. Instead "consumers are kept in the dark about what they're eating and what it is doing to their bodies,"(Food Inc). The director, Robert Kenner, is not the main speaker. Rather, he provides personal stories that connect with the viewer. One story is about a two year old boy who died from a hamburger that contained E Coli. Instead of Robert Kenner telling the story, the boy's mother Barbara does. Barbara is currently trying to pass a law called Kevin's Law. She described the purpose of the law when she said, "Kevin's Law would give back to the USDA the power to shut down plants that repeatedly produce contaminated meat,"(Food Inc). Even after she has been working for six years, the law still hasn't passed. People often blame individuals for being obese or unhealthy. This film blames the entire food industry. Poor people have a greater chance of becoming obese and getting diabetes. It is not their fault the food industry purposely made it so vegetables are more expensive than processed food. The powerful food corporations care more about their revenues than the food they are providing. The film compared the American food industry to one of the most corrupt industries to ever exist, the tobacco industry. The food industry is providing us with processed food our bodies were not predisposed to eat. As someone who is not a huge fan of documentaries, I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film. It is never boring, and all of the information is well worth your time. Not only did I feel I learned something after it was over, but I felt inclined to do something. This film serves as a crucial warning about a crisis that is kept from every consumer. Now I am a more informed consumer, and I have seen what lies beneath "the curtain." This is a must see film for all!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Following up on what "Fast Food Nation" reveals about the all-American diet, Robert Kenner's "Food, Inc." looks at how a handful of corporations have grown to dominate the food market. It's not just the cruelty to animals and dangerous working conditions, but also the highly-processed, genetically modified products that they market, in addition to patenting GMOs so that they can sue farmers even if the latter's crops accidentally cross-pollinate with corporate crops. The documentary's point is that the American diet is making us less healthy by the day. For the first time in recorded history, we are seeing a generation of people who are less healthy than the previous one.Interviewees include "FFN" author Eric Schlosser, "The Omnivore's Dilemma" author Michael Pollan, and Colorado Rep. Diana DeGette. Every person in the documentary puts in his/her two cents about what the fast food industry has done to the environment, the workers, and the consumers. A truly chilling movie. You just might lose your appetite forever after watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie that will lift the veil from the Food Industry.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Food Inc. is a movie about the changes that have occurred in the past century in the "food industry." The movie talks about a subject that has been discussed in recent history quite a bit. The movie takes the stance that our food is not the same as it once had been and that we need to take it back. As any good documentary, the film uses a wide host of statistics to show its point. The film makers show the difference between "home-grown" food and "industrialized" food. They show how these foods differ. They take a look at how advertising and food labels are changed over the few years. One big section they talked about was the health information that is included on food labels, and that is intentionally excluded from food labels. They had established their ethos for the film by also interviewing farmers, consumers, and government employees. A big section of the film was dedicated to the misfortune of a mother losing her child over a simple outbreak of E. Coli. So as you can see the film maker intentionally uses a sad story to bring the viewer in with pathos. They want us to sympathize with the mother, and to feel that the industry has committed a grand evil. Without looking at the film critically I would totally fall into the trap as well. You easily get sucked into the mindset that the food industry is completely to blame for this child's death. The film makers also touch on another hot button topic which is employing illegal immigrants. Many American's are very upset at losing their to illegal immigrants. Though this is a legitimate fear for many people, the other side shows that many Americans are unwilling to work these jobs. Throughout the film, the tactics of pathos, logos, and ethos are all well put together to truly prove their point with a strong message.I found the movie to be very informative. Though I was watching the film critically I found it hard to look past much of the evidence that the film maker brought up. This system is corrupt and broken. We have and will be harmed by this industry if we don't take some steps to make a difference. I do believe this message is something that should be heeded as we are quickly running out of resources, out of money, and out of time. However, on the other side of the argument, what can really be done to alleviate this problem. Though the film suggests buying local from farmers, and groceries, this solutions is faulty. There are 300 million people in the United States. They all need food that will sustain them in their busy, hectic lifestyles. Can we feed these people with a system that allows for organic, "healthy" farming practices? Though, I don't know the answer it is something that we must all debate. What is the message in the film, and how can me make a difference.Overall the film is extremely well done with very good camera work, story-telling, and overall well put together ideas. The films is put together in sections and segments that move the ideas along in ways that seem short and to the point. This is a great way to put the film together because it allows for the younger generations to really be able to grasp the film and its message.I would recommend this film for anybody who is interested in our food industry. If you ask yourself questions about where your food comes from, how it's made, and what's really in it, then this movie is for you. It will help you lift the veil from the food industry and find its inner darkness. My only word of advice is to make sure you remain objective of what is being presented. Don't be suckered into their message without validating it yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director Robert Kenner attempts to challenge us to fight for our right as informed consumers and he does succeed for most parts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do you know from egg-to-death, most farm chickens in America live in total darkness so that they do not quarrel so much, and they are force- fed to three times its natural weight that it renders them immobile to the extent they eat and sleep in their manure? Or that the beef we consume sometimes comes from cows which are fed with dead chickens? It does not matter if the meat finds its way into your favorite cheeseburger or an expensive steak house, their fate remains the same.Every time you step into your local supermarket, you are greeted with rows and rows of food products. You may marvel at the huge variety offered but it is actually an illusion. Do you know a huge stake in the world's food industry is controlled by only four major food corporations in America? This means there is no real competition for your money. Or that nearly eighty percent of items in your local supermarket is made from corn, including - gasp! ? batteries and baby diapers?Food, Inc. reveals these secrets unbeknownst to us for years. As consumers, we have every right to know where our food comes from, and how it is made. Yet whenever there is a case of food poisoning from salmonella or E. Coli, these corporations not only refuse to investigate their possible unsanitary practices, they may even sue the victim for creating a storm in a teacup. It is a lost cause for the average consumer as most laws in America favor these big, faceless, dictatorship-like food companies.Director Robert Kenner attempts to challenge us to fight for our right as informed consumers and he does succeed for most parts. The documentary is made up of many small 'chapters' which debate over a series of interviews and case studies everything that is wrong about the food system today. It is also insightful and thought-provoking, occasionally inciting anger and disgust at appropriate moments. The opening titles are a delight, hooking us from the start, but the film becomes less engaging along the way.The flaw of Food, Inc. is that it is not very well-linked. It is as if the film is shot and edited immediately after a brainstorm session. The content is there, but the ideas are not arranged in a seamless narrative that flows from one point to another with proper links. The result is a disjointed film with information everywhere but belonging nowhere. Food, Inc. is a half-decent film with its fair share of flaws. The important thing is that the film is able to trigger us to do something. Whether we choose to shoot is entirely up to us.GRADE: B- (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Food, Inc 2008 (Spoiler Alert) If you are into the horror fascination, then this movie is definitely for you. Though, I am not talking about creepy ghouls, or bloody axe murders. No, this movie will horrify you in a far worse and much more sinister way. Food, Inc attempts to unveil the secrets of the food industry that it believes are purposely hidden from us to keep us dumb. If we don't know how the food is produced, then we will not fight the multibillion dollar system that creates it.Food, Inc is advocating strongly against certain companies such as Tyson and Monsanto. The documentary does not give too many counterpoints to its arguments. However, every major corporation declined the request to be interviewed, so this isn't out of a lack of effort. It seems to me that the only reason you wouldn't want to argue a counterpoint and prove that you are right is because you know the opposition is correct in their claims.When watching Food, Inc you will finally start to understand many of the problems that are happening in the food industry, and why Americans are getting so fat and malnourished while large food corporations are getting fat wallets. Food, Inc traces the source of these problems and offers such simple common sense solutions that it is amazing we have got to this point of food industrialization.Upon starting up the movie you are offered a very well constructed layout that is pleasant and effective. The film provides titles to sections and provides problems and solutions to these common issues: Fast food, 'growing chickens,' corn, corn feed, FDA's conflict of interest, genetically modified plants, Monsanto's patent on life. The movie proposes solutions to these issues, but states that to get back to the point we were at 50 years ago is going to be a lot harder now that these huge industries are in control.The biggest issue that gripped me after watching the film was how a company, Monsanto, can patent a living organism. That in itself is ridiculous. Then once I realized I could be eating GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms) without even knowing it?because the FDA doesn't require this to be marked on food containers?I became furious. How do companies have the right to not tell us what is in our food? The next greatest issue is that the United States' government subsidizes corn. I always thought this was a good thing, so that we would have enough food to eat. This documentary argues that by subsidizing key crops the government is enabling junk food to be cheaper than healthy food and therefore promoting the consumption of unhealthy foods. The price of a hamburger doesn't reflect its true cost because the crop that is being used to help make it is subsidized.The truth is real and it is terrifying. Our country's food state is in great peril and we aren't getting any healthier, despite all of our "health" products. We can no longer trust our government to regulate these foods, or the companies to be honest about how they are making them. We can no longer trust our guts because the companies create substances to trick them. Food, Inc finally advocates an "eat local foods" approach. Where you CAN trust your farmers (if you deemed them worthy) and you can trust that the food is true to the earth and your health. You will know you producers and know how you food is produced. You can raise complaints and your farmers will hear. If you have never thought about the foods you eat, or even if you think about it all the time, I strongly recommend you watch this movie, but don't do it for me. Do it for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boy, what an important topic for a documentary. Of all the topics that have ever been given the documentary treatment, food is the biggest, most important, most fundamental to our very existence. Kudos to the producers for picking this topic and running with it.We've gone so far off the rails with the production of food in this country. We've given up local production, we've given up sustainable production, we've given up healthful production, and we've given up nutritious production. In true-blue American fashion, the only thing we care about is economical production. Money is king, whether we save it as consumers or whether we make it as businessmen. And yet we're digging our own graves because of it."Food, Inc." does a good job putting all the pieces together: how corn subsidies skew our entire food production towards something fundamentally unhealthy; how corporations and their lawyers are effectively drumming independent farmers out of business; how the mass-produced food lobby (and their enablers, the fast-food industry) manipulate our government to keep this horrendous system in place; and how even such seemingly unrelated concepts as Freedom of Speech, the stability of foreign governments, and the country's immigration problems stem from the food policy choices our government has made.I see a show like this and I think a) I have to give up eating hamburger; and b) how our nation has become so convoluted and so sour that there seemingly isn't a way out of the horrendous pit we've dug for ourselves.I advise folks to watch this film.I do, however, have some criticisms.First, I stated "Food Inc." does a good job putting the pieces together. However, I'm not sure the average Joe will get it, even after seeing it. I grew up in a farming community and worked on them as a boy, plus I pay attention to public policy and all things environmental, so I entered into it with an understanding of the background. I don't think "Food Inc." will resonate to the average layman. There are too many gaps, too many leaps that have to be filled in by the viewer. Such as "why is corn really that bad for us" and "what happens when everything in the food production stream is fed by the same crop". There's a part early in the film where the filmmakers talk about the spread of e coli that I'm sure won't make sense to most folks. Some of the stuff here is pretty heavy yet only gets a quick treatment that relies on audience knowledge. I understand it's only 1-1/2 hours long, and you can't explain everything, but this film still ends up being an elitist film, and that's a shame.Second, at the end they proclaim the salvation of organic food, but they don't investigate the high probability that the organic food industry will become just that ... an industry. Another corporate-driven market where profit is king and lying to consumers is standard operating procedure. At the end, they say "Kellog bought this organic cereal company, and Colgate bought this organic toothpaste company", but they brush off the notion that these same conglomerates who enabled the destruction of America's current food industry will also adulterate and destroy the products and values that make organics the solution. Then we'll have an elitist documentary in 20 years pondering the failure of the organic movement.Of course we might all be dead by complications from obesity by that time ...I give "Food Inc." an 8 out of 10. Solid overall, but a bit elitist and dishonest with itself at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie everyone should see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Food, inc. gives us all an unflattering, unrelenting, unsettling look into what we put into our bodies. It tells tales of the food industry dominated by a few huge companies, where food is not grown on small farms, where farmers rise at the crack of dawn to toil in their fields and provide us with fresh meat, but of giant slaughterhouses, where cows live in two feet of their own manure, corporate organizations slowly taking control of arguably the most important industry in our lives.The movies are broken up into small chapters, easily digestible (heh- pun intended) that drive home a point in each one. It transitions nicely between the tale of a small boy, contracting E. Coli and died twelve days later- all because of a burger, and how we - the consumers - have the power to change how this business is run.That's another thing that caught my eye about this documentary: it provided a solution. Too often have I seen a documentary that moans and complains about a certain thing, that, admitted, should be fixed- but it offers no solutions, no method of fixing it. It's these that I forget, these that hold the least power over me. But Food, inc. doesn't do that. You have genuine farmers, as in red barns, large herds of cattle grazing in fields, pudgy pigs and clucking chickens galore, talking about how this industry needs to change, telling us HOW.That's not to say it doesn't tap into human sympathies to great effect: there are pigs on conveyor belts, before they slide down into darkness, where we can't see them; but that doesn't stop the squeals. You have live cows hanging upside down, whizzing through a large factory, mooing with fear.Whether or not it makes you vegetarian is besides the point- that is not the nature of this film. It is to teach, not change us from our omnivoric ways. The film's goal is to tell us that we have the power, that we are in charge of our health, and that if we refuse to by a product, that product will not continue being sold. It is a call to action against corporations that are controlling our farmers, abusing nature and animals in equal measure.It is a film that will change you. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eye-Opening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a lot of word on the street as to what we're all eating and what we're all buying, but the truth is, that the less we know, the better profits are for big business. I was aware of a lot of the downside of corporate food production and distribution, but Food, Inc. really opened my eyes to more sides than I even thought I cared to know. It has changed my buying and eating habits indefinitely and irreversibly.From the beginning, I knew that this film was going to take the gloves off, and it didn't let me down. Often times, we do find that documentaries tend to paint the darker versions of what we don't know in society, and though this followed along these same lines, I was pleasantly delighted to see that they covered the bright spots and outlined what could be done to make a change.I won't outline the film's points or go into any spoilers, but I feel like it's VERY important to see this film and others like it so that we might be EDUCATED and AWARE of how we're being manipulated, and what we're being fed, both with the food we consume and with the media. Once you see what is going on behind closed doors, you will never eat or live the same.I was already on the green, natural, local, and organic kick before seeing this film, but not only has it pushed me more in that direction, but I've seen it several times, showing it to multitudes of others to spread the word that these are the things about our consumables and our society that we NEED to know! My only disappointment with this film is that the representatives of the big businesses who continue to deceive and implement and promote questionable business practices refused to be interviewed for the film, which was out of the hands of the filmmakers. Hopefully, we can get a sequel one day that will have these cowards face the music.See this film! Share it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a informative documentary that clarified how big business has squished the little farmers and ruined all our healths. However, I somehow felt distanced throughout the movie. I'm not sure why, since they did try to humanize the docu by incorporating interviews with the poor farmers and with a woman who lost her child to tainted meat. Maybe it's because I was reminded of Super Size Me, which was both from a first-person point-of- view and villain-ized primarily McDonald's, which is as well-known a target as possible, whereas Food, Inc. relied more on narration and interviews, and targeted corporations that are less well-known to the average person, like Monsanto. I'd never heard of Monsanto. In any case, it's still an excellent production and worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting and horrid insight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a eye opener of a documentary, not perhaps because it tell's us that much of the food we consume is mass produced, but perhaps more because of the scale of it and the cross effects of doing it. Massive multinational companies hold majority business when it comes to many food products, such as beef, pork and corn. Much of it is connected, mass produced corn is used in hundreds of products in various guises, it is also fed to animals, even though most animals aren't designed to eat corn.Scary is the massive factories, huge scale buildings that process meat products on a mass scale, some providing the majority of meat to a nation, the enormity of these buildings to do nothing more than feed us is absurd. The fact that it is all linked together even more frightening.The film is American and so focus's on the American food industry, the huge need for food, cheap food is easy to provide, once you start to mass produce it, yet of course not only do the animals suffer, but humans do as well. Yet there is for some little choice. It's scary to think that cheeseburgers cost less than fruit or beg or that out of a group of 10 or so teens the majority keep their hands raised when asked if more than two family members have diabetes.Tragic too, is the effect on the everyday people, a small time farmer sued by a multinational, the mother whose son died from an ecoli outbreak after eating a contaminated burger, all because mass production of beef means higher levels of bacteria. These people have suffered, yet they are the few to raise their voice and promote change, which it appears is coming slowly.Perhaps we have things a little better here, but as the film tells us, just around the corner, there is the potential to get food poisoning from eating spinach or eating meat laced with ammonia. It's all very horrid, but altogether too true. You may not learn much new from this, but it is still an education.Now anyone going to McDonald's?

		<fullReview>I watched this Documentary and by the end I was a bit sick to my stomach. Everything made so much sense and I couldn't believe that all that was going on. What ever happened to just having fresh food? It is like the government really doesn't want anyone to be healthy. The only way for someone to get the fresh food they truly deserve, has to be rich. Well maybe not rich, but have a pretty good job. In today's world, it is not as easy and people use what little cash they have to support the companies and sell these tainted foods. Robert Kenner had many great points in this film to support what he was getting at. The one thing that scared me, was the use of corn. I couldn't believe that corn was in everything. The USDA and the FDA could easily help get rid of this, but instead they are taking all the overgrown corn and using it in everything and to feed everything. They feed the corn to the cows and it makes the cow have a higher chance of getting E. Coli. But the scariest part is that if they cow eats grass, they have a 50% chance or more of not getting E. Coli. But they feed them the corn anyways. Just because they have a huge abundance and it helps make them fat for bigger cuts of beef. This film really makes you think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As someone whose mother died of E Coli 0157 infection in New Zealand last year I am grateful that this film publicises risks in modern beef production and related activities. The only possible sources of Mum's infection were bean sprouts or ready washed salad greens. Infection from vegetables comes from crops fertilised with cow manure contaminated with E coli 0157. This is common practise. Do not think it is only an illness from hamburger beef or other undercooked beef. It is not. Mum's case highlights the fact that the impacts of "cost minimisation driven" meat production go beyond the animal meat being produced. We often don't know where other byproducts of production end up. So a byproduct of shoddy beef production can kill someone eating bean sprouts or lettuce.....would you have guessed that? We must take steps to clean up food production immediately.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a saying that goes something like this: we are what we eat. If this is true, then according to this documentary, we are in deep trouble. This documentary provides a candid but slanted portrayal of the food industry in the United States, slanted because the producers of this documentary seem to be using the agriculture industry to promote an anti-corporation anti-big business agenda. Nevertheless, their argument, that the food industry is more interested in making profit than in producing high-quality food products, is a convincing one. It is true that food production is an industry; the question is: is this industry putting our health at risk? This documentary suggests that in its quest to maximize profits the agricultural industry is churning out adulterated slop at cut-rate prices to meet what they believe to be consumer demand. Now that we have been alerted to the problem, the next question is: what do we do about it? Demand better quality food but pay a higher price or settle for the cheap, and sometimes not so cheap, slop that fills our bellies, satiates our appetite but makes us sick? Ultimately, the choice is ours.</fullReview>

The film reminds us that every time we pass a food product over a backed scanner we are casting a vote.

		<shortDescription>"Food, Inc."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Emmy-winning documentarian Robert Kenner's "Food, Inc." is a relatively dry but undeniably important and frequently terrifying condemnation of the corporate food system in all its facets. The film is not unlike other heavy-hitting, issue-oriented documentaries of the last several years, popularized in large part by filmmakers like Michael Moore and Morgan Spurlock."Food, Inc." isn't as controversial or rabble-rousing as say, "Fahrenheit 9/11," nor is it as entertaining as "Super Size Me," but carves a place for itself somewhere between them as a credible but certainly not unbiased, entertaining but not gimmicky visual essay. "Food, Inc." is not without its moments of humor, but it functions more as a learning aid than a piece of pop entertainment, which is in equal doses refreshing and trying.The film is divided into distinct chapters that focus on stories illustrating one of the many evils of America's industrial food system and its benefactors, who in the opinion of the filmmakers are more worried about the safety of their profit margins than the safety of their products, employees, or customers. Their argument is bolstered by the testimonials of those affected by corporate negligence, like a lobbyist whose child was killed by tainted meat, experts including the authors of "Fast Food Nation" (Eric Schlosser), and "The Omnivore's Dilemma" (Michael Pollan), evidence in the form of first-hand interviews with farmers impacted by corporate mingling, and more alarming statistics than you can shake a Big Mac at.The film isn't all doom and gloom, however, and while the final moments feel plucked from Al Gore's "Inconvenient Truth" powerpoint, "Food, Inc." whittles the issue down to a personal level, recommending that we pay a little more for organic, locally grown food, attend farmers' markets, and be more conscientious about what we put in our bodies. It reads like a politician's pie-in-the-sky stump speech (a little corny, if you'll pardon the pun), backed by "This Land is Your Land" (come on), but the message really can't be undersold. It is up to each and every one of us, but I'm still a little too jaded to walk away from "Food, Inc." with any degree of optimism.From a design standpoint, "Food, Inc." isn't a terribly innovative film, and its successes are nearly all stacked in its content column rather than its craft. Most of the information is delivered via unceremonious on-screen text or talking heads, and the characters are generally quarantined to their respective chapters. However, these gripes are made acceptable and even forgettable because the text is (usually) fascinating, and the talking heads have a lot to say."Food, Inc." is getting a lot of critical "Required Viewing" stamps, which it deserves, but merely because it's the most thorough, easily digested, and immediately available piece of information on the subject around. It's not a revolutionary piece of film-making, but again, it doesn't have to be. It's not an incendiary masterpiece that'll blow your mind or have you rolling in the aisles, but it may just make you reconsider your eating habits and make a concrete change to improve the world we live in, which at the end of the day is more important.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever wondered what is in your food? Sure, we all have. Documentary filmmaker Robert Kenner has the collaborative help of two authors, Eric Schlosser and Michael Pollan, in exposing some of the health concerns involving foods that stock grocery store shelves. Why are corn and chicken farmers going in debt, while the companies they provide product for get richer and richer? The consumer loves white meat, so chickens are developed with bigger breasts and grow so big they can't even walk in their dark chicken house. Year-a-round fresh veggies are so desirable that tomatoes are engineered to grow bigger and sprayed with chemicals to give that impression of ripeness longer.The major food manufacturers have helped create the situation that has the public finding fast food burgers cheaper to buy than healthy fruits and vegetables. What exactly is the FDA and USDA doing to help thousands of Americans battling early onset of adult diabetes; fighting obesity and dealing with newer and stronger strains of E. coli? How humanely are the cattle, hogs and chickens treated before showing up as higher and higher priced products at our favorite grocery store.

		<fullReview>Grown from the roots of 'Fast Food Nation' and 'The Omnivore's Dilemma' - the former of which spawned a highly engaging narrative-based film in it's own right; Food inc. represents the efforts of 3 years of dedication, which was made all the more harder with it's depicted industry for the most part at least not wanting to play ball with anything resembling a camera crew.The industry in question is the food industry, whose rise to power in recent years has been almost unprecedented - power that it has to be said that's been concentrated into the hands of a few very influential corporations. The film sets out to cast a light on the practices and behaviours inherent of such a monopoly, and indeed some rather unsavoury things have transpired.The bleakness that comes across from the showing of these unethical practices are at least tempered with some success stories sandwiched in between. The rise of organic products into public awareness and farmers who stay true to their roots being the most prominent. That's not to say that there is a overall melancholic tone to this piece, you are left at the end feeling more enlightened and that you can do something to change the whole situation. But the moments where ordinary people are thrown against the rocks of adversity with little help from those higher up are really quite something.With clever pacing, smooth narration and a point that certainly seems pertinent today more than it's ever been - food inc. is absolutely unmissable to anyone interested in the field of documentary, and for the rest of us probably even more so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although highly informative and essential viewing for those interested in where, how and what's going on with the food that lands on their dinner table, FOOD, INC. follows in the footsteps (often lockstep) of another interesting treatise on American corporate food culture, THE FUTURE OF FOOD.Essentially, The Future of Food focused more directly on the Monsanto Company and how the first patent on a living thing (seeds) has changed the face of agriculture. Food, Inc. similarly rehashes this theme and includes the same information regarding Monsanto's strong arm tactics in keeping their patented seeds out of the hands of farmers who haven't purchased it. The problem, though, is you can't control the wind, and when seeds fall off trucks, or a few fly from one field to another, there's no way farmers can control it. And this is where Monsanto has done the unthinkable: they've built a group of strongmen attorneys to go after those farmers who's crops show Monsanto seeds, but haven't purchased them (nor tried to steal them, I might add). This strong arming has resulted in farmers being dragged through the court system at tremendous expense. And when you're David fighting Goliath, the odds are not in your favor if it takes two years to get to court and your attorney fees begin mounting.But where we begin to diverge in the two films (The Future of Food versus Food, Inc.) is in the meat department. Food, Inc. delves much more into the problems with the mass production of chickens, beef, and pigs (the three main meat staples) and how we've modified these creatures to fit our increasingly bad appetites and diets. Tyson Foods is one of the largest suppliers of chicken meat (you've probably seen their labels at your local store), but did you know that the chicken you're eating was born, grew and slaughtered in less than three months? And that the chicken you're forking into your mouth right now could probably only stand up, taking two or three steps, then collapse into a panting, feathered heap? Do you know why? Watch this film and learn.Another alarming trend is in beef industry where cattle are no longer allowed to graze, but are held in pens, wandering around on piles of manure, and being fed corn. Why? Because corn puts weight on much faster, but it also causes certain intestinal bacteria to flourish and, maybe mutate. Want to know why we've had so many E.Coli outbreaks in the past few decades? Watch this film and connect the dots.The brightest part of this film is that it is NOT anti-meat; it's anti-corporation. Big time. But only when it comes to our food. It wants you to learn why it's so important to shop at your local farmer's market. Why foods that are out of season are out of season FOR A REASON. Why corn has become so pervasive in our diets (and what its doing to our food and, in consequence, to us). Why free-range meat is much better for you (including the bacteria count). It wants to know why you're not asking why.This is a good eye-opener for those who eat at McDonald's every week (or day) and to those of us who shop at Piggly Wiggly or Safeway. Check out the meat before you bite into it.Even though Food, Inc. gave some good (but repetitive) information, it was a bit long. I think the film makers could've gotten away with about 15 minutes less time and made it just as effect in getting its message across. Still, I'm looking more closely at my food, which is what they want you to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fine Introduction, But Not Substantially Useful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Pollan and Eric Schlosser team up to present a first-hand look at the agriculture industry, primarily with regards to chicken and beef. There is also a brief covering of corn, but only as incidental to the meat industry (as cows that traditionally eat grass are now eating corn).Whether this film is great or flawed may depend on what angle you're coming in at it from. In some sense, it does provide a lot of shocking imagery and statistics, and that is good for raising awareness of the issues of this film. However, the unfortunate thing is that the film seems to be mostly a surface cover with no depth. The gist is: factory farms bad, organic farms good. Details are few.I think in particular more attention could have been paid to the subsidies. The issue is brought up, saying that subsidies on American corn ran Mexican farmers out of business. But who is getting the subsidies, how much, and why? I think this is really important, and it was not addressed.As far as legislative solutions go, the only thing mentioned is Kevin's Law, that would allow the FDA to shut down plants that have repeated violations of contamination. That's a good law, but it covers one small aspect of the problem: e. coli. What more can we do through government? Asking people to vote with their wallets at the supermarket is not realistic -- people choosing between cheap and healthy will choose cheap, as the film clearly shows. They cannot be asked to produce extra money they do not have.Many good issues were raised, but I left unfulfilled. Those who know about the issues will find little or nothing new here and may get bored. Schlosser and Pollan's books cover so much more, and it would be a better investment to purchase one of their books than to purchase this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love documentaries but since the age of Michael Moore where Documentaries became main stream entertainment I feel like you really have to watch these documentaries with at least a small grain of salt. Food Inc. is scary, shocking, eye opening and for the most part probably very true. The film also doesn't just show you where most of our food is coming and the problems with where its coming but tackles the major industries controlling the food production and farming and also shows some very scary control schemes that these industries are apparently forcing on certain farmers working for them. The biggest issue with the film in my opinion was that despite showing practical extortion against these farmers forcing them to raise and abuse animals in the most disgusting way to get food from them they don't attempt any resolution. They don't directly go after the corporations. Michael Moore or even Morgan Spurlock (Super Size Me) would pull some horrendously entertaining prank to bring this issue to their doorstep. Instead you're left only feeling complete and utter shock over the treatment of these animals, the corner that these farmers are pushed into.However, even without this you are shown some really disturbing things done to food of all types that end up on our tables. I suppose the goal of this film is accomplished to me because sometimes consciously and sometimes sub consciously I have almost eliminated buying food from far away. I buy local grown meat etc. I'm sure organics truly is the key to health but not always an option but the film still gives you plenty of information to give you decent alternatives. I do believe this issue is very important to director Robert Kenner and that does matter. He doesn't hold any punches and shows some drastically disturbing images. If nothing else Food Inc. doesn't particularly go out of its way to be entertaining but instead goes for the message and does decently well. I didn't feel like it was world altering or "brilliant" but solid. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>one sided, inarticulate, uninformative, sensationalism.throughout the film i keep having visions of South Park the Movie where the film actor's guild speaks to the UN:"Tim Robbins: Let me explain to you how this works: you see, the corporations finance Team America, and then Team America goes out... and the corporations sit there in their... in their corporation buildings, and... and, and see, they're all corporation-y... and they make money."the film fails to convince why large corporation = dark secrets, falling on its face again and again by simply giving different interviewees a chance to say the same corporationy arguments.the film attempts to appeal to emotion rather than give constructive, factual, and logical notions. by showing a little boy on his death bed we somehow are meant to think that an industry keeping 300million people from hunger is evil beyond doubt. even then, the case of e.coli contamination is more a hygiene control issue of the burger store! why are they peddling this like its the end all be all argument??watch this film with your reality goggles on. watch it with happy music instead of the dramatic themes. watch it knowing that the food industry has managed to ensure that every mouth in your country can be fed affordably.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i chose this amount of stars for various reasons. one is that is was really disturbing and not really inviting. it was this because they showed how the pigs and chickens and other things and what they contain when they get shipped in with feces, urine, poop, and other dirty things.another reason is that they exposed what they do to people, either they sue them, lock them up, or and take their business away from them.also i didn't like how they questioned the woman who's son died of a type of virus. so overall i didn't like it because it was not inviting. this movie was though kind of informational due to food market.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>S-s-strap yourself in while Robert Kenner does the thinking for you ! ! ! ! Tired of unbiased information being hurled at you in some factual form or maybe your tired of Michael Moore making movies of himself and calling them documentaries, well kids here's the newest stain on the genre. It has a bit of an agenda....which doesn't advocate any action but INSTEAD presupposes that all consumer food corporations are out to get (kill) us.Seriously, what are we supposed to do at the end of this "documentary" ban food or just the eating of it? The movie presumes that all of the meat industry is inhumane, economically, and environmentally unsustainable. It also presumes that the entire grain and vegetable industry is also unsustainable. When in actuality, agriculture is pretty damn sustainable. So long as people live and breath they must eat...Bing Agriculture Industry, sustained. But no this movie just cruises right over that, screen transition, cue eerie background musics, HEY shadowy figure interviewee #3 quiet on the set, ACTION!FOOD inc. is a total crap-fest to the agriculture industry and disparity on those people and corporations. If you never worked on a farm don't show up for the first time on farm with a camera asking a bunch of questions like your trying to shut down the damn farm. They actually do this in the first ten minutes of the film. So a bunch of suspicions are riled up by the film's agenda when they reveal using the proper sound bites and font that "Tyson chicken would not permit the use of cameras on their chicken farms." But for some pretty god damn obvious reasons I might add but no the documentary changes subjects. Oh yeah according to FOOD inc. MONSANTO is apparently the god project of STANDARD OIL and the CIA, all part of Operation Treadstone, with duh dun DUN...........Matt Lamon as Jason Bourne X. It's not this stupid, it's worse. For example once too much information on an issue is presented they change topics. I think they spliced footage from Tienanmen Square in there. WTF? But hey they put a bar code on a cow and then they put that cow on the cover of the DVD! Get it! Because that's funny and smart!!! Oh IT'S SO FREAKING INTELLIGENT THANK GOD I DROPPED OUT OF COLLEGE, AND GET TO WATCH FOOD INC. AT COMMUNITY COLLEGE! I never felt someone was trying to undertake the American public to rally bodies like the U.S. Army until now. Let this "Documentary" be a statement on the education system in America if anything. I wish I were in Tienanmen Square getting run over by a tank. Needless to say, the origins are Californian, and even in that vein it is a misrepresentation. The point of this film is shifty and moot. This movie makes dumb people feel smart when conversing with other peoples who haven't seen it yet. That's the only true bit of knowledge that can be learned. And to me that's the movie's agenda; it's only valid point, to spread like cancer among dumb American Netflix subscribers until it makes more money than AIDS. You go government</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are a raging socialist you will love this film. I agree that the food industry has problems, but the socialist solution is more government without understanding that it is the government that has allowed these corporations to get to where they are. Free Market does not cross the minds of the intellectual midgets who crafted this propaganda film. If left to people like this your decisions would not be your own. I'm all for information, but this is horribly one-sided. It's not shocking that the companies portrayed as evil in the film would not be interviewed. "Documentaries" like this have agendas, these companies know that, and if they do show up on them they are portrayed even worse. Michael Moore is a perfect example. The show is worth watching to understand the dementia of the left.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Food Inc: Righteous Bias</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Logan Ressler Food Inc. (2009) Review 12/9/2010Robert Kenner's Food Inc. is a film documentary that lifts the veil on the current condition of the food industry and its practices. The movie is separated into sections, each having to do with a particular sector of the food industry, such as chickens, grass, seeds, et cetera. This documentary is the slickest, most professional looking I've ever seen; the special effects and CG images add a distinctly "Hollywood" vibe that a lot of informative documentaries are missing. The movie starts out with this clever gimmickry. The opening credits are run in a supermarket with all the product names replaced with names of directors, writers, and others involved in the creation of the film. This effect is also useful when seeing products being shown, such as the scene where Robert Kenner shows us how many supermarket foods now contain GMOs. Computer-generated images are also used to create eerie fictional scenes, such as the scene of businessmen in the cornfield with the sooty factory imposed in the background. Such images convey the mood and opinion of the film, without explicitly implying a bias. Although this documentary is doused in details and filled with facts, there is a clear bias against the larger food industry as a whole. Any use of pathos, or capturing the emotions of the reader are to create contempt for corporations and sympathy for the small farmers and consumers. We see this obviously shown with the selection of those interviewed, and how. The CEOs and upper management are giving short dimly- lit interviews that make them sound ignorant to the problems being presented. When interviewing chicken farmers, the farmer who did not let the crew film inside his chicken house (at the request of his employer) was painted as an unintelligent pawn. When the other farmer did let the crews in, she was portrayed as a victim of the system. The poor Hispanic family interviewed are shown as forced to buy fast food because they cannot afford unsubsidized natural food a market. The most poignant use of emotion to send the point of the film home was the mother who lobbied Washington to reinstate Kevin's law. The teary-eyed mother recounts the sickness, and eventual death of her son to a politician as footage of the young child plays. While none of this is misrepresenting information, I still believe that this film is trying to convince the viewer about the food industry, not just inform. Besides the use of information, and lighting aforementioned, music is also used to make the viewer feel a certain way. During the factory scenes the music is harsh and partially electronic. The sludgy dissonant tones put the listener on edge, and uncomfortable with what they're hearing and seeing. During the "local farmer" scenes such as with farmer Joel the music is soft, organic and folksy. This makes the listener feel at ease in a simpler way of living and farming. Most of the film's focus is demonizing, however justly, the giants of the food industry. When focusing on fast food companies we see the conundrum of "cheap" food. Cash crops like corn are subsidized by the government, and therefore cheaper. Because of this fast food companies utilize this as a cheap additive and food for cattle, making their unhealthy food cheaper than more natural non-cash crops. Director Robert Kenner also tries to create the connection in our mind of animal abuse and worker mistreatment. Segments showing cattle being slaughtered segue seamlessly into shots about workers illegally hired and hidden camera shots taken by workers. The film also creates sympathy for small farmers, using farmer Joel as an example. Farmer Joel Salatin does everything on his farm himself, and is a likable and humble person. The only view we get of farm industry is profit-hungry and without morals. This is exemplified by the scenes involving seed patenting and how average small farmers can be sued for not using genetically modified seeds. Not everything in the movie is doom in gloom. A particularly insight full thought at the end of the film is presented by Michael Pollan comparing the food industry to the tobacco industry. The tobacco industry had a tight grasp on the market, and few regulations, but now has been severely limited by the government. The point of Robert Kenner's Food Inc. is to convince the average American consumer that the same can be true for the lofty food industry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While it is commendable and a solidly good film, it is neither as engaging nor as impacting as it should have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was my pick (guess) for the Oscar this year simply because of the topic being the sort of thing that the Academy would pick. As it was the film did not win and it was shortly after this that I actually got to see it and saw for myself that, while engaging and important it is not as strong a film as I thought it would be. Let me just caveat that remark by saying that this film probably would be stronger if viewed by those who have never heard any debate about food production practices, the industrialisation of the food chain, the marginalisation of farmers by big business and the fact that the things that are "better" for us is usually more expensive than the low-quality mass produced meats etc in the supermarket. Unfortunately for Food Inc, this group is probably made up of the minority of the population ? and none of them have picked this DVD off the shelf in their video rental store.It is still good stuff though because the film does investigate all these things and it is never dull to listen to. However it is battling against an audience who, whether we do it or not, do know what is wrong with the system and do now that sausages are a million eyeballs and a$$holes scrunched up so without anything too shocking or revealing to add to the debate, it is hard not to view it a little jaded and not be as impacted as one would like to be. I remember reading Fast Food Nation many years ago and I do remember the impact and the detail and it did change my diet (specifically I can count the number of fast-food chains I have been in during the last 8 years on one hand), but this is not the case with this film.This is not to say that it lacks information or impact, because it does. It is always engaging to hear about food poisoning, about practices in the processing plants, about the treatment of workers and the toothlessness of the regulators and in this the film is a good watch but it seems packaging to be less effective. The tone is far too light and the access is far too limited to really have a killer impact and I didn't think that the film really helped itself in this regard as it needed to be clearer, more forthright and with more of an impact in what it is saying. It tries this but it is only a good and interesting documentary ? it doesn't ever feel like it will be a game-changer or something that people look back on as their dietary road to Damascus moment.This is Food Inc's problem. It is engaging and well made, with lots of good points and basis for what it is saying, but yet it seems happy to play for a single base and not hit it out of the park. The tone is too light and the film itself doesn't build particularly well. Perhaps there is an element of me having heard this message many time before that makes me a little jaded towards this film but, while it is commendable and a solidly good film, it is not as engaging nor as impacting as it should have been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To many times have I seen documentaries like these: they present you with all sort of things that are wrong in the world and then they push all sorts of simple solutions in your face that are going to make the world a better place, kumbaya! Unfortunately they always forget to mention some basic root problems that insure the world is never going to be a better place, no matter how many large corporations we fight. We are all actively and daily participating in maintaining the capitalistic system by working for companies large or small. These companies have all gotten bigger by acquiring other companies simply by following the rules of the system: make as much profit as you can within the boundaries of the legal system, and also: if you don't get caught it never happened. The system is not perfect and there always will be abuse. There are now about 7 billion people on the planet. Are people naive enough to think we can all grow healthy biological food for every human on the planet, think again. There isn't enough room on this earth for that. So they industrialized food and made it an industry like everything else. Everyone wants cheap food and have as much bang for their buck as possible, the industry delivered it. The 'evil' these corporations do has more to do with the poor separation of power in the American political system then anything else. But that also goes for the financial sector, IT, automotive. This docu won't change the world and it doesn't matter. The problem is not how to get 7 billion people eating healthy but ratter how long can this planet go on feeding this ever increasing infestation called mankind? Wake up and get real hippies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The polemical nature of the film sometimes works to the disadvantage of its aims, cinematically and, also dialectically, as there is a whole digression on the finding of E. coli in certain foods which is simply not an issue that has to do with the production of food organically or not, but on the subsequent handling of it, for such can easily occur in organic products, as well as genetically engineered or factory farmed. That the film makes hay of this point, and uses the death of a child to make it, is a bit disingenuous, but the film also deals with the lax regulations that make such outbreaks inevitable, and the outfall from the death, which includes industry attempts to defeat the law, year after year, and disallow government inspections of processing plants (ah, the joys of deregulation!). Contrapuntally, the film also shows a farmer who raises his chickens in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, and slaughters them humanely, and in the open air, only to get slapped by federal authorities with claims that his chickens are unsanitary, whereas processed chickens are dipped in chemical baths- a classic case of the insanity that often accompanies the mix of government and big business into any area, even as the government's inspection of such businesses has decreased by over 80% in the last four decades. The film also details Monsanto's CIA-like attempts to intimidate and extort small farmers into a feudal serfdom via their legal department's patent infringement harassment, as well as 'food libel laws,' and the gaming of the system by paying off legislators in many countries to write laws favorable to them.That stated, Food, Inc. is a classic mixed bag- too long on Left Wing nostra when it should have concentrated on what it did best- feature raw information which is undeniable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is food we are eating that horrible?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should say the whole idea of the film got 8 out of 10. But I have to give 5 out of 10 for the following reasons. 1. Food industry or government is not the only one responsible for food safety. I didn't mean to be rude to the lady who lost her son, but I have to say how can you feed you 2 year old son undercooked hamburger?! Microbial food safety is never absolute. It is relative. No one dares to say that my food is 100% free of pathogen even though he is doing good work. Two years old kid is still a child. His immune system is not strong enough to take raw meat yet. Please, take care of your child. 2. Poor is not the reason you buy soda. Yes, per pound of meat or vegetable seems more pricey than one soda. But how much you will need of meat to make one meal? Don't always say that I don't have time to cook. It only means that you are lazy. We always spend time on things we prefer to do. There is always space to squeeze time. 3. Costumers pushed food industry to make processed foods. Now, they want their real food back. The thing of processed food that market food can't compete is consistency and well-control. No matter what, this is still a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Film... Bad ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the better politically motivated documentaries i've seen. I agree with what someone mentioned about the ending being a little too preachy... Not only was it too preachy, it watered down the content and the information the film provided (it pretty much ends saying: buy organic and you will save the world and yourself from destruction... what a load of bull Sh@t!) Other than the ending, which was completely unnecessary, the film was great. It basically took Marxist concepts of alienation to analyze the way in which we get food... (it's easy to know what a Frito is but its VERY hard to understand the process in which that Frito is created). It used alienation to scare the crap out of the viewer in a poetic and fact based way. The process behind the manufacturing of a corn chip or a tub of mayonnaise really sheds a light on the way in which our representative "democracy" functions--with industry (in this case Food) becoming the fourth, most powerful branch of government. It becomes clearer each day that America's legacy will be the manufacturing and selling of products which are trash (how many days a week do you open your mailbox to find all you have received is junk mail?) so that a handful of oligarchs can suck the nectar from the teats of the gods. Not only does big business create a system of trash for cash... the government subsidizes it so that these companies can put lots of time and money into trying to convince people like me that their garbage is worth buying. "thanks for nothing" is pretty much the unconscious slogan in every store when the clerk hands you your bag. More films like this need to be made... one's that scare people by simply explaining the systems that affect them on a daily basis. It's too bad the ending just looked like a PR campaign for Wal Mart and big business organics. Its going to take a lot more than boycotting to solve this problem especially during an economic crisis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Documentary but Needed More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Food, Inc. (2008) *** (out of 4)This Oscar-nominated documentary made quite a stir when it was originally released but like many documentaries it features one major flaw for me. More on that in a bit but the main goal of this film is to tell Americans that they are eating very unhealthy and this is causing people to be overweight, die young and worst of all is that it's happening to our kids as well. Another point of this film is to explain that many of our favorite foods are rather disgusting when you see them from birth to your plate. This includes cows who stand in ankle-deep crap and then go into your tummy. Also, the few major corporations that control the industry are all evil. Oh yeah, we have to save the planet and make sure the animals are OK too. The government is also evil and they're being controlled by this evil companies. That's pretty much the main focus of FOOD, INC., an interesting documentary that is certainly entertaining and a real eye-opening but there is one problem. When I watch a documentary I think it should present its case and let me make up my mind. I think too many documentaries today and forcing their ideas onto you and I think that is a major problem here. The documentary is constantly telling us how bad certain people and companies are but at the end of the film it really doesn't tell us how to fix the problem. We get the typical save the planet talk as well as buying organic materials but there are even more reports out there that will show you that organic materials have their own amount of negative things. I don't think there's any question that there is some major problems with our food today but to me the documentary should have done a lot more when it came down to what we can do for the future of things in this country. Again, this is a good documentary but I must admit that I was rather shocked to see how much attention it did get because is anything here really new? We've heard about these issues for years now so I'm really not sure why this film broke so much ground when it did. Perhaps people are just now wanting to do something about it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A corn-y film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adapting Eric Schlosser's "Fast Food Nation" would have been a natural for documentarian Michael Moore(just imagine the zaftig one giving Ronald McDonald a bad time), but then an upstart provocateur named Morgan Spurlock altered filmic destiny with a bit of journalistic performance art, in which the "Super-Size Me" star took the subjective approach to documentary film-making towards new narcissistic heights, when the Sundance sensation almost died for the sake of his own self-promotion. Thanks to Spurlock, "Fast Food Nation" was adapted by Richard Linklater into a wildly ambitious multi-narrative film that at times seemed to be more about the difficulty of translating a non-fiction book like Susan Orlean's "The Orchid Thief" in Spike Jonze's "Adaptation". Now comes "Food Inc", a long overdue non-fictional account of the food industry that hopefully won't be preaching solely to the converted.Under Moore's helm, one can imagine the sometimes self-aggrandizing filmmaker making more ado about the FDA administrators who once worked for the companies they're supposed to be regulating. One can imagine Moore ferreting out these complicit facilitators of a fatter America as they avert their faces from the cameras with pointed questions about the outrageous conflict of interest that comes with their jobs. At a crisp ninety-three minutes, "Food Inc." gives short-shrift to the bought "watchdogs" who helped aid the consolidation of the agricultural gatekeepers with an all-too-brief computer graphics display of their mugshots(I mean, identities). Perhaps fearing accusations of a liberal slant, the filmmaker doesn't try hard enough to make these people who, at the behest of their friends, play loose and free with people's lives, more accountable through a confrontational, pro-active approach, which is Moore's specialty. Throughout "Food Inc.", disclaimer after disclaimer state that the desired interview subjects were not available for comment start to annoy, because muckraking aficionados suspect that somebody of Moore's stature might have been able to break through the silence. Comparable to "Sicko", in which the issue at hand should be a non-partisan concern(as health care was), "Food Inc." fails to incite the sort of populist anger that the crisis deserves. Ironically, it's the food safety advocate, the mother whose child died from a tainted hamburger, who links agricultural deregulation practices with conservative ideology, when she identifies herself as a lifelong republican in the state capitol building, en route to a meeting with a democratic senator.This time, it's no laughing matter that there's "s*** in the meat," like it was in the Linklater film, in which the fast food executive(played by Greg Kinnear) learns about the beef industry's dirty little secret from his boss, and from one of the higher-ups(played by Bruce Willis). In "Food Inc.", at its most sobering, the filmmaker puts a human face on the toll that unconscionable avarice breeds, as the audience contemplates the boy in the video; the boy who ate s*** and literally died. Since "Food Inc." never aspires to be a populist entertainment(some may argue that Moore's op-ed manner of documentary film-making dumbed down the genre), such obviously gut-wrenching material doesn't come across as exploitative. In "Fahrenheit 9/11", the segment in which Moore hugs the inconsolable mother of a dead Iraqi war soldier, who the former president predictably wouldn't fit her in his schedule, may smack some as a cheap stunt to manipulate the audience into tears. Under Moore's stewardship, one can imagine a scenario where the filmmaker would make a shameless attempt to confront the camera-shy interview subjects by evoking the child's memory while they elude his badgering. Moore's grandstanding tactics somehow managed to remake NRA spokesperson Charlton Heston into a sympathetic figure in "Bowling for Columbine", when his harassment of the aging actor ended with the filmmaker leaving the photo of a gun victim at his front door. While "Food Inc." is a far less dynamic movie because of its failure to get anybody important to talk on the record, it does render this perceived liberal agenda to near sublimity, therefore giving the conservative constituency less reason to politicize such an obvious universal concern.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, it's enormously sad and heart-wrenching to see how the animals are treated while alive and how they simply end up on the dollar menu in the fast-food industry. I don't think that's too much of a secret. Though that was a good portion of 'Food, Inc.', I think the main focus was the evil behind the evil. They went after the "how could you sleep at all" people that head up the select few companies that send people to their death as they make a profit. I love how none of the big wigs commented for this documentary. I guess they could've justified it by saying they don't need to defend themselves. I just see them as cowards for not even trying to tell their side. Unfortunately, that was one downfall of this documentary ? it was extremely one-sided. Sure, it's no "Michael Moore," but not too far off. You see the side of the mother of the child, Kevin, who died due to the corporation's tactics to make money. You see the sides of the chicken farmers with heart who make pennies comparatively speaking. You see the "illegals" arrested to save face. But none of the positives ? if there are any. I don't know if there is any good that comes out of what these corporations are doing. I wasn't told any. I was actually told this film was unbiased, but it isn't. It's just another slice of evil-humanity. And I agree. People that void thoughts of humans over profits are utterly inhumane. Yes, I liked this documentary, and it gave me a lot to think about and how to vote ? Dollars over Congress. But, what it should've asked from us: do your own research and "Don't take our word for it.

		<shortDescription>Some good information, but very one-sided</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Food Inc." certainly provides a lot of food for thought (pun intended). It is a worthwhile documentary and deserves some attention. However, it is unfortunate that it is so biased. Full disclosure: I am a journalist who writes for an agricultural publication which takes advertising dollars from some of the corporations slammed in this film. So I may have a slight bias toward farming. But I would like to add a little balance. For instance, how many people realize that E. coli can infect organic foods as well as corporately grown foods? In fact, it is likely that some of the spinach involved in the E. coli outbreak of a few years ago was grown on an organic farm. Organic produce can easily be tainted with E. coli, since it usually comes from animal feces, and manure is often used to fertilize organic fields. But that bit of information was conveniently left out of the documentary. Also, it is ridiculous to blame the food industry for the California family's love affair with fast food. To claim they are virtually forced to eat McDonald's burgers because broccoli is too expensive is laughable. A family can eat a well-rounded diet very economically. And that, by the way, is largely because of the wonderful advances made by the agricultural industry over the past few decades which has made food production more efficient.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good but ultimately bland look at the way our food is made today. Its all the things that are wrong with the food industry today.To be certain this is a revealing look at the things we eat, but the presentation isn't really the sort of thing that isn't going to hold your interest. Personally I started to nod off more than once. as the film showed me things that I was already aware of.I think the film has three real problems. First of the film's problems is that it looks really good. It is in its way a quite beautiful film. How can you get upset when much of what you are seeing will make you smile? Second the film is a bit too laid back. Everyone is a bit too matter of fact in what they are relating with the result that the film loses much of its urgency. While I'm not for being screamed at the film should have made some effort to truly engage the viewer.Lastly if you care about what you eat, or if you are aware of how things are made much of the film isn't anything new. To be certain all of the bits about how the animals are treated and the food is grown, and how its all giant companies and that the prices are kind of fixed to make profit for the few while cheating the farmers, are clearly shown so one can see with one's own eyes, but at the same time there isn't anything I hadn't known before. I wanted to be informed but instead felt like "yes and..?" Its not a bad film, if you don't know how your food is made you really should see this, but at the same time I don't think its going to radically change your mind or make you a zealot for change. Its just too laid back and a bit too much been there done that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one sided, flat argument.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I looked at the sponsored links on this page and guess what they were for???? Organic food products and whole foods market. I get the message of the movie...that the conditions in our food processing facilities aren't great, and I accept it. They are definitely better than 100 years ago. the reason I disliked this movie is it's obvious political spin. It is extremely biased and rarely shows the other side. The only way to win a logical argument is looking at both sides, which hasn't been done. It is trying to force feed u crap (no pun intended). The facts are, that yes, these places do things that are somewhat ethically questionable but there is no proof at all that it does any harm at all to the foods. In fact, some studies have shown that organic foods might not be as safe as non-organic...I even saw a taste test outside of an organic market, and in this blind taste test, most people chose the non-organic foods. The quality of life doesn't affect how something tastes or the quality. If u treated a cow like a king and had one that was processed like these big companies do, the meat would taste similar and healthwise they would be the same. Organic foods are a trend and all this is trying to do is get you to buy organic foods and scare you into doing it. People should know the facts and not be scared into eating a certain thing. People want us to have organic foods only in the world someday...With the way organic farms have to be set up, spacewise, there is only enough farmland and land that could b used as farmland in the world to feed 2/3 of the ppl. That would mean the bottom 1/3 wouldn't be able to get food. that is 2 billion people, and getting larger each day. They want to scare you that genetically engineered crops are evil and will kill you. In fact, they are sometimes better for you and have saved millions of lives already across the world. They put out their side, now i am addressing the facts they missed. it is easy to protest when you're not hungry!...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bellow average, but fairly entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film starts out fairly well. It's pretty clear that it has its mind made up from the beginning, and it's out to confirm its starting assumption, which is that the food industry is evil and flawed. And it may be right.However two things really grind my gears about this, way more than it not being very honest and impartial.There is a story that begins 20-30 min in to the film, which is (and I am not going to spoil anything) your classic sad "I lost my son, now I am fighting for change" story, from a mother who lost her 3 or 4 year old son to an Ebola virus. It's very sad and has the moody music and everything, yet they fail to ever mention any numbers or statistics. How many people eat meat and how many of them get the virus? And how many die from it? What are my odds of death from meat, compared to death by shark attack or lightning/meteor strike? With 250.000.000 + Americans eating meat, some will die from something some times, and from the perspective of that person's mother, it will be tragic.The other thing that i did not like, was the ending (and again no spoilers). After the movie is done, and the text are about to roll over the screen, you get 3+min. of morals injected directly in to the softest part of your brain. "You can vote on this, 3 times a day with your wallet, when you do your shopping" and it's time for change. Just show me the movie, and let me make up my own mind. I am not a mindless drone, and telling me what my morals should be is going to have the opposite effect.All criticism aside, there are some very impressive pictures and video clips in this film. It's for the most parts, not boring (maybe with the exception of the sad mother story) and it have some facts in it, thou most of them are strongly opinionated. Do not get your hopes up for this film, if you are of a critical mindset, and not easily moved by sad "mother lost child" bits. It's not very good and not very bad. I had pretty high expectations, due to the high ratings and publicity of this film, and I was very disappointed. If you watch it with low expectations, maybe it wont suck as much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Myth of Happy Meat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, factory farming is horrible for the animals, and it's killing the earth. The movie gets that part right. But like The Inconvenient Truth, this film addresses only part of the issue. Michael Pollan and others would like us to believe factory farming is not sustainable but that smaller farms like Joel Salatin's Polyface are. The truth is that ALL ANIMAL AGRICULTURE IS NOT SUSTAINABLE. Human overpopulation and plain simple math make this a fact. Every hour a million chickens are murdered in slaughterhouses in the U.S. Obviously, we as a nation love KFC and McNuggets.Polyface slaughters chickens on-site on the farm but sends pigs and cows and other animals (like rabbits) to the regular terrible slaughterhouses. Nothing humane about that. So if Polyface, the shining example of the smaller farm, still does cruel business as usual--what do you think most other small farms will do? And to build many more farms like Polyface will only destroy the earth. There's no room to churn out less "product" and use more land and water doing it.This film is not so much an unbiased documentary as it is a slick tool of propaganda to pave the way for proponents of "humane meat"--which is a total myth that doesn't exist. (See HumaneMyth.org for informative slide shows.) The movie guilt-trips us about the horrors of factory farming but, gee, isn't it odd that no one is suggesting we become vegetarians or vegans? But then how would Michaal Pollan and Joel Salatin profit? Their books and farm business are all based on the premise or myth of humane slaughter.Historically, we may look back on "Food, Inc." as "greenwashing" or simply the duping of the American public. Though to be fair, about one hour into the film, there's some basic helpful information about Monsanto's insane quest to control the world's food supply. (For an in-depth look at that problem, see The Future of Food, a film made by Jerry Garcia's widow. It's now available for free on Hulu.com .)Michael Pollan and Joel Salatin talk about the "wants and needs" of the animals. To truly respect their wants and needs would be not to kill them, don't you think? As long as animals are treated as "products" and "property," they will continue to be used and eaten. They will be seen as "resources" instead of individual animals with a right to their own lives.Watch the new documentary "Peaceable Kingdom: the Journey Home" when it comes to a film festival near you or when it's out on DVD next year. That film really delves into the lives of animals as individuals with their own wants and needs.Ironically, no one ever raises the most basic question in "Food, Inc.": Is it just plain wrong to kill animals? Just because we can doesn't mean we should.The movie only suggests that we become nicer killers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The documentary is based on assumptions that size and efficiency are inherently evil. During the 60 minutes of this program not once did the producer try to present the other side of the story. Instead, it never lost a chance to show "so and so company declined our request for an interview" leading us to believe that they must have something to hide so, there it is, they are evil! Well perhaps Mr Kenner the reason they declined was they knew the program will be one-sided and self-serving but we will never know since they did not want to talk to you.Offers lots of criticism for the food industry yet lacks any practical suggestions or solutions to mass production of food (which does not personally excite me either).Most of the suggestions are so out of touch with reality, such as having the farmer who prefers slaughtering his few chickens outdoors suggest that we should drive to his farm to buy our food! Wow! Can someone tell this guy that Americans and the rest of the civilized world prefer living in big cities, far away from any farms and that not many generations ago it was every farmer's dream to get out of farm life and move to a big city? Or are we to reverse progress so Mr i-raise-a-few-chickens-the-right-way farmer can feel good about himself? Oh I know, we should relocate all city dwellers to the countryside and save the planet. Afterall, it was done before, in 1976, in Cambodia...The fact that this documentary had one purpose and one purpose only - to prove the author's firm beliefs (and increase the sales of his books/DVDs) without any real research is obvious throughout the program. One obvious case is the Hispanic family spending $12 to buy meal for four from Burger King and presenting it as if they did not have another choice. I'm no food scientist but I can easily feed all four of them with less than $12 and with food that is not only healthier but is also more culturally familiar to a Hispanic family - namely beans!(my favorite meal). A bag of beans costs $1-3 and easily feeds four people. Oh but of course it's not as convenient as a drive-thru meal! Well, people make the wrong decisions and some big corporations are taking advantage of it. Lets not just blame the corporations if people are in love with junk food. We are what we eat, we as a nation prefer cheap and fast junk food so cheap junk food is produced and served to us! Unless we assume responsibility for our actions we will be taken advantaged of and suffer as a result. Following this programs idea that size and industrialization is inherently evil is like saying Ford was evil because he perfected mass production of automobiles. Of course the planet would've been better off without Mr Ford's ideas, so lets all go back to driving horse-drawn carriages!Mr Kenner ideas are simply ridiculous and typical of a pseudo-intellectual zealot's ideas that are neither sound nor practical and they serve one purpose only - to make the author feel good and smart.I bet most of the advocates on this documentary drive large SUVs and have the refrigerators well stacked with cheap meat. This show made a couple of good suggestions at the very end though, 1) teach kids at school about eating healthy and that less is more! 2) Cleanup school cafeterias from junk food. (We have PA meetings all over the country and we can easily change that) Lets not just take the easy way out and blame our weakness on some corporations because they committed the 'crime' of figuring out how to be more efficient in what they do.I have a few tips that I try to follow myself. 1) Do not east junk-food, never, just forget that it exists. 2) EAT LESS! 3) EAT A LOT LESS! 4) Stop eating so much meat. I personally eat meat maybe once a week and thats more than enough. 5) Avoid canned foods of any sort. Always! 6) Avoid processed food as much as possible. 6) Do not drink soft drinks, ever! 7) Eat a lot more vegetables! They are not that expensive and if you add the long term health benefits, they are cheaper than junk food. 8) Exercise (just a bit everyday is enough)And ask you representatives to promote rules/laws that teach kids from a very young age about eating right! If we succeed in raising a generation of kids that tare health conscious, perhaps the big feedlots will disappear as they operate on economies of scale. If people stop eating meat 3 times a day then they will be no animals suffering, till then, blame it all on the meat-loving population - US!Mr Kenner's unconvincing and unscientific zealotry cause more harm than good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I didn't see this movie...yet...but here's why...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a problem with these so-called "documentaries". Take 'An Inconvenient Truth' as an example. It was very controversial when it came out and as the truth behind the manipulated and falsified research (lies) the movie was based was revealed, it's got more controversial. Does Al worry about it? Of course not! Look at all of the awards it won, including the once coveted Nobel Peace Prize. He made a whole lot of money from publicizing outright lies and those lies have changed the way people live. I do believe that many of the things we do as temporary occupants of this planet are horrible, but their effects are not as bad as the progressive movement wants us to believe.Any documentary that wants to be considered educational, such as those on The Discovery Channel and the like should not have profit as an end result. While people such as Michael Moore want us to believe that he made the movies because he had a message he wanted to bring to people, if money wasn't to be made, Moore wouldn't have made it or any of his other "documentaries". 60% of the profits were donated to charity, but the remaining 40% (~$89 Million) is more than enough to make those that it went to very comfortable; in other words, anything a man says in reference to matters that have a large price tag attached isn't worth the energy it takes to speak it. While I have referred to these movies as documentaries, documentaries do not try to get you to change your lifestyle to fall in line with the beliefs portrayed in the movie. True documentaries do nothing more than give you enough pure and unfiltered information on a topic with no spin of that information so that you can make your own judgments and decisions. I would categorize these types of fodder as nothing less than propaganda. As Socrates once said, "I cannot teach anybody anything, I can only make them think," so stop letting people tell you how to think and do the research so that you can be the one to decide what is best for yourself!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Informative and disturbing, but slow and preachy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films that could have been excellent, but just wasn't. It was almost there, but then they decided to send an array of preachy messages just before the end credits, which pretty much angered me. I don't like movies that tell me what to do or how to do it. I don't mind liberal films, just don't talk down to me like I'm a child. (With that said, conservatives anger me off as well.) Food, Inc. is about how our food industry pretty much screws us and smaller food companies over, to keep it simple. It's first half is actually very fun and insightful to watch. After that, the seemingly forever lasting second half clipped along at a snail's pace and kept us in the dark about certain issues that surfaced, but weren't explored.In a way, it's important. It's important to know what's in your food and how it gets there and what happens in the process. What isn't important (nor is it necessary) to try to influence the viewer with words telling us what we should do. In my eyes, that's just not a good thing to do in a film. The glacially slow second half would have been forgivable if they hadn't done what they did just before the end credits. Other than that, see this film. You might learn something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underwhelming.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this hoping to learn some shocking secret to the food industry that would change my mind about what I ate. Instead, I got a lightweight group of shots of corporate buildings or industrial production that did not expose anything. Yes, it's true, there are large processing companies that process a lot of food. So what??? The suggestion here is that because they are big, something evil must be lurking behind those doors. But no such evidence is provided. The worst they could come up with were subtitles that said "such and such a company refused to grant us an interview!" Wooooooooo! How incriminating. The fact is, there is no real shocking truth revealed by this film about the food industry. In fact, there own arguments support the processors. For example, they site the well known instance a couple decades ago about the child that died from a Jack In The Box hamburger. One instance. Given the billions of portions of beef served since then, and not another instance of this has occurred, I would argue the food industry has done a great job of containing that risk. Additionally, they clearly hide facts about the Monsanto case, showing selected single sided arguments, without allowing Monsanto to voice their side of the story. They attempt to make a farmer who was being prosecuted by Monsanto look like a victim, showing only selected clips of his testimony in court, and not Monsanto's side. I'd expect at least to let them speak and tear them apart if they didn't have a point, but to exclude the other sides perspective makes the whole movie seem like a charade. At the end, all I learned was that big companies control the processing and feed animals a lot of corn. I'm one of them, because I enjoyed my popcorn throughout this movie, but not the fact that I spent $13 to see it. A waste of time.</fullReview>
