		<shortDescription>not just a teen movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of posts focus on the 'coming of age' aspect of this movie, but the very overlooked part is the role it played in helping to alleviate many of the stereotypes a very Asian phobic America was after WWII, Korea and Vietnam.They make a point of showing Miyagi in a US Army Uniform--and a War Hero-- and makes references to detention camps Miyagi's family was sent to (a horribly dark period in American history)...where Miyagi's wife was being sent (pregnant) and where she and his unborn child (son) ultimately die during childbirth. There are also a few scenes in which ethnic slurs are used by rednecks toward Miyagi.Taking this into light, and taking the fact that Daniel has no father that we know of in this movie, the name Daniel-san (sounds like Daniel-SON) helps demonstrate a father son bond that is overlooked. Much of the conversation between Daniel and Miyagi is about Miyagi's great father in Okinawa, because Miyagi has acquired all this knowledge and wants to share it. Daniel substitutes for the son Miyagi never had and Miyagi substitutes for the father Daniel doesn't have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Old One"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My love of "The Karate Kid" is limited to the fact that this movie, if it had been in the hands of a more fluorescent director, could have turned out a lot differently from the movie we all know and love from 1984.Directed by John G. Avildsen (who also did 1976's "Rocky" - another underdog story) and written by Robert Mark Kamen (who would later co-author 2001's "Kiss of the Dragon" with Luc Besson, which starred Jet Li - another example of martial arts in American cinema done right), "The Karate Kid" is by far the best (and frankly, most realistic) incorporation of martial arts into a mainstream American film.This movie came out the year before I was born, and only through word-of-mouth over the time I was growing up, did I know that "The Karate Kid" even existed. I got to view the film my freshman year in high school as part of a class, but the instructor watered down the experience so much that the movie lost its potency.Now a few years later, I finally watch the movie without any intrusion from the outside world and I find a truly marvelous picture that's far better than its many stylized contemporaries, i.e. "The Matrix" trilogy, which is the best example of that trend.Ralph Macchio stars as Daniel LaRusso, a new kid to a picturesque southern California community that looks a lot like something you'd see in a magazine advertisement. Daniel makes the mistake of hitting on Ali (Elisabeth Shue), who unknown to him, is the ex-girlfriend of Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka), and Daniel takes a pretty brutal beating from the martial arts-trained Johnny, that leaves him scarred but with his pride and dignity still in tact.The number of violent clashes with Johnny and his brutal Cobra Kai martial arts friends continue, until Daniel is saved by Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita), the karate-trained handyman of his apartment building. Daniel insists on Mr. Miyagi teaching him karate, so that he can compete in an upcoming martial arts tournament; this requires Daniel to undergo some pretty unconventional training - "wax on, wax off; paint fence - side to side" etc. And in return, Daniel learns that there's a lot more to karate than just fighting and the "Old One" shows him that way."The Karate Kid" is a true gem of a film that's shamefully underrated. I'm glad that on February 1st of this year, this movie is finally getting the DVD treatment it deserves.Macchio is convincing as Daniel, bringing a number of wide-ranging emotions to his role that at first may seem quite perfunctory as opposed to being dramatic. The real star of the show (at least in the minds of a number of critics, and the Academy), is Morita as Mr. Miyagi. He brings grace (almost rivaling Bruce Lee) to a role that could have been quite stereotypical, but is still very moving and dramatic.Of course, what's a movie about karate without the fights? I should note that the action in this movie is very convincing, but is not stylized in any fashion, shape or form. It is very down-to-earth and realistic, and that may of course be a bit of a turn-off to some hardcore fanboys that may watch this movie thinking it'll be something like "The Matrix" (1999) or "Enter the Dragon" (1973).The fighting here is in its own style and mode of action. A number of the fights are quite brutal, especially in the ones where John Kreese's (Martin Kove) Cobra Kai students are featured, as he frequently trains them the brutal way of "no mercy," which Mr. Miyagi is quick to realize is not the way of karate."The Karate Kid" gets a perfect 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a classic coming of age story. A story about a boy who has to face his fears, girls, and moving to a new environment. Daniel, who is a big up stater, clashes with the rich people of the Cali high life and learns that not all people are who they seem. The Kobra Cai, as they are called in the film, bully Daniel and Daniel just seems like he has no choice but to take revenge. So he learns the next best thing--KARATE. Even though he has no idea what hes doing. He goes with the flow. Mr. Mayagi teaches him respect, discipline, and anyone can over come their fears. This is one of the best films of the 80's. It even has classic names of the 80's, like Johnny, Daniel, Tommy, and my favorite, Bobby. So if you don't have anything better to do, then check out Karate Kid. You might even learn a thing or two about a thing or two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Certainly one of the top movies of the '80s, if not all-time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Karate Kid" is the tale of Daniel Laruso (Ralph Macchio), a young man who, on the heels of his mother's finding a new job, is uprooted from Newark, New Jersey, to the sunny shores of California. Daniel's mother has visions of a new start, a new life with the sky as the limit. Daniel, however, quickly finds that, for him, the West Coast holds nothing but hard times.With the comforts of his rough, middle-class neighborhood thousands of miles away, Daniel tries to make friends and blend with the well-to-do, upper-class kids in his new home. At first, Daniel seems to do alright but, before long, he crosses paths with Johnny (William Zabka), the tough, rich leader of a group of karate students who attends Daniel's new school. To make matters worse, Johnny is the ex-boyfriend of Ali (Elisabeth Shue), a girl Daniel is pursuing.Enter Miyagi (Noriyuki "Pat" Morita), an aging handy-man who works at Daniel's apartment building. Struggling for friends and failing to fit in, Daniel finds support in Miyagi. After enduring several beatings at the hands of Johnny and his gang, Daniel comes to learn that Miyagi, in fact, knows karate. Following a vain attempt to speak with Johnny's karate teacher (Martin Kove) about being left alone, Daniel is suddenly entered into the All-Valley Karate Tournament, where he will attempt to win the respect that Johnny and his gang have taken.As he trains for the karate tournament with Miyagi, Daniel learns invaluable lessons about life and love. And brought to the foreground of this karate story is Daniel's pursuit of Ali, who truly is the single person who gave the new kid a chance.On many levels, "The Karate Kid" is an uplifting movie. It illustrates how a lonely, out-of-place kid triumphs against the odds, and the movie doesn't need computer-animation or special effects to get its story across. But, for me and anyone who loves '80s movies, the "The Karate Kid" has to be appreciated for its nostalgia trip back to "better times." For that reason alone, this movie is a classic.I've enjoyed few movies, if any, more than "The Karate Kid." I highly recommend this flick to anyone who loves a touching, uplifting story, or to anyone who simply can't get out of the '80s!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific 80s's underdog story!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I being a child of the 80's have a soft spot for this movie. Yes it is predictable,but what makes it a great movie is the performances by the 2 main characters. Ralph Macchio is great as a teenager that is bullied at his new school. But the movie belongs to Pat Morita as Mr. Myagi. He plays an old apartment maintenance man that befriends Macchio. He becomes his karate teacher, but they develop a great friendship that makes the movie all the more enjoyable. The great thing is that the movie shows that the old man comes to need the kid as much as the kid needs him, it is a touching relationship. All the rest is standard Rocky film stuff, but what Rocky and this film have in common is that the characters are people we care for, so all the climactic scene stuff works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional teen film from the 80s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While John Hughs' films may be the standard for teen flicks in the 1980s, Hughs' films were just a few of the great and unique teen films to be released in that decade. Coupled with Back to the Future, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, the 80s was a rather unique time for teen movies. The Karate Kid just happened to be another one of those films. With the immortal Pat Morita leading the way, this film was not only touching, but put a whole new spin on the `zero-to-hero' story line which we have all seen too often. Ralph Macchio may have had no career after these film, but at least he proved to be comparable as Daniel (san). Sure, the ending and outcome proved to be a little predictable, but the film was still a winner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The late Pat Morita, karate kid man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Metaphorically speaking, the late Pat Morita is the real life Daniel-san. Mr. Morita was humbled by the following incidents in his life: interned during WWI, suffered from a weak spine, short in stature and a stereotypical Japanese, nicknamed "Hip Nip" and casted for mainly comically roles in American TV and cinema. As if through divine intervention, the role of Mr. Miyagi was created, a natural and defining role for Pat Morita. Like the main character Daniel-san, who earned dignity and respect through karate, so too did Pat Morita earn dignity and respect as an actor for his role as Mr. Miyagi. The Miyagi character is a humble, soft-spoken, respected, Asian sensei (teacher.) He is humble not because he is weak and avoids being some bully's victim, but because he knows he holds the fate of all who bullies him in his hands. So it was that Pat Morita finally achieved through the character of Mr. Miyagi in the Karate Kid series what Daniel-san always gains at the end of each movie: dignity, respect, and honor to compensate for all the times of abuse, suffering, and humiliation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic story of good vs. evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Karate Kid is a wonderful film that tells the classic story of good vs. evil. Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) is obviously the good, along with Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita). The bad is the dojo of the Cobra Kai, led by the dangerous Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka). The feud between Lawrence and LaRusso is well-scripted and executed, as is the feud between Miyagi and Cobra Kai Sensei, Kreese. This is the definitely the best film out of the four Karate Kid movies. I grew up as a really big fan of these fans and I'm glad they finally released the DVD set. I've searched the internet looking for good articles about the films and there's a very funny article by humorist Rob Bloom about Johnny Lawrence and Daniel LaRusso on Rob Bloom's website. These movies are very entertaining (even #4) and definitely are required viewing for anybody who believes that the underdog can win in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 'old one' taught him the secret to karate lies in the mind and heart. Not in the fist!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having a man teach you a valuable art such as that of Karate, is invaluable especially if you are young, inexperienced and in a battle with people who you have no hope against. However viewers of the 'Karate Kid' get to learn a valuable lesson for life out of this story, that fighting is a waste of time, and with time and patience anything can be achieved. In addition viewers get to hear the cute pronunciation of `Daniel-san' by the great teacher!Fatherless teenager Daniel is a new arrival in Los Angeles when he becomes the object of bullying by the Cobras, a menacing group of Karate students. Daniel asks his handyman Miyagi, whom is a martial arts master, to teach him how to fight. Miyagi teaches Daniel that karate is mastery over the self - mind and body - and that violence is always the last answer to a problem. Under Miyagi's guidance, Daniel learns the physical skills while gaining faith and the self-confidence to compete against the odds as he faces the fight of his life in the exciting finale.I remember watching this film along time ago, but boy was it a thrill. Sure it didn't have 'big stars' or big action in it. One thing it did have was 'heart'. The character of Daniel was one person that typifies this. At no stage does this teenage loner from New Jersey ever give up, when at times that might have been the best thing for him to do. I feel that this story and character for that matter, is how we need to approach our own lives, because if you keep putting in the hard yards and stand-up for what you believe in, things will soon turn around.The stars of this movie are not bad. Firstly main star Ralph Macchio was excellent as Daniel. I felt he brought the struggling teenage character to the screen perfectly. He is a very na?ve and inexperienced young man, yet with time and patience he makes what was a terrible situation seem nothing big at all. I enjoyed Macchio in other movies including 'The three wishes of Billy Greer', a movie which again suited this tough actor, about a young man who is dying from premature aging, in addition to movies such as 'The last POW? The Bobby Garwood Story'. I cannot praise Macchio any higher.Other stars are just as worthy. Pat Morita was wonderful as the wise and what I feel was the humorous `Miyagi'. His role was just as good as his counterpart Macchio, yet it was also very different. Miyagi is one person that does not like the spotlight, yet when his young friend is placed in a very precarious position in his new home town, he steps in and shows what a great Karate man he really is. Then you have the other side of this story, which of course has to have a girl in it, with Daniel striking up a relationship with the popular Ali Mills. Actress Elizabeth Shue, who has also had a somewhat 'celebrated' career, played Ali. She has starred in films such as the controversial 'Leaving Los Vegas', 'Back to the future II' and 'III' and the 1988 hit 'Cocktail'. Though there are times that you expect Daniel to never make it with Ali, in the end he does have a faithful person outside of Miyagi.The bad guys are not bad in this film either, with that part of the cast including Martin Kove as the arrogant Karate Teacher John Kreese, who will stop at nothing to see the end of the fairytale of LaRusso and Miyagi. His main student and the person who wants Daniel's blood the most is Johnny Lawrence played by William Zabka, and although he has not go on to big and better roles, his bad guy role was enjoyable in the Karate Kid. I did read in one review on IMDb where a person claimed that the bad guys were not given enough of their own treatment. However I disagree, considering the bullying and beatings that Daniel receives, I feel that Daniel and Miyagi teach the 'Cobras' a lesson. Sure we don't get to see Kreese get what he deserves, but if you have not seen the second Karate Kid, then you will get to see what awaits this cruel and relentless individual.The Karate lessons and fighting sequences in this film are incredible. I guess like Daniel, most of the fans of this film would assume that Daniel is not learning anything, yet being Miyagi's personal slave. However we get to see how intelligent this old Okinawa man is, through all of his work for Daniel he teaches him some very basic and vital Karate moves. I love the attitude that this movie brings to everyone, that fighting is the last option for any situation, whether it is verbal or physical. I think this is so true, as fighting gets people nowhere. It just makes life bad for both parties, again this movie shows this to be so true.In conclusion, the Karate Kid is a truly great film, but perhaps I am showing what era that I grew up in? I cannot say that I totally agree with Karate, as it is a very Chinese practice, but if it is based around what Miyagi teaches, that is for self-defence, and then it might be ok. I am sure many moviegoers will never forget the finale to this movie, because I am sure I never will. The sequels which follow slowly start to lose there appeal with this story, but not to matter, if you are looking for a story which shows you that giving up is not really an option, then see what is so special about this story of a courageous Karate student and his clever teacher!CMRS gives 'The Karate Kid': 5 (Brilliant Film)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best American martial arts movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie will perhaps be remembered as the best martial arts movie ever made. Movies of this genre are usually more concerned with action scenes that the stories tend to be poor and appeal to the audience on a short run. With the exception of Kurosawa's films, the Karate Kid is perhaps one of the best and most popular martial arts movies ever. Ralph Macchio, who is also good in "the Outsiders," does a fine portrayal of the novice, frustrated Daniel Larusso (he was 23 years old when he made this film??). Equally superb is the wise and "cool-as-a-cucumber" Mr. Miyagi, played by Pat Morita. Once again, John G. Avildsen has directed a film that glorifies the fiesty nature of underdogs. This is the "Rocky" movie of the 80's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cult of Many Generations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lucille Larusso (Randee Heller) moves with her teenage son Daniel Larusso (Ralph Macchio) from Newark, New Jersey, to Reseda, California to work in a better job in Rocket Computer Company. Daniel meets a neighbor in his building and tells him that he fights karate; the neighbor invites him to go to a party on the beach. Daniel meets the gorgeous and wealthy Ali Mills (Elisabeth Shue) that lives in Encino and they immediately feel attracted by each other. However, the bully Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka) comes with his gang of bad boys and argues with Ali, who was his former girlfriend. Daniel defends her and is beaten up and humiliated by Johnny in front of his new friends. Then Daniel is frequently bullied by Johnny and his four inseparable friends at school. One night, Daniel is saved by the handyman Mr. Kesuke Miyagi (Noriyuki 'Pat' Morita), who was born in Okinawa, from Johnny and his friends and he asks the old man to teach him karate. Mr. Miyagi heals Daniel and goes to academy where Johnny and his friends learn karate and he asks their violent instructor John Kreese (Martin Kove) to order his students to give a break in the beatings; in return, he accepts that Daniel participates in an all-valley tournament two months later. Now Mr. Miyagi begins his non-orthodox training of Daniel, especially movements and balance waxing cars and painting fences. "The Karate Kid" is a cult-movie of many generations. I do not recall how many times I have seen this film, in the movie theater, on VHS and now on DVD, and I still love it. In the 80's, Ralph Macchio was a sensation with "The Outsiders", "The Karate kid" and "Crossroads" and his chemistry with Noriyuki 'Pat' Morita in "The Karate Kid" is something very special. This coming of age story discloses a beautiful friendship of Daniel and Muyagi; the discovery of the first love, with the romance of Daniel and Ali; and the message relative to the importance to find balance in life. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "Karat? Kid ? A Hora da Verdade" ("Karate Kid - The Moment of Truth")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think it would be impossible to make a movie centered around a karate tournament that would be even close to as good as "The Karate Kid" is. I think this movie is just brilliantly done.The plot of this movie is really great. It has been done before, but it seems very well done in this movie. The characters in this film are unbelievably memorable as well. How many times has Mr. Miyagi been parodied in pop culture? He is a magnificent character. John Kreese is also great as the evil to compliment Miyagi's good. Daniel and Johnny are also very good in their roles.The ending of this movie is very good too. Daniel overcomes great adversity and wins with the crane kick. Good stuff.The sequel was good too, but it couldn't top the original and I don't expect the coming remake to be able to either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Best movie ever!!! The chemistry between Ralph Macchio and Elisabeth Shue is pure gold! This movie is really relatable to just about everyone who ever got picked on. I also think Pat Morita did a great job in reducing vocabulary while retaining intelligence for this movie. Another thing that really impressed me was that I heard that Billy Zabka really took that kick to the face in the conclusion of the tournament. The characters really play off of each other and the result is astounding. One thing however I find almost unbelievable, is that in this movie, Ralph Macchio is almost 23 years old. With his ability to pull off such a young role and his performances in The Outsiders along with these Karate Kid movies I believe he is one of the best actors ever. All in all, this movie is a must see and an extremely good classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a legend in my eyes. It has a great plot, 2 brilliantly played leading actors, and a great finish. It also has a great cast (but the Cobra Kai weren't really successful in their movies?? They hardly featured in any). You could say it was a one hit wonder as the numbers 2 and 3 failed to live upto the hype of 1. Elisabeth Shue is gorgeous in this movie, and she and Johnny (from the Cobra Kai) are very likable characters.I remember back in the day when me and my friends watched this over and over in our childhood (ALONG with Home Alone!!) (I'm now 24), but still enjoy this flick 20 years after it was first released! Can you believe it? It should have had more ratings than 6. The story is about an underdog (Daniel LaRusso), and his efforts to defeat the wrongly taught 'bad' students. "Teacher say, Student do"...Mr Miyagi - played by Pat Morita, is - amazing. It should have won him the Oscar award, but he must feel privileged to be the first Asian-American actor to be nominated for an Oscar award.Mr Miyagi and Daniel click from the very beginning. It's a superb movie, and shivers run through my back every time I watch the ending ** SPOILER ** and the infamous 'crane finish'. Mostly because it reminds me of the olden days, and the whole 'underdog spirit' thing. It really does motivate you. It has some very distinctive lines that were made popular by this movie. In the late 80's and early 90's you had all the kids doing karate and saying 'wax on, wax off' they still do! It has some memorable quotes, some which are on the IMDb (kk1) page.IMO, it's a legend, and legends never die. This will be played over and over...and over again on my poor DVD player for another 10 years (hopefully!).I really do recommend it to the younger generation....BRILLIANT MOVIE...9/10!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was hoping for a very good film in The Karate Kid. When it was over I knew it had become one of my favorites. There is so many things to like about this movie. The cinematography is gorgeous, the acting is fantastic, the dialogue is great, the emotion is strong, the characters are likable and the music is fantastic. I can't believe that this only has a 6.9 and that awful film Avatar has an 8.3. This is in my opinion the most underrated movie of all time. How could anyone not like it. There is one scene in the film that cinematography is so good that my flat screen couldn't even fully capture the moment. Ralph Macchio gives what is in my opinion one of the most underrated performances in film history. When people think of a fantastic child actor performance nobody ever thinks about Macchio in The Karate Kid. They think of Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense, or Jodie Foster in Taxi Driver. Me personally I think that Macchio deserves to be mentioned in the conversation of great child acting. All others in the cast do a great job, but the person who steals the show is Pat Morita as Mr. Miyagi. He deserved the Oscar he got nominated for. The music is great. Both the orchestrated score and the 80's pop songs are really good. The one that stands out though is "Your the Best" by Joe Esposito. It is one of the catchiest songs you'll ever hear. The strength of the emotion in this film is very strong like the director's other film Rocky. That's another thing I want to mention. I hate how this is underneath the shadow of Rocky. Rocky is excellent, but so is this film. In fact this film may be even better. This film really needs more love. It is a great movie that even with all these years that have went by is still not truly given the credit it deserves.4 stars out of 4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm Gonna go ahead and say That The Karate kid should be in the Top 250 of the IMDb, because not only is it a good family movie, there is a moral inside of it that today is quite easy to emulate but is rarely done as well as John. G. Avildsen has done in this film. What is this moral? Being a father. While Daniel Larusso might not have a father, Mr. miyagi becomes the father he never had, and "daniel-san" as Mr. Miyagi calls him, is the son he never had. they bond in that way and it's something that should be done more often in movies.Daniel LaRusso (Played by Ralph Macchio) has left new jersey with his mother to start a new life in the Run down part of what might be Los Angeles, California. Once he is there, he encounters a cute girl (played by Elizabeth Shue) But is quickly bested in a fight for her by Johnny Lawrence, A Black-belt Karate student of one of the most brutal karate teachers of all time (Played by Martin Kove, also known as Ericson from Rambo: First blood part II) After Constant bullying by the Cobra Kai (Johnny's Gang) Daniel turns to Mr. Miyagi (Played by Pat Morita, who has since passed away) for help, and finds not only the skills to earn Johnny's Respect, But a father in the form of an old Okinawan Janitor.This movie defines Good. There is nary a bad thing in it. The soundtrack is great. The fighting Sequences are pretty good, and it's good to tune into AMC to catch this on a late Sunday night.10/10</fullReview>

Mr. Miyagi. Miyagi teaches the young man how to defend himself with the use of Karate and somehow Daniel finds himself entered in a competition were he competes against his bullies.I watched this previously on ITV on a re-run....Watching it I felt a bit of my childhood were I portrayed the moves; watching this back the fight scenes with Daniel are a little outdated but its the bond between the old man and the boy that strike a cord with the audience. I must admit after watching this I wanted to learn Karate like many other kids... Will always be one of the greatest under-dog movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Karate Kid is directed by John G. Avildsen and written by Robert Mark Kamen. It stars Ralph Macchio, Pat Morita (Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor) and Elisabeth Shue. Daniel LaRusso (Macchio) moves with his mother (Randee Heller) from Newark, New Jersey to Reseda, a neighbourhood in the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, California. Pretty much from the off Daniel finds he doesn't belong and quickly incurs the wrath of Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka) who is the ex-boyfriend of the only person Daniel has connected with; Ali Mills (Shue). Not good since Johnny is an ace karate student from the Cobra Kai dojo, a place where the students are taught winning is everything by tough ex-forces sensei, John Kreese (Martin Kove). But salvation and a stop to the beatings at the hands of Lawrence and his bully loving friends may come in the form of the quirky but kind handyman at the apartment complex; Mr. Miyagi (Morita). In 1976 John G. Avildsen had directed one of the most loved of all the underdog comes good movies, Rocky. Fast forward to 1984 and we find Avildsen treading on the same turf, only for a younger audience. What was to follow would be a monster hit movie (it made over $90 million domestically alone), that spawned three sequels, a remake, pop culture bonanza and more telling; got karate back in the headlines some 11 years after the tragic death of Bruce Lee. Its appeal is not hard to fathom, geeky young guy gets beat up on by some suspiciously Aryan bully types, forms a wonderful and warm friendship with sage old Chinaman, becomes a karate hero after being tutored in an unorthodox manner by kindly Chinaman, then kicks Aryan dudes butt. What's not to like there? Hell us young men even had the all American cutie pie looks of Shue (she was 21 at the time and Macchio 23) to admire as we joined Daniel in chopping, kicking and falling on our asses as we tried the famous "Crane Kick". Sure some of it looks creaky now, but it's creakiness with an 80s charm that still engages today. So lets get waxing on and waxing off and relieve the moment when we all cheered at the climax of this simple, yet utterly beguiling movie. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the top films of all time. I don't know how it got a '6' . It deserves a '9' at the very least. The magic between Ralph and Pat are unmatched. I loved the ending - powerful, well-done. Well-directed. Well-acted. Beautiful story. Not a single bad moment, except the profanity in the middle. Otherwise, perfectly balanced film. I watched this in 1984 in the theaters and no one moved after the end credits. It was that powerful. Ask anyone then if they would give it a '6' and they would have thought you were crazy. But today's generation gives 'Sin City' an '8' - what does this tell you about our society? What does it tell you about a society that says 'God is dead, but Elvis is alive?'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An 80's Classic!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I re-watched this movie today to get ready for the remake. I bet every kid in the 80's grew up with this film. Ralph Macchio stars as Daniel LaRusso, who is forced to move to Reseda. He meets Ali Mills, and makes an enemy with her ex-boyfriend, Johnny. When Daniel is violently bullied, the handyman named Mr. Miyagi agrees to teach him how to defend himself in the art of karate. At first, Daniel thinks he's being treated like a slave, because he has to wax the cars, paint his house but he was really learning karate moves the whole time. Mr. Miyagi gets Daniel ready for an 'All Valley Karate Tournament' where he must confront his enemies, and Johnny and see if he has what it takes to be the best and win the gold. I highly recommend THE KARATE KID!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every time this is on TV, I have to watch it. It is as relatable now as it was when it was made- a new kid moving to a new place, starting at a new school and getting bullied by tougher kids.The reason I enjoy the film so much is the interaction between Ralph Macchio (Daniel) and Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita). They just work so well together in this film. I love Mr. Miyagi, he is such a lovely character who looks very stern at times but other times, he comes across as very warm and funny who has some of the best scenes in the movie and had me in stitches.It doesn't matter that I know what happens at the end, I still get gripped by the ending, it is a very feel good movie where the bullies get their come-uppance and even respect Daniel at the end. Love the song that plays during the Karate Tournament "You're the best", just works well with the action.A childhood film I continue to have a lot of warmth for even today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An 80's classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best movies of the 1980's happens to be "The Karate Kid". Ralph Macchio who happens to play Daniel Larusso did S.E. Hinton's "The Outsiders" earlier. Daniel(Macchio) is a transplant from New Jersey, runs afoul with bullies from a karate school known as Cobra Kai. Johnny Lawrence(William Zabka) is the ruthless of the bunch. Their sensei John Kreese(Martin Kove) is barbaric. Then there's Mr. Miyagi(Pat Morita, "Happy Days", "O'Hara" and others) who happens to be Daniel's sensei. His ways are more peaceful, and his patience can be limited with how he handles with his student. Never call him humorless, cause he can have all the fun with his student whenever he could. I like the memorable parts he says, "Wax On, Wax Off". And the crane technique is also a gem. Then one that blew me away is when Miyagi chopped the necks of those beer bottles. Then there's the tournament, those Kobra Kais really had it coming, especially Johnny. Falling victim to the crane kick. At least he lost humbly, he was no sore sport unlike the others. However, I think they are starting to see the errors of Kreese's ways. Some are, some aren't, who knows? This movie is a gem and Elisabeth Shue's role of Ali is remarkable! WAY TO GO! THE KARATE KID!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who thinks this movie is terrible is either a) an idiot or b) a total dipshit who tries to talk about the realism of the film. Firstly it's a film, as a film it doesn't need to be realistic. So anyone saying the cheerleader wouldn't go out with the school wimp hasn't realised that the wimp is Ralph Macchio aka ladykiller. Secondly Mr Miyagi is an inspiration to everybody. He's an unassuming okinawan who just wants to have a son after his son and wife were taken away from him. He finds this bond with Daniel son. The moral of the story is it's OK to antagonise several school bullies if you have the support of a zen master like Miyagi. The only reason he lost out on an Oscar is that he was up against Haing S Ngor. BANZAI!!!!!</fullReview>

I know that reason: people can learn something from them... at least, those that follow deeper than what they see on the screen.Not only can everyone learn from this movie, but part of what makes this movie so memorable is the fact that it's very quotable, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a movie from the 80's that you couldn't find a single memorable quote from.I give this movie a solid 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>EXCELLENT "movie with a message" setting epochal trends, but the original script was much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the success of a movie were to be measured by the rip-offs and spurious sequels it generates, Karate Kid would be in Star Wars' league; in fact it brought to the zenith the 1980s frenzy for martial arts movies, apparently waning after the 1970s Bruce Lee era, and contributing western settings to martial arts typical of Hong Kong with their oriental flavor (men jumping building high on wires etc). This is an excellent movie that closely reminds Rocky I. I just read the FULL, ORIGINAL Mark Kamen SCRIPT of the movie on American Film Scripts Online and I must admit many scenes and character development never made it on film, or were lost in the cutting room. For example, there is one scene in which Daniel rescues Ali from "greasers" who try to abduct and to rape her. The atmosphere of the "arcade alley" seems darker on script than in the film we watched, with lots of unsavory types around. Daniel's name is "WEBER" in the script and his father abandoned him as a child (thus not deceased as in the movie ); there is an angle describing Daniel's mother job and a flirtation with a say co-worker, also absent in the movie. Some scenes we watched on screen are totally absent from the script. Akin to Rocky, Karate Kid delivered some "American dream" epic tailored to working class people ala Rocky Balboa... Daniel is a working class hero whose exploits are great, but within reach (not another Clark Kent or Commando character ).Worth noting, in this kind of movie main actors may (or may not ) deliver solid acting, but supporting actors are invariably bland to opaque. In Karate Kid not only do Daniel &amp; Miyagi deliver good acting (with Norita being better in the league of Alec Guinness' "Kenobi" and Shue distant third ), but minor co-stars like Zabka, Kove, Thomas etc deliver remarkable cameos...Kove's piercing portrait of nasty sensei Kreese is light years ahead of say his bland performance in Rambo II.A true classic I have watched many times without getting tired.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another great 80's movie! My mom was a teenager in the 80's so I love watching this one with her. We both LOVE Ralph Macchio! This is a great story of how a teenage boy moves across the country and deals with girls, bullies, and trying to defend himself. Movies like this only come around once in a while. The acting was very convincing, the storyline was excellent, and Ralph Macchio is definitely one of a kind, and even though he was twenty-three while filming this, he COULD pass for 15, no doubt of it. I recommend this movie for anyone, it doesn't matter if they're eight years old or eighty years old. I know they'll enjoy this movie.

		<fullReview>This is a heartwarming, nicely paced, relaxed flick which plays with the age old 'Rocky'/'Coming of Age' formulae-and does them to a T by treating the material w/ such respect. Highlights? The boat-scene, 'Wax-on/Wax-off', where Miyagi gives him a car-pick one-, heck his whole up and down relationship w/ 'Alley', etc.-all quite good, moving, etc. It's a fun movie but tautly directed.John Avildson never was better than this, to my thinking, save for Rocky of course. And Macchio-whatever happened to him? Plagued by Robbie Benson disease, I guess-23 looking like a 15 year old, last sighted in '92's 'Cousin Vinny', where he was in his 30s and still babyfaced.I enjoy the bit parts here-Steve McQueen's son, Chad, Martin Kove, William 'Back to School/Equalizer' Zabka, etc. It's always good to see a cast rise to the occasion.#2 was alright, #3 looked kinda bad, #4-well, it had Hilary Swank...this is the one to see, the one everyone remembers, check it out.*** outta ****</fullReview>

A time when the " bad guy " had no honor, but would rarely curse...lol. ( Hey, this was a PG movie after all, wasn't it? LOL. ) " Oh, I think nothing of cheating and being mean, because THAT'S what makes the audience dislike me and root for the hero, but I just can't use filthy words. " I miss that.I love the movie because it takes me back to my childhood and a simpler time. A good guy and a bad guy, with the good guy coming out on top.

		<shortDescription>A movie to make punks feel good...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ALL MY REVIEWS CONTAIN SPOILERS. EVERY ONE OF THEM.Am I the only one who looks at good vs. evil films with a moderate point of view? Am I the only one who perfectly understands why Johnny and the Kobra-Kai's hate Daniel so much? People tend to watch television and accept whomever the writers tell you is the hero. But they never look at it from the antagonist's point of view. To put it simply, Daniel should just mind his own business. There are about 4 or 5 million girls his age in Los Angeles, why does he pick the one who is dating a black belt named Johnny, who also happens to be the leader of an awesome karate clique called the Kobra-Kais?In the beginning, Daniel moves to LA via Newark, NJ, a town ten times worse than happy, sunny Cali. How he grew up there and ended up a punk I'll never understand. When he moves to LA, he meets an equally punkish kid named Freddy. Daniel brags to Freddy that he knows karate and how he can handle himself. Mistake number one. Everybody knows that lies eventually catch up to you, so when Daniel gets his ass kicked on the beach (just hours later) I felt no sympathy for him. He falls for this girl named Ali and when her man comes to talk to her, Daniel butts his head in where it doesn't belong. Mistake number two. Any man knows you never jump in between a lover's spat. Women never fully get over their ex's, that's why when the cops come, they never press charges. Freddy never hangs with him ever again, but can you blame him? Not only is he a complete embarrassment, he's a liar. Again, no sympathy for Daniel.Daniel doesn't learn his lesson. He hits on Ali some more, this time at school. Johnny, understandably is p**sed. So when he sees Daniel in his karate dojo, he takes it upon himself to round up his boys and push Daniel off a steep hill. What was Daniel doing out there on a lonely deserted road anyway? Even if he didn't have a flock of crazed ninjas after him, that's simply stupid anyway. After he fell down the hill, he got what he deserved, and I'll bet any money he'll think twice before riding his Schwinn where no people hang out.The maintenance man of Daniel's building is a thousand year old Japanese man named Mr. Miyagi. When Daniel first meets him, he sees Miyagi at home trying to catch a fly with chopsticks. This alone should have let Daniel know the man was obviously nuts. But Daniel is nuts himself, so the two become best buddies. There is even a scene later in the film where Daniel himself catches a fly with chopsticks. I can dismiss human physics and except Hollywood disbelief for this scene. But what I can't accept is a fly that flies around in one spot.Daniel goes to a Halloween party and makes the dumbest decision I've ever seen in a movie. To impress a girl, (the same one who Johnny is after, mind you) Daniel decides to set up Johnny by putting a garden hose in the bathroom stall over his head. Mistake number three. Not only is Daniel adding fuel to the fire between them, but he ruins the joint Johnny was rolling; a mistake that cannot be forgiven. Johnny is soaking wet and looks like a fool. Can anyone BLAME him for being p**sed? I totally understand the ass whuppin' him and his buddies lay on Daniel. But Mr. Miyagi comes and saves the day, and beats up all the kids. Miyagi is a trained karate master, this act is not done in self defense, and all the kids are minors. Why Miyagi isn't in jail for the duration of the movie, I'll never understand.Daniel goes to the Kobra-Kai dojo and like a true punk, brings his new bodyguard Miyagi with him. He pleads with Kreese, the dojo's master to have his boys leave him alone until an upcoming karate tournament. Miyagi then agrees to teach Daniel karate, but instead turns him into his own personal mail order bride, and Daniel cleans up Miyagi's house for the next 2 weeks. Daniel then learns some karate, gets Johnny's girl, and ends up in the tournament at the end of the movie. Now let me get this straight...I can learn a lifetime of karate from a feeble old man in about 6 weeks? Now there's reality.Needless to say, in traditional Hollywood clich fashion, Daniel's tournament ends with him directly facing off with his nemesis, Johnny. Daniel of course wins, gets the trophy, gets the girl then even gets the friendship of Johnny. Then all the nerds watching the movie stand and cheer. Gimme a break. Who could even swallow this crap? I can accept far fetched movies like Superman before movies like these. This movie is totally fake.If this movie was real, after Miyagi was bailed out of jail, he would have trained Daniel the best he could, failed miserably because of the short time span, Daniel would have been eliminated in the first round, Johnny would have made it to the end of the tournament with some other kid who can truly fight, Johnny would have won, and Ali would have been so turned on by her ex man, she would have jumped into his arms kissing him frantically. Johnny then would have taken her home, banged her one last time, then dumped her for being so shallow. Meanwhile, Daniel would have gone back to Miyagi's house, donned a full maid outfit and once he turned 18, the two would have run off to Vegas and got married in one of those drive thru marriage places. Now that would be a truly good movie.Zero stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underdog + wise old mentor = cinematic genius!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John G. Avildsen directs yet another underdog "rags-to-riches" kind of story, much like he did with the 'Rocky' films, 'Lean On Me', and '8 Seconds'. This time, the film tells the tale of a New Jersey teenager, Daniel LaRusso, who reluctantly moves with his mother to sunny California. Of course, he is an impatient and impractical smartmouth, but the real Daniel - the Daniel that's actually tolerable, is not far beneath his rough exterior. Due to his new kid status, he is bullied by the Cobra Kai, an overly aggressive group of teenage boys that are obsessed with using their own form of karate on their weaker 'inferiors'. Daniel also takes a liking to Ali, who is of course the former girlfriend of the Cobra Kai's leader. Amidst all this, he befriends the handy man at his apartment building, a Mr. Miyagi. Like everyone else, Daniel at first underestimates Miyagi. Over the course of the film, we learn that Miyagi is really a very wise man who knows a lot about karate - the less aggressive and more genuine kind. The Cobra Kai continues to torture Daniel, and he finally convinces Mr. Miyagi to teach him the ways of the ancient art. But it is not just about getting back at his tormentors - Miyagi teaches him to use karate as a way to discover himself, as well as learning about honor, responsibility, and the like. While I would agree that the film is predictable, and Daniel could get on anyone's nerves, the true magic of the story is Morita's performance as the wise handy-man/karate instructor. Rather than just come swooping in at exactly the right time to save Daniel's sorry butt, we meet him as a handy-man first, and therefore learn about him as a person before putting him into hero situations. His performance makes Daniel tolerable, because without Miyagi, I don't think anybody could stand Daniel. Morita earned an Oscar nomination for the film, and while it was highly deserved, I can't really say whether he should have won because I don't know what his competition for the award was in 1984, without researching it. However, it cannot be denied that he displayed masterful acting talent, and the only element that made the unnecessary and very repetitive sequels watchable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Karate Kid is an underdog story in the mold of a previous success of director John Avildsen's 1976 film Rocky.It stars Ralph Macchio as Daniel,Noriyuki "Pat" Morita as Mr. Miyagi and Elisabeth Shue as Ali,Daniel's love interest.The film was written by Robert Mark Kamen and it was directed by Avildsen.The story is about Daniel La Russo,who arrived in California from New Jersey.The teenager almost immediately runs afoul of karate-trained high school bullies. He is rescued by Japanese janitor Miyagi,who agrees to teach Daniel how to harness karate for good instead of brutality.The film culminates in a championship karate bout, pitting Daniel against his sworn enemy Johnny -- the cruel and thuggish boyfriend of Ali, with whom Daniel's love interest. It was a commercial success upon release.Aside from that,it also garnered favorable critical acclaim. Extremely popular,movie spawned three sequels namely:The Karate Kid Part II,The Karate Kid Part III and The Next Karate Kid - all of who are rapidly of descending merit. Inspite of the screenplay being utterly predictable during its time and Miyagi's questionable training methods of teaching Daniel karate,the movie was warm, sincere,highly entertaining and difficult to resist.One reason was due to the great chemistry between Morita,who was nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor,and Macchio.In addition to that,the movie had great soundtracks such as "The Moment of Truth" by Survivor.Finally,it also was one heart-warming story that would be appreciated by teens particularly those who are in High School.People won't appreciate this film at present unlike during its time of release due to its many plot holes BUT overall,the movie was a classic during the 1980's and very much appreciated during its time of release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming, fun and thrilling.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the director of Rocky, this teen drama deals with more than the title. The Karate Kid tells a wonderful story and an exceptional cast that make this a great movie. Daniel LaRusso, played by Ralph Macchio, is moving from New Jersey in Los Angeles, California. He has trouble fitting in because the school he goes to has bullies. Daniel, also befriends an pretty cheerleader Ali Mills, played by Elisabeth Shue. Feeling defeated and left out, LaRusso soon finds out that their next neighbor in an expert in karate. His name is Mr. Miyagi, and his character is played by Pat Morita. His performance and Macchio are the best in the movie because they perform such a great chemistry, it's almost like a teacher and a student. To prepare Daniel for the karate fight, Miyagi instructs Daniel with the infamous, "Wax On, Wax Off." Miyagi's technique may be strange, but it helps Daniel defeated his enemy. The Karate Kid is a real charmer, both fun and great. It's heart is in the right place. Macchio and Morita's chemistry are terrific together. &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; 4 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheesy 80's fun for the whole family!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's so much to love about this classic. Whether it's the cheese-tastic 80's soundtrack, the plethora of quotable lines, or the incredibly lovable Mr. Miyagi, The Karate Kid is just such an enjoyable movie. It's the story of Daniel LaRusso, a kid who moves to a new town and runs into a lot of trouble with the school bully gang. In order to protect himself, he learns karate from his apartment mechanic, Mr. Kesuke Miyagi. In order to finally settle the conflict, Daniel agrees to fight in the upcoming Karate tournament, and it is only with the help of Mr. Miyagi that he will have the skills necessary to fight. This is the classic underdog story that we all know, but The Karate Kid does it in a wonderfully enjoyable and very high quality way.The Karate Kid is undeniably an 80's movie. It has plenty of long hair, synthesizer, and cheesy-as-hell montages. But it is all this cheese that makes this film so much fun. It all adds to the great uplifting spirit of this film that just makes you want to get up, dance, and cheer on Ralph Macchio, who is plenty likable. You just can't hate this film. It is too much fun and it leaves a mark on you that you will enjoy for a long time afterwards. There are a ridiculous amount of lines from this film to quote, and certain catchphrases have become staples in pop culture. If you haven't heard "wax-on, wax-off" in your lifetime then you have obviously been living under a rock.But all the nostalgia and cheese aside, this really is a good movie. It tells a really great story and is very enthralling for your typical crowd pleasing underdog tale. There are obviously those moments which don't exactly shine, but nobody said it was perfect. The script is full of wit and delivers a ton of wholehearted laughs. Plus John G. Avildsen, the director of Rocky who obviously loves underdog stories, directs this film very well and can make scenes hilarious and entertaining, to exhilarating and gripping.But of course what makes this film complete is Pat Morita, the incredible actor who perfectly plays the role of Mr. Miyagi. Morita even earned an Oscar nomination for this role, and it was much deserved. He is undoubtedly the best part of the film and whenever he is on the screen you know you are in for a treat. He and Ralph Macchio are great together and their teacher/pupil relationship is a joy to watch as it heartwarmingly unfolds, with plenty of laughs along the way.The Karate Kid is just a great movie. There's something for everybody in this movie, and if you don't like it then there has got to be something wrong with you. I'm not saying it is the perfect film, and it isn't exactly a grand work of cinematic art, but it is a classic that has spawned a generation of underdog tales, hardly any reaching the greatness that is The Karate Kid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kid version of Rocky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director John Avildsten, (Rocky) after doing taking a break from the Rocky movies, decides to create another underdog franchise. Though not as good as Rocky, it still holds out as an underdog classic.Story follows Daniel, (Ralph Macchio) and his mom, who move to Los Angeles, where he gets into some trouble with some bully karate experts. To gain his respect and his dignity, he gets karate training from the maintenance man at his apartment named Myagi, (Pat Morita).Follows a similar story to Rocky, not completely, but somewhat. Myagi and Mickey, although both mentors, have different characters. Mickey is broken down and grouchy, while Myagi is nice, and polite. All together though, I kind of like Mickey better. Not to say I don't like Myagi, but Mickey is a lot more famous.The relationship between Myagi and Daniel as they spend more time together is really touching. It never says where Daniel's dad is, but for some reasons he's absent. And later in the film, you find out that Myagi's wife died of child birth. So Myagi becomes like a father to Daniel, and Daniel becomes like a son to Myagi.The bad guy, who is the karate expert's sensei, will annoy the heck out of you. He's just so ridiculous and over-the-top. You just want to see him get kicked in the nuts. The performances are pretty decent. Pat Morita as Myagi is definitely the most powerful. Ralph Macchio is all right as Daniel, though he can get on your nerves sometimes. The bullies are just like the sensei, over-the-top and ridiculous.Its kind of a simple story, but its got a lot of emotion in it. Its a classic underdog movie that is loved by many. Not as good as Rocky, but in the end, there about almost even.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply put...an awe inspiring film that defines the true meaning of Karate.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is absolutely awesome. I love 80's films, and this has to be one of my favorites! I take Karate myself, and this film almost goes along with my style, which is cool! I think that the defining performance in this film has to be Pat Morita. He plays a very good mentor character. The one part in the film that got to me the most was when Daniel walks in on Miyagi drinking, and he listens to his story of how his wife and unborn child died. This was actually the scene that got Morita his Oscar nomination. There is also a great message of friendship tied in. The bond that Miyagi and Daniel have in this film is unforgettable. The love interest aspect is a little overrated between Macchio and Shue, but this was included in a lot of the movies at this time, so I guess that is okay. Also, there has been talk of Ralph Macchio being extremely "whiny" in this film, which is pretty much true, but I think it works for this film because Macchio is trying to depict a boy who does not understand why he is getting beat up and what Karate is actually about. If you want to see a movie that has a great moral and overall message, then this movie is for you. Check it out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A classic before you see it!The Karate Kid is a film to be enjoyed for decades to come. Basically it's an entry-level film into the eastern world for the developing class of younger people. Karate Kid combines the aspiration of an immature American child and the discipline of eastern martial arts and philosophy. Through common struggles of a teenager we see balance found through the influence of mind. This is what makes this movie timeless. The conquering of the soul and mind. I hope that forever we can appreciate the righteous effect Karate Kid has on American and foreign youth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most memorable films of the 1980s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Karate Kid" has long been a favorite movie of mine. It is a movie I can watch over and over again. What's more, it is proof that a believable story with good acting is all you need for an enjoyable film experience.After being hired for a new job, Lucille Larusso and her teenage son, Daniel, move from their home in New Jersey to take up residence in sunny Southern California. As expected, Daniel is not crazy about starting a new life across the country, having to say goodbye to all of his friends and everything. Once they reach their destination, Daniel meets up with some people his age and they go to the beach. It does not take long for Daniel to find trouble. He has an encounter with Johnny Lawrence after the latter gets into an argument with his ex-girlfriend, Ali. The problem is that Johnny knows karate, and proceeds to triumph over Daniel.After the beach incident, Johnny and his pals continue to harass Daniel. While all of this is going on, he begins to develop a relationship with Ali. Not only that, he strikes a friendship with Mr. Miyagi, the handyman at Daniel's apartment building.Miyagi comes to Daniel's aid one night when Johnny and his group surround Daniel and beat him up. Miyagi, who is experienced in karate, defeats all of the boys in no time. This leads to Daniel asking Miyagi for assistance in dealing with his enemies.The duo go to the karate school where Johnny and company train, the Cobra Kai dojo. Once they enter the building, they see why the students are like they are: Their sensei, John Kreese. Kreese is a hardcore type, who believes that anyone you encounter in karate is an enemy. The two sides discuss the matter, and it is agreed that Daniel will enter the local karate tournament, where several Cobra Kai students will be competing as well. How will Daniel fare in the tournament? Will the Cobra Kai dojo win? John G. Avildsen directed this underdog movie, which is familiar territory for him (he was the director of Rocky). Like Rocky, Avildsen knows how get the audience to sympathize with Daniel. Robert Mark Kamen wrote the screenplay, and from watching this movie, you will have a liking or disliking for each character. The casting is also very good. Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita give good performances here (and Morita has his share of funny moments), and Elisabeth Shue is fine as Ali. Martin Kove, who played Kreese, is perfect as the villainous sensei.This is a movie that anyone can enjoy. It would make for a good choice for family movie night. Watch it, it's a good one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An 80's classic for anyone who was bullied.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For anyone who was bullied in school, this is the ultimate movie where you will root for the underdog and wish for the villains to get their asses kicked! Most importantly, it made Pat Morita's character "Mr. Miyagi" into a household name! This is a classic 80's movie that will forever be famous for its generation. It was refreshing to see this movie again as it has been released on Blu-ray this year (2010). It makes you feel like a kid again! There are some scenes where it seems outdated; but the universal story of the underdog standing up to his bullies, still holds up strong after all these years.After watching this movie again, I really appreciate &amp; admire Pat Morita's character even more! It's the classic bond of an everyday ordinary old man who becomes more than just a sensei to Ralpha Macchio; but also a teacher, a mentor, but most importantly, a dear friend.I saw the remake version of the new Karate Kid and they pay multiple homage to this original film. So even though the new version is for today's generation, the 1984 version will always be the film that is remembered. You know a movie is a classic when you can say "Wax On, Wax Off!" and people know EXACTLY what you're talking about!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Again, it's really pretty pointless to review a movie like this one, a kind of Teflon-coated, nostalgia-tinged keepsake for my generation who spent their formative years dancing to the likes of Bananarama and trying to stop their own parents from forcing them to wear denim jeans bought from What Everyone Wants.Daniel (Ralph Macchio) is the new kid in town and soon runs into some local bullies, one of whom used to go out with the girl he now really likes (played by the ever-charming Elisabeth Shue). After one run-in to many, Daniel is bruised and beaten and ready to pack it all in until a pep talk with his calm, interesting new neighbour, Mr Miyagi (played to perfection by 'Pat' Morita). Mr Miyagi agrees to teach him karate and gets the bullies off his back by agreeing that Daniel will enter a karate tournament against them in two months. And so the training begins although Daniel isn't so easily convinced that waxing cars, sanding wood and painting fences and houses is going to teach him the ways of the "empty hand". Will he learn the moves? Will he emerge from the tournament victorious? Are there still any people out there who have never seen this film? It's cheesy, it's ridiculous and it's a great deal of fun. Macchio is enormously likable in the lead role, mixing just the right amount of vulnerability with a smart-ass nous. Shue is an appealing love interest. The bad lads who look like they've just stepped out of the Third Reich for a Pepsi break are suitably . . . . . Aryan and nasty. Then we have Morita, as Mr Miyagi, effectively stealing the entire movie and delivering lines that still make for great shorthand in any modern conversation. Who HASN'T used the "wax on, wax off" moment to illustrate some tedious task to a colleague/friend? I know that I'm guilty of it yet I also remain unashamed thanks to this movie and the impact it made on so many. Simple, unpretentious fun.See this if you like: Rocky, No Retreat No Surrender, Double Dragon.</fullReview>

Though born two years after its release, I grew up around movies like crazy because of my dad. This movie is a great mood setter.

However I can't believe the news I here about this re-make of 'THE KARATE KID'. I don't get how politics go in Hollywood but how can they say their re-making a film a already classic (I just don't and will not understand why You even mess with the title 'The Karate Kid' with Will Smith(producer) and Son? (Don't' get me wrong I love Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, ALI etc.) but pulling your strings for your son to be in it and staring in it at that. Thats messed up. What the _ are you doing?

I first saw Ralph on The Outsiders, and I already had love for him, but once I saw this film, I fell in love with him all over again!And the whole moral here is mentioned by Daniel, "What goes around comes around." Something we should always be aware of.Summing it all up, Karate Kid is great for everyone, and can be replayed for so many times, without you getting sick of it.And now I'm off to find the second one...</fullReview>

The way he teaches the karate through everyday work tasks for Daniel was a nice touch of comedy and original thinking on the writers part. And several scenes like trying to catch a fly with chop sticks or breaking the necks of beer bottles with a karate chop not only make you smile but go a long way to fixing Mr.Miagi as some ancient martial arts master.So much so, that when i saw Danile learn enough karate in 3-4 months to compete in a brown belt - Black belt tournament.I had no doubt at the time that it was possible (I was 8 years old when this came out ). *talk about suspension of disbelief =P. Imagine my heart break when I started taking weekly Kenpo karate lessons and it took me 2 months just to go from white belt to yellow belt ^^.Weather your a fan of 80's films or someone picking up this movie for the first time, there is more then enough here to make you smile and cheer for Daniel all the way through."So Can you fix my leg with that thing you do"?</fullReview>

Nobody seeing this for the first time could have figured out the whole "wax on/wax off" thing. Incredibly clever. And the crane kick at the end, and the way Johnny sells it with his head snapping back is simply the best. That final scene could have looked ridiculous, but instead it put a powerful end to a great movie.2) The plot within the plot. Everyone views the movie as Daniel versus Johnny...but its really Miyagi v Kreese. The Good Side vs The Dark Side. Even though Kreese (Martin Kove) has relatively a small part in the movie, its his overwhelming presence and philosophy that Miyagi and Daniel are out to defeat. I mean is there a more sinister looking guy than Kreese? One of the most clever scripts and well acted movies of the 80s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceeds every film with 'Kid' in title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many generic films have been made with the same premise as this movie and tries to follow the same formula. Boy needs to learn to fight to defend himself. The kid usually learns this from some unexpected 'mystical' character. The magic of 'The Karate Kid' is that it has been fleshed out with a great detail and works on the level of drama as well as a family or action film. The mystical character, Mr. Miyagi, is haunted by his wife and baby, whom he lost during WWII. This really expands the role of mystical character and breaks the stereotype that goes with it. As we see the weaknesses of Miyagi, the strength of his bond with Daniel, the karate kid, shines through. This bond is really what carries this movie. Another strength of this movie is in Daniel's actual training. At the time of the movie this was a shock and awe sequence because Daniel and the audience were led to believe that he was doing something completely different than Karate training. Many films have used blueprint since. The score of Bill Conti takes the movie's climax one step above and the direction by John Avildsen gives the movie the same feel as 'Rocky'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Daniel-san falls only to stand again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Karate Kid, released in the summer of 1984 became a sleeper hit and one of the more enjoyable films of that year. It's now've become an official classic, 20 years in the making, and has established a cult following because the essence of the movie's message still stands today and can be related in more ways than one. Daniel-san, a New Jersey Italian Kid, who moves to the west coast of California, hoping to fit right in with the people, but wounds up running afoul of some toughs, lead by Badboy Johnny Lawrence. However, not all is lost when Daniel meets a sweet, young lady of name Ali, and the two become good friends, evolving into a relationship. But even with this, there is a price.Spoilers ahead...Spoilers aheadDaniel has two confrontations with Johnny and the gang, as the film takes a rather modest approach, giving you the less is more tactic, as it concentrates on family values and balance of life, over the concept of fighting and karate-kicking action. Personally, I think that makes the movie work. The initial dispute erupts at a beach party when Daniel strikes up a conversation with Ali, the cute blonde, unbeknownst to her past boyfriend and its problems. Soon enough, Johnny and the gang show up uninvited stirring up trouble. Daniel tries to help Ali as he sees her struggling with the annoying Johnny, and wounds up receiving a good beating in return.Later, Daniel moves in for revenge as he sets up Johnny by spraying water from hose onto the Badboy's head, causing Johnny to seek him out with his gang, and the vicious crew tear Daniel up with ferocity, almost leaving the poor kid critically injured. But, Daniel's good friend, Mr. Miyagi rescues him, and the training begins.End of spoilersThe Karate Kid is a very good, solid moving film with subtle touches of humor, some excitement, but mostly important character development that helps the film feel realistic, aside the stationed grand finale that pits Daniel against the gang, something that marked the movie's popularity...Daniel vs. Johnny, as seen in the final chapter of the DVD.Everyone should see the Karate Kid for its significant values of life, respect, and the traditions of friendship, something that will never grow old.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Karate Kid is the best...around, and 20 years later, it should not be forgotten. This movie is all about details and symbols, it's not just about fighting the bad guys and getting the girl. It is about a young teenager looking for an easy way out, blaming everything bad that happens to him on everyone else. It's about him finding a friend the last place he would expect, who shows him that to conquer what he fears in the outside world, he has to grow up and learn discipline, put aside the petty back and forth fighting and really stand up for himself.The seemingly unorthadox way Daniel Laruso learns Karate is wonderful, Mr. Miyagi was a great character whose actor, Pat Morita, should have won an oscar for, and all he put into his role; (the back story about the wife and the internment camp), which inspires Daniel to really find himself, and learn a valuable lesson about life, how to accept that bad things happen, and that he has to learn to balance everything out...not just physically...like the crane kick...once you learn balance, "no can defense". What a great metaphor...but anyway, this is just my take on things...No matter how you take it, I hope you enjoy it, and take the time to let this sleeper hit find it's own place in your life.</fullReview>

It's very realistic and we can all relate to Daniel.Ralph Macchio and Noriyuki "Pat" Morita make a great team. Elizabeth Shue, Randee Heller, William Zabka, Chad McQueen and Martin Kove are an excellent support cast. Also, Pat E. Johnson was perfect for choreographing this movie. I can watch this movie anytime and not get bored.Not only that, this film inspired me to take karate again. My brother and I took a few months off from taking the classes. My brother is a brown belt and I'm a purple belt. At first I enjoyed the break. But when I saw this movie, I just had an urge to go back. Thankfully, my parents signed my brother and I to go back and I feel better about myself. The instructors were thrilled to see us back.The martial arts has taught me a valuable lesson, believe in yourself and the power within you comes out in your own hands. I give this a 10/10. I hope someday a sequel is made, with Daniel and Mr. Miyagi back together.on side note:If you think William Zabka is bully or a punk in real life, you're wrong. I got an e-mail from him and he is one of the nicest people one could meet.</fullReview>

You'll be surprised!!This is such a great movie!! Whoever says that it follows the same storyline as Rocky... well not really! The only similar event would be the big showdown at the end. Besides that... most of the movies are way different.I always get goosbumps when lil' Daniel beats Ali in a game of Hockey. You can see the pure look of joy when he scores the goal!!Das my boy!!!!Hieu &lt;with a 'U'&gt; Nguyen</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I assume most people who are reading this review have already seen the film (after all, who hasn't?), so I'm going to focus on some thinks that you may have missed when you did see it.Johnny is rolling joints in the bathroom at the Halloween dance.Daniel tries really hard to swallow Ali when they kiss outside Golf 'N Stuff.Daniel has never been as excited in his life as he was when he scored against Ali playing bubble hockey. Just look at the face he makes.Freddie Fernandez's shirt at the beginning of the movie says, "Makin' Bacon" and portrays two pigs doing it.When Daniel and his mother are eating at the Orient Express, you can see Bobby talking to his Cobra Kai cronies and then run back to them when he sees that Daniel is in the restaurant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ralph takes a beating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today this movie to many is just a joke. Mostly because of the embarrassing next 3 sequels. But, now and then you'll hear or see imitations of the famous "crane" move that is demonstrated at the end of this movie.It is a simple believable story about a skinny puke of a teenage boy(Ralph Machio)named Daniel Laruso, who moves from Newark NJ to Los Angeles CA. Out of place he tries some what to fit in. He goes to a party, tries out for the school soccer team, meets a girl(Elizebeth Shue), goes to a school dance. But within each of these instances he runs into a rough crowd known as "The Cobra Cons". These boys are rich, popular, and all are a part of an expensive karate dojo. Eventually this crowd, especially one in particular named Jonny, picks on him so bad that he searches to learn karate to use as revenge. He discovers that the old oriental maintenace man(Pat Morita) of his cheap apartment complex is a karate expert. He eventually convinces him, Mr. Miyagi, to teach him. In doing so he gets more than he bargained for, real genuine karate lessons, friendship, and a car. At the end he enters the All-Valley under 18 Karate Championship Tournament whom he competes with all his bullies from school.Ralph Matchio is great in this movie as a skinny wimp teenager. He must have gotten beat up in High school alot because he looked experienced. He realy gets beat the snot out of in two scenes.His relationship with his mother is classic. They give you no info about his father until in part two you find out that he passed away. So it's just Daniel and his mom Lucile. She is your classic middle aged annoying mother. Constantly embarrassing Daniel. She has no clue that Daniel has been getting beat the crap out of through a good portian of the movie because Daniel says he fell off his bike. One particular scene when he and her get in an argument in the parking lot outside their apartment is one to remember, "I hate this stupid bike! Damn bike! I hate it!" "Daniel! Why did you throw your bike away!?" "Because I felt like it Ma!"Also they manage to throw in a love story with Daniel and Ali(Elizebeth Shew) a girl he meets at the beach party on his first day in town. But he soons finds out they have many differences, she is a rich country club girl and she's also the ex girlfriend of Jonny. But nevertheless, it doesn't stop the burning flame.Pat Morita was nominated for an oscar in best supp actor for playing the part of Mr Miyagi. Who even though is old, can still kick some serious butt. You get to know a little about his life as Daniel becomes his karate student. He's a wwII vetran, wife died along with his baby due to complications at birth, and he's an expert fisherman. He brings both the funniest lines and the most serious lines to this movie.The movie brings good corny and real laughs to the screen. But in my opinion there are really only two corny areas: The beach Party on his first day and his first date with Ali. But don't get me wrong, these are great scenes! They add to the 80's mood. "You're gonna let me drive? Are you serious?" "Hey it's the 80's!"The fight scenes are choreographed very well. Especially the tournament at the end. It is fun to watch. Plus, the great 80's music adds the right touch to every important scene. People now, say it was a corny movie, but I strongly disagree. It is far too deep to be corny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Karate Kid" can appeal to all ages (except maybe young children). The characters are fascinating and very well orchestrated. There are some wonderful revelations -- sometimes two or even three in one, such as when, in one moment that leaves him stunned, Daniel learns what *really* has been going on, and one or two things about himself and life ... such as that things aren't always as they seem ... and that he should learn to trust those who have earned his trust.Overall, lots of comedy, a good amount of action, some strong drama, and some surprising thematic depth.Very enjoyable, often touching.

		<fullReview>I have not seen this film in years, and I believe it would be a great idea to watch again for old time's sake. This movie captivated me at a young age. Just like Jamie Robinson, I rewound the final tournament a million times. I would always picture myself as the hero, having been so often put down by other kids. My favourite song, of course, was Glory of Love by Peter Cetera. Banarama's "cruel summer" and the song "your'e the best" (can someone please tell me who sung that?) were incredible, and well suited ot the movie. Nostalgia is the greatest strength of the film, but it is great for many other reasons. I'll just name one right now, and that is that the movie so vividly explores the master-student relationship, and what it means to change our perspective on life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the great films from the 80's. There are so many cool things about it, from the plot, to the characters, to the climactic finish. I think its cool how we see Bobby's character portrayed... He wants to be one of the guys, getting caught up in their cruel treatment of Daniel, but he shows glimpses of compassion and maturity throughout the show. (At the beach, at the Halloween fight, etc.) His moral dilemma is whether or not to follow his Sensei's instructions, and put Daniel "out of commission". Of course, he makes the wrong choice but shows real regret afterwards.Don't you wish they had made some alternate endings, just for fun? Like Bobby beats Daniel in the semifinals, then goes on to de-thrown Johnny. Or, Daniel gets demolished in the finals, but still earns respect. Or, Miyagi and the Cobra-Kai sensei go at it, and Miyagi gets his tail whipped... Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't change the original film at all. It is nearly a perfect movie. The point is, I wish that the sequels had been as good as the first.</fullReview>

Now that I have seen most of it, everything makes a whole lot more sense. It is refreshing to see a movie balancing action with morals (in layman's terms, so my godson and I can watch it together). Daniel's dedication throughout the film, first to learning what Mr. Miyagi had to teach him, and then to putting into play after his injury at the tournament, was heartening. It was also something my godson could relate to, as he has had many sports-related injuries. I have long been encouraging him to learn karate, and his new favourite movie may help!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The formula for this movie is very simple, but effective. Boy gets bullied. Boy meets guy. Guy teaches boy to fight, etc. Boy overcomes bully. The same formula can be seen in Sidekicks, another of my favourite movies, except there's a lot more comedy involved (namely due to Mako's presence) than the Karate Kid, which is mainly a drama.This is one of my favourite movies. My favourite Karate Kid movie is the second of the trilogy, but of course it would mean nothing without this first installment, as this is where you see Daniel LaRusso being bullied, and his first meetings with Miyagi Sesuke.Daniel LaRusso's mother has just been given a new job, so the pair have to move from Newark, NJ, to Reseda, California. The place they arrive at is a dump, but Daniel soon meets a guy who invites him to a party, where he ends up in a fight and is thereon labeled a loser, and subject to constant bullying from a gang of local karate students.Miyagi overhears Daniel telling his mother about this one night, and decides to help him by teaching him some karate, and how to earn respect. The showdown at a karate tournament with Daniel and the main bully, Tommy, is intense, moving, and incredible. I picked up the trilogy for pretty cheap, I recommend anyone who likes drama, triumph, emotion, and action, goes looking for this amazing movie.</fullReview>

Newark, New Jersey is a pretty tough town to grow up in and someone as light on their feet as Danny Boy couldn't possibly survive 16 years of growing up there, could he? And even so, why would he travel almost 3000 miles to sunny, laid-back southern California to get his ass kicked by Johnny? Are the Kobra-Kai bigger and badder than oh say the Latin Kings? Well hmmm.....oh wait! I forgot that Daniel-san is Italian and being Italian AND from New jersey has to have some perks. What if.....Daniel(whose father was dead...it never said how...another hmmmm) was connected to a godfather who had people that could "take care" of Johnny, Dutch, Bobby, Kreese and the rest of the nasty Kobra-Kais?What if the character of Myagi was substituted by "Maggio" (portrayed by Anthony Quinn or Tony Curtis), a maintance man who was secretly hiding under his Federal Witness protection. Instead of "The Crane", he shows Daniel how to pistol-whip, make car bombs and mix cement. Instead of an old Packard, Maggio gives Daniel his very own hoop ride; a 1977 El Dorado convertable that Daniel had to wax with melted wax from a wheel of fontina cheese...bueno!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well loved eighties film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen The Karate Kids about ten times since the eighties. I really enjoy the film as it's one of those feel good films America seemed so good at making in the eighties( see also Risky Business and Ferris Bueller's Day Off).The plot, for the few people who haven't seen the film, concerns a kid from New Jersey, Daniel La Russo( Ralph Maccio) who moves with his mother to LA for a better life. Unfortunately he falls foul of a group of school bullies who train at a karate club owned by the ruthless and sinister Sensei Kreese, played by Martin Kove, whose saying is " an enemy deserves no mercy... mercy is for the weak". After being savagely beaten by the gang and being aided by the janitor in his apartment block, Mr Miyagi( the late Pat Morita), who is a karate expert, La Russo learns karate and defeats his enemies in a local karate tournament.OK that's the plot out of the way, but watching the film again and enjoying the story, something seems to strike me as odd and sinister about Sensei Kreese, owner of the Cobra Kai dojo, where he trains Daniel's tormentors in a brutal form of karate. Most karate clubs will contain women, families, older people and children in their ranks, but the Cobra Kai is solely made up of 17 and 18 year olds, La Russo's school year, with Johnny, a blonde surfer type played excellently by William Zabka, as Kreese's star pupil. It seems to me Kreese only seems happy around brainwashed teenagers, who seem to fit into some Aryan stereotype, and he is possibly some kind of fascist using karate to create some kind of brutal movement for his own benefit.Anyway conspiracy theory over, and if you watch the second one, Kreese is deserted by his young gang after brutally attacking Johnny and being defeated by Mr Miyagi. If you feel like a feel good film where a good kid overcomes his bullies, falls in love, has an excellent eighties soundtrack featuring British girl group Bananarama, and some good karate fight scenes, including the famous crane technique, you can't go wrong with The Karate Kid. However, treat the sequel with caution as it's not as good and the third one is well below par.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rocky underdog story for kids and teens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Granted I never lived in the 80s, but movies like The Karate Kid trilogy are one of the reasons that make wish I had. I know the story is really predictable and standard but that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. I mean Rocky is predictable and standard too and it's considered by most to be a classic. But I like the performances and characters and their relationships between each other and I think that's one of the reasons that what makes The Karate Kid so enjoyable. Like I like how Daniel and Mr. Miyagi are more than just student and teacher, they have more of a father and son relationship seeing how Daniel lost his father and Mr. Miyagi lost his son. And I think the romance between Daniel and Ali is really sweet and works really well and I like how Mr. Miyagi teaches Daniel that there is more to martial arts than just fighting. As for the sequels and remake, The Karate Kid Part II was a good continuation of the original. Sure, it wasn't as enjoyable as the first one but I mean it still had good martial arts action and good romance and I thought it was a good idea for it to take place in Japan. In fact, I thought it was rather underrated. And as The Karate Kid Part III, I thought it wasn't bad even though a lot of people hated it and thought it was really cheesy but in my opinion, I don't think it deserves all the hate. And I seriously doubt it could be as bad as The Next Karate Kid which didn't even star Ralph Macchio. I never saw it but it's supposed to be awful. And as for the 2910 remake, I thought it was okay but nothing special. But with some movie series, you can't beat the original and classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am sure I am in the minority with this film, but I simply do not understand the hysteria behind it. For my job I was required to watch this film, but I couldn't make it all the way through. The only character in the film that I thought had value, integrity and an actual relatable character was Pat Morita. Everyone else could have been erased. Watching him tend to his bonsai trees was more entertaining than anything in this yawnfest. A mother drags her teen kid from the east coast to California. Everyone is blonde and pretty, except him. Some stupid ass beats up on him because he's expressed some interest in some girl. As he's being beaten within an inch of his life, the girl and her "girlfriends" watch and do nothing. Absolutely nothing. I don't need to go on about the plot as I'm sure there are glorious descriptions of it elsewhere. I found this film to be racist, stupid, trite, dumb, boring, pointless and with acting that must be some other kind of job, as I could not discern any acting on the part of anyone except Pat Morita. I have parted company with the individuals I worked for that required me to view this. I was one of the lucky ones who did not succumb to the advertising campaign for this when it first came out and I am also one of the lucky ones who didn't live in a world like the one created in this film, where everyone except the lead boy, his mother, and Pat (and maybe a teacher and stray friend) was pretty!, blonde!, white! I rarely use this word, but I almost barfed. If you like reality, diversity, finely tuned acting, run for the hills, because you aren't going to find it here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deeper analysis of "teaching" and "good v evil"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is an oft missed juxtaposition of "good v bad teaching" and the careless automatic assumption that Johnny and the other bullies are bad per se.This is often a result of the most mis-quoted quotes in the movie: It's NOT "No sucha ting as baad student, only baad teachah."' It's "No sucha ting as baad student, only baad teachah; teachah say, student do." It's that last part that is most important to making the first part true.In the original, the good teacher is Myagi of course and the bad is the Army dude.ALL students (including Johnny and the other bullies) are "good" in the sense they listen to their teacher. The more cerebral perceptive viewer will feel ambivalent towards the bad-guy karate kid realizing, though Johnny's a mean bully, he's also (i) a good student listening to everything his teacher instructs, and (ii) perhaps a product or yet an innocent victim (nurture not nature) of the bad teacher...but only in the end, do some of the students of the bad teacher turn on their teacher, which raises a profound philosophical challenge to the original thesis: No such thing as a bad student only bad teacher.Now what? When is it OK to go against your teacher? What is good v bad (ie evil)? Who decides? If a good student should blindly follow the teacher (ie sand the floor), then shouldn't the bad-guy teacher's students have blindly followed everything and NOT turned against him? Maybe sweeping the leg was art of a tacit creative secretive teaching method that wasn't what it seemed - just like Daniel having to sweep the floor. Granted sweeping the leg is a flagrantly illegal and injurious act, consider the philosophical moral dilemmas in modern war fare and training.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pat Morita Was The Best Karate Teacher Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie back in the 80's and really liked it at the time. I just watched it again today and found that it still had the same appeal. In some ways that's kind of strange. The story doesn't have all that much going for it. It's entirely predictable. Daniel is a high school kid who has to move cross country from New Jersey to California against his will. He doesn't fit in, and makes the mistake of hitting on Ali - the ex-girlfriend of the high school tough guy Johnny. She actually likes him, but Johnny doesn't take too kindly to the situation and he and his buddies from a local karate school set out to make Daniel's life a living hell. It's a movie about bullies - but it's also a movie about overcoming bullies - because in steps Mr. Miyagi.Miyagi is played by Pat Morita. Morita over the years was a very busy actor, and a very good actor. I probably know him best as "Arnold" - the drive-in owner on the TV series "Happy Days." But if Morita had an iconic role, it surely had to be as "Mr. Miyagi" in "The Karate Kid" and its sequels. He was nominated for both an Oscar and a Golden Globe for his role in this first of the series, and while Daniel was the central character, and so Ralph Macchio the star, for me at least this movie revolved around Miyagi. Miyagi was a fascinating character: the handyman at the apartment complex where Daniel and his mom live who also takes on the role of Daniel's karate teacher when he discovers that Daniel is being beaten up. In fact, it's probably fair to say that Miyagi becomes almost a surrogate father to Daniel. The layers of Miyagi's life get slowly peeled away. Handyman and bonsai trimmer; karate expert; widowed when his wife and baby son died in an internment camp during childbirth; US Army World War II veteran; winner of the Award of Valor. Morita plays Miyagi as a gentle, thoughtful man - even a broken man who's never come to terms with the deaths of his wife and son, but one who's also tough as nails, and who's fiercely loyal to Daniel. Watching the relationship between Daniel and Miyagi grow makes this movie worth watching on its own. He teaches Daniel about karate (the purpose of karate is not so you can fight, but so you don't have to fight) but he also teaches Daniel about life, and perhaps even about love - because, yes, there is the requisite love story in this as Daniel and Ali (Elisabeth Shue) also see their relationship grow.Everyone else in the movie was fine. I didn't think there were any real weak spots in the performances. The weakness of the movie was just in the basic story, which is entirely predictable and formulaic (although it does manage to mix in some gentle humour every now and then) and in the fact that some of the characters were quite simplistic and one dimensional - especially Kreese (Martin Kove), the teacher at the karate dojo where Johnny and his friends train, who comes across as the epitome of evil all the way through. It's not that Kreese can't get his students under control. It's that he wants them to destroy Daniel. He has none of Miyagi's feelings for the more philosophical underpinnings of karate. "Strike first, strike hard, no mercy" is his only creed. Basically, what you get with "The Karate Kid" is "Rocky" with teenagers (well, Macchio and Shue were both in their early 20's actually, although they did come across realistically as teenagers) and karate - which probably shouldn't be any surprise. Both movies are underdog movies, and both were directed by John G. Avildsen.This movie has its weaknesses, and this movie has its strengths. Most of all, though - this movie has Pat Morita, in what was probably his best and most remembered role. (7/10)</fullReview>

He trains Daniel how to fight, pick a car to drive, and fall in love. Okay, so he can't be a romance teacher. Also, the film needs more comedy than drama!! Will Daniel win the tournament? I can't tell you that. But, I can tell you the movie goes from New Jersey to California after the Columbia logo shows up. The film was mostly filmed in San Francisco, California, USA. Plus, the film is about karate. I also want to say the characters are a little shady. They need to go to acting school.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Karate Kid (1984): Dir: John G. Avildsen / Cast: Ralph Macchio, Noriyuki "Pat" Morita, Elisabeth Shue, William Zabka, Randee Heller: Director John G. Avildsen scored majored success with Rocky. Here he creates a juvenile hero faced with similar responsibilities. Ralph Macchio plays Daniel LaRusso who is not pleased with the move that he and his mother made to this new town. Fitting in becomes an issue when standing up for a female classmate on the beach turns into a beat down, led by her narcissistic ex-boyfriend. Eventually a lonely janitor, played by Noriyuki "Pat" Morita comes to his aid and ultimately teaches him karate for the purpose of defeating his foe in a karate tournament. Like Rocky, we know where this is headed and how it ends, but that doesn't reduce its effect on rooting for the underdog. Macchio being a small high school kid makes him vulnerable but his determination to avenge his pride and stand up for himself is the stuff that viewers will relate. Morita steals the entire film as the peaceful Kiesuke Miyagi whose methods of teaching Macchio the moves are the film's best moments due to his simplistic and humbling nature. Elisabeth Shue as the female caught in the middle of the chaos is merely a romantic prop. William Zabka makes for an effective narcissistic bully. Randee Heller plays Macchio's well meaning yet na?ve mother. It stresses mind over matter, and control over pride. Score: 8 ? / 10</fullReview>

I remember watching the Karate Kid back in High School for Japanese class the whole class sat there and loved it. This in itself was a first because the class was not fond of learning Japanese.After seeing it again by myself years later it was even better! The music, the dialogue, the good vs evil, the chemistry between Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) Ali (Elisabeth Shue)and Mr Miyagi (Pat Morita) all this with the 80's what more can I say.The directing of this movie was in my view the best. John G. Avildsen you knew what you wanted to do and done it very well. All of the actors were perfect for the roles they played especially the bad guys.The Karate Kid still being referred to today as being one of the best movies of all time even in 2015 (31 years later!) This just shows that it has stood the test of time and beaten many newer movies made with the same good vs evil in mind.The new Karate Kid (2010) I haven't even seen and don't plan on watching either as you can not beat the original Karate Kid (1984) it doesn't matter how hard you try.The 80's Nostalgia in the Karate Kid maybe that is what keeps me coming back to watching it again and again. But it doesn't matter the movie was that well made with so many symbols of good vs evil (right and wrong). On each viewing you pick up something new that you didn't catch before. The symbols such as the relationships in the movie how they grow and the chemistry and trust that keeps building with Daniel and Mr Miyagi is just brilliant and something everyone can see and relate to.I will probably wear the Karate Kid Blu-ray disc edition out soon I have played the movie that many times but I don't care I will just buy The Karate Kid again and watch it another 50 times because that is just how good this movie is.If you are a young family with young kids I couldn't think of a more suitable movie for the whole family to watch. This movie would teach more to your kids than an entire year of school. That is how to treat your fellow man and how to act in society. That is just how good the Karate Kid (1984) movie really is.The Karate Kid (1984) the original and still the very Best!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent but it's not enough for a masterpiece! The plot is very hurry (the match), it's look like the director want to finish the film. However, Karate Kid is one of my favorite martial arts movies. The acting are very great, Ralph Macchio is OK and Pat Morita is fantastic, he was nominated for Oscar - Best Supporting Actor.And the remake in 2010 starring Jackie Chan &amp; Jaden Smith is a trash, very boring and suck. Chinese people, culture &amp; life? I don't care! It is more famous than the original because the cast and nowadays people just want to watch new movie.The Karate Kid (1984) is one of the great movies in 1984, should be nominated for Best Picture!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the film that makes you want to learn martial arts! The Karate Kid is the remarkable tale of Daniel a troubled teen who learns self defense and confidence from handyman Mr. Miyagi, to help prepare Daniel for a karate tournament he will enter to fight the bullies who beat him up. Pat Morita delivers a grade A performance earning him a Oscar nomination. He also delivered one of the greatest lines ever in film history, "Wax on, Wax off." Ralph Macchio gave one of the best performances of his career in this film. Fully committed to the film he actually took a real kick to the face during filming, but never called for a cut. Pat Johnson is the fight stunt coordinator on this film he also did the coordination on "Mortal Kombat" he creates the most compelling and exciting fight scenes ever in fighting movies. This movie will have you clapping and possibly even jumping out of your seat in excitement! Definitely one of the most classical movies we will never forget!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best feel-good movies of all-time. An 80s classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always been a huge fan of the Karate Kid films - I think they're some of the finest films to revolve around a teenager. The story - the struggle, the build up, the heart, everything, it's all just wonderful. Pat Morita and Ralph Macchio are simply brilliant in the film - their evolving chemistry just gets better and better as the film goes on. The antagonist, Johnny Lawrence, played by William Zabka, is also very good in the film - especially alongside the villainous John Kreese, played by Martin Kove, head of the Cobra Kai Dojo, the vicious team of karate students who become involved with Larusso (Macchio) after he moves to Los Angeles.The film has always been one of my favourites, and it always will be. The Karate Kid is one of the greatest films of the 1980s, and it's one of the most enjoyable films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best Movies Of The 1980's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So much about this movie is perfect. unbelievably quotable, it's in my top 10 of the decade (and the 1980's was an excellent decade movie wise) Plot In A Paragraph: Daniel Laruso (Ralph Macchio) and his mother move from New Jersey to California. She has a wonderful new job, but whilst Daniel quickly meets a girl he likes called Ali(Elizabeth Shue) Daniel also runs into trouble with some karate students led by Ali's ex boyfriend Johnny (William Zabka) The handyman in his building Mr Miyagi, saves him from a beating and discovers the real motivator behind the boys' violent attitude is their karate teacher. Miyagi promises to teach Daniel karate and arranges for Daniel to fight at the all-valley tournament several months away.Ralp Macchio, who I'd liked in the brilliant "The Outsiders" the year before, is perfectly cast as the title character, as is William Zabka as Johnny (According to the commentary on the DVD, Zabka came up with a backstory for his character, to "get the feel" for him. He says he envisioned Johnny as having no father, and that Kreese is the closest thing to a father figure). Elizabeth Shue looks gorgeous and I developed a real crush on her from seeing her in this movie, and Martin Kove is splendid as the vicious, take no prisoners (and racist) karate instructor. But the stand out performer in this movie (and that is saying something given how superb Macchio, Zabka, and Kove are) is the Oscar nominated Noriyuki 'Pat' Morita. The fact he was nominated for the Oscar says it all. As much as I love this movie, and I do. It's not the type to be nominated for Oscars.The studio wanted to drop the "drunk Miyagi" scene, feeling it slowed the pace of the movie down. Director John G. Avildsen argued for it to stay in and it was felt it was the scene that got Pat Morita nominated for an Oscar.Bill Conti's soundtrack is another valuable asset to this movie. No surprise Conti was Avildsen's go to go after his work on "Rocky" that netted Avildsen an Oscar. there are also several songs here too from Bananarama, The Flirts and Jan &amp; Dean and Survivor all which fit perfectly. none more so that "You're the Best" by Joe Esposito.Esposito says "You're the Best" was originally written for "Rocky III". The song had been rejected in favour of Survivor's "Eye of the Tiger".It's a shame this movie was so popular and iconic, that audiences forever associated Macchio, Zabka, Morita and co with their characters here. No matter the quality of the movie or the performance.John G. Avildsen is another curious case. He seems capable of bringing the best out of his actors. After wining the Oscar for "Rocky" his work was largely ignored with the exception of this franchise. "The Power Of One" made after he returned to direct his only Rocky sequel "Rocky V", has some great performances is a good movie I enjoyed at the time, but again it received little attention.Overall I rate it 10/10 because I loved it growing up in the 80's and I still love it, when I watch it with my kids (two boys, 16 and 8) who both love it too.All this without even talking about the crane kick and the end. I love the satisfied smile on Miyagi's face as Daniel shouts "Hey Mr Miyagi, WE DID IT, ALRIGHT". It's not quite as spine tingling as "YO ADRIAN, I DID IT" from Rocky 2,which it so clearly borrows, but it's close.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I write about this iconic film which has not been written or said already!? It is the story of Daniel, a kid from the wrong side of the track of New Jersey, who moves to California in search of a better life. What he encounters there is anything but. He becomes the target of relentless bullying from the student of a local Karate Dojo. The movie does provide outstanding plot and original characters development which in turn makes us care deeply about the main characters and their plights. It turns out that the Karate Kid became a Classic 80's movie and does contain many lines that have become part of our Pop Culture and which are often given some sort of references or homages in many movies thereafter. A MUST see and an All Time Classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is so good on many fronts, good vs bad, the underdog and survival of the fittest. What makes a memorable movie is moments that are then repeated thereafter...who hasn't at some point said wax on wax off or attempted the karate kick on an otherwise uninspiring day! I still watch this on a yearly basis, normally before Xmas...so much better than the re-make which I succumbed to watching for all of ten minutes! The acting is occasionally over the top but quite endearing. The biggest mistake they made is the follow up movies, whilst they were watchable they were 6 out of 10 standard.

		<shortDescription>A fun repackaging of a well-worn message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sports movies can be divided into two categories: those in which the protagonists win, and those in which they lose. Often, the latter kind are the better movies, because they understand that the power of a story is in the journey the characters take, not the destination, and a noble loss can resonate as much or more than a hard-fought win. But if the movie has done right by the journey, then the outcome really might as well go either way. As Mr. Miyagi reminds Daniel, it does not matter whether he wins or loses. This is not just lip-service, because by the time Daniel takes to the mat for his final match, he has already gotten to the point where he should be.Sports movies are often heavy-handed with their metaphors and messages, and "Karate Kid" is no exception. A certain amount of obviousness is perhaps inherent in the genre, since sports are celebrations of the most obvious elements of human existence: muscles, bones, sweat, blood. And yet, sports movies tell us, there is a meaning to these things without which they are impotent. Bad guys in sports movies are the ones who don't see anything beneath the surface. They are almost always bigger, stronger, and faster than the good guys. But the good guys know that the real competition in sports is internal, a mastery of mind or spirit, and an acquisition of wisdom about how to use one's power. Karate, with its overtones of Oriental mysticism, is even more suited to this kind of message than baseball or boxing or running, though for decades movies have been making it work for each of these sports and more. Mickey is an effective teacher in "Rocky," but Mr. Miyagi is spot-on in "Karate Kid." He has all the great lines, on-the-nose as they are. "You remember lesson about balance?" he asks Daniel. "Yeah." "Lesson not just karate only. Lesson for whole life."Pidgin English notwithstanding, the Miyagi character has a rich (and strikingly politicized) backstory, and Noriyuki "Pat" Morita makes him feel like a real person. It surely helps that Morita is of Japanese descent. He sounds right and moves right, as anyone who knows Japan can tell. A Chinese or Korean actor playing a Japanese sensei would be acting, but Morita can't for a moment be caught pretending. Interestingly, his costar Ralph Macchio is also playing an immigrant of sorts?a poor Italian kid from Jersey transplanted to blonde, suburban California. It's not just Daniel's approach to karate that's wholly different from his peers: he has a distinct approach to family and dating, too.This is a good looking film, and one that is proudly of its era. Rich sets and creative cinematography, like the long shots of Daniel on a boat silhouetted against a shining Pacific Ocean, are immersive and help the 2-hour runtime not to feel too long. The soundtrack of 80s beats hardly pauses for a breather, or to let the dialogue be heard, except when it gives way to a classical score in the more cerebral middle third. Being so well-acted and put-together, it's easy to forgive the simplicity of "Karate Kid"'s old message.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I can say something about this movie, it is this - this movie took me to that special place where I used to be when I was a little kid. When we'd watch those movies from 90s and 80s while our moms would be after us to get the homework done. There were no responsibilities and life was simple. The movie starts with this guy moving to a new place with his mother, where he ends up going in the bad books of this local karate champion(who by the way, happens to be super rich). Our protagonist doesn't seem to deal with it very well. Now comes the technician who practically lives in the vicinity of our protagonist and happens to be proficient in karate(convenient, right?). And thus begins the journey of self discovery and standing up for yourself in this epic movie. Truth be told, this is not the most original movie when it comes to the story. A good guy gets into a problem, then a father figure appears who teaches him to deal with it. But the emotions it makes you feel are real and raw, and I guess, that's what matters at the end. Coming to the acting, it's top notch, everyone does a great job here. The music is great, the songs used are great, almost everything is wonderful.At the end, it's not the best movie you'll watch in your life, and in no way it's life changing. But it is one of those movies which you watch when you're feeling low, and the movie you can come back to, anytime when you want to feel the warm, familiar feeling you used to get as a little child when the times were simple, and winning a match played with kids in locality made your day. I guess, for a brief span of time you are able to root for the main character to win that goddamn tournament, even though we know that this is just a small tournament. But for a very short while, we let ourselves be passionate. That's gotta be worth something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A deft mixture of underdog/teen/martial arts movie, THE KARATE KID is a pretty kickass flick that still holds up extremely well after thirty years. Plenty of credit is due to its two leads; Macchio embodies your fish-out-of-water gangley kid from Jersey with a chip on his shoulder. A smarter guy would've left well enough alone, but the kid's got heart, and that's what really sells this movie. Backing him up is Morita as Mr. Miyagi who . . . well he's just a great character from top to bottom; layered, wise, and Morita plays the guy with the utmost endearing charm. It's awe-inspiring to see him drop down to put the Cobra Kai in a hurt locker, and it's an even better movie moment to see him bring all of Daniel's menial tasks training into focus (it's a showstopping scene that ties the whole movie together). On top of all that, there's Joe Esposito's classic "You're The Best", a fist- pumper of an '80s montage song. Realistic? Hell, I dunno, but it's a great story. Learn tradition and honor, stick it to the bully and win the girl. What more could you ask?8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Youth Movie a Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Karate Kid was a worthy follow-up to Rocky by director John G. Avildsen as a Frank Capra style story of a New Jersey kid who moves to tropical California only to be shunned as an outsider who lives on the wrong side of town. The movie is still enjoyable and in 1984 made a tremendous impact on the movie-going public. Like the Black Stallion in 1979, it became something of a classic movie for young people.The kid, played by Ralph Macchio, finds some strong support in his always devoted mother, who is determined to make a new life. However, the real anchor is the building superintendent and new found friend Mr. Miyagi, played by Pat Morita. Miyagi is a wise elder, who creates bonsais and teaches the young man how to defend himself by mastering karate and its true values. Martin Kove plays the negative adult role model for the gang of kids who terrorize Daniel with their macho karate, not the form of self-defence that Miyagi promotes. I think the show is still great entertainment. The show reaches a Rocky-style climax and you can probably guess how it turns out. It can be faulted for a formula plot but is still good enough to hold your attention and reflect on the values of mutual respect and ethical conduct that often don't register with parents and their teens.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there is one movie that can encourage kids to take martial arts classes, this would be the one. Ever since I first watched this at age 8, I loved everything about it enough that today, it is one of my all-time favorite movies. Like any good drama you need to have an imperfect character in the worst situation possible (a perky if lonely teenager who's the new kid in school getting bullied by a future girlfriend's ex) and this one does not disappoint. Even better is the lessons Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita in a well-deserved Oscar Nominated performance!) gives to Daniel LaRusso about karate and life itself. And last, but certainly not least is the action sequences. Well choreographed, exciting with the tournament settings, and most importantly the final bout ends on a sweet note. If you need something uplifting, this could be one of your choices.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You grow up with some movies..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was raised with this movie that's why it has always been so special to me and I love it so much and from time to time I still watch it when I feel depressed or bad. There are some movies that you can't give up on them no matter how bad is the story for others. You keep it as the best movie in the cinema history for you. The Karate Kid is this movie for me. Even though it was made in 1984 the story is still great and it entertains me whenever I watch. I loved the Japanese culture with this movie and probably that's why I studied Japanese in the university. This movie is a masterpiece because you can see the influence of The Karate Kid in many other movies that were made after it and also you can see lots of features of it in our daily life, like trying to catch a fly with sticks.The Karate Kid's genre is romantic drama martial arts. It was released on June 22 1984 and made with a budget of 8 million dollars. It grossed 90 million dollars which is considered a commercial success compared to that era and the movies in that era. You can only be successful in a movie if you really want to give people something. If you make a movie only to earn money maybe you will earn money but your movie will not be remembered after 5 years. But if you really focus on giving people something with your movie, you will both earn money and your movie will still be remembered by the next generations.The movie was nominated for academy awards for Best Supporting Actor ( Noriyuki Pat Morita ) it was directed by John G. Avildsen who was also the director of Rocky 1976 and won the Best Director Award with it. The Karate Kid has all the necessary features for having a good time. It has sport, drama, love, comedy, friendship. Today the movie has 7.2 points on IMDb. After 2 years they made a second movie as The Karate Kid Part 2 but it wasn't as successful as the first one and in 2010 they have made another Karate Kid movie with Jackie Chan but neither of them were as tasty as the first one.The Karate Kid was ranked 31 on Entertainment Weekly's top 50 best high school movies. Now I am pretty curious about that list and after I finish writing about The Karate Kid I am going to look at that list because I like this genre, they are relaxing and make you feel good. And this is exactly what I expect from a movie. As long as I feel this in a movie no matter how badly it was criticized, for me that movie is going to be good and I am going to write good things about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Looking to start a fresh new life in sunny southern California, young Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) &amp; his mother move into a small run down apartment building, where Daniel runs into the quiet, repairman Mr. Miyagi (A fantastic turn by Pat Morita in a role that would make him a household name) who unbenowest to Daniel will play a big part in Daniel's future. Daniel instantly makes an attempt to fit in &amp; enjoy his new surroundings, he makes friends with another boy who lives a few doors down from him, who later invites him to a beach party where Daniel meets the pretty Ali (Elizabeth Shue) Ali &amp; Daniel seem to hit it off pretty good, which does not set well with Ali's ex-boyfriend Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka) who along with his gang of thugs, make life miserable for LaRusso. When Larusso attempts to fight the bullies back, he finds himself quickly defeated &amp; humiliated by Johnny, a martial arts student training under the tutelage of his (&amp; his pals) unmerciful Cobra Cai owner &amp; sensei John Kreese (Martin Kove). It looks like Daniel has no choice but to accept the fate that has befallen him, but as luck would have it, it turns out Mr. Miyagi knows martial arts very well, taken Daniel under his wing, Miyagi at first seems to be taking advantage of the young kid, getting him to do countless chores that quickly wear Daniel down, however Daniel soon discovers that Mr. Miyagi is actually training him in the ways of karate, in a much different way &amp; Daniel quickly learns that there's more to karate than just fighting as he continues his training leading up to a martial arts competition where Daniel will face some pretty tough opponents including Johnny &amp; his gang.THE KARATE KID is a real crowd pleaser! Director John G. Avildsen who helmed ROCKY, basically takes the same formula that made that film successful &amp; repeats it here for the teen set, instead of boxing, the films young hero learns karate &amp; a few life lessons along the way. The films acting is really strong with believable situations, wonderful characterizations, professional directing, an engaging story &amp; some really good martial arts sequences, help highlight this feel good film that just seems to get better each &amp; every time one views it. Often imitated, never duplicated. A must see for fans wanting to see a really good film, they definitely don't make them like this anymore! Later an animated series. Remade in 2010. Followed by three sequels, starting with THE KARATE KID PART II.**** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie with positive ideas and energy; unrepeatable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Karate Kid is an excellent movie with really positive ideas especially for young people. The first part is greatly conceived: two main characters make a great team - Mr. Miyagi is a calm and dignified man specialized in martial arts, with positive and compelling life philosophy. Not only does he teach Daniel-san karate, but he also teaches him the most important values in life. He is a magnificent teacher and a wonderful friend. Daniel-san is a very simple young man with a friendly personality and strong mind, willing to fight and do good things. This first part is really a nicely done movie, with very good actors and very positive thoughts. Without Mr. Miyagi, the film probably wouldn't be the same, but it is also Daniel who brings the energy in the movie while Mr. Miyagi teaches him to find balance in life. The second part, in my opinion, was not as good as the first one, the third was good, but again, not as good as the first one, while the fourth part (The next karate kid) is definitely the worst, because that chemistry that was there with Daniel is not present any more, and in most of the movie there is not much action or energy as in the first part. Although we cannot say that the remake is bad (since Jackie Chan is a nice actor after all), it does not have the same peaceful energy and chemistry as in this movie. Mr. Miyagi and Daniel-san are a combination that is not easy to repeat. I highly recommend this movie, if you like good,positive action and master-student-relationship movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back in Newark, New Jersey, Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) was the top of the food chain in his school. But luck would have it, when his mother got a new job in California and now Daniel has to start from the bottom. He's now become an instant social outcast and seems mystified as to why the students behave the way they do as he tries to blend in with the others. He appears to have a bit of a tough streak in him, but when he gets into an entanglement with the toughest bullies, he now feels he is totally out of his league. His anger and his determination are his defensive weapons when the going got tough, which at the same time was his downside as well as he becomes a prey to these goons. The wounds don't heal any faster as one of the goon's ex-girlfriend starts to show affection towards Daniel. It does however, adds the dramatic effect toward the tough Jersey teen.One night, while the goons are chasing after Daniel, and they beat the living daylights out of him, the handyman from Daniel's apartment steps up and defends Daniel against these punks and takes them down easily because they are just thugs with no form of training. The handyman's name is Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) and after seeing such a sight, Daniel asks Miyagi if he could train him to fight like him. Very reluctant at first, fearing that Daniel will want to use his skills for vanity purposes and that there is more to karate than just whipping butt and gaining recognition. This is where we get to the meat of the story after we just finished slurping the soup as we now see the movie shift gears from a high-school drama Hallmark Channel schmaltz into a compelling character study with a coming-of-age theme implemented in the story.Ralph Macchio has his fun in the sun as the titular character that made his presence known for his heart-rending performance in the 1983 classic "The Outsiders". He was still relatively young at the time was not that polished as a performer, and at times he still feels a bit green in his performance. However, he does capture the image of the alienation in a world that seems rather new to his old surroundings. The casting directors were spot-on when they casted Arnold from "Happy Days" Pat Morita in the role of handyman/karate trainer Mr. Miyagi. His execution was perfectly put in place as a subdued, but very spiritual and intellectual as he was the foundation that held this film together. It was a no-doubter that Mr. Morita was the winner for Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars.In the 80's there was a lot of cheesy movies that came out, "The Karate Kid" was one of the many films that overcame the cheesiness to bring you two solid hours of inspiration, entertainment as well as knowledge. It may look towards the younger age demographic, as it shows that even underdogs can achieve success if they put their minds to it. But the central theme in "The Karate Kid" is that vengeance is not a solution. There are other ways to crack the bully code without having to crush their balls. And the message stands true to today's standards as schools are petitioning to stop bullying without fighting back. The Miyagi and Daniel chemistry is one of the richest in film history and throw in a young Elisabeth Shue in the mixture you get pure gold in cinema. Not only is it educational, but it's also a gentle film that everyone in the family can get to enjoy. Even though it's been 30 years since this movie has been released, it has not shown a single sign of aging.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Martial Arts movie that took me by surprise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While going through a marathon of checking out films I've never seen before. "The Karate Kid" was a movie I've never considered watching because at first I thought it was just going to be some boring Martial Arts movie that I wouldn't care about, and the fact that it wasn't a priority.So, I checked it out regardless and the movie took me by surprise. This movie showed a great friendship between an bullied high-school kid and a master of Martial Arts and it's done so well. I love the fact that Mr. Miyagi assigned Daniel chores at Miyagi's home and later revealing that those chores made Daniel learned Karate. All that work Daniel learned really pays off at the end of the film.Daniel also meets a girl and develops a relationship with her which to me makes the film a lot more relative. I have sense viewed this film 3 times (at the time I post this) and has became one of my favorite movies. I would recommend everyone to check this movie out at least once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John G. Avildsen's nostalgic coming of age classic 'The Karate Kid' brings back a lot of memory. What made those films (that centered round teenagers) particularly outstanding was that they weren't dominated by clichd themes like sex (which became the only thing most Hollywood teenfilms dealt with post 'American Pie'). 'The Karate Kid' really captures the awkwardness of adolescence: the need for identity, dating, growing up etc. It also does a good job of presenting the philosophy behind karate and that it's not about violence at all. The best moments are Macchio's sequences with Morita, Shue and Heller. The mother-son bond is depicted wonderfully without the usual clichs. What appears on screen looks very natural. Similarly, the romance is portrayed with innocence and sincerity. And, last but not least, the master and apprentice sequences are delightful and endearing. The fight sequences were great. Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita are excellent. Elisabeth Shue and Randee Heller provide brilliant support.Avildsen's film is a charming entertainer. 'Felt good to revisit it after years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Daniel LaRusso, transplanted by his mother from New Jersey to the west coast, falls out with local members of a karate school, and ends up being trained by the janitor of his apartment block so that he can take part in a tournament against them.The 1984 Karate Kid movie, the first of a trilogy, still satisfies. The story beats work perfectly, there is good chemistry between student Daniel (Ralph Macchio) and unlikely teacher Mr Miyagi (Pat Morita), the action is well choreographed (not to mention filled with cathartic wish fulfilment), there is humour and heart and, in "wax on, wax off", a killer phrase was introduced into the language.It's not perfect - Macchio is too old to fully convince, and Daniel is too whiny to be wholly sympathetic, but it is still a fun trip. Which can't be news to you because I'm sure you have seen it if you're reading this. And if you haven't - why not?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Student and teacher not only build a lasting friendship, but help each other get through some trying times.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do you enjoy rooting for the likable underdog as much as I do? Well then, this classic film is for you. This classic film from 1984, follows a young teen, Daniel (Ralph Macchio) whose life is already in turmoil due to a life changing move cross country. Now in California, Daniel tries to fit in, but has difficulties doing so and he has to talk his way out of a few fights. His luck finally runs dry and one night he is chased home and as he is being beaten up, someone comes to his defense and saves him. He wakes up later that night to find out his savior is none other than his apartment buildings' aging gardener, Miyagi (Pat Morita) but how could this little old man have taken on all the bullies? And can this man help Daniel turn things around and defend himself and his honor? Watch as these two become student and teacher not only build a lasting friendship, but help each other get through some trying times in their lives. My favorite character is Miyagi, because you don't expect this little, old man to be able to not old defend himself, but beat up a lot of bullies along the way. Plus, he is so funny in how he trains Daniel and just his overall personality. My favorite scenes are the training scenes, where Miyagi uses basic household chores to train Daniel, which confuses him. These are funny scenes, but at the same time, it is great how they will eventually tie in the training concepts with Daniel. This is a great example of someone who needs to prove to themselves and others that they have a great deal of inner strength. The storyline of this movie is phenomenal and there is a great amount of action in it as well. The cast does a great job and really give great performances that make them seem so believable. This is a fantastic family film and even though it's almost 30 years old, the story still holds strong today. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars as it is a movie the entire family will truly enjoy and can watch together. I recommend this film for the entire family. Look for this film as well as other classic films on HDNet Movies Kids Scene this month. Julianna No one, age 12, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 80's flick carries a inspiring tone, and inner breakthrough comes for those willing to embrace the 80 music, and acting! enjoy this film! Mr. Miyagi is a character of wisdom and depth. Carrying the spirit of his father, he teachers Daniel to be still and see early in the movie. And truth is in what he sees from within. This is one of the many gems from the film. You will find yourself laughing both from 80's culture and poignant character development. I personally put myself in Daniel son's shoes and the movie becomes a treat. Daniels romance throughout the film is one of the constant moments of humour. I think anyone who is seeing this film for the first time better be ready for a roundhouse kicking' time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very entertaining and nostalgic sports movie from the classic 80s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just to let all of the users who gave some positive feedbacks on this film in this website, I would like to say that I've recently saw this film and I've never even heard of it before. However, when news grabbed my ear that lots of people were very fond of this flick from the classic 80s, I've rented a DVD copy from a library last summer and watched it to keep my interest. I was unsure whether or not it was gonna be good, but little did I know that I was in for an awesome treat! Besides, since it received some critical acclaim on Rotten Tomatoes (90%) (With Roger Ebert praising it as well) and became a box office success back at 1984, I actually started to like this movie. It had an original story about a teenager named Daniel LaRusso who moves from New Jersey to California with his mother and makes some new friends and a girlfriend as well. One day, he gets beaten up by a bunch of bullies who are professional karate students working for their over-the-top villain and starts having problems.Suddenly, things started to change when Mr. Miyagi, a gardener and a karate master, saves Daniel and promises him to train him for the All-Valley Tournament, thus developing a relationship with each other. Also, Mr. Miyagi teaches Daniel that karate isn't about violence. It makes you what you are inside your soul.Like I said, I still like this movie, but I do have two problems with this flick. The screenplay is sometimes predictable and the reason why Mr. Miyagi is letting Daniel paint his fence and waxing his car remains questionable. With those two problems aside, the music from Bill Conti (with a great pop song "The Moment of Truth" by Survivor), a top-notch cast, some touching moments, a good moral about looking deep inside of you, and some riveting karate moments (with the best part where Daniel LaRusso uses his crane kick near the end of the movie) makes this movie an entertaining and nostalgic martial arts movie that would always be watchable to fans of sports films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie scheduled for an evening showing on Turner Classics last night and something compelled me to watch it even though I saw it when it first came out and still pretty much remembered the story. It seems a lot more simplistic now compared to what might be produced today, probably due to the fact that I'm twenty five years older now, and one's problems rarely get solved as effectively in two months time as they do here. But that shouldn't be read as a negative, I think there's some value in the story's themes of persistence and honor, and staying true to your goal even when that's a scary prospect.I think the picture would have worked with any young actor in the Danny LaRusso role, but the presence of Pat Morita in the picture was an inspired decision. Known primarily as the second Arnold from the 'Happy Days' TV series, Morita brings a solid presence to the story as the wise and benevolent father figure for Ralph Macchio's character. Blending humor with martial arts, the picture subtly explores the importance of repetition and discipline for developing control and power. It pays off in the tournament finale when Danny gains the Valley Championship along with his self respect.I know many will find fault with the idea that Danny could actually beat a competitor who has trained for many years, but that's not the point. If you're going to have a movie where the underdog overcomes his challenges and grows as a person, you wind up with a product like "The Karate Kid". A more realistic film would have Danny get his butt kicked in the championship round, but then you have a story without a moral, and who wants to see that?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great 80's fun movie. I've heard some people on here saying they have black belts and so they can tell that the moves in this are fake... lol cos you need a black belt to say that! this is fantasy 100%. (Although it's cool to see some old faces in the tournament scenes, such as Pat Johnson, and there are actually some good karate moves here especially from the guy that makes it to the semi finals)My biggest problem with the movie watching it now is that there is zero chemistry between Macchio and Shue. I know it's aimed at kids but their few intimate scenes together really are disgusting!!! It's like seeing a 20 year old make out with her mates 13 year old brother Also some of the Asian stereotyping is pretty lame and dated. I'm fairly sure Pat Morita didn't really talk like that! Overall though it has a nice central philosophical message in terms of going back to natural elements to build your skills, and the film definitely has a heart. Just a pity about the later instalments!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit cheesy in an '80s kind of way, but still good fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1980s are equally lauded and criticized for giving birth to "high concept" movies, i.e. star-carried films, mostly confined to a specific genre (comedy and action, preferably), with a plot that can be summarized in thirty seconds or less. The culmination of that cinematic "current" was Top Gun, on which Jerry Bruckheimer built an entire career based on high-concept hits. Most of these films are still enjoyable, but some, including Gun, haven't dated that well after two decades or so. The Karate Kid is no exception: no one would produce it today. Still, the film is actually quite amusing and, in one scene at least, oddly moving.Using high-concept rules, the plot would be summed up like this: nerdy kid becomes a hero by learning karate. The nerdy kid in question is Daniel Larusso (Ralph Macchio), who has just moved from New Jersey to California with his mother. He instantly finds a soul-mate in Ali Mills (Elizabeth Shue), the kind of girl all guys would like to date, and is repeatedly brutalized by her ex-boyfriend Johnny because of the bond between them. Daniel decides to take karate lessons to get even, only to discover the local dojo is run by a glory-obsessed mad-man, whose students include Johnny and all of the latter's friends. When all hope seems to be lost, help comes in the most unlikely shape: Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita), Daniel's gentle, plant-loving neighbor and, allegedly, martial arts champion. His peculiar technique consists of four simple words: "Wax on? wax off".It is easy to see why John G. Avildsen, director of Oscar-winner Rocky, accepted to do this film: like Sylvester Stallone's breakthrough, it's the story of an underdog who tries to get to the top ? not for money, but so that he will feel better as a person. Sure, Daniel's bizarre training can easily be mistaken for a spoof of Rocky's more conventional montage, but there is an odd poignancy to those moments, especially when the superb Pat Morita (who was Oscar-nominated for the role of Miyagi) is on screen: elusive, brilliant and, in a scene where he remembers his late wife, touchingly vulnerable, he embodies all the preconceived ideas one might have of a martial arts instructor but manages to go beyond a mere caricature. Macchio is similarly convincing, although his scenes with Shue suffer from an 80's cheesiness (mostly as far as the music is concerned) that robs the movie of the sincere romance that made Rocky a hit.So yes, this is a picture that looked great in 1984 and lost some of its charm as the years went by. And yes, it is true that neither Macchio nor Morita will ever be remembered for anything else. But hey, why hold that against them? Flawed or not, The Karate Kid is good fun. Heck, it even made a catchphrase of something as silly as "wax on? wax off". It can't be entirely bad, then, can it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic martial arts movie with the intimate Pat Morita and Ralph Macchio</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A teenage named Daniel(Ralph Macchio) aware that Karate is his salvation, he battles an evil nemesis, facing a violent young group trained by a Karate expert(Martin Kove) . A Japanese handyman named Miyagi(Noriyuki,Pat Morita) teaches him martial arts and combat in a Karate contest. Meanwhile, Daniel falls in love beautiful young girl(Elizabeth Shue).This agreeable movie, a sort of junior version of 'Rocky', develops a sincere and deep friendship among two protagonists, the rockie young boy and the wise old man. Using more than his fists, Daniel learns about himself and the sense of life. Sympathetic and likable acting by main actors: Macchio and Morita. Furthermore, appear as secondaries, Larry Drake, Chad McQueen, Larry B Scott and Martin Kove. The film contains adequate cinematography and long-standing score , though with excessive disco-music, by Bill Conti, usual of trilogy. The picture is well directed by John G Avildsen. Since then , Avildsen has mixed more karate Kid and Rocky films with such feel-good message films as Power of one, Lean on me and again Rocky V. It's followed by three sequels,Karate Kid II(1986) where the protagonists travel to Okinawa, Part III(1989) where Daniel again battling nasties enemies. And 'The next karate Kid'(1994)by Christopher Cain which introduces a new kid , girl, with the two times Oscarized Hilary Swank. Rating: Enjoyable film for its close characters, well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humorous, entertaining, worthwhile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director John G. Avildsen must love the underdog, as his films "Rocky" and "The Power of One" both had a theme of one person against the odds. "The Karate Kid" also follows this line, with new kid in town Daniel La Russo trying to settle into a new home in California, and having a very difficult time of it.Daniel fancies pretty young Ali (Elisabeth Shue), whose ex-boyfriend was not too happy about their recent split. When Danny gets on the wrong side of Johnny and his Karate thugs, things start to look grim for La Russo, until he meets Mr. Myagi.These type of movies are usually aimed at the young, however this is not an action film, nor a teen flick. Rather, it is quite a strong drama about a friendship between an old man and a young boy.As the wise old Mr. Myagi, "Pat" Morita is splendid and makes the whole movie worthwhile as he creates a very enjoyable character. He is the father Danny never had, as well as being a great friend, teacher and mentor. And as Daniel La Russo, Ralph Macchio is competent and plays his frustrated 16 year old well. He is the son Mr. Myagi never had, and so enables the old Okinawan gentleman to pass on the pearls of wisdom that his father taught him so many years ago.The action does work well also and the final tournament fight, though brief, is quite rousing. Bill Conti touches off proceedings by providing Mr. Avildsen with another good score. Quite a humorous, entertaining and worthwhile movie.Friday, January 14, 1994 - T.V.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lesson of life? Probably.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Karate Kid" is more than just a teen movie or a blockbuster classic; I would go as far as saying that it's a lesson of life.Let me explain... the movie centers around a young teen named Daniel Larusso who fits perfectly in the "un-cool" category. His mom drives him to his dates, he is a total ass when it comes to flirting, he is a mess on clothes, etc. Overall his a bag of bones.And worst of all, he's a potential victim for bullies in school (oh, what would junior high and high school be without them?). Soon after the situation gets really difficult, he seeks the aid of a Japanese karate master who happens to be his next door neighbor. This man, named Mr. Miyagi who owns a dojo, teaches Daniel that karate is not only for kicking asses; but it's a matter of spirituality and more. Daniel soon finds out that karate made his life better but it couldn't happen without Mr. Miyagi's help. He's some sort of his spiritual master. They start a friendship that breaks all frontiers and the result is a new life for Daniel. A tender relationship by the way.There are some classic scenes in the movie like when Daniel is attacked at the Halloween party, or when he wins the tournament with the infamous "Gruya" movement in the final match. An excellent movie for all ages that should be watched by those who think karate is only for "cool" purposes or self-defense. It's an art.Pat Morita steals the show as the wise, tender, and lonely Mr. Miyagi. Ralph Macchio is perfect as the whinny, cry baby that suddenly changes for good and demonstrates strong character. Elisabeth Shue is smokin' hot and looks cute whenever she's reacquired to. Martin Kove is a great villain and also steals the show. A very good movie that shouldn't have sequels but that's a different story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every Boy's Favorite Story, Mentor, and Girl !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It looked as if director John G. Avildsen wanted to remake his movie (Rocky ? 1976), however with teen Italian lead, gorgeous Adrianna, and Miyagi instead of Mickey ! But it turned out to be totally another thing of its own, which also had success and turned into franchise. You can follow that "karate" success and its influence on other movies of the same era through (The Last Dragon ? 1985), (No Retreat, No Surrender ? 1986), or even (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ? 1990). Though, (The Karate Kid) will live longer. Defining the reason why could be hard in a movie has nearly all the right ingredients. But I see it clear. It's considerably that script. Scriptwriter Robert Mark Kamen made brilliant and balanced mix of martial arts, romance and drama. And showed a right way for how the unoriginal underdog story could be excellently recycled to be original apart. And if the script was the movie's crown, then this crown's jewel should be the strong characterization, especially of the unforgettable mentor; Mr. Miyagi. He's not the wicked Japanese only, but also an old soldier, whom had his wife and son killed, as we knew in a brief yet fine scene when he was excessively drinking. So he is a wounded man who hates violence, misses his family, and above all is not perfect; living lonely, trying to find balance in his life. And he finally has the chance to be a father of Daniel as a substitute for his late son (noticing the absence of Daniel's father too), where they become the best of friends. Hence, it's more than just a relationship of a green karate student with an experienced instructor; it's a tale of a son who meets his lost father, father who meets his lost son, and 2 friends who positively affect each other's life for good, so the human, plus the karate, lessons unfold. Ahh, can you name one of today's made-for-teens movies, that has human characters, pains, and lessons ?! I don't think so ! Moreover, that certain "reestablishment" in the character of the Japanese on the American big screen; to be as nothing of its antecedents, and maybe the most important accomplishment done by such a movie. Pat Morita as Kesuke Miyagi was a very belated sorry for Hollywood's long history of dealing with the Asian people through the worst stereotypes and clichs ever.Look at the nationalities of the bullied humble characters as the minority of USA, then look at the bully, not honorable at all, wasp wealthy brats; and you'll understand that it isn't just another repeated story about ordinary conflict between 2 guys over one girl. This is how this movie guarantees depth, cause, and numerous viewings. Director John G. Avildsen made it sentimentally wonderful. It's clear how he loved the story, creating it as aesthetical, enjoyable, and warm as well. Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita's chemistry was flawless. They both did top-notch. However my higher appreciation must go to Morita, who marvelously proved that he wasn't yet another comedian as everybody thought at the moment. And I had the best time watching Elisabeth Shue; she was one heck of an explosive motive; being ? truly ? every boy's dream as one sexy angel !Now, after many virtues, let's see the vices. First off, I didn't like it when the lead showed up at the amusement arcade and his girl was angry of him !! It's supposed to be the opposite; as she was the one who didn't come to the last date, and she was the one in other person's arms, so she was the one who should apologize, not him !! For more essential vices; the end was very fast. The competition has been briefed in one pop song like a MTV music video. Not to mention the easiness of it, where the magic of Miyagi's hands does all the wonder. That's all. And, accordingly, they're too little vices. (The Karate Kid) is one in a decade movie. It has every boy's favorite story, mentor, and girl, all made in a very effective way, which clicked at the moment, and still does.</fullReview>

Even after only having a minimum experience of about 12 years in Okinawa Martial Arts known as Uechi Ryu I can attest that the basic principles are followed. The unique character that is developed within the plot summary according to the student teacher relationship is very entertaining. I think the methods make the film entertaining as well as have moral value.In Karate Kid the martial arts is made to be taken seriously while promoting the nature of entertainment with accuracy of the martial art itself. The fundamental philosophical concepts are well grounded in the moral facts of life. I think many people enjoy this film as much as trying to understand the philosophical values of martial art, and the actual real martial art principles of Okinawa Martial Arts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Karate Kid,while not as iconic as ,say,Rocky,is a classic in its own right.this is another story of the underdog triumphing over adversity.this time it is a teenager named Daniel Larusso(Ralph Macchio)who has just moved to a new city.very quickly he gets on the bad side of the town's local karate champ,Johnny Lawrence(William Zabka)and is bullied from then on.However,just when he is about to be beaten to a pulp,someone saves him.That someone is Mr.Myagi(Pat Morita),a humble,diminutive man with great fighting skill.But there is more to Mr Myagi than meets the eye.He is also very wise, as Daniel soon learns.Daniel and Mr Myagi soon develop a bond and without Daniel realizing it,Mr.Myagi begins teaching him karate.Daniel learns that karate is not just learning how to fight,but how to be better person.In the end Daniel regains his respect.this movie is a good family movie,with minimal and mild language and some fight scenes,but is not graphic.Martin Kove turns in a wonderfully villainous performance as Kreese,Johnny Lawrence's sensei.his motto is no mercy,when it comes to fighting.Elizabeth Shue plays Ali,who becomes Daniel's girlfriend.this is a true classic which is entertaining but also has a good message. a strong 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic movie,teaching young kids the value of true karate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The year is 1984,and young,skinny wimp Daniel larusso has moved from new jersey to California.(Ralph maccio was actually in his 20's when this was made,if you didn't already know) At first things are going well,he has some new friends,and he gets a girlfriend,Ali. Then when Ali's former boyfriend,johnny smashes her radio,Daniel steps in and trys to fight him,and easily gets his ass handed to him. His new "friends" abandon him leaving only his girlfriend. He desperately want's to learn karate to stand up to his opponent's,but when he goes to the cobra Kai dojo,run by drill instructor type sensei John kreese,he see's johnny in the dojo and leaves. When he next runs into johnny and his cobra Kai gang,he is brutally beaten and when johnny refuses to show him any mercy,old repairman MR miyagi,runs in and kicks all of there asses and saves Daniel. He convinces Mr.Miyagi to teach him the ancient art of karate,and the best part's of the movie follows,when Mr.mayagi makes young"Daniel-san" paint his fence and wax his cars. Frustrated,Daniel-san is about to give up,when Mr.mayagi tells him he has been in fact prefecting his blocks. Many other wise quotes follow from mayagi such as my personal favorite, Real karate is in here(points to brain),here (points to heart) not here(points to belt). Daniel-san surprisingly makes it to the tournament finals,and when he is tied with johnny in the final match,he assumed the crane stance,and at mayagi's single,does a "crane kick" to johnny's head,knocking him down and winning the tournament,restoring his honor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great movie, that is the standard good vs evil basis for films.The quick gist of the film is, that Daniel and his mom move to the west coast, because of her new job. Daniel gets attacked by bullies and is saved by an unlikely martial arts master. Daniel learns there is more to the martial arts than fighting.Being a martial artist myself, I can heavily relate to this movie. While I didn't' learn from an unlikely master, I did learn over my years of training the spiritual aspects of the martial arts.The fights scenes are simple and not over the top. The acting is done very well, and the coming of age theme is done very well.I've many of the types of people in the film in real life. The martial arts master who promotes physical force, instead of using your mind. The young male, who gets bullied, the person you would least expect to be a martial arts master, etc.Overall this is a great film, that everyone should watch at least once in their life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me tell you just one thing to probe what "Karate Kid" meant for the children of my generation (at least here in Spain): a few weeks after the release of the movie most of the kids in the school had enrolled for karate lessons. We all wanted to be Daniel Laruso!!! It's quite a myth for those who were children in the eighties and even today has an special charm. The story may be kind of typical, but it's been well structured, and what about that final climax!! KARATE KID RULES! *My rate: 7/10--------------------------- --------------------------</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Someone points out in the goofs section that when the drunk master gets the bottle the cap never comes off and he tries to pour. I do not think this is a goof. If you watch the scene very closely, you will see its part of it. He is too drunk to actually take it off. It does not sound like liquid pouring out. He then goes and passes out. I think this was nothing more than an extended attempt by the director to show the level of intoxication by the master. You never actually see the glass with any more booze in it. So, I guess this will remain a topic of debate forever. I just think it was a scene padding. I am not sure how to report it to the goofs section, so I posted it here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ka-Rocky Kid with NY Attitude!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the Ka-Rocky Kid with NY attitude! I saw this for the first time at the grand old age of 26, having endured the charm of Part II time and again on syndicated TV for too many years, and the torture of the Parts III &amp; IV abominations.Only catching glimpses of the final All-Valley Under 18 Karate Champs between "Daniel LaRusso" (Ralph Macchio- The Outsiders' "Pony Boy") and the baddie Cobra Kai hottie "Johhny Lawrence" (Billy Zabka- slow-ass "Jack" from European Vacation) as a kid on pirated HBO sparked my imagination for far too many years. All I can say is this flick will make you get up and cheer (so I agree w/AFI- so what?!!!). Ralph Macchio plays Daniel LaRusso with so much L.I. spunk you kind of forgive that Robert Mark Kamen sets him up as a Newark native. But "Mr. Miyagi" (Pat Morita, bless his departed soul) is to quote Director John Avildsen, "the ultimate surrogate dad" ensuring that "Daniel-san" takes his special brand of Okinawan karate-do training to heart and keeps his temper at bay while bearing the brunt of the Cobra Kai's ruthlessness over Johnny's jealousy having lost his ex-girlfriend "Ali (with an 'i')" (Elisabeth Shue) to the underdog.The editing could have been done better w/spots of continuity problems, one of the most glaring is in the karate tournament/music video montage to Joe Esposito's "You're the Best Around" where horrifically peroxided Cobra Kai cutie bad-ass "Dutch" (Chad McQueen- that's Steve's baby boy) loses a fight to Daniel w/o seeing how Daniel scored the second of his 2-point bout. It's a damn shame that save for Pat Morita (got the Oscar nod for his portrayal of Miyagi) and Elisabeth Shue no one's career took off as Ralph Macchio was forever typecast as Daniel-san for the rest of his professional life along w/the promising Cobra Kai bullies, Billy Zabka who got the Oscar nod for a short film and silent "Jimmy" (though I firmly believe Avildsen edited his lines out) Tony O'Dell is best remembered as "Alan" reprising his preppie role for "Head of The Class". Chad McQueen a retired racer and sometimes actor is on board as executive producer of a film his dad wrote 30 years ago before his death in 1980. Rob Garrison, "Tommy" ("Give 'im a body bag!") dropped off the radar completely in the early '90s and humble "Bobby Brown" played by Ron Thomas the ONLY black belt at the time (now Billy Zabka an HS wrestling champ now sports one of his own b/c of the film) is a self-help guru running his own wellness clinic and dojo in Northern CA. As for Martin Kove, who exquisitely played the Cobra Kai's sadistic sensei, 'Nam vet "Capt. John Kreese" continues to act in bit parts.Call it 80s cheese if you like, but buy the special edition DVD and watch all the features, especially "The Way of The Karate Kid pts. I &amp; II" where the writer, director and main cast members (Pat Morita is featured in the months before his death) share their feelings behind the scenes some 21 years later- Ralph is precocious as ever, Pat gets all the laughs, Martin is philosophical and Billy is hyper! As Easter eggs you get the Survior music vid to the film's ending theme, "The Moment of Truth" and a choreographed fight scene in Pat Johnson's gym to better understand how he worked his martial arts fight choreography and training for the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent coming of age flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE KARATE KID, in my opinion, is an excellent coming of age flick. I thought that Daniel (Ralph Macchio) and Ali (Elisabeth Shue) made a cute couple. To me, Johnny (William Zabka) was a real bully. This was because he couldn't accept the fact that his ex-girlfriend was dating Daniel. If you ask me, Kleese (Martin Kove) was a pure a******! This was because he was a very harsh man who wouldn't tolerate mistakes. My favorite parts were the dance and the confrontations between Daniel and the Cobra Kai. In conclusion, I highly recommend this smash hit to all of you who like coming of age flicks or are fans of Ralph Macchio or Pat Morita.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Please don't misunderstand the message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely love THE KARATE KID ... it's one of the rare occasions in which American film-makers have managed to make a credible martial arts film that is actually ABOUT the underlying Truths of the fighting arts.It's also a terrific, ROCKY-style story about the triumph of the underdog, with endearing characters, convincing performances and thrilling action sequences.But there is one point that needs to be made. Many of the reviewers here have pointed out that the underlying theme of THE KARATE KID is that if you persevere, in the face of overwhelming odds, then you're sure to succeed. I heard this philosophy again when I saw Mary J Blige perform in London in June 2006. Mary enjoyed pointing out to the audience between songs that they mustn't listen to people who tell them they can't achieve whatever they want through believing in themselves.I believe this is an ill-considered and inappropriate assertion to make and quite probably the cause of so much of the anger and frustration we see today, especially in urban youths.Look, I can't carry a tune in a bucket. So no amount of perseverance and tenacity will ever turn me into a world-class opera singer. It's fine for Mary to say, in her experience, believing in herself helped make her a big star - but Mary, love, your fabulous soul voice played a small part in that.Equally with Daniel LaRusso - yes, his stick-to-it character was able to improve his karate to the point where he was able to defeat the bad guys, but that was Daniel's path. Another character may not have benefited so much from the teachings of Mr Miyagi.So the message should be, we can achieve highly if we have the strength of character to carry on when it seems all is against us, PROVIDED we have some degree of talent in our chosen field.To tell youngsters otherwise is foolish and harmful and I wish to blazes our role models would think it through before they offer us life advice ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Teenage martial arts Rocky with a memorable mentor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a great feel good movie (good guy versus bad guy), totally deserving of its popularity.It's of course the tale of a sympathetic young teenager, Daniel, who has just moved from New Jersey to California with his mom. After encountering some trouble from the local bullies, he is given some karate lessons from the neighboring Oriental, Mr. Miyagi, the most memorable mentor of all time. The role of Daniel is charmingly played by Ralph Macchio, but Mr. Miyagi (portrayed to perfection by Pat Morita) MAKES this movie with his quiet humor, his bonsai skills, his unique fly catching technique, his teaching tactics (the immortal "Wax on, wax off"), and his personal story of loss during World War II, so touchingly conveyed to young Daniel.Of course it's a classic coming of age tale, so naturally there's a pretty love interest for our young hero, but it's the unusual and touching relationship that develops between the fatherless Daniel-san and the older and very wise Mr. Miyagi (with his lessons in both karate and life) that fuels the fire igniting this movie. As another reviewer cleverly noted, Mr. Miyagi is the father Daniel never had and Daniel is the son Mr. Miyagi never had. As for the Rocky style karate match between Daniel and his quintessential bully opponent, I won't give the winner away, but it'll keep you glued to your seat and cheering regardless of whether or not you're normally a fan of the martial arts. A fabulous movie (also the sequels). My husband, my teenage son, and I...not one of the three of us can resist tuning in to it whenever it happens to be on TV.</fullReview>

Normally I only see a film one or possibly two times but this is no ordinary movie. When I was young (younger) i could watch it 3 times on one day if I was ill and home from school. The other movies are also good but the original is the best. It combines a little action with a little wisedom and also some romance. It contains everything. It also gives hope to young students who get bullied in school or feels lonely and lost. We all should have a Mr Miyagi in our lives.... Rest in Peace Pat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1984 is responsible for about 80% of my great childhood memories. "Karate Kid" has to be right up there.The movie centres around the "too close for comfort" relationship between Daniel (macchio) and Mr Miyagi (Morita). Daniel and his mother move to LA to advance her career. Daniel is happy about it, and is soon even more unhappy as he starts getting picked on by some karate thugs. Daniel is also a karate student, it's just he's rubbish at it. One day he comes across the apartment repairman, Mr Miyagi, and the two strike up a relationship. Turns out Mr Miyagi is a major karate factor and teaches Daniel his special brand of karate, which during training revolves around doing Miyagi's odd jobs. Daniel decides to enter a tournament against his nemesis Johnny, who has beaten the suitcase out of him every other time they've crossed paths. Will Daniel beat Johnny? See it and find out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredible movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is the first movie to a three movie sequel. It is about a boy that has just moved to a new home. But he finds himself in a trouble situation that contains karate and anger. He has experienced pain and hurt in this new town but finds a friend. He is his only friend and is also his only chance of revenge and to prove that he is strong inside and out through the use of karate. He and his friend must work together to achieve their aim and the purpose of him trying to learn karate. The main character in the movie, Daniel Laruso is played by a 23 year old Ralph Macchio. This guy is unbelievable! He plays his character in a way that will make you feel like your just like him. He plays his character well by playing his a weak boy at the beginning of the movie but builds up bravery, strength and also confidence to Daniel. He protrays him exactly how he should be portrayed. The difference that this movie has and most other movie like it is that it is one that you will remember always once you watch it. This movie will make you cry and then make you smile like your on top of the world. This movie is a feel good movie and I recommend that you watch it if you haven't because you are missing out in a great movie. I am sure others who have watched this movie enjoyed it. So did I. And I am sure the people who hasn't watched it will as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartwarming "Formula" Teen Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director John Avildsen (of the "Rocky" fame) applies his "root-for-the-underdog" formula to this teenage drama, resulting in a heartwarming, satisfying family fare. Ralph Maccio (at 22 still convincing as a mid-teen) plays the "kid" who is tormented by bullies, until an elderly Karate master (effectively portrayed by Pat Morita) teaches the boy the spiritual and physical disciplines of Karate. The predictable outcome is nonetheless uplifting and gives the audience (especially children) the message that good will triumph over evil.The relationship between the "kid" and his "teacher" is a high point of this film. Seen as a surrogate father-son team, the leads' interaction is a delight to view. This is one of the best films of its kind. I highly recommend this film as an alternative to other, much more violent "entertainment" that seems to dominate Hollywood lately.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just found out that the director of 'The Karate Kid' also directed 'Rocky', and you can tell. This is not a bad thing, it's just that both films pour out with the lesson of self belief. But back onto 'The Karate Kid'.Even now, watching this film I still get butterflies at the end. When the bad coach shouts "finish him", Mr Miyagi nodding his head, the music, the referee shouting "fight", it still affects me. And the crane kick, oh my god amazing. And that is just the end.The whole film oozes out self belief and friendship. The relationship between Daniel and Mr Miyagi is very heartwarming and realistic. This applies well with the storyline, as it makes the story well scripted and well thought out.The cast did incredibly well to bring their characters to life, especially Daniel and Mr Miyagi (again). Also, I thought that Mrs Larusso did a fine job at playing the worried and caring mother of Daniel.So altogether, this film has heartwarming emotions and lessons to learn in your own life. Karate is for self defence and don't mess with Mr Miyagi!</fullReview>

But when I saw "The Karate Kid" I realized that I just don't give a rip what people thought about me. And then after that People saw I was a cool guy a made some friends but of course your gonna have some point when some punk is going to talk trash about you, and when you feel like you need to fight him just because he's talking trash watch "The Karate Kid" and you'll who cares what that jerk off thinks i'm going to live my life the way I want to live it. So thats my comment and contains no spoilers just a message of how the movie touched my life. And if you have never seen this movie before get off your butt and buy the DVD Collection and you'll see that "The Karate Kid" is one of the most inspiring movies ever made and if your picked a lot watch that movie immediately. Now I know a lot of those lame martial-arts fans will say "it sucks" but they like jean-crud van-damme movies not real movies. So don't listen them just watch the movie and you'll see that these people are full of crud and they don't know what their talking about because they don't know real movies and they will probably never know a real movie. And if your at a tough spot at whether you should watch this movie, don't hesitate watch the damn movie and you'll like it so don't listen to all those fake ass people who don't know movies just watch it and I know you'll like it OK!!!!!!</fullReview>

But watching this film 20 years later made me see that is actually a winner of a film.You can kind of tell it had the same director as Rocky, as underdog tales seem to be his specialty.Ralph Macchio is Daniel LaRusso, a poor kid who lives with his mother. They just moved to Resida, California after his mom switched jobs. After being bullied by local punks he turns to handyman Mr. Miyagi for karate lessons.Little does Daniel realize is that he learns karate from painting, waxing, and sanding!Miyagi tells Daniel to "Wax on, Wax off!" and just by the motions of his hands he learns how to block karate chops!Not as good as Rocky, but it's marvelous storytelling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is about a teenage boy moving to California from New Jersey. When the boy named Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) arrives, befriends Ali Mills (Elizabeth Shue), and becomes enemies with Johnny Lawrence who is the ex-boyfriend of Ali. Johnny happens to be a black belt in karate. Throughout the movie, Daniel gets beat up several times, by Johnny and his friends who also train in the same dojo Cobra Kai that he does. A Japanese handy-man named Mr. Miyagi knows about these issues, and teaches Daniel that karate is really about self-respect. The duo also learn that the reason why those boys are so violent, is because that is how their sensei John Krease (Martin Kove) is teaching them to be. Overall I enjoyed this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>after 20 years i see it again tonight. certainly it's still amusing. the plot is totally predictable but the point is the spirit.very naturally i think of Rocky although the feeling is not exactly the same. The Karate Kid is not that "intense". anyway i like them both. the emphasis here is placed on "balance". that's Taoism. Nature is no enemy although fighting spirit gains us self-respect. to grasp the balance we have to fight in a humble manner. it's no easy task. Rocky seems to convey no such kind of message. but we can find it in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. also this movie puts some doubt in my mind - can we still make a movie like that today ? certainly, but in a different style - more complicated and thus maybe less "powerful". perhaps sometimes a complicated message is best to be conveyed in a simple way. or maybe we should not remove all our passion from movie. today we get smarter but no doubt it costs something. one day we may have no dream anymore. things really keep changing. in 1984 i saw this movie on cinema. no way could i believe that time i would see it on computer after 20 years. All actors are good and i do like the music. it's a very nice movie. don't miss it.</fullReview>

It didn't break any new ground (or any ground for that matter) but it was lots of fun. Avildsen's love for "underdog/outsider" movies may have been his downfall, but like "Rocky" before it, Karate Kid had me cheering (figuratively) for Larusso by movies end."It's a cruel....., cruel summer," and if you found yourself humming just now you are an 80's child, and doubtless saw Karate Kid two or three times. But that's okay, Karate Kid had no depth to it, but neither did it warrant any. It is what it is, a fun, harmless, great movie going experience. And you know you had a crush on Elizabeth Shue!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Daniel (Ralph Macchio) move from New Jersey to California and almost immediately runs afoul of karate trained high school bullies. He is rescued by Japanese janitor Noriyuki "Pat" Morita, who agrees to teach Macchio how to harness karate for good instead of brutality. The film culminates in a championship karate bout, pitting Macchio against his sworn enemy Martin Kove. Karate Kid is an all time favorite and the best of the series like most originals are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This, besides the Bruce Lee movies, probably got people interested in martial arts.Directed by John G. Avildsen, it tells of a young school kid named Danny (Ralph Macchio), who has just moved with his mother to a new town. Before too long he is attacked by The Cobras, a group of karate students whose leader used todate a girl named Ali (Elisabeth Shue) who takes an interest in Danny.After just one too many beatings, plus the discovery that an old man namedMiyagi (Pat Morita) knows karate, Danny decides that he must learn karate.However, can he last through Miyagi's unorthodox teaching methods?This film used to be quite amusing, and is one of the few Western filmscontaining martial arts that shows some of the martial spirit (in an unusual way), but now it looks rather dated and tacky. Knowing from other movies that PatMorita can speak English a lot better than he does here is a little insulting. Also, what exactly is the Crane stance -- a kung-fu stance -- doing in a film about karate?Its only real saving grace these days is that many parents will not feel that it's something they should shield from their little 'uns (fortunately it's not excessively violent), provided that they take on board that martial arts are not to be used aggressively.Look out for Chad McQueen (son of legendary Steve) as one of the Cobras.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a guilty pleasure for me, because my brain recognizes how silly it is, but I always come back and watch it again. Any movie, let alone a trilogy, which takes an irritating, unlikeable whiner and makes him the heroic protagonist deserves some respect, at least for overcoming the hurdles associated with making an unlikeable character likeable. See also, Star Wars.Ralph Macchio explodes onto the screen as Daniel Larusso, the aformentioned whiner. The kid gets into fist fights over boomboxes, steals a guy's girlfriend, hoses the guy down at the school dance, and blames the subsequent problems on his "stupid bike." He is, for lack of a better word, a bonehead. Who WOULDN'T love this crazy all-American teen?Then Pat Morita steps in to give Daniel some much-needed direction. His attempts to help are greeted with more and more whining. But through months of zen floorwax training, Daniel-san becomes the grandmaster of Miyagido Karate and proves once and for all that violence really IS the answer.Unfortunately, this is one of those movies that contributes to the general American non-understanding of Asian cultures, with its stereotypically eccentric Mr. Miyagi, but Kreese (the EVIL karate instructor!) is equally eccentric, so I guess I forgive the filmmakers for that.A word on this movie's soundtrack: Gnarly! During the beach party sequence, we are treated to a rapidfire trio of obscure 80s pop tunes (possibly "fake songs," written especially for the movie, but I'm not sure about that). And during the tournament scene, you'll be dancing like a dork to the motivational hit "You're the Best Around (No One's Ever Gonna Keep You Down)!" or whatever that song's called, I don't know.FUN FACT: I used to have this movie on VHS. I copied it from my local video store. But the movie is more than two hours long, and I used SP speed to tape it...so right after Kreese says, "sweep the leg," and Daniel's knee is apparently crushed, the tape ends, with Daniel crumpled on the floor in a heap, gasping for life. It's GREAT.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We know there is no such thing as a crane technique. Which was the finishing move Daniel used in the movie. Yes we know that a person can't learn to master martial arts in a few months. Just the same this was a great movie. You had an underdog moving to California from Jersey. The popular tough guy at school picking on him. Mix this with Mr. Miagi's little funny one liners and you enjoy the movie. I saw this at the theater when it first came out. I can remember at the climax the whole theater crowd cheering. Yes you have to suspend disbelief a little but still a great movie just the same. It does not glorify violence but as karate was intended, it glorifies self respect and discipline. A good movie for the family too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Superfight of The Century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starring Ralph Macchio, Pat Morita, Elisabeth Shue, William Zabka, Randee Heller, and Martin Kove.The story is about Daniel LaRusso, a senior in High School who moves to Reseda, California from New Jersey. When he moves there, he gets into his first fight on the beach at a party by the head Karate student of the Cobra Kai. When Daniel seems to get beaten pretty badly, he becomes friends with the Handyman, Mr. Miyagi. After a Halloween Party at school, the Cobras attack Daniel again, which brings Mr. Miyagi to Daniel's defense. The next day, Mr. Miyagi and Daniel go to the Cobra Kai dojo to discuss the problem. The Sensei, Kreese, will not let them get by without a fight. Miyagi makes a suggestion for the Karate Tournament. Kreese accepts. That gives Daniel two months to train for the fight that will change his life forever.One of my favorite 80's movies. I think that it did better than 6.5 out of 10. If you were to watch any sequels, watch Part II. This movie has one of my favorite endings in Motion Picture History. Director John G. Avildsen did a great job, afterall he did direct Rocky. Pat Morita did such a good job at acting, that he was nominated for an Academy Award.3.5 out of 4. My IMDB Rating: 7.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having trained in various martial arts styles on and off (OK, mostly off) for the last 26 years (the longest stint in an Okinawan style of karate), I think this film reveals more honest truth about Karate then any of the others I've seen, though I am admitedly not a huge fan of martial arts films. Miyagi is indeed a famous surname of Okinawan martial artists; Karate used everyday work implements and movements as part of secretive training to avoid detection by Chinese and Japanese conquerors. (Even the American occupation is hinted at in one of the sequels). Okinawans are renowned for using their karate skills only for defensive purposes. The Chinese predecessors to Karate (particularly the style called Kung Fu [Chuan Fa] in the West) took many movements from nature (e.g.: Crane Style); mostly Western, non-traditional accoutrements include the belt system, exhibition sparring, etc. Breaking bottles is the most extreme and advanced form of a speed break (don't try this at home kids :-) ). "Focus all your power in this one punch"; "Karate not just way to fight, Karate way to live"; "Do Karate Yes, do Karate No, not 'Do Karate guess-so"; are all integral parts of what martial artists of any style are expected to learn. "Best block, not to be there" is something I think about every time I spar. Yes, elevating the Crane style "#4 jump front kick" (as it's referred to in my current style) to something mystical was unfortunate, as was the "always look eyes" (considered disrespectful and a sign of distrust in ALL Asian cultures AFAIK), but overall a much more informative and enjoyable movie than most of the films Hong Kong seems to churn out by the hour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been an IMDB user for a couple years now and today I watched the Karate Kid - and was amazed to realize i had never looked it up on IMDB to see what grade the IMDB community had given it. 6.5???!?!?!?! You people should be ashamed of yourselves.The karate Kid may be the best film to come out of the 1980 - if its not the best its in the top couple. It is the ultimate story of the underdog beating the odds. This theme had been done in movies and tv long before Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita waxed on and waxed off - and it has been done a million times since. But, at least in my experience, it is only once in a blue moon that a movie creates a story and a character that it is so easy to identify with.maybe I am a product of the time I grew up - but i am confident that whatever age I am when I watch this movie, I will be able to relate with Daniel LaRusso - and judging from a lot of the user comments i read, a lot of you agree with me. This is why the grade confuses me, but whatever.This movie is solid all the way through - the acting is fantastic from Ralph Macchio, Pat Morita, Elisabeth Shue - and the very underrated William Zabka, who played Johnny lawrence, the leader of the Cobras who will always in this guy's mind - be the prototypical bully. i also feel i should mention that this movie is put over the top and into the "classic" category because it has easily one of the best endings of all time. Whoever is not inspired by that ending simply is not human. 9/10 </fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're tired of watching movies where an old Japanese man teaches a young kid to fight karate, don't forget this is one of the pioneers in this kind of plot. In opposite to all the other ones, "Karate Kid" is interesting and makes everybody see such fight with the eyes of art. Highly recommended for everybody, even people who know nothing about karate. There's a slice of innocence in this movie. This is obvious in the scenes where the protagonist Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) makes his best to please a rich beautiful girl named Ali (Elisabeth Shue). To make the film even easier to attract the audience's attention, there's a villain too: Johnny (William Zabka), who is Ali's ex-boyfriend and who hates Daniel.Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) is an old Japanese man who fixes things for the neighbours and later teaches Daniel karate using unusual techniques, where the pupil learns his "lesson" in close contact with housework and nature.I rate it 7 maybe 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Daniel-san's excellent adventure...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(** a minor spoiler or two herein**) When I saw this at the theater upon release I knew that what I'd just seen was essentially a less gritty and considerably lighter rerun of "Rocky" for a younger set, substituting karate for boxing and the sunny environs of 'the Valley' for Philly's urban decay but otherwise constructed of the same kinds of elements. That familiar story though, already familiar enough in its essentials when "Rocky" came out, is one that movie audiences apparently have yet to tire of. It works for me, anyway -- I loved this film when it came out and I still watch it with a great deal of affection. As is true of many movies from the '70s and '80s, part of the appeal for me and probably for many others has to do with nostalgia. In my case, at the time of the film's release I was just a couple of years or so older than the film's characters, had long been silently infatuated with a girl who looked more than vaguely reminiscent of Elisabeth Shue (if the Shue fits...), and a few years before had suffered a disastrous introduction to martial arts under the sadistic tutelage of a karate teacher who made Martin Kove's scarily sociopathic bad seed look like Mary Poppins. One of the story elements in "The Karate Kid" relates to the fact that the teacher -- of martial arts or anything else -- can make all the difference. The casting of Pat Morita and Martin Kove as skilled karateka with diametrically-opposed philosophies also works both as a cultural commentary (brash, materialistic, goal-oriented West versus the more multifaceted, humble, centered East) and as an embodiment of the yin-yang principle of opposites. For my part, I can certainly testify that Martin Kove's nasty meat-axe of a character is, unfortunately, nowhere near as over-the-top as many might think. Luckily, Mr Miyagi's character (that Pat Morita does an exquisite job with) is also not at all far-fetched in terms of his teacherly attributes. A lot's changed since "The Karate Kid" came out. Elisabeth Shue has gone on to critical raves for later roles (I have no idea where her semi-lookalike is these days) and I ended up living not only in the US but, for several years, not too far from where the action in "Karate Kid" unfolds. I've also been training in Chinese martial arts (commonly known as 'kung fu') since 1986 -- and, no, as far as I'm aware this movie was no influence on that, though my earlier negative experience with the Sensei Kreese clone kept me from getting back on that particular horse for long enough. As my experience with and knowledge of martial arts grew I saw that this film has one flaw of particular note regarding martial arts training: Daniel's learning enough within a few months to effect a tournament win is unrealistic and only reinforces the con-job claims of some 'instant masters' that they can turn anyone into a lethal weapon within such-and-such a timespan. Then again, compression of time was necessary for the narrative and -- besides -- early in the film Daniel claims to have learned some karate at a New Jersey YMCA. I'll give them that one, in the interest of dramatic license. On the bright side, the philosophies expressed and implied within "The Karate Kid," including those that point out the hidden value of techniques for which martial application is not obvious ("wax on, wax off"), are generally consistent with those that form part of the morality base of traditional Asian martial arts. They're also philosophies that more youth -- particularly in the US -- could do well to adopt, embody, and live by. If this film still gets young people into martial arts (as long as the teacher's a good one, more Miyagi than Kreese), so much the better for them, for their families, and for society. This is one of a few films that I can painlessly watch again and again and I think that it's held its own very well over the years. It's hardly a deep movie (neither is it completely shallow), but sometimes that's a good thing. By the way, I'm still just beginning to cope with the discovery that the blond leader of the Cobra Kai group of teens was William Zabka -- I'd always thought that he was Vince Van Patten, who I could swear looked exactly the same back in the '70s. Then again, it seems like everyone on TV and in the movies back then had that California blond beach god or goddess thing going on...</fullReview>

Macchio and Morita work great together as Daniel-san and Mr. Miyagi, and Zabka plays a mean bad guy, the perfect rival for Daniel. (Check him out in "One of the Guys") Classic lines ("Wax On, Wax Off!"), classic '80s music and styles, and great action sequences make this one a movie that lasts. And the whole family can watch it together, unlike some of the stuff that's out these days. Simply put, this movie has something for most everyone. Definitely a Doomite-Approved film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview> Ah, this film brings back so many pleasant memories of my childhood, such as watching it 8 or 9 times in one day and annoying the hell out of my older sister with it. It's that kind of movie that requires little effort on the part of the viewer, and you can watch it after a hard day and still digest the messages it's promoting. I have to disagree with many on here and say that it's Macchio who is the best thing about the film, and not Morita. He seems to capture perfectly the awkwardness of adolescence; so much so that I'm still trying to get my head around the fact that he was 23 when he made it! No wonder he has struggled for work since if he looks that young... Thinking back at it now; Miyagi can be seen as quite an irritating character, spouting inane homilies that are almost as bad as 'Confucius, he say: man with holes in pockets...' A smidgen of good taste and the IMDB smut regulators permit me from finishing that one. (SPOILERS) Shue is used as window dressing here, but oh, what lovely window dressing she makes! Martin Kove is also suitably menacing as the bad guy, although the final scene always reduces my friend to hysterics, when he gives orders to "Sweep the leg, do you have a problem with that?" My pal sensibly points out that the leg sweep is an unbelievably tame move, and one which he is well within his rights in performing. Similarly, the famous "Crane Kick" is also quite basic, and not the audacious act of ingenuity it is portrayed as here. Shamelessly manipulative tosh when compared to real life then, but there's nothing wrong with that if it's done well. In Avildsen, the director, we have a man who has already performed the trick once with "Rocky". With "The Karate Kid", he proved he could do "Rocky-lite" for teenagers too...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a Classic! -- in need of a Widescreen DVD Presentation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard it said that psychologists have found that certain films can promote certain emotional healings. When I think back on this gem of a film, it certainly brings back a barrage of emotions. It always reminds me of those times when bullies made my school days miserable, and I felt like a weakling, unable to steer my own destiny. In "The Karate Kid" I found a comrade in spirit with Daniel. He fought back only when pressed from all sides, and no other avenue of escape existed. Even when faced with the "no mercy" and "unfair" methods, Daniel San still presses on -- courageous --determined and encouraged by his mentor to do the honorable thing. The most disappointing aspect of the movie? Only having the pan-and-scan version on the DVD. I'd think that the studios would clamor at the chance to give this film a first-class presentation. Widescreen and Dolby 5.1 would restore the quality of this wonderful film and build on the emotional crush that the film delivers... So that when Daniel faces his adversaries, and the crowd cheers him on, I can FEEL his fear and anxiety. An experience like this is only heightened by the visual and audio impact of Daniel's victory. And in that moment, as I sit immersed in that feeling.. those memories from my own life replay.... and from that comes the reminder, that like Daniel, I've ended up victorious! Man, what a movie. Can't wait to see this film with a decent treatment!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not think that this type of movie will ever be made as good as this one. Following the story of the underdog coming good, the Karate Kid is one of those films that has you glued to the screen even though you know how it will turn out. Daniel moves from his home town to Calafornia with his mum and immediately starts to get bullied by a load of kids at his school who are also a bit handy when it comes to Karate. The local handyman at the housing area he lives at, teaches him karate in a very unorthadox manner but also teaches him more about life. There a a number of points in this film that make it seem a lot more realistic than other movies of this type. The fact that Daniel has not got a father and the fact he and his mum live in a very modest flat rather than the usual mansion you see in movies, make it easier to identify with the story. The ending still has the hairs on my neck standing up. Macchio turns in a brilliant performance and the soundtrack is superb in an 80's cheesy way!!!!! 5/5 for a memorable, feel good film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Karate Kid" was another terrific movie from the '80s. This hit drama from the Oscar-winning director of "Rocky" is about a teenager from New Jersey who (along with his mother) moves to California and once he gets there is immediately bullied around by the local nasty boys who are experienced martial artists. Then one night the villainous bad boys beat up the kid real good until a Japanese handyman steps in and precedes to kick their butts and save the kid. The handyman then decides to teach the kid karate, and the boy begins to learn about some important lessons in life. This is a movie that made me feel good after seeing it in the theater in 1984. It's heartwarming, funny, and entertaining. Ralph Macchio stars in his most famous role as Daniel, the Karate Kid. Elisabeth Shue also stars in one of her early film roles as Ali, Daniel's girlfriend who just happens to be the ex-girlfriend of the lead bully. But the real scene stealer in "The Karate Kid" is Pat Morita, whose just wonderful as Mr. Miyagi, the old Japanese handyman who teaches Daniel some unique karate techniques (some of them are good for alot of laughs). "The Karate Kid" became such a big hit when first released in the summer of 1984 that three sequels followed. The next film "Karate Kid II" was very good, but "Karate Kid III" and "The Next Karate Kid" (the latter starring a then little known actress named Hilary Swank) were mediocre. This one's the best. It's a winner in my book.***1/2 (out of four)</fullReview>

I liked Elizabeth Shue as his gal too-she was sweet if ornamental-not given much to do, etc. Their time at the fun park is nicely shown.Miyagi of course is the centre of the whole shebang, Morita deserved his Oscar Nomination here. Such a leap from Happy Days eh? He was great-self assured, taciturn, well intentioned, wise, etc. I have always thought that this was one of the 40 best performances in the 80s easily.Gotta like William Zabka trotting out his blonde SOB surfer-dude character too here, which he used in 'Back to School' and other places with effect in the mid-80s. He has kinda disappeared though, but here he is good. You really do learn to hate him. Ditto Steve McQueen's kid, it's too bad he didn't go onto bigger things. Martin Kove of course is pretty nasty too.You can't hate this film, the 'Wax on/Wax off' stuff, the posing on the end of the boat ala Crane-style, the new car he's given-great stuff.It has lasted too.I give it a ***1/2 rating and recommend it highly of course.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The karate kid is an underrated classic. This is a witty, funny movie that follows Daniel from his first days in California as a nobody to becoming the Karate Kid. Some of the greatest lines in Movie history come from this movie lines like "Get him a body bag" "Hey he hooked me" "I decide when he's had enough" John the bad guy should of one a academy award he plays a mean mean person very very well. And of course Mr. Miagi the mentor and spirtual advisor to Daniel on his journey to becoming the Karate Kid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definately one of the best films of the 80's. I am 22, and remember seeing this movie when i was like 6. I didn't fully understand many of the subplots working along with the karate. Now, in my older days, i watch this film and realize what a true masterpiece it really is. Without a doubt, this is the best of the trilogy, because i do not even count "the next karate kid" as part of the trilogy. Macchio, Morita, Shue, Zabka, Cove, Heller, and the rest of the Kobra Kae's really made this movie interesting and fun. It spawned three sequels, plus video games for all the game systems of the 80s. I actually watched this film today, and I was thrilled once again. No matter how many times i watch it, the plot never gets old, and the story is always fresh and exciting. I also took notice of Chad Mcqueen's performance of Dutch, and definately give him props for the role of the second best bad guy in the film. So if your in the mood for an 80s cult classic, Choose Daniel and Miyagi.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pat Morita (Mr. Miyagi) and William Zabka (Johnny) are excellent in their roles; I hope they find Oscar-nomination vehicles some day. Ralph Macchio does a credible job as the protagonist, especially as he avoids maturing too much during the movie.The classic formula is done well, although the bad guys are just a touch overdone for my taste. I've seen the movie 4 times over the past 14 years, and the story still holds up very well. The character backgrounds are good, nothing is overdone, and the movie progresses at a very good pace.The movie's one glaring error is the ending. It works for the USer audience naive in karate-do, while screaming "SELL-OUT" to those trained in the art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dont know too many who hated this, the story of toothpick sized kid (Macchio) from Jersey who gets a daily beating from Valley boys after moving to California. A harmless looking handyman surprises the hell out of Macchios' tormentors one night, and one of the most memorable relationships on screen was created. Mr. Miyagi and Daniel, the older oriental and the young teenager are two of the best characters you'll ever see. Everybody will forever remember "wax on, wax off," Moritas many "Danielsans!," or one of the most recognizable poses ever, the Krane Technique. The climax is extremely uplifting and unless youre horribly unemotional, you'll smile everytime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A simple re-telling of Rocky (by the same director) quickly turns out to be a great movie. The story is that a boy named Daniel moves to California and be-friends a girl but there is a problem, the girl has a jealous ex- boyfriend who knows karate and beats on Daniel when ever he gets the chance. So Daniel learns karate from an old but wise handyman at his apartment, Mr. Myagi. Charming movie with great story, perfect characters, and an exciting climax. One of the most memorable scenes in this movie is the wax on, wax off technique which has been a staple in the martial arts genre and gets parodied all the time. The story played out so well and that's thanks to the great characters. Sure it may be dated in some spots and it's kind of hokey, it's so enjoyable you forget about all that. So overall, it's a up-lifting movie that's just as lovable as Rocky.</fullReview>

I connected with the Daniel's navigation from the agony of defeat to the ecstacy of victory.The metaphor "balance is not just in karate, but in life",is something I try and use today. The way Mr.Miyagi infused simple work tasks to train Daniel without him knowing was genius. I laughed as Daniel thought he was being worked like a slave,but indeed had learned several moves that would serve him well. The special bond that began from complete strangers,to that of forever friends made this movie a tear jerker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, this is probably the epitome of eighties films. Some dufus moves to town, and gets picked on by the local bully/(ies). Some sage advice is provided by a reclusive adult. Soon thereof, the dufus hooks up with the teen hottie, who's usually the girlfriend of the bully, more problems ensue, but in the end, the dufus wins the day, the girl, and more importantly the respect of the bully. Yeah, this is just a morality tale, to find the hero in oneself, and conquer your fears, but in real life that's usually a bunch of hog-wash. Bullies usually prevail (I speak from experience, I've beat up a lot of nerds in my day), Sage adults dishing out useful advice don't exist (a recluse is usually that way cause they're a drunk pedophile), and the hot chick stays with the school bully, cause they're cool and can pretty much kick the a** of anyone dumb enough to mess with them. So why do I rate this film so high? Simple, in the final confrontation at the Karate Tournament, there's a goon that yells to his Buddy the bully "Send him home in a body bag." then gleefully laughs about it. Classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's full of clichs: the Oriental philosopher, the kid bullied at school,and you know who's going to win the karate contest, even if he does only have one leg to stand on. That apart, it is a good film: it's educational and there is plenty there for the parents who are bringing their kids to the cinema.To the person who says it is not possible for someone to learn karate in two months and then win a tournament, I would say that that person does not know much about combat sports. It is not only possible, it has even been done. The lesson here is that the Cobra Kai dojo are teaching karate the wrong way, that karate is more than just a way to beat people up: it is a kind of meditation, if you like; and if you have not grasped this essential, advancement above the lower stages of the sport is impossible.This film is good by itself, but is even better as an introduction to the rest of the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love this ironically</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is undeniably silly. Its plot is a clich; a boy is humiliated at the hands of another stronger boy whom he struggles to best. Although a hackneyed plot, why can I not stop watching this movie when it is aired. It may be that I was kid when I saw this and I watch because of nostalgia; the same reason I contiue to listen to Duran Duran. However, I saw The Goonies at the same time and do not feel any sort of loyalty to that film. I watch because many of the karate moves are fun to imitate. I watch because Elizabeth Shue is cute and ebullient, a perfect representation of adolescent yearning in the 1980's. The dialogue is ironically excellent. I laugh in all the wrong places; "Put him in a body bag Johnny!", "Johnny you're a cream puff!" Who says phrases like "cream puff"; it is outrageous.I love the final song performed by Joe Esposito, an anthemic fight song proclaiming that, "You're the best around, no ones ever gonna take you down!" Completing the distillation of 1980's culture is Daniel Laruso's dress. In one seen he is sporting a pair of aviator sunglasses, a buttoned dress shirt, and a pair of camouflage pants. He looks like the victim of a terrible thrift store explosion. The movie however trite still elicits intended emotions and I continue to find myself internally cheering for Daniel to defeat his adversaries. His tormentor and his cronies are portrayed as loyal, smug minions of a slick, arrogant teacher. He has no redeeming qualities and I felt anger toward his cruelty and ability to distort the sensibilities of his students. The Karate Kid is a film you will ridicule with your friends and love when alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Karateeee Chop! (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Karate Kid is apparently one of those 80s nostalgia films that have long since transcended the decade and distanced itself quite far from obscurity. This is probably in large part because of the story.Daniel LaRusso (Ralp Maccio making himself prominent in the business for this role but now having disappeared) is kind of a wimpy, insecure teenager from Jersey who moves with his mom to California. This is where he becomes the vulnerable target of a group of karate chopping bullies, The Cobra Kai, headed by Johnny (played by the gorgeous William Zabka in the bully roles he was type casted for in the 80s). (Look for Steve McQueen's son, Chad McQueen as the guy who bounces around a lot before he prepares to fight during competition scenes). But the building super, Mr. Miyagi, an old karate expert from Okanawa, teaches Daniel the essentials of karate to build his body, his mind, and as always, his self-esteem (which also helps him with his pretty girlfriend, Ali Mills, who is played by Elizabeth Shue). Miyagi's teachings are different from the that of the Cobra Kai master (Martin Kove) because Miyagi is teaching something like soul karate to Daniel (to accept himself in order to gain confidence and then work on his fighting technique from there--to keep him from going 'squish, just like grape'), while the Cobra Kai Master instills on his students a philosophy of win at all costs.This is one of the few enjoyable American martial arts movies, let alone martial arts movies in general (for me anways, since I'm a little tired of the repeated story lines of fighters seeking revenge for the death of masters/brothers/fathers/uncles, etc.). Here, you have a teenager who is being hassled. His mentor (Mr. Miyagi played by Pat Morita, a role he was nominated for) is going to help train him to improve his confidence, and soon enough, to become a decent fighter able to compete against the ruthless Cobra Kai ("show no mercy!"). You also get a few lessons in traditional (Miyagi) and modern karate (Cobra Kai, other teams at the competition) style in addition to an entertaining story. The follow up movies were for the most part absolute disasters, going with two sequels starring Machio and Morita. Part 2 takes place in Mr. Miyagi's hometown, Okanawa. The third (in which Cobra Kai master, Martin Kove returns) features a new kind of karate nemesis who befriends Daniel, but actually turns out to be in kahootz. Number four, 'The Next Karate Kid,' however, features a female heroine, played by Hilary Swank who is paired up with our old friend, Mr. Miyagi. The first is and always will be the best (and in my opinion, the only one worth watching in its entirety). It was so popular, they even had an NES game for it (I didn't like it much).Albeit corny at times (Maccio comes off as too pathetic in the earlier scenes), 80s fans (especially young girls) should be drawn by the teen cast alone. Ralph Maccio (who was surprisingly older than Zabka at the time) is a charming, though sometimes doofus character. And Johnny is his relentless (and gorgeous) nemesis, as leader of the Cobra Kai (just under his sensai, of course, since they're an organized karate team). This movie is a lot of fun with great fight sequences, a nice story, great music, and a good cast. And, it is extremely 80s. Yet, young audiences can still enjoy it after all these years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing this film again recently, was like visiting an old friend. OK I didn't see when it was first released (I was 4 years old in 1984!) but it is still a childhood memory. It's a violent film without being too graphic, and there are some pleasant moments without being too cheesy. It was fun, and it also prepared me for a teenage life that was later to come! And of course Mr Myagi was a gem! I think everybody knows who you are referring to to with the phrases "Wax on, Wax off" and "Daniel san". But seeing it again, the teenage thugs were just funny! Nothing menacing about them at all - even when they were dressed as skeletons.

A must see movie, if you haven't already, especially if you are a child of the 80s like me! The Karate Kid Part II is okay. It lacks the magic of the first movie, but it is still okay.

Daniel LaRusso is a senior moving from New Jersey to California, and when he arrives, he doesn't receive a warm welcome from the karate students, who beat up on Daniel. So Mr. Miyagi, the handyman in Daniel's neighborhood, agrees to talk it over with the karate master and teach Daniel karate in two months, also to tell him that fighting is not important.Under-rated by many people, The Karate Kid is a wonderful movie from the 80's that delivers a great message. There is great acting from almost everyone, especially Morita, in an Oscar nominated performance. The director, John Avildsen, did a great job with this, as he did with Rocky.

		<fullReview>***Spoilers within********This movie is just awesome. The story of a kid who is taken from his comfort zone, and dragged across many states. He is placed within a world he is not use to. He makes an enemy with the towns most notorious Karate experts, because he falls in live with the leaders x-girlfriend. These Karate experts unfortunately go to the same school as him. They beat him to a pulp day after day.At the same time he befriends an old man who not only teaches him how to fight these karate experts. But he teaches him the meaning of life, friendship, Karate (and above all)love. A love that goes beyond that of a boyfriend-girlfriend. The type love a father should give his son.This is a timeless classic, that has a meaning within a meaning. The meaning seems to be, if someone believes in you and you believe in them and yourself. You can soar as high as you want. But the meaning within the meaning is: if you stop and look beyond the appearance of something, you may just find that there is something special hidden in us all. Deep, I know. But fact of life.I give this movie 9 out of 10. Excellent flick!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it was a new release in the summer of 1984, with a guy I was crazy about. This movie illustrated for me the difference between the way a man perceives a situation and the way a woman does, because if I remember correctly, my friend thought Daniel was asking for it by messing with the Cobra Kai boys, and I was all caught up in the romance thing between Daniel and Allie. Mars and Venus for sure. LOLNow that I'm 38 instead of 19, I can see my friend's point, although I also got some help from some of the people who've posted here saying that Daniel was a little weasel who deserved getting his butt kicked hourly. LOL However, I have *always* found the idea of someone learning enough karate in a few weeks' time to win a regional championship a little far-fetched. And I thought both Miyagi and Kreese were fashioned into caricatures -- it wasn't necessary to make them into stereotypes of Inscrutable Japanese Wise One and Embittered Vietnam Vet Badass for them to be effective characters.The message that karate is for defense, not intimidation, was valuable, but since Daniel spent so much time engaging in behavior that was sure to antagonize his tormentors, it's hard to avoid concluding that he was actually intimidating them, albeit indirectly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think that anyone who sees this film forgets it. I first saw it when I was six and I instantly wanted to watch the sequels that were already out when I saw the original. The final fight scene has become a classic and everyone remembers the crane technique in the final bout. I have watched that about ten times now and everytime it gives me goosebumps! That scene symbolised two things. One was that anybody can overcome the odds if they are willing to fight for it and the second is the mind overcomes the body in all cases. Essentially, karate is a mind over body art and the film shows this as the Cobra Dojo, with its strictly physical regimes, are the losers in the end. It is perhaps the best low budget film of the 80's. Ralph Macchio acts the weakling well and it is a shame he didn't become bigger because of this film. A must see even if the average rating does not signify it as a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] Daniel LaRusso and his mother are moving away from New Jersey and heading to sunny California. Daniel is not looking forward to the move. When they arrive at their new home, Daniel is invited to a beach party. He goes. He meets a girl he likes, Ali, but unfortunately, she had a brutal boyfriend named Johnny who rode around on his mini-bike with his cronies Bobby, Tommy, Jimmy and Dutch. Daniel comes to Ali's aide and makes a new "friend" with Johnny. And from then on, the boys would torment Daniel whenever they saw him. Daniel befriends the custodean of the building he lives in. The man's name is Mr. Miyagi. He hails from Okinawa and is a master at gardening. He tries to help Daniel out so they go to the dojo where Johnny and his friends train. Their instructor is ex-marine John Kreese, who's quite mean and aggressive. Miyagi arranges Daniel go go one on one at the All Valley Karate Tournament. Daniel is worried but Miyagi promises to train him. At Miyagi's homestead, he shows Daniel a new kind of Karate which included washing the cars, sanding the decks, painting the fence and the house. The training paid off and before long it was time for the tournament. Daniel took out Johnny and his friends and won! A pretty good movie! A favorite of mine. It's from the guy who directed Rocky. I've never seen Rocky so you won't find a review of it in my comment library. Like Rocky, the Karate Kid was followed by sequels. I like the part where Mr. Miyagi get's rid of some drunks by Karate chopping the tops off of beer bottles, or the part where Daniel and Ali go on a date in Daniel's mom's faulty station wagon. So I do recommend this picture. If you're looking for a movie of this genre, this one's for you.-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ralph Macchio may have been the Karate Kid, but this film belongs to William Zabka and it's such a shame he's not making bigger movies even though he is still acting. He was brilliant as Johnny and even though he was the bully you couldn't help but like him and I had the biggest crush on him growing up and I was only 7 when I saw this at the movies and watched all his movies until Shootfighter and of course when he was on the Equalizer and he was quiet for a while until High Voltage and Python were released in Australia as not all his movies are released here.He put so much heart and soul into his performance as Johnny and it was a shame that he was typecast as the bully in his other films but then again, he was the best actor in Back to School.Elisabeth Shue gave an honest and real performance as Ali but was relogated to the role of girlfriend in her other films until Leaving Las Vegas when again she showcased her wonderful acting ability and Pat Morita was brilliant as Miyagi. It's a shame that the sequel didn't focus more on the Cobra Kais and Ali as after the opening of the 2nd one the movie fell apart from then on.When Karate Kid 3 was released all I knew then was that Kreese was after revenge and it would have been great if the original Cobra Kais made an appearance other than the arcive footage as the first Karate Kid worked so well when they were on screen that when they weren't the film got a little boring. Of course Ralph's character in the beginning wasn't a expert on karate and of course the underdog has to win the tournament and the girl but I didn't like his character as he lies to his potential new friends and his sometimes treatment of Ali made you want the Cobra Kais to win, but of course in movie land this isn't possible. It's hard to believe this movie is almost 20 years old. It hasn't dated funnily enough and is always showing on cable. Teen movies are sure a lot different today than what they were in the 80s. It seems every decade the new generation of teens latch onto those 80s movies and even though the fashion etc are questionable, some of the best movies were from the 1980s and this is certainly one of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie....but I would have done things differently</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fantastic movie. However, I feel that the bad guys did NOT get enough pain and punishment that they deserved. I loved it when Miyagi foiled all the bullies by the chain-link fence. It would have been better if he had actually crippled or even killed one or a few or even all of them. I smiled at the prospect of one of the bullies being kicked in the crotch hard enough to ensure that he would never have children. Good move! Same guy was kicked in the leg and arm. It would have been great if either or both limbs were broken. I would have killed Johnny, slowly and painfully. I'm sorry, but in the real world, kids are killing kids. That's exactly what the bullies were trying to do to Daniel. They weren't beating him up. They were trying to kill him. I especially would have also liked to see Miyagi dump the sadistic Kreese in the garbage dumpster. The baddies are p***ed off at Daniel for surviving, and it shows. If you ask me, bullies get off far too easy in films. Just once, I would love to see the good guy kill the bad guy instead of just defeat him. Give the bully exactly what is deserved!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nice Little Film From the Director of "Rocky"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Karate Kid" is a "Rocky" for the 1980s crowd. A young New Jersey kid (Ralph Macchio) moves to California and is constantly bullied by a gang of upper-class karate thugs. Enter an elderly janitor (Pat Morita in his Oscar-nominated role) who teaches the boy the art of karate to get him ready for a tournament against his enemies. Look for a young Elisabeth Shue in the role of Macchio's love-interest. Overall a good film which will get the audience cheering. 4 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can still remember the first time I saw The Karate Kid. It was at the movies with my brother and cousins and we loved it so much that we used to re-enact the tournament scenes.Even though Ralph Macchio had the lead role - I didn't think he was all that great. This movie belonged to William Zabka. He played his role with a passion that made him so believable in the role of Johnny. It's a shame he hasn't gone on to bigger roles as he is such a good actor.Even though Elisabeth Shue had a minor role, I thought she was very good, although I didn't believe Ali and Daniel as a couple as there was no chemistry between them - I thought she was better suited to Johnny- any way it is good to see Elisabeth get out of the typecast roles of the girlfriend ( Back to the Future 2 &amp; 3, Cocktail etc etc).Up until two years ago when it was on television, the last time I saw this movie was when I was 12 years old. When watching it after a 8 year gap, the one thing that surprised me was that The Karate Kid has not aged. It is still as good today as it was 15 years ago and it is one movie that should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard Not To Root For The 'Little Guy'[</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people liked this story about a small kid being bullied and then learning how to fight by a kindly old man.Then again, these type of stories of the picked-on kids - or nerds (i.e. "Revenge Of The Nerds"), as they were popularly labeled back in the '80s, were always hit movies. People usually like to root for the underdog and always against bullies. I include myself in that category.Revisting the film recently brought mixed results. It was interesting to see a young Elisabeth Shue. I definitely enjoyed this at the theater in 1984 but now the kid, Ralph Macchio, and his New Jersey accent, is annoying and Pat Morita's Far East religious philosophies also got to be a little too heavy-handed.Overall, however, the film has a lot of charm no matter what decade you see it, and you can usually count on a David vs. Goliath type story to be popular. Overall, it's a fun and satisfying film. I wouldn't recommend the sequels but this first movie is worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may be the basic coming-of-age underdog story, but it couldn't have been done in a more brilliant way.Ralph Macchio is great as Daniel. He perfectly portrays the role of the underdog who is having a hard time at his new home and is constantly getting bullied. He really makes you feel for him.The bullies are utterly despicable and complete jerks who are hell-bent on making Daniel's life miserable. Elizabeth Shue makes for a good love interest.The center of the film, however, is the friendship between Daniel and Mr. Miyagi, who is played by Pat Morita in an Oscar-worthy performance. He is a different kind of mentor from Mickey from "Rocky" and is such an engaging character.Also good is the 80's feel of the whole thing, the setting, and the motivational soundtrack. The training montage and especially the karate tournament at the end will have you cheering.I love this film. It is a true classic in the underdog genre and a great movie by any standard.9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underdog kicks a guy in the face. FANTASTIC!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You're the best around; nothing's ever going to bring you down. Truly words to live by. The Karate Kid is the timeless and shape shifting fable of a disproportionate teenage male overcoming the odds and kicking an utter scum in the face. To do this, he uses sympathy to trick a withering, Japanese puppet into teaching him how to perform manual labour. The most effective strategy of all.The film absorbs the aura of the entire 1980s and spews it unto celluloid. Montages are more commonplace than shoes and people actually meet in person, a practice that was lost with the advent of radio waves. The maturity of this cinematic cheese is what makes the film so enjoyable. While the ending is more predictable than an arithmetic sequence, you purely want this skinny human beat a slightly less skinny human to a human pulp. This comes about because of the numerous scenes they spend showing this gang of karate wielding victimising the protagonist.None of the characters seem quite real. Our "relatable" protagonist, Danny, is magnetic to his fellow characters but honestly just acts like a pretentious cocky scumbag. Showing off his skills at keeping a sports sphere airborne as a sort of mating call. The martial arts mentor, Miyagi, is a cackling, reclusive goblin whose origins are simplistically vague. He's enjoyable to watch because he the wittiest retired, Japanese army general in California. The screenwriter seemed to think it a good idea to make Miyagi more human by giving him a slightly less cheery backstory. Does it mean anything? No! Not mentioned by Danny. Not mentioned by Miyagi but mentioned by me. The scene felt entirely pointless.What I did very much like about the film is the message to both the characters and the viewers that martial arts are not just punching people as many movies (which are admittedly still excellent) may portray. It's important to remember that these forms of self-defence are such. Along with this is strapped another message of balance in life. While vague, the message will forever be pertinent.While the fight scenes are not near as jaw-dropping as other films bound with the martial arts label, the underdog story is truly the backbone of the film. I wanted the blonde scumbag to get kicked in the face so much that I wasn't too concerned with the visual spectacle of the combat. The main characters were often nearing levels of contempt rivalling that of the movie's villains and one scene is entirely unnecessary. Nevertheless, the film is wholly enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beloved 1980s classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE KARATE KID is one of those 1980s childhood classics that I somehow never got around to watching until now. I even watched the Italian rip-off, KARATE WARRIOR, before I watched this, alongside the Jackie Chan remake. I was worried that all this avoidance would lead to a disappointing viewing experience, but I needn't have worried; THE KARATE KD has retained its charm.It's an '80s-era slice of cheese, a family friendly self improvement/tournament movie which comes across as a kiddie version of KICKBOXER or BEST OF THE BEST. At the film's heart is the well-written relationship between Daniel and Mr. Miyagi, and it makes for plenty of warm and amusing sequences. The extended training sequences are the best thing this film has to offer, that and the surprisingly exciting and hard-hitting action-flavoured climax.Ralph Macchio is fine as the lead character, coming across as likable and streetwise. Pat Morita is also likable enough as Mr. Miyagi, but I wonder what this would have been like with original choice Toshiro Mifune in the role? There are bonus roles for Elizabeth Shue (PIRANHA 3D) as the love interest, the delightfully nasty Martin Kove as a karate instructor, and even Steve McQueen's kid Chad playing a vicious thug. THE KARATE KID certainly isn't a great movie - it has its fair share of flaws, and is pretty dated by modern standards - but it's likable, and that's the key.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine coming of age martial arts movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reviewing the remake, I might as well reviewed the original. Like in my review of the remake, the plot is about a boy and his mother were moving in from Newark, New Jersey to Los Angeles, California as our main hero makes friends with a beautiful girl, while gets pushed by a bully as a man in his 50s comes into the boy's life to train him how to fight. That is what the premise of this movie is, because there is nothing different as what the remake did. So, with that said, I thought "The Karate Kid" is a fine coming of age martial arts movie. It is not my favorite John G. Avildsen movie as much as I love his other movie "Rocky," but that is just me. Avildsen does a great on directing the movie as what he does, when he is telling a story and knowing where to point the camera at. I thought the performance between Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita both have a great chemistry with each other, and they are both Daniel LaRusso and Mr. Miyagi. Elisabeth Shue does fine as the love interest, but it doesn't go well when her character becomes a cop out in the second movie which I will talk about that later. Robert Mark Kamen's script is extremely well written, and I thought he written really well on how to develop a great story and characters. Bill Conti's score is just as great as what he did with "Rocky;" although I like his music in "Rocky" more. The fight scenes in the movie is very well choreographed as what the remake did in its own way as the movie is more on Karate as the remake is more on Kung-Fu. Some parts of the movie are slow, which they should have cut a few minutes of scenes to keep the pacing going along. Nevertheless, I was still keeping interest. So, that is how far I can say about this movie. I really enjoy it , and I will give you my thoughts on the second movie. I give "The Karate Kid" a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the darkest, bleakest films I have seen in a long time. All the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods. Macchio is convincing as Daniel, but the real star of the show is despair. Dysfunctional families live in decaying shacks, without money or food. Violent dogs are barking everywhere. Disagreements are settled by fistfights. ( I have seen people drink themselves evil. I have seen young people fall apart because of those around them.) From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shamelessly unrealistic, shamelessly sentimental, shamelessly effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Daniel LaRusso, a teenage boy, moves with his mother (presumably divorced, although this is never made clear) from Newark, New Jersey to Los Angeles. At first Daniel finds it difficult to make friends at his new school, but he eventually finds an attractive girlfriend named Ali. In doing so, however, he makes an enemy of Ali's jealous ex-boyfriend, Johnny, who never loses an opportunity to bully and torment Daniel, often with his friends joining in. To make matters worse, Johnny is a skilled student of karate, so Daniel decides he needs to study the martial arts himself in order to defend himself against Johnny and his gang of bullies. Fortunately, Daniel has befriended Mr. Miyagi, the elderly Japanese-American handyman in his apartment block, who just happens to be an expert karate practitioner. "The Karate Kid" can be interpreted in a number of different ways, largely because it borrows from so many different film genres. On an obvious level it is a martial arts movie. On an equally obvious level it is a high school drama, with stock characters drawn from just about every American high school film you've ever seen; Johnny, in particular, fits the "arrogant jock" stereotype, and his one-time girlfriend Ali is, of course, a cheerleader. On the other hand, it is also an "underdog" sporting drama similar to "Rocky" which was made by the same director John G. Avildsen. Finally, it can also (like a lot of martial arts dramas) be seen as a philosophical, quasi-religious allegory of good against evil. Daniel and Johnny have essentially learned the same fighting skills, but they have done so from teachers with quite different philosophies of life. Johnny's teacher, John Kreese, is significantly not an ethnic Japanese or even an Asian, even though he refers to his school by the Japanese term "dojo" and insists that his students call him "sensei" (Japanese for "teacher"). He is a white American and an Army veteran whose philosophy is based around strength and aggression. He essentially sees karate as a more efficient way of beating people up, and encourages his students to think in the same way. Concepts such as mercy, compassion and the peaceful resolution of disputes are quite alien to him. Miyagi, by contrast, is kindly and humble, believing that one should only use force as a last resort. To him studying the martial arts is not about making oneself a more efficient fighting machine but has more to do with harmony, balance and self-discipline. The final showdown between Daniel and Johnny, therefore, when they meet in the final of a local karate tournament, is as much a clash of two philosophies as a clash of two adversaries. Like many "underdog" films this one is both shamelessly unrealistic and shamelessly sentimental. It is, for example, unrealistic to suppose that Danny would have any hope of defeating Johnny- bigger, stronger and with a lot more previous experience of the sport- in the final of the tournament, but of course he does. (Thereby going one better than Rocky, who lost his big fight, albeit narrowly). Its sentimentality lies in its black-and-white view of morality; it goes out of its way to build Daniel and Miyagi up as the good guys and Kreese and Johnny as the bad guys. Johnny might have the partial excuse that he has been led astray by an older man who should have known better; no such excuse is available to Kreese. This favourable view of a Japanese character was perhaps unusual in the Hollywood of the eighties, a decade in which there was a lot of anti- Japanese feeling in America, mostly rooted in trade rivalry. (This feeling is perhaps reflected in some other films from the period such of "Woman of Valor", one of the few traditional war films of the period, in which the Japanese are very much the villains). Even so, the scriptwriters were careful to give Miyagi a distinguished war record with the US Army in World War II, even though Pat Morita would only have been nine years old at the time of Pearl Harbor. I also found myself wondering whether (1) a first-generation Japanese immigrant in the forties would have been eligible for US citizenship or service in the US armed forces and (2) whether someone whose English-language skills are so poor could ever have been promoted to Sergeant. Quibbles like these, however, were obviously less important than the message the film-makers were trying to get across, namely that Japanese people can be good guys- provided they are also patriotic Americans. There are other plot holes; it is never, for example, explained how Miyagi, who presumably only earns a modest salary as a handyman, acquired his collection of valuable vintage cars. Overall, however, "The Karate Kid" is a reasonably good example of the sentimental feelgood genre, largely because of the standards of acting. Morita earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor (losing to another Asian actor, Haing S Ngor in "The Killing Fields"), and Ralph Macchio makes Daniel an engaging and likable young hero. Martin Kove is also good as the brutal, cynical Kreese, although the character struck me as being too close for comfort to the stereotypical view of the Vietnam veteran which prevailed in the eighties. Despite its theme of two conflicting philosophies of life there is nothing particularly profound about the film, but it makes for entertaining viewing. It may be shamelessly unrealistic and shamelessly sentimental, but it is also shamelessly effective. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ralph Macchio plays teenager Daniel, who is forced to move from his beloved New Jersey to California after his mother gets a new job. This transition is made worse by his failed attempts to fit in, resulting in him being beaten up by young Karate school students, who want Daniel gone. Only the timely intervention of his building janitor/karate expert Mr. Miyagi(Pat Morita) saves his life, and the kindly Miyagi decides to tutor the boy in the arts of karate, just in time for the local tournament, where the same kids who beat him up(led by a ruthless instructor played by Martin Kove) awaits.Clearly inspired by "Rocky"(with the same director, John G. Avildsen), this modest film still works thanks to sincere performances and skillful direction, even though none of this is remotely new or surprising.</fullReview>

The character of Daniel is great and you hate when he gets beat up and you want him to win and that makes you smile when you see Mr. Miyagi the old man beating up 4 teenagers in skeleton costumes. I like how it was done and it has some memorable scenes and good morals.

I really liked the older man who was the boy's "trainer". He reminded me of someone who I look up to in life. His vocabulary was very unique, in that it was simple words, but the most critical.I caught early on to what was going on when the boy was doing chores. And was impressed with the lead up, all the way to the boy, who was ready to fight. But the ending confused me, as it was all so sudden. One minute the boy won, and then got the trophy, then it shows his trainer smiling, then suddenly it ends, just then. It didn't make any sense, as it was all so sudden.However, the rest of the movie was very well done, so I rate it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Powerful "Feel Good" Movie. But With One Major Flaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Karate Kid is one of many feel good movies that packs a powerful entertaining punch. Ralph Macchio plays Danny Larusso, who moves from New Jersey to California when his mother gets a job transfer. He tries to make friends, but can't seem to fit in with the new community. He has eyes for a girlfriend who recently broke up with "Johnny," the main bully character in the film. A jealous Johnny and his friends are also top Karate students at a local gym, run by a sadistic instructor who encourages his students to fight dirty, never back down, as well as to inflict punishment and pain.Daniel took Karate in New Jersey at the local YMCA. But Johnny and his motorcycle friends are tormenting him at every opportunity. A few black eyes and kicks to the body later, Daniel seeks help from their apartment maintenance man, Mr. Miyagi, a wise Karate mentor, who learned from his father that fighting should always be a last resort. He shows Daniel how Karate can be used as an art form, to instill discipline in a positive way. Mr. Miyagi says that Karate should come from the heart, not the fist. He instills gradual self confidence in Daniel by teaching him poise, balance, and coordination exercises through discipline, timing and perseverance. (i.e " Show me, "Wax On Wax Off" Washing a car, "Show me Paint a Fence, Show me, Sand A Floor.") At first, Daniel fails to see how these exercises relate to Karate and while initially resenting them, he begins to form a very touching, emotional bond with Miyagi, who enters Daniel in the big Karate tournament, where the final match is against his nemesis "Johnny." The ending is predictable, but worth waiting for, created by the same director who did "Rocky" and "Lean on Me," John Avildsen, you know the formula works....well almost.Bill Conti's music is great and sunny scenic California never looked better. Daniel's mother Lucille also provides strong support, and Pat Morita's "Miyagi" is deserving of an Oscar. The problem is with lead character, Ralph Macchio.For some reason, listening to his voice and looking at him reminds me of scraping fingernails on a blackboard. It's understandable for him to take on a "wuss" persona early on in the film. But the problem is, the character inside of him doesn't change where you WANT to root for him. Ralph's enthusiasm from within just isn't there. The birthday party scene is supposed to be one of the film's highlights. But Ralph's lines seem forced, "Oh gee, this is great. You did so much already." In the big tournament, when Daniel gets his big win, you don't get the type of emotional high that this movie wants you to have. The reason is because Macchio's persona is somehow more naturally annoying that inspiring.This movie miscast Ralph Macchio as the main character. It needed someone you could really cheer for and care about such as Sean Astin in "Rudy", (who would have been great in this role.) a Morgan Freeman in "Lean on Me", Edward James Olmos from "Stand and Deliver", Sean Penn in "Bad Boys", Tim Robbins in "The Shawshank Redemption" or Sylvester Stallone from "Rocky." Ralph Macchio just lacks that type of charisma that is needed that would have made this movie a "classic." instead of very good. Survivor's "The Moment of Truth" as the credits roll, (shamefully not in some TV prints due to copyright issues) is one of the great inspirational songs of any movie. However, Ralph Macchio takes what could have been an awe inspiring powerful knockout film and brings it down to the level of asking, "If only it wasn't him, imagine what could have been."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ralph Macchio became a teen idol from this film. He portrays a New Jersey teen who moves with his mom played by Randee Heller to Los Angeles, California for the sun, the beaches, and a new life. Anyway, he is the outsider who falls in love with Elisabeth Shue's character who comes from the right side of the tracks. Ironically Shue is also from New Jersey too while Ralph is from Long Island. Anyway, Ralph's character learns karate by a janitor/karate expert Pat Morita in an Oscar nominated role. Believe me, Pat's nomination was well-deserved even if he didn't win the award. Ralph's character learns to fight and defend himself and become a champion. Of course, the best scenes are with Morita and Macchio's characters bonding over learning techniques that are not traditional by any martial arts standards. It's one of those films that you can't help rooting for in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Things aren't always what they appear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Daniel and his family have just moved to America. When he goes to school, he is constantly bullied by a black-belt karate student. Then, "The Old One" a.k.a. Myagi, who says he can train Daniel. However, his lessons are very unusual. For example, Daniel is reduced to painting fences and waxing cars. These lessons are not what they appear to be, but instead, they teach young Daniel how to defend himself.This movie is also not what it appears to be. To quote Roger Ebert: "I took one look at the title and figured it was either (a) a sequel to Toenails of Vengeance, or (b) an adventure pitting Ricky Schroder against the Megaloth Man. I was completely wrong. THE KARATE KID was one of the nice surprises of 1984 -- an exciting, sweet-tempered, heart-warming story with one of the most interesting friendships in a long time."Like Roger Ebert said, "The Karate Kid" is not an average kung-fu movie. No. It's a drama that starts out like another clichd high school movie, but adopts a message and drama. After Daniel finds the meaning behind his training, the movie starts to head into a drama.After Daniel learns the meaning of his lessons, the film gets dramatic. He learns that things aren't what they seem to be, and that karate is for self-defense; not fighting.I remember having to watch this film for "P.A.C.E.," which was a program to help me remember and do better in school and crap like that. They had a lot of weird lessons and only made me watch "The Karate Kid" to teach me that things aren't always what they seem.The main flaws in "Karate kid" are that the bathroom scene was too unrealistic and that there was a lot of swearing that might offend the younger ones. But, it was a good movie with enough heart, along with a moral.It appears as a crappy, clichd kung-fu movie, but ends up looking like a great drama.Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love this ironically</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is undeniably silly. Its plot is a clich; a boy is humiliated at the hands of another stronger boy whom he struggles to best. Although a hackneyed plot, why can I not stop watching this movie when it is aired. It may be that I was kid when I saw this and I watch because of nostalgia; the same reason I contiue to listen to Duran Duran. However, I saw The Goonies at the same time and do not feel any sort of loyalty to that film. I watch because many of the karate moves are fun to imitate. I watch because Elizabeth Shue is cute and ebullient, a perfect representation of adolescent yearning in the 1980's. The dialogue is ironically excellent. I laugh in all the wrong places; "Put him in a body bag Johnny!", "Johnny you're a cream puff!" Who says phrases like "cream puff"; it is outrageous.I love the final song performed by Joe Esposito, an anthemic fight song proclaiming that, "You're the best around, no ones ever gonna take you down!" Completing the distillation of 1980's culture is Daniel Laruso's dress. In one seen he is sporting a pair of aviator sunglasses, a buttoned dress shirt, and a pair of camouflage pants. He looks like the victim of a terrible thrift store explosion. The movie however trite still elicits intended emotions and I continue to find myself internally cheering for Daniel to defeat his adversaries. His tormentor and his cronies are portrayed as loyal, smug minions of a slick, arrogant teacher. He has no redeeming qualities and I felt anger toward his cruelty and ability to distort the sensibilities of his students. The Karate Kid is a film you will ridicule with your friends and love when alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot understand why this film in the UK is a fifteen rating. It's stupid. The sequels are much better and they are both PGs. There is not really anything in the first one to make it such a high rating - maybe it was the year.If you thought this film was good then watch the sequels - contary to popular belief they are much better!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'd be a perfect fit for Cobra kai</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS....I bought the DVD and saw this movie again for the first time in years. I remembered siding with Daniel as a youngster, but upon further review I find myself siding with Cobra Kai for the extermination of this little punk who is supposedly from Newark, as if he wouldn't get his ass kicked there too. That's another thing I didn't get, he moves from Newark, where supposedly he was bad-ass, to a ritzy high school in CA and now he starts getting into fights? I don't think there is a person on the planet, except for people with down syndrome and Foley, who couldn't beat up LaRusso. Anyway, here's why I hate Larusso and think he's a punk who deserved to get his ass kicked every second of that movie.1) first time larusso meets Johnny Lawrence, (brilliantly played by Wiliam Zabka), Larusso is hitting on JL's ex, who by the way isn't his type. Larusso needs some trampy jersey girl cause he's too much of a wuss to hook up with anyone else. Anyway, JL just wants to chat with his old woman and larusso butTs his pathetic ass in and starts looking for trouble, obviously JL beats the crap out of him.2) Larusso is trying out for the soccer team, which in the mold of She's All That is the big sport at the school (note that schools like this are completely queer), anyway Bobby slide tackles Larusso, legally might I add, and Larusso goes crazy tackling Bobby to the ground, he then drills him in the face. Bobby laughs because getting punched by Larusso would be like getting into a pillow fight with a small Pakistani baby. Then the coach kicks Larusso out of tryouts, it's usually not a good idea to start a fight during them, especially when you're a wuss.3) Lawrence and the crew are finished with larusso, as far as they're concerned he doesn't exist. However, Larusso is still looking for trouble. At the halloween party at the school JL is minding his own business smoking a J in one of the stalls and Larusso decides it would be a great idea to douse him with a hose. Obviously the Cobra Kai crew chase him for a while and beat the crap out of him, which he easily deserved. JL even had the line "you couldn't leave well enough alone could you Larusso...", JL was ready to ignore Larusso but he had to keep pushing them. Who does that? Who starts fights with 6 guys who could all kick your ass? That would be like me walking into the NY Giants locker room and kicking Shockey in the balls, just a stupid idea regardless of the security breach.Thus, Larusso is a wuss who deserved everything he had before he started training with Miagi. Although my ending of this movie would have had the fat guy from Cobra Kai winning the All Valley under 18 tourney, he was a real darkhorse. Also notice how everyone at Cobra Kai was a black belt except for the fat kid and the black kid (lamar from Nerds), makes you think if Sensai was some sort of Nazi, I posit he was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This comment has a possible spoiler at the end.We have a new kid in town, and he is having a rough time in his new environment. A single mother raising her son. There's a bully and the need to fight him and win. There's a poor kid, Danielson, dating a rich gal. A nice man, Mr. Miagi, who lends a helping hand and takes an interest in a kid like the father he doesn't have; who gets his student to concentrate and focus. We see the importance of hard work and dedication, resilience, and continuing to try until a technique is mastered. There's the matter of doing things for the right reasons as opposed to the wrong ones. Setting high yet attainable goals. Facing fears. Fighting through the pain. Selfishness vs. selflessness. Good vs. evil. How thinking as a group can lead to ugly behavior.This movie has some great music. The actors and actresses are convincing. Mr. Miagi is very funny and kind. I'm sure we all know someone like him or wish we did. Danielson plays the part of a high school kid learning karate pretty well, although it's always interesting to read about how old the actor really was when he did the movie. Much older than you'd think. This was believable because Danielson's karate moves were never all that spectacular. Spoiler: He didn't turn into an expert overnight, but he was quite a contender in the tournament at the end. This was a great movie. The final scene was similar to that of a series of boxing movies that were also popular at around this time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just because this film came from the 1980's it seems people are willing to forgive the predictable formula and unrealistic plot elements. Not me! Hollywood has been using the same "underdog" formula since film was invented.Not to mention the "good guy" always winning regardless of the sport etc he (truthfully they mostly are "he") learns in a few months while experts fall in his wake.Kids watch films like this and think they can learn karate/baseball/gridiron/ballet/tennis/quidditch (yeah even that) in a few months/ weeks and beat people who have played for years just because you are the sympathetic underdog who is taught by a master. I bet many parents have got new clean cars and painted fences etc while their kids have thought that's all you needed to do to learn karate (I wouldn't turn down a clean car).Kids think they can poke bullies with a stick and then whine when the bully punches them because the underdog did it and ran away until the bully caught him and punched him - and then the adult male beat up the bully- reality says the adult male would be in jail.Old Myagi says something about a man who can catch flies with chopsticks being able to accomplish anything ? yet there he is a janitor. I guess Bill Gates caught a few flies with chopsticks in his time. The constant reminders that Asian people love bonsai, use chopsticks, drink sake, live in Japanese looking houses even in America and are experts at karate also show the age of this stereotyping movie.This film is made for kids and sadly teaches kids bad lessons (which they will learn in less than a few months and beat experts at of course).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Daniel is new in town, and is getting picked on by the local bullies, who all are adept in karate. Determined to stick up for himself, Daniel begins to teach himself karate, only to discover that the caretaker at his apartment seems to be a master of karate. Agreeing to teach Daniel, Mr. Miyagi shows Daniel that there is more to karate than violence. The best way to solve the problem he has with the bullies is in the All Valley Karate Championship.While its probably one of the defining films of the eighties, the film has many flaws. It's basically Rocky for kids, and the film is way, way too long.The film focuses too much on the romance side, and while that is good, a maguffin for Daniels rationale to learn Karate, along with the bullying, the film could have been trimmed by twenty minutes, taking out all the creepy parts where Daniel is being aggressive toward Shue.Other than that, it's a fine movie, the bad guys wear black so you know where you are, and Kreese literally sneers and shouts his entire script, which makes the film fun whenever he's on screen.Macchio is fine as Daniel San, but Morita blows him off screen whenever the two are together, which is 90 percent of the time Morita appears in this. Miyagi is a career defining performance, funny, and utterly harrowing when he has his drunk moment. A powerful moment in such a high concept blockbuster.There are lots of standout scenes, and although the final act is exciting, nothing come close to the moment when Daniel learns why Miyagi has made him do all those chores, its jaw dropping stuff.So all in all, its a fine movie, just way too long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Karate Kid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew bits and pieces of this film, including the ending, so I was definitely going to give this film a go, from director John G. Avildsen (Rocky). Basically Daniel Larusso (Ralph Macchio) and his mother Lucille (Randee Heller) have moved from New Jersey to California because of the mother's new job. At his new school, Daniel gets himself into fights with bullies, mainly because he tries to date Ali Mills (Elisabeth Shue), and he has no fighting experience. The person who may be able to help him defend himself better, or just help him with his little love of karate, is local handyman Mr. Kesuke Miyagi (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Noriyuki 'Pat' Morita), who used to be a karate trainer. For a while, he just makes him do cleaning and painting, e.g. "Wax on, wax off" for the car, Daniel then puts these hand and arm movements into use when Miyagi tries to fight. The bullies still bother Daniel though, and a situation arises where Miyagi and other the karate trainer agree to have Daniel and the main bully fight in a karate tournament. Daniel of course does very well, and even with the leg injury towards the end, you knew he had to win, and you had to see Miyagi nodding with a smile. Also starring Martin Kove as John Kreese, William Zabka as Johnny Lawrence, Ron Thomas as Bobby Brown, Rob Garrison as Tommy, Chad McQueen as Dutch, Tony O'Dell as Jimmy, Israel Juarbe as Freddy Fernandez and William Bassett as Mr. Mills. Morita is perfect as the wise tutor, and the fight scenes (whether training or real combat) are fun to watch. It was number 98 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, and it was number 58 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Karate Kid isn't the best movie ever made, but it is nostalgic, and is appealing, fun and charming. Even with some of the weak spots of the script, and the admittedly formulaic plot, I really like this movie. It is well filmed, has a nice soundtrack, has a good message, some terrific karate sequences and some decent direction. Plus it goes along at a brisk pace. I for one also liked the acting, Ralph Macchio is appealing in the lead, while Pat Morita(always the highly watchable actor, and the actor who elevated the sequels to a more watchable standard) is excellent and it was nice to see the charming Elizabeth Shue. Overall, I like The Karate Kid, even with the flaws, it is nostalgic and enjoyable. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite bearing the "karate" title to the film, I wouldn't think its what most die hard fans of martial art culture would be expecting from once they get drawn into it or even buy a film on DVD without awareness on how much they have paid for it and not having actually rented it and watched it in the movie cinema or on TV. To me, some "good" films may actually be a load of rubbish as people have different opinions with what they see. In the whole the film is too much of a challenge being mostly "romantic" without featuring much karate to see on and having watched it once or twice made me feel a bit desperate in wanting it to end quickly that I don't see the point in viewing further Karate Kid films. The casting of Ralph Machoo as a "kid" regardless of how young he seems to look was ridiculous as he was actually 23 years old at the time this was premiered yet he was to continue making further Karate Kid films until he was approaching his thirties. Just don't bother</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Karate Kid (1984) was not only the start of a trilogy (plus one) but it also beget the short lived karate/self defense craze of the mid 80's. Not only did this spawn several sequels but it also was responsible for a dreadful NES video game.Young (and I use that term loosely) Danny is tormented by a gang of karate punks after he messes with the head goon's former girl. Tired of being throttled everyday, Danny tries to learn some "karate" and gets into all sorts of trouble. That is until he meets his apartment building's handyman/super. What happens next is the stuff that legends are made of.I enjoyed this movie very much when I was a lad. It was Rocky for the 80's generation (I guess). The Karate Kid spawned many imitators and parodies (I recommend Love on Delivery a Stephen Chow vehicle). It's a great feel good movie. Recommended (for nostalgic value)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another one of those movies that I, and a lot of other people, watched as a kid and really liked. When it came out on Blu-ray it was a kind of must-have-in-my-collection movie. When we watched it yesterday I found that it was a lot sillier than I remembered. It is definitely a movie for the younger audience. Most of the karate scenes are downright ludicrous. Especially the ones with Mr. Miyagi in them.It is still a quite okay movie though. The kids certainly liked it. The basic story is a classical one of friendship, a bit of love and the bullied underdog kid getting back at his bullies and it plays out without any real surprises. It is the kind of story that most people feel sympathetic towards which is perhaps why most people like the movie. After all, if you say "wax on, wax off" almost everyone knows what you are talking about.The Karate Kid is plain, simple and good Hollywood entertainment that has turned into something of a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie would be the first of four movies and is by far the top one of the bunch. This movie would have a couple of groan moments, but not as bad as two and three, never saw four all the way through, but from what I have seen the entire movie is a groan. This movie has a new kid moving into a new place and seemingly making new friends right away. He gets invited to a beach party and there is a cute girl taking a shine to him. Wow, it can not get better than this? Well the girl has a jerk ex-boyfriend that crashes said party and proceeds to use his karate to beat up the new kid. Granted the girl feels for him, but the guys at the party seem to look down on him. Well this sets some stuff in motion where he becomes friends with the complex he and his mom are living in maintenance man who helps make him a disguise where he is able to go to a dance and be with the girl and instead of living well enough alone he proceeds to do something to the guy who beat him, that makes said guy want to beat him up again. Well the maintenance guy turns out to be a rather good karate teacher and thus the teacher pupil relationship is born and the kid even is able to build a relationship with the cute girl. Good movie for the most part as it has some drama, action and comedy to keep a person entertained. Much more so than any of the sequels, I prefer to think of this movie as stand alone. The tournament at the end is okay, but a bit much in places.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst hero of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You're an awkward teenager moving to a new city with your single mother. Upon arrival you feel disheartened about leaving your friends behind but meet a chap the same age as you. He kindly invites you to a party on a beach that night. Being a new guy in town, it may be sensible to asses the lay-of-the-land. Who's who, and what is okay amongst your new peers. But no, you decide you to show your soccer skills and get your swerve on with the best looking girl there, because she's not likely to be seeing anyone, is she? When said girls double-hard boyfriend makes an appearance you attempt your home, self-taught karate on him. Alas, he's been trained by an evil Vietnam vet how to do evil karate and kicks you up and down the beach. All is not lost as you still have high school to fall back on. Sadly, on your first day you realise every one you alienated attends your new high school. But don't forget you're a whizz at soccer. Surely the school team will be the mark of the turn around for your fortunes. As you show your skills in the try-outs, by not passing to anyone at any point, you are tackled. A tough tackle but probably fair, in any case you've earned a free kick. A good opportunity to dust yourself down and show your competitive spirit. Or you can storm off shouting at all around you how their school "stinks" and "sucks". Despite all of this, there are two rays of light at the end of the tunnel. Beautiful beach girl has warmed to your "charms". Also, a kindly old janitor is willing to give you the time of day. So, you maintain a somewhat upbeat demeanour, except for when your shouting at your mother about how everything "stinks" and "sucks". It's the school fancy dress party. The options are limitless, Elvis, a vampire, werewolf, Liberace, Richard Nixon you can be anyone you want to be. Curiously you want to be a shower. The costume is cumbersome to say the least but people don't know it's you and that works in your favour. Beach girl thinks your ccccrazy. Things are looking up. In the gents you notice double-hard evil karate bloke smoking evil drugs in a cubicle. Fair to say a quiet retreat is percentage play here. Once again you defy logic and drench him with water. A chase ensues, but luckily you're in your streamlined shower outfit. Double-hard evil karate bloke and his chums are all dressed as skeletons. Somehow they catch-up with you at a fence. The mother of all beatings begins. They're chanting something "mercy being for the weak", oh dear. Things are looking bleak until a shadowy figure fends them off. Coming around from the battering you taken you are greeted by the janitor. To your shock it was he who saved you. Well, fortune is finally shining on you. Pushing your luck you ask him to come to the dojo of evil karate. Having fought in a war, struggled to make a life in a foreign land, barely learnt the language, and lost the love of his life, the old man, who just wants to tend to his bonsai trees, regretfully declines the request. Weighing up all that has happened, he's taught you how to prune bonsais, given you one of them, fixed your bike, saved your life and nursed you back to health and put up with your incessant whining, you could thank him and be on your way. Or Jump up shouting "thanks for nothing man, thanks for nothing". Against his better judgement the old guy goes with you to the Dojo. There the evil sensei mocks you and the old fella. Irritatingly, the old guy fails to get these guys off your back. Instead he enters you in a karate tournament. You suspect this is payback for being such a whining turd. The old guy has just guaranteed you'll have your ass handed to you except now it'll be in front of hundreds of people. You plead to him to teach you good karate. To which he agrees. However, he seems have misunderstood your plea for training. Instead he seems to have heard "Can I please redecorate your house and gardens?". You're not falling for it and after a week of humiliation you down tools. As you go to storm off, the words "stinks" and "sucks" forming on your lips as you do so, the crazy old geezer comes at you. You fend him off with rudimentary blocks. From somewhere you have developed the ability not to get hit.As time goes by, you see less and less of the annoying woman who brought you into the world. Instead you spend all your time with the old man, who has no family or friends. This seems normal to you as you to struggle to make relationships. However, fit beach girl is still interested. Her friends try to sway her away from you but she's not having it. It's your birthday and the old guy gives you one of his 38 cars. Perfect. Now you can pick fit beach girl up and take her to the fair. All goes well. You even let her drive. When she questions this you deliver the flawless logic "Hey it's the 80's". Your training is moving on too. You balance on a pole on the beach and now you're ready.The tournament plays out with predictability. Except for that eastern looking guy who clearly knew more martial arts than anyone else. I have a nostalgic fondness for this film but Larusso is such a terrible human being, he sucks all that's good from those around him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't suspend my disbelief - well it's better than that crappy remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, this movie might be marginally decent as far as movies go - one thing I can't suspend my disbelief for is that in a small town a karate teacher teaches the students "no mercy" there are 2 reasons why I think that is unbelievable 1. what parent would send their child to a class that's like that and 2. what kind of karate dojo would have this guy teach classes, one part of karate is the discipline and that does not happen. Okay I'm done with that part.Then you have the kid, he learns karate to it's fullest extent in just 2 months, what?!?!?! your telling me that years of work can just be done in 2 months? I think not, it takes you at least one month to go from the first belt to the second (and that is at the lowest standard). then there's the bully who is supposed to believe that Daniel goes from not knowing a thing about defending himself to Daniel talking about how he knows more karate than he really does... I'm not even going to point out why I can't suspend my disbelief, maybe the bully is an idiot.Another thing I find fascinating is that for the first 20-30 minutes or so Daniel keeps getting his ass kicked by Johnny and he doesn't say anything to anyone - not even his mother. I would think there would be something, I can't think of an excuse not to tell someone, If the mother's nervous it's better than having the $#!+ kicked out of you.I am aware that it's just a movie, it might actually be rated fairer if I didn't know what I about this (I do, there is no mistaken that except that last point that is just a point of logic - go to a karate class and see how long it takes to get you to a black belt, see how many teach you "No mercy" - thought so) I hope my review raises a few points - I am not asking for you to say "this movie is bad" because I know with some people that won't be possible because it's all opinion and how far somebody can stretch their suspension of disbelief (for people who know this) so I do respect opinions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the 2010 version of this film first, so I'm a bit biased towards that one. I did like this film, but there were too many things that I didn't find particularly interesting.First of all, I felt like Daniel and Ali didn't really make the "perfect couple". They just didn't seem right for each other. There wasn't enough chemistry between them. And I'm sorry, but the kiss that they shared.. I just found that awkward.And also, I found that the fights between Daniel and his bullies got a bit tiresome. I actually considered skipping them altogether. All the bullying scenes were practically the same. The bullies chased Daniel, until they got to beat him up good. I don't see the point in repeating those scenes thrice or more times.I did like Miyagi's original ideas on teaching Daniel karate with the help of simple tasks, though. Watching the 2010 film, I thought it was really a clever idea. Sure, it did seem like Miyagi was just using Daniel at first, but boy, were we (and Daniel) proved wrong.Even though I wasn't that engrossed with the film, I can say that the tournament at the end really caught my attention. That's when we saw Daniel's potential, talent and progress. I was cringing during the final moments. I felt sorry for Daniel. But it all seemed too fast. Maybe that's why I liked the 2010 version better. There was more suspense and really left the audience on the edge of their seats.The main message of this movie, which is to learn how to stand up for yourself and to never give up, is really good and inspiring. I can see why lots of people, especially those who grew up in the 80s, really like this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finally saw the famous "Karate Kid" movie and while I felt it was a little cheesy and predictable, it was still a good movie that gave you such a good feeling at the end like Rocky did. It is very dated and you know what will happen in the next scene, but I think this was a one of a kind at the time it was released.Basically, Daniel is a teen in a new town with his mom in a crummy apartment. He unfortunately is not very well excepted at first by his classmates, except for one pretty young girl. Perhaps you know her? Some girl named Elizabeth Shue? Never heard of her. :D LOL! But anyways, he also befriends the old Asian Gardener who is his land lord. When he has a bad night after another confrontation, his old friend defends him and together he decides to teach Daniel how to learn Karate and defend himself.With some cheesy moments and over the top of predictions, this is a decent flick to catch with our favorite optimistic endings that make us smile and may inspire us. This is just a cute and fun movie with some pretty catchy lines, I think anyone could enjoy this film. For the family or just your own pleasure, have fun and try not to kick anything. :)7/10</fullReview>

I must admit I always preferred the Kickboxer styled movies over these ones mainly due to Macchio, Macchio is fairly unlikeable in the beginning of the film. He often times deserves his fate and although i'm not sure that was the point, the whole training montage and all that is clichd but provides the film with it's best moments it is really the fairly dull subplots involving the bullying and Elizabeth Shue which stop the movie's momentum. It is a tired formula, one that goes on too long but I always enjoy the underdog styled story and really this predictable flick is worth watching only because of the unforgettable training montage and in the latter part of the film when the movie explores the relationship between Daniel and Myiagi (After Daniel becomes more likable) The sequels are mixed as for my money # 3 is the best of the series but this is always the movie that everyone loved that I found only decent. Also the climax when it finally comes around, it manages to get the blood running somewhat but you have to sit through too many scenes of Macchio talking to himself and basically getting beatings before finally delivering what we expect.* *1/2 out of 4-(Pretty good)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Karate Kid" (3 hairs) was a very popular Chinese comic strip first published in 1935-37, continued from 1948 into the 1990s, about a young orphan boy struggling with life in Shanghai.This movie adaptation sees a lively boy actor in the central role. His head is quite changed to match the comic book appearance, with big head, thick nose, and the three strands of hair that give him his name. At first, this looks bewildering, but one soon gets used to it, and follows his mixed adventures in dire poverty, in the pickpocket school, on "Children's Day", especially his "adoption" by a rich family with a big party that is very well put to scene (and with thrilling music in the chase scenes). Unforgettable images.The final scene (Communists parade in the street) seems a little tacked on), but the real comic had the same situations, which to us appear much less exciting than the "pre-Liberation" ones. But poor children in the 1930s might have thought differently...For those interested in Chinese history and popular culture, this movie is highly recommended. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best of Its Type</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Karate Kid, The (1984) **** (out of 4) Terrific drama about a teen (Ralph Macchio) who moves cross country with his mother but soon finds himself under attack from a group of teens. After he's brutally beaten, Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) makes an agreement to enter him in a tournament if the kids allow him time to train. If you read many reviews of THE KARATE KID, even the positive ones, you're probably going to see the word manipulative several times. There's no denying that this film is predictable and there's no denying the fact that every scene tries to manipulate the viewer into a certain emotion but who cares? THE KARATE KID is without question one of the best films of the decade and it's also one of the best of its type from any era. There are so many reasons why this film should have fallen flat on its face but a lot of credit has to go to director John G. Avildsen because he makes sure that things never get corny and he is so terrific at building up the characters and the drama that you can't help but get caught up in everything you're fed. I think most people will be able to connect with the Daniel character and Macchio does a terrific job at bringing him to life. Morita gets the role of his career and simply kills it and ends up becoming one of the most memorable good guys in the history of cinema. The two actors have such a warn chemistry that one can't help but feel their relationship grow and even more important is that it comes off real. The film has one of the greatest underdogs, one of the greatest good guys so we have to have a great villain and we get that in William Zabka and Martin Kove who play the main bully and his master. The two are such creeps that you can't help but hate them and want to see Daniel win against them. Elisabeth Shue also turns in a very strong performance as the love interest. It's really remarkable to see how terrific the cast is as all the leads and everyone down to the extras fit their roles perfectly. I'm sure many will see connections to ROCKY, which was also directed by Avildsen but I think this movie is even better. The drama is so real and the emotions that the characters go through are so dark and true to life that you really can't help but feel for them and what they're going through. The film is quite dark in spots but it's also got a terrific heart and message that really make it so memorable. There have been many imitators since (and a remake) but there's no question that THE KARATE KID is something special and something that really can't be touched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good for kids, lethargic for adults.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good film for kids and a pleasant diversion for the whole family. But it's just SO utterly predictable! It suffers from lethargic pacing, which makes the predictability even more apparent. If a "classic" is a film you can watch over and over, then this is no classic: if you're an adult and you've seen it at least twice, try it one more time: it may put you to sleep!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just horrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie sucks, and it sucks big time. I don't care if it is supposed to be a cult movie. Nor do I care if many people love it. It is just stupid and overrated. And this, my friends, is not my opinion. It is just pure and simple FACT. That is right. That is what I wrote. Whoever liked this movie is just wrong. I don't know what would you like in it. The karate is pathetic. The story is ridiculous. The moral is absurd.Now I am going to write a few SPOILERS here, so feel free to skip my review if you haven't seen the movie.First, you see the newcomer in town - the new kid in the school - getting beaten on a regular basis by the Evil Bully - the black belt owner. The reason? Daniel LaRusso interfered in an argument between The Bully and his ex girlfriend. Why? Because he was stupid. What kind of an idiot would interfere into an argument between a girl he has met just a few minutes ago and a totally unknown boy? What kind of an idiot would start a fight with another idiot who is obviously able to crush him like a bug? I mean, Daniel was as skinny as a toothpick and had no fighting experience at all. The Evil Bully was a leader of a bikers' gang - and you can't be a leader of a bikers' gang if you can't fight. If Daniel was not as as dumb as something very, very dumb he would have figured that out. He should have had also figured out that by interfering in their argument he can only make things worse for both of them. How would you feel if you were arguing with your ex and some total stranger interfered? Daniel should have shown some respect to Ali and let her solve her problems with the boy without getting in her way.Second, after the beach incident he became the school wimp. Now tell me, do you really think that the most popular cheer leader in the school would show any sympathy to the school wimp? Would she like him? Even if she liked him would she show it? You know the answer. The answer is: "NO!" No 16 year old girl would risk her reputation because of the school wimp. Not a single one, especially if the school wimp is a total stranger to everybody in the town.Third, Daniel pretended to know karate from the beginning of the movie. You saw him opening a door with a pathetic excuse of a "karate" kick. I liked to do that too... When I was 5. When I was 16 I already knew that if I say that I can fight and I can't I would get beaten by some bully. I knew that if I pretended to know something that I don't know the result would be devastating to me. Keep in mind that Daniel was not a normal teenager. His mother was single. He was the man in the house so he should have been more experienced than I was at that age. But he was not. He was stupid.Now let's talk about martial arts.First, you do remember the sensei of the Evil Bully, do you? The guy who liked to say "The Enemy Deserves No Mercy!!! ARGH!!!" Let me tell you one thing. No sensei would keep their dojo if they teach their students like that. Fact. Especially if they teach in a small town where everybody knows everybody. Do you think any parent would let their kids study with a man who turns them into criminals? If you do, then you are just wrong, sorry.Second, there was Miyagi... Who was as much of a karate instructor as the school janitor was. He didn't teach Daniel how to fight. He told him how to wash cars. He trained him to paint fences. He showed him how to dance before the sunset. Do you think that is the way to learn karate? If it was that easy the painters would be the best fighters in the world... However Daniel became an equal fighter to the black belt owners just in two months. That would make any martial artist in the world very angry. You know, it is IMPOSSIBLE for anybody to earn a black belt in just two months. Even if you practice 25 hours a day you just can't do it. Even if you are a God of Karate you can't do it. Yet Daniel did it in just two months washing cars? Do you know how many kids start visiting martial arts classes because of movies like this? Because of movies showing martial arts as something you can master in a few months. After the kids see that it is actually very hard to earn a black belt and in two months they have learned absolutely nothing they quit the dojo disappointed and with low spirits. Which is actually quite dangerous and that is another reason for me to hate the movie.What is the moral of the movie? Here it is:You don't need to think. You don't have to be smart. You may be a stupid wimp and a poser and people will like you because you are The Protagonist in the movie. You don't have to put any effort if you want to learn something. You don't even have to practice the thing that you want to learn. But you will succeed just because you are The Protagonist of the movie. You will become equal to people who have worked hard for many years because they are Bad and you are Good.END OF THE SPOILERS.The movie probably works as pure entertainment. But you can find better entertainment with another movie ? movie with a better story and a better moral.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>falls short -- a lot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>there were many good things about this movie and it started many many clichs (which is completely different from USING clichs -- one's good one's bad). anyways, this movie overall was cheesy it was also predictable all the way through. when he has troubles with his girlfriend, it is so obvious that he will get her back that very night. his karate moves are unrealistic (trust me, i've got a black belt before), and the fight at the end was anti-climatic. i mean, the movie ends out of nowhere after you know 100% beforehand he will win the tournament.overall, this movie is kind of childish (which it is supposed to be) but that doesn't mean it should have sucked as bad as it did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't like this movie (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I know I am probably in the minority here, but I really did not like this movie at all. First off, you can only beat the same kid up so many times before it gets really old. Also, it is completely unbelievable. There is no way that Miyagi could possibly teach Daniel enough karate in just two months for Daniel to even make it past his first match. The time frame given is two months. He is competing against guys that have been taking karate for years. You're going to tell me that in two months he can learn enough to beat someone who has been taking karate for two years? I don't think so. Also, there is no way that a rich, beautiful, popular cheerleader like Ali would give Daniel the time of day. After the beach incident, Daniel is considered the school wimp by the entire senior class. Ali would be too afraid of ruining her reputation to even give Daniel another glance after the beach fight where Johnny takes him down. Lastly, this movie gives the wrong message. The Cobra Kai's aren't automatically going to accept Daniel just because he beat them in a tournament. It would be more like "Hey, you cost me my title, just wait till after school tomorrow wimp!!!!!!" The second movie had a better message. Love is always worth fighting for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Worst movies ever: 1.Alexander (with Colin Ferrel) 2.The Postman (with Kevin Costner) 3.Robocop 3 (with... crappy actors) 4.THE KARATE KID (with a pre-pubescent skinny dip stick from Florida and a retarded, hopeless Japanese grandpa) 5.all Childs Play movies and Seed of Chucky 6.etc....that should say it all. A completely terrible film, that will make the weak-minded individuals that love movies endlessly (Germans) kill themselves. I use the DVD case of this movie that i found in a bush as toilet paper, floss, a paper weight, a napkin and a Frisbee. If you like this movie, let me know where you live so that i can kill you.</fullReview>
