		<fullReview>Those who gave this gem a low score - Please! Crawl back in your cardboard life and stay there! This film bubbles with zest, wit, subtle humor, raw humor, strange scenes, great songs and a huge host of memorable characters. Most of the characters are drawn as sharply as if a straight razor...well, not straight...as if a razor had been used. Not intended for the super straight part of our culture, which is why it usually plays at midnight shows, but you'll notice that it's been playing steadily for 30 years now, especially along the American coasts, which is a better record that almost anything else you can think of (excluding Gome With The Wind in Atlanta, a single town). I even took my mother to one of the 15 or so theater viewings I've attended. She thought the dressed up audience was a little strange, but she found out why they were so enthusiastic and quite liked the show. It's just a time slip....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better To Watch At Home!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A squeaky-clean young couple, Brad &amp; Janet (Barry Bostwick &amp; Susan Sarandon), get a flat tire on a late rainy night, and decide to stop off at a nearby castle to use the residents' phone and call for help. What they don't realise is that these are no ordinary residents: Dr. Frank N Furter (Tim Curry), with assistance from his servants Riff Raff (Richard O'Brien), Magenta (Patricia Quinn), and their ragtag bunch of fellow Transylvanians, has his own diabolical plans for the evening, set against a kick-butt rock 'n' roll music score....Call me a twisted "Rocky Horror" fan, but I actually prefer to watch this cult classic movie-musical in the comfort of my own home, rather than going out to one of those midnight theatrical screenings that have made this 1975 film so popular. Oh, I'm sure there's great fun to be had at a midnight showing, but the fact is, you're not going to see or hear very much of the movie itself, what with the audience shouting &amp; throwing stuff at the screen literally every two seconds (think of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" on speed), as well as the live cast performing in front of the movie screen! If you want to really *see and hear* "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" as you would any other film, watch it on video first. Then, when you've got the movie firmly etched in your head, head out to the theater. But NOT before!Having said that, this movie version of the hit stage musical written by Richard O'Brien (Riff Raff himself), is a ton of great, naughty fun. It wonderfully sends up B-movie sci-fi/horror flicks, with a playful, healthy dose of blatant sexual innuendo thrown in for good measure. Classic, memorable rock 'n' roll tunes written by O'Brien throughout, including "The Time Warp," "Sweet Transvestite," "Hot Patootie"....the list goes on and on. And, of course, you have a spectacular cast, led by Tim Curry, who IS the larger-than-life Dr. Frank N Furter, and a young, attractive Susan Sarandon, who simply lights up the screen as Janet. But everyone else, including Barry Bostwick, Meatloaf, Little Nell, Patricia Quinn, and Charles Gray all make excellent contributons, too.I love "The Rocky Horror Picture Show": it's very funny, sexy, and brilliantly performed, with great rock 'n' roll music t'boot. But I, personally, still prefer to watch it at home, where I can see the film in peace &amp; quiet without being yelled in my ear, getting soaked, or having rice &amp; toast tossed all around me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mother of All Cult Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Or I should say, the Sweet Transvestite of all cult films!To those who haven't seen Rocky Horror, don't bother reading reviews about it. It won't mean anything. Don't rent it on DVD which it recently came out on. It also won't mean anything, because it's missing the thing that gave it and the stage play that preceded it life... the audience. By definition, a cult film is meant to be seen by a group. Preferably, a large one. I saw Rocky Horror 20-something years ago, and wound up playing "Brad" with the players next to the stage. Something I would normally never do. Why? The show's energy sucked me in. More accurately, the audience's energy sucked me in. The show, with a revved-up audience, is almost like a dialogue between the movie and the people watching it. It celebrates sex, hedonism, even while playing out the danger, violence, and tragedy it can result in. It allows the audience of mostly young kids to exude and rejoice in their sexuality, whatever it is. And without ever taking their clothes off. I think that is the real appeal of the show. There's a joyousness, and a strange innocence, in throwing raunchy comments at the screen, watching the live performers on-stage act out the scenes in racy costumes, and sharing the energy anonymously in the dark with strangers. The live show with the original actors must have been electrifying. Plays always have more energy than films because of the immediacy of the live actors, and the energy must have been even more intense. I'll always regret not having the chance to have seen it. The movie itself has been described too many times for me to give a synopsis. I will however say that it is really a collage of feelings, ranging from fear, trepidation, excitement, lust, joyous sexual fulfillment, more lust, tragedy, and a strange sadness at the end. Basically, all the emotions that make life worth living, in an hour and a half. However, the visceral enjoyment of this film, and the emotions it brings, will only be experienced with a large, highly energized audience. If you get a chance, and if you can get your reserved ego out of the way, go to a midnight showing in your area when you know there's going to be a big showing. Don't go expecting a logical, coherent storyline. Its about experience, not narrative. You'll get an experience that you've been missing your whole life. At the end, there is a message here, hidden under all the seemingly blissful hedonism. It takes a long time for it to become clear, however.I wonder if O'Brian, its creator, was clever enough to have put it there all along? By the way, there is no nudity or actual sex in the entire movie. For a movie with its reputation, that's pretty amazing. Compared to the slasher/gore fests passing themselves off as film these days, the movie is strangely quaint and innocent. But then, that's what true enjoyment of sensuality should be. For a cult film, 10 out of 10 stars. It doesn't get any better than this as cult films go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moving on from the riotous cult stage show which was born in a small studio theatre in the early 70s, this movie version is a well-cast, outrageous romp showcasing the absurdity and sci-fi obsession of Richard O'Brien's inventive musical.The small cast - the wonderful Tim Curry as Frank 'n Furter (the sweet transvestite from transsexual Transylvania'); Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon as the odd science students Brad and Janet; Patricia Quinn as Magenta ('a domestic'); Little Nell as Columbia ('a groupie'), Jonathan Adams as Dr Scott; Meat Loaf as Eddie; Richard O'Brien himself as the handyman Riff Raff; Peter Hinwood as the muscle man Rocky, created by Frank in a spoof on Frankenstein; and Charles Gray having a great time as the Criminologist - are all really good, and the songs are terrific, from the madness of 'The Timewarp' and 'Sweet Transvestite', to the ethereal 'There's a Light' and 'I'm Going Home', by way of the rocky 'Whatever Happened To Saturday Night?' and the film-reference heavy 'Science Fiction Double Feature'.Great, great fun and the floor show sequence in particular, showcasing Frank's obsession with Fay Wray and the RKO cheapies, is exceptional, with its statues in basques and its huge swimming pool. Trash, yes, but classy trash, and most enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Science Fiction Double Feature!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We-e-e-elcome to the Late Night Double Feature Picture Show! This Cult-Classic mixes elements of "Bride of Frankenstein" with "Forbidden Planet", "The Day The Earth Stood Still" and other classic Horror Flicks. This is a brilliantly conceived original, unsurpassed by any similar effort.The heroes, a newly engaged young couple, are stranded with car trouble on a rainy night, looking to use the phone at the "Frankenfurter Mansion". They are in for a turbulent ride! There are some great song &amp; dance numbers here, most noteworthy the "Time Warp" and the numbers involving "Eddie" (played by a then unknown Meatloaf). Tim Curry is delicious as the bisexual satyr-like Frankenfurter, who sees his young visitors as fair game for seduction.The action is fast paced with one thrill after another. It's quite understandable that some fans have watched this film every Saturday at Midnight for the past 30 years. Get a bag of rice, toast, a squirt-gun, surgical gloves, etc, and have yourself a Rocky Horror Picture Show Party!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rocky Horror Picture Show isn't a film for everyone. You need a sense of humor to enjoy, I would say, and must have an open mind.Back in the 70s I used to see this film almost every weekend with my buddies. It was a blast! The audience participation is so energetic! Dressing up was also something I loved doing (I'd dress as Magenta!) The film is hilarious and the lines delivered are priceless. Kudos to Richard O'Brien for writing such a good script! And the actors were simply amazing!! A first role for many of the stars. Tim Curry stands out as Dr. Frank-N-Furter, 'the sweet transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania', a role he will always be famous and remembered for. He is so hilarious, delivers his lines perfectly and, if I do say so myself, he is quite magnetizing! Susan Sarandon performs great as Janet Weiss and has a very nice singing voice. Barry Bostwick's character, Brad, is simply lovable! Patricia Quinn and Little Nell are 2 beautiful women playing 2 beautiful characters who are also very entertaining! Charles Gray and Jonathan Adams are also a great addition to the film.Another major plus of this film is the singing and the dancing! Catchy songs and thrilling dance numbers drew me to this film the most! So see it at home, see it in the theater, but just make sure you see it and get ready to have ultimate fun with what is, in my opinion, the best movie out there!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, everybody knows that "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" is probably the ultimate cult classic; at this point, "RHPS" isn't even really a cult movie anymore, due to its prominence. The plot (or whatever it is) of course has Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon) and Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) going to a castle run by the bizarre Dr. Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry), a "transvestite from transsexual Transylvania". Mostly, the movie seems like a big excuse to be weird, and they do just that to great effect. And who ever would have guessed that Susan Sarandon, now known for serious roles, could do such a cool job singing? So, was "RHPS" trying to tell us anything? Who cares? It's just so neat that you just have to sit back and enjoy. And enjoy you will, even if you think that nothing good came out of the '70s (I, for one, don't hold that opinion).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A middle-class young couple, motoring in the country on their wedding night, have car trouble in front of a huge mansion? Wanting to use the phone, the two approach the house and go in just as its master, Dr. Frank N. Furter, is leading an experiment? His newly made creature, the body-beautiful Rocky, is ready to be unveiled, and the innocent couple is caught up in this strange household filled with the doctor's campy, exotically dressed admirers? Both the wife and the husband are seduced by this garter-belted "scientist." The film's first half is fast and funny, with virtually every song a memorable one? But the second half tries to do too much and the film loses much of its potency? Nevertheless, the adorable characters make this a delightful entertainment?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, it really is the greatest cult-film of all-time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's fairly easy to see why "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" became such a huge cult-favorite so quickly... So huge even that the fans went to screenings all dressed up like drag-queens, singing along with the songs and waving around cigarette lighters. "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" simply is a tremendously inspiring movie and it's almost impossible not to start swinging yourself when the legendary songs such as "The Time Warp" and "Touch Me" are being sung by the vivid cast. The screenplay is adapted from Richard O'Brien (who also co-stars) play and it still comes across as very wit and all-knowing in its humor. There's spoofing and referring to everything from Universal and RKO-Pictures horror movies over typically 50's science-fiction to Hammer horror and the filming locations &amp; set pieces are leftovers from other classic genre titles. The story is ridiculously simple and merely just introduces a young couple whose car breaks down near a ominous dark castle. When they go there for help, they're sucked into the eccentric world of transvestite Dr. Frank 'N Furter and his bizarre collection of servants and friends. The frenzied doctor created himself a muscled and blond-haired toy-boy and he's in the middle of presenting his creation when Brad and Janet (a great early role for Susan Sarandon) stumble in. The lines and song lyrics are often hilarious and far from politically correct and the lingerie costumes are quite nifty. All the acting performances are terrific but immensely divergent, since Tim Curry's Frank 'N Furter is extremely grotesque whereas Charles Gray's narrating character is straight-faced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Musical Dream Come True</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rocky Horror Picture Show is the greatest rock musical of all time. It succeeds on every aesthetic level; the cast is a wonderful collection of cartoonish eccentrics, the premise combines the adventurousness of experimental theatre (The Rocky Horror Show) with the fun of film and musical popular culture, the songs are all catchy and beautifully arranged, and the costumes and sets are inventively quirky.The overwhelming creativity of the film has its roots in the hit London stage musical, Richard O'Brien's exuberant first work. After quitting the cast of Jesus Christ Superstar over creative differences, O'Brien set out to write a rock musical that would combine all the things that "give you a buzz," from science-fiction and horror films to comedy and glam rock. Impressed by Alice Cooper's recent concert assaults on London, O'Brien created what he originally called an "Alice Cooper type Frankenstein" character named Dr. Frank-N-Furter, who would build a blond muscleman for his own pleasure. Tim Curry assumed the role in the 1973 London play, sharing the stage with O'Brien, Little Nell, Patricia Quinn and Jonathan Adams. Behind the scenes were director Jim Sharman, production designer Brian Thomson, musical arranger Richard Hartley and costume designer Sue Blane, all of whom brought their considerable creativity to the production. The core members of the Rocky Horror stage family went on to create the film, building on a year's worth of theatrical innovation.Transferring Rocky Horror to the medium of film allowed the concept to take on a dreamlike quality. The film's tone is satire; Richard O'Brien enjoyed the dialogue of classic science-fiction films, where actors were called on to say outlandish lines with straight faces. The songs are integrated (not "backstage") musical numbers, which advance the plot. All of the characters are seduced or controlled by Frank, but his influence does not end with them. The film is at its most subversive when Frank talks and sings directly to the camera; the technique is a tribute to Jean-Luc Godard, Jim Sharman's favorite director.In the film, "Sweet Transvestite" Frank is given a glamorous, Joan Crawford-like film star appearance, and speaks in a feminine voice (with an upper-class Knightsbridge accent). When he/she gazes into the camera and beckons "Give yourself over to absolute pleasure," his message is not meant only for his poolside partners, but for us. As the bisexual mad doctor commences his final descent into decadence, his "moral" subduers are portrayed as similarly decadent hypocrites, offering up Frank as a sexual martyr. We are left in the swirling mists with Brad, Janet and Dr. Scott, forced to reconsider our own inhibitions. But first, Let's do the Time Warp again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Morals: Why I love this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit I'm too lazy to read through all the reviews here and see if I'm the only one who loves this classic not only for its music, its cast and costumes, or its insane collection of cinematic references. Just in case I'm the only one, I post this comment to perhaps give you a new view to this wonderful film.Under all its noise and gaudiness, I think the RHPS is profound, touching and tragic.A German critic (sympathetic to the film) called it "utterly immoral". This is ridiculous, as the RHPS is one of the most deeply moral films of all times.Why do Brad and Janet let themselves so easily be seduced by Frank N'Furter? Because they never spent a thought on the rules they want to live by. They think, you don't have sex before marriage because that's just the way how decent people should live. Obviously no one has told them that there could be a real understandable REASON for living this way. They have no clue. Trying to live by a moral without understanding the foundation of this moral must lead to tragedy.Frank N'Furter is a fascinating figure, one of the most memorable villains in cinematic history. There can be no doubt that what he does, to Brad, to Janet, to Rocky, to Eddie, is not only rude, but evil. Not before the "Floor Show" at the end we get a glimpse at the human core in this monster. There he sings about how he wanted to be dressed like Fay Wray when he saw her in "King Kong". I suspect that he not only wanted to be dressed like her, he wanted to BE her -- a longing that could not be fulfilled. Wearing women's clothes tragically didn't made him an angelic figure like Fay Wray, it made him a freak. And it seems to me that all he wanted in the first place was to be loved and be accepted for what he was. When he sings "I'm going home" and imagines an audience, this audience doesn't consist of weirdos like the Transsylvanians who are present when Frank is introduced into the film. Instead they are ordinary old people who friendly applaud his performance. Frank makes you think about how unfulfillable desires can torture people and make them outsiders. I don't think Frank wanted to be an outsider.For me, the most beautiful scene is when they sing "Don't dream it, be it" in the pool. The other four people in the pool are dressed like Frank; there are no boundaries any more, no distinction between the sexes, no gravity. This is pure bliss, the single truly utopian moment of the RHPS. Makes you want to believe that it could really be possible to be in love with the whole world, caress and be caressed back, without jealousy and pain, beyond time and space, beyond good and evil. Not even Dr. Scott can resist (great performance in his monologue, magnificent actor!).But is this more than a dream? Could it be real? The scene could go on for ever, I wish it would, but it is short and is abruptly ended by Frank himself when he jumps out of the water and starts singing "Wild and untamed thing". Why? Doesn't he trust his own utopia? Earlier in the film, we have seen how Janet imagines different people replacing the face of her lover, Rocky, during her orgasm. This is basically the same utopia, but here the way it is presented doesn't make it look very tempting, but bizarre and disturbing. I suspect this scene is closer to our reality outside of the cinema, outside of our dreams: When you love with your body but not with your soul all you can hope for is a moment of frantic pleasure, but no real fulfillment.The ending of the RHPS cannot be mistaken in its moral. Brad and Janet spell it out when they sing the sad last song "Super Heroes". What is left for them from the big party? Nothing but pain and disillusion. They have not been loved, they have been used, and now they are scarred for life. This is not a happy ending.The epilogue by the narrator is very pessimistic. But are we really "insects", crawling on this earth, without hope, without meaning? I don't think so. We could decide to live a different life. A life without deliberately or thoughtlessly hurting other people. Respecting and accepting other people for what they are. Living not by an empty moral, but by a real one, with love and compassion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard of Rocky Horror before I saw it. I saw it on TV, by myself, and thought, wow, this is really bad. At same later time I saw it in a movie theater with the audience yelling and throwing things at the screen, and viewed that way, it's a lot of fun.But when reviewing a movie, you shouldn't be reviewing the audience, although that's exactly what some people do.Recently Rocky Horror was on TV and I decided to watch a bit. It was better than I remembered, but still is problematic.Parts of it are actually amazing. The first song is quite good, and the first 10 or so minutes in the castle are great, with two of the best numbers from the show and the appearance of Tim Curry in a brilliant and fearless performance.After that, the movie goes up and down. The acting is varied although Bostwick and Sarandon are quite amusing (and as a bonus Sarandon spends most of the movie running around in her underwear). The dialog is weak. The movie has a low budget quality, and while some of it is visually imaginative and clever, at other times it seems indifferently filmed. Some of it is funny, some of it is stupid, and a lot of it is dull.Part of the problem is that the movie tries to be a takeoff of bad movies while never establishing that it is not, in fact, a bad movie. A successful bad movie parody has to leave no doubt in the viewers mind that those behind the camera know exactly what they're doing (for example, The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra). But Rocky Horror has no consistency of tone, sometimes seeming like a tribute to bad movies, sometimes like a movie that is trying to be a really slick musical. The movie never tries to make much sense, but it's not well-made enough to get away with that.Ultimately, Rocky Horror is a curio distinguished by one brilliant performance and four or five really good songs. And, of course, Susan Sarandon in her underwear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an 18 y/o stranded in a small, bible belt town in the sticks of Missouri, I would drive 120 miles every two weeks to St. Louis to the Varsity Theater to see The Rocky Horror Picture Show during the early 80's. For me, it was a chance to live, to breathe free, as anything went; there was no need to conform to any narrow minded conventions, as I felt I had to survive at home. The first time I witnessed Tim Curry flinging open his cape, proudly proclaiming "I'm just a sweet transvestite, from Transsexual Transylvania," I knew I'd found a place to be myself. Even now, some 18 years later, that sight still gives me a thrill. Sure, the plot is ridiculous (on second thought, it had more to offer than 80 percent of the crap coming out of Hollywood then and now) and it is loaded with technical flaws. Still, I consider it the greatest film of all time. How many films draw a crowd of regulars weekly, create a sense of community, especially for people who, more than likely, felt as if they were not a part of any community, as I felt? Over the years, I've seen the film 64 times, and when I'm 80 I plan on getting up on my arthritic legs and doing the "Time Warp."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw 'Rocky' on video, aged 14, and was confused as hell by it. BUT the songs stuck in my head, I rented the video and watched it with two mates, we learnt the songs off by heart, and drove everyone we knew up the wall!I think this film IS a modern classic - it's fun, it's cheesy, it sets your fingers tappin' your feet a-dancin', and gets you humming 24/7. You shouldn't't take it seriously on ANY level; it's a blatant parody of 50's B-movies, with awful dialogue, wooden acting, wobbly sets... *sighs*... wonderful!Tim Curry in full drag is probably the sexiest sight ever on screen, and the movie, IMHO, is actually more erotic by implying sex than the blatant warts-and-all approach we are given in most adult films these days.This is a film to watch with friends, preferably nutty ones, and just have fun. The new DVD with the sing-along feature is excellent for Rocky virgins, and the live show directions (squirt water pistol NOW) make it the most fun DVD in my collection.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was definitely not made during the days of the Hays Code. This musical has amazing, talented actors that can keep a straight face. This movie deals with being different in society, from sexuality to the way people look. The directing was good, and the scenery and lighting gave the story that takes place in this big house believable for the movie. This also helped keep the audience interested. It made people think of things like "What's going to happen to Brad and Janet?" "Will they ever get out of this house?" "How is this movie going to end?" Although the story was very different then from what I'm used to watching, it was still great nonetheless.The story was hard to follow towards the end. When Dr. Frank and Rocky die, and Riff Raff and Magenta return to Transylvania it was a little confusing. This movie works for the movie, but something like this couldn't happen in real life. I liked this movie anyway since I'm a sucker for a good musical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those of you who are not old enough or have been living under a rock for the last 25 years, Rocky Horror Picture Show is about a hopful, about to be married couple venturing to see an old friend, when a flat tire stops them short. They wander into a strange castle where a party is being held. I will not reveal any more, but all i can say now is that the events which occur will be remember for a long, long time.  Now, to the review. This movie is an excellant exploration film. It pushed to limits that where unheard of back in the 70's. It bombed at the boxoffice. Evenwith strong songs, it was the worst bomb of the 70's, perhaps of all time. ( I can't back that up) in all aspects, the movie sucked. Some awful performences by a few cast memebers and an offbeat plot make due for a bad movie. That's the normal Vhs version. The new DVD is an excellant buy for anyone interested in the film. All Rocky Horror fans should own it. It features new songs and an audience participation backing. But the only way to enjoy the greatest musical ever is to see it at a midnight showing. You will love it. The audience will be rather insane, mind you. But never the less, it's an excellant show. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay I have watched this movie 38 years after it was made and even now in this modern age it is definitely not like any other musical out there. I can understand why they call it a cult-classic, after I watched the Show I couldn't stop Tim Warping in my room...it was amazing.I love that they don't try to hide anything, they give you "More, more, more" and it's so satisfying I had a smile on my face the whole time. The music is timeless and I think even my children will one day still hear the music of Rocky Horror Picture Show...Susan Sarandon is amazing in her portrayal...she brings the innocent factor, but then with "Touch-a-Touch Me" I was like "Go Susan..."And then there is Tim Curry...There will never be a better Frank...he was amazing. His voice probably the best of them all. May The Rocky Horror Picture Show live forever....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Musical Scifi-Erotic-Horror Double Feature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' is probably one of the (positively) weirdest musical horror science fiction movies. It starts off parodying your typical horror movie, with the characters breaking into a song every now and then. Right up until the point when Brad and Janet arrive at Dr. Frank-N-Furter's mansion. From then on the film takes a comically bizarre turn. Saying what happens further will be risking spoilers. The surprises are better left for the viewer to discover.The execution is first rate. Jim Sharman successfully creates a bizarre atmosphere that is creepy, sexually charged and fascinating. This film doesn't appear outdated at all. The hilarious songs are of the foottapping kind and the visualization is very energetic. The special effects are good. Costume and makeup are totally wacky.Barry Bostwick, Susan Sarandon and Tim Curry turn in hilarious performances. The Curry character should be included in 'weirdest movie characters' category. Sarandon is nothing like she has been in the movies she's done in the last twenty years. Here she's very convincing as a naive bimbo.'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' is a delightful ride to the world of bizarro. Definitely a great rainy day or past midnight flick and one that made me laugh out loud on multiple occasions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply bizarre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's really hard to judge and grade a film like this, not only because the version I saw is a midnight showing with people in costumes, acting out the film, yelling stuff out at every moment of silence (and occasionally during the dialogue), and throwing stuff at the screen, but also because the film is so bizarre. The plot is a strange mish-mash of horror, sci-fi, comedy, and gay musical, and it doesn't always fit together. In particular, the alien stuff at the end has always been one step too far for me. The songs are good for the most part, except for the ones at the end. So really, I like everything about this film up until about the dinner scene, and then it's all downhill from there. But the stuff leading up to that is wildly imaginative, brilliantly hilarious, and a complete riot. But I've still never watched the whole thing at home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this was in L.A. It was at midnight, and the theater was filled with patrons who were dressed in the various characters costumes from the movie. Inside the theater we experienced more fun with the sale of "Virgins". The sale refers to new viewers to Rocky Horror Picture Show. When the movie started there were people in the front next to the screen acting alongside. People in the audience were yelling back in unison to the actors dialogue on the screen. Water, toast, rice and various other inanimate items were used to enhance the experience of the movie. The people with me were laughing as hard as I was through all the stuff going on. I loved it. I had seen it a few more times at various midnight shows throughout the years. Most of the time it was wonderful. But when I saw it at home a year ago I did not have that same feeling, I saw it for the first time with out all the outside enhancements. I finally realized that the movie was really not that good, It had some good songs and some funny characters, but the movie is not that great. It is simple and sometimes almost moronic. In all, This movie MUST be seen with all the extra enhancements to really enjoy it. In the right movie theater, It is a 10. At home it is around a 5.5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is pure adult fantasy fun. It is escapism at it's ultimate best. If viewed with an open mind &amp; a sense of fun, one can lose all sense of self &amp; worries. You have to allow yourself to feel the joi de vivre which Richard O'Brien intended. He encompasses a nostalgic journey through 1930-50's sci-fi with the philosophy of "don't dream it, be it", in other words, realise life &amp; live it to maximum enjoyment. Enhanced by powerful, life affirming music &amp; dialogue. If you can understand this, then it is obvious why audiences have embraced this film &amp; want to physically interact with it. It liberates the inner child &amp; motivates the future adult. Powerful stuff, if you let it in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the ultimate campy movie. You can tell that everyone in the cast had a blast filming it. The special effects are low tech, which is OK because this movie is supposed to be a nod at the '50's B movie.That's not to say it's a bad movie....quite the opposite. It's a fun ride that takes you places you never expected to go. It is filled with memorable musical numbers that make you laugh out loud.Oh, and you mustn't forget the incomparable cast, most notably, Tim Curry as Frank-n-furter. He is wonderfully over the top here. And his songs are a great showcase for his marvelous voice.The best way to watch this movie is to get a large group of people together late at night (alcohol is a must here!) and let loose! Everyone will be up on their feet doing the Time Warp before you know it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just recently saw this movie in the theaters and boy was it a blast! The first great experience of my summer, I underwent the de-virginization ritual and had to get on all fours and squeal like a pig! I really got into it, too. At least I wasn't the virgin who had to lick whipped cream off the tip of a gigantic blow-up cock! At the screening, they had a movie screen showing the movie and a stage with a cast acting the whole thing out. It was so much fun, and this is the best way to see this film. But if you're not adventurous enough to go out on your own, just get a group of friends, a bag of props (listed below), and rent this!Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) and Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon) are the typical whitebread American couple who get a flat tire during a storm and walk to a castle to use a telephone. There, they encounter Dr. Frank N. Furter (Tim Curry) and his band of bisexual, incestuous, and just plain perverted servants who help him in creating a muscleman to aid in relieving Frankie's.....tension. To say anything more would be criminal.What more can I say? If you haven't seen this yet, you need help! Everyone should view this at least once, preferrably in a theater with full-time audience participation, but if you can't do that, get a few friends over with a couple beers and view this! You will never be the same! For props, get rice (for the wedding), spray bottles (for rain), newspaper (to put over your head during the rain), flashlights (for the "There's a Light" musical number), noisemakers (for the operation scene), toast (for when Frankie proposes a toast), and a party hat (for Rocky's birthday song). Throw the rice and toast at the screen, use everything else properly as in the movie. The music is fantastic! You must get up and dance to "Time Warp" and try to sing along to the highly addictive songs. They will guaranteed stay in your head for weeks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's Do The Time Warp Again: The Cult Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From absolute disaster to international success, few titles have had the roller-coaster ride of THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW. Originally a low-budget English stage show, it exploded into mainstream popularity and became one of London's longest running musicals--but then died a quick and very painful death in New York. As an afterthought, the American company played a limited engagement in Los Angeles and once more the show was a smash hit and soon became a motion picture--which received mixed reviews and proved a box office dud. That probably would have been the end of it, but the film suddenly and unexpectedly emerged as a cult movie phenomena and ascended to international acclaim.The story is well known. All-American Brad Majors and Janet Weiss become engaged and rush to tell their mentor, Dr. Everett Scott. But they take a wrong turn, have a flat, and suddenly find themselves captives of a bisexual transvestite from outer space who is intent on making the perfect boy-toy lover from scratch. Although the material was considerably softened for the screen, even today it remains surprisingly sharp, and the film contains numerous references to the classic Hollywood horror films that inspired it.The cast, most of whom played in the various stage versions, is truly astonishing. Tim Curry was little known when the film was made, but he shows tremendous talent in the role of Dr. Frank N. Furter, the bisexual transvestite from outer space; his performance is a remarkable combination of broad farce, sensuality, and dark wit. While Curry is certainly the show's centerpiece, the rest of the cast is equally effective. Both Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon are beautifully cast as the goody-goody Brad and Janet; Richard O'Brien (who wrote the stage show), Patricia Quinn, Little Nell, and Meatloaf all give memorable turns as the mad doctor's bizarre associates; and character actors Johnathan Adams and Charles Gray offer considerable drop-dead wit in supporting roles. Only Peter Hinwood seems out of his league, selected more for looks than talent--but strange to say, this actually works in the context of the film.If you've only seen this film at an audience-participation showing, you're in for a surprise: THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW is wickedly funny, something you're likely to miss when every one in the audience is screaming at the screen. Although the material was toned down for the movie--song sequences were rearranged, lyrics rewritten, and script and characters softened--the whole thing still has plenty of bite. The story, of course, is intrinsically subversive; the script has a uniquely British sensibility; and the songs are catchy, bouncy, and frequently have lyrics that are very clever in an underhanded sort of way. Like most cult films, it will not appeal to everyone--but if you get it, you've gotta have it.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome Cult Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While NOT much of a film as movies go... Rocky Horror was resurrected as an exciting audience participation cult film. It saddens me to hear young adults talking about the movie being excellent. It would seem that weekly Rocky-goers from the 80s and 90s grew up, got married, and had kids. They felt the urge; the need to share Rocky with the kids. So this generation grew up seeing Rocky at home (how awful). Obviously their parents forgot to mention the only way to see it is with a live cast. Rocky bombed at the theatres initially. Of course, I will admit it made any appearance of Tim Curry in other films, utterly hilarious. But, always a fan, and as I spent more than three years as Brad in our local cast, I give Rocky Horror its well deserved 10 out of 10. This rating is wholly weighted on entertainment value with a talented live cast. So do your part. Find a Rocky virgin and get him or her to a theatre as soon as possible. And we'll all do the Time Warp again! And again. And again. And again. See you there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Rocky Horror Picture Show" is a truly funny musical, and if you haven't seen it (even if you hate musicals) you should watch this at least once; probably at home. I must be one of the few Rocky Horror fans that hate the whole "audience participation" deal. If you have to throw toilet paper and hotdogs and shout obscenities to make a movie fun then you obviously aren't fulfilled by the movie itself.This musical parodies those cheesy B-movies where the typical wholesome all-American couple gets a flat tire and goes to a spooky house for a phone...though in this case it's the house of a transvestite doctor. This going to be FUN! Reprising their roles from the 1973 Original London Cast of "The Rocky Horror Show" are Tim Curry, Richard O'Brien (also the creator), Patricia Quinn, Little Nell, as well as Jonathan Adams (though in the role of Dr. Scott instead of the Narrator). Meatloaf also reprises his role as Eddie from the 1974 Los Angeles production. I appreciate how instead of getting all big-names and a big fat budget they opted for lower budget with a cast formed of previous RHS actors. How would you parody a low-budget B-movie with a high budget anyway? Susan Sarandon makes a great Janet, though Barry Bostwick is slightly lacking (his version of "Once In A While" was so slow; I could see why they DID cut it out from the movie).Three things I rather hate about the movie is the song pacing, Charles Gray, and the elimination of Rocky's dialogue. Every song in the movie is performed much slower than they were in the original productions, which in turn slows the action of the movie down; the only songs that worked at a slower pace were "I'm Going Home" and "Superheroes". Charles Gray talks at the pace of a dying mule and puts nowhere near as much energy as Jonathan Adams or Graham Jarvis did (nor as much ominousness as Arthur Dignam). In the play Rocky actually talks; he never actually talks in this movie. This makes sense going the Frankenstein route, because the monster couldn't speak fluent sentences until he went to the man at the cottage. What DOESN'T make sense is that he can still SING. This thwarts that logic, huh? One thing I like that the movie adds is the awkward dinner scene.....that's always a hoot to watch.I suppose I should wrap things up. WATCH IT! Clever, catchy songwriting. Great cast of actors (closest thing you'll get to seeing the original 1973 London cast.....unless a bootleg of THAT shows up). And just an overall good time. Invite some friends over to your house, get Doritos, kick back, and give yourself over to absolute pleasure!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Rocky Horror Picture Show" is a strange film not only because of its content, but because of the way it needs to be seen to be appreciated. You have probably heard of this film and how it is often shown at midnight with an audience dressing up, singing along and shouting non-stop at the screen. That's exactly how you should see the movie because at home, by yourself it really isn't anything special. This broad musical follows Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) and Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon) who find themselves stranded in a rainstorm on a strange road after getting engaged. Seeking a telephone, the couple decide to get out of the car and travel a creepy castle spotted earlier in the road. When they arrive, they find that the Annual Transylvanian Convention is being held. Bizarre-looking characters are singing, dancing and being extremely frank about their sexuality, much to Brad and Janet's shock. Things become even stranger when the head of the convention, Dr. Frank N. Furter (Tim Curry) arrives. He is dressed in a corset, fishnets, wears bright lipstick and strips the couple of their clothes before bringing them and the rest of the convention to his laboratory where he presents his creation, a perfect man named Rocky (Peter Hinwood). After witnessing Frank N. Furter's depravity, Frank and Janet are sent to bed, but the Dr.'s influence is already starting to affect them...Technically, this is not a very well made movie. The acting isn't particularly good, the plot is often barely intelligible, there are wardrobe malfunctions (Magenta before being turned to stone, Dr. Frank during the end of the film), badly choreographed dance numbers, scenes where characters don't act like human beings at all (like when Janet puts on her robe, takes three steps then takes it off again), scenes where the low production really shows (when getting wet, Dr. Frank's tattoo can be seen running). If you're watching the movie just by yourself, not knowing what you're getting into you'll just be wondering what the big deal is about. This is where the audience participation comes in. Despite its flaws, the film is very memorable and features many catchy songs. It's got a lot of iconic imagery and the dialogue lends itself well to ridicule. It's likely that there's a theatre somewhere near where you live that will at some point show the film and let the audience participate. If you're curious at all about the movie, that's the way to see it. Depending on how obsessive the fans are and how crowded the theatre is, if you're a newcomer (or "virgin") you might find yourself getting hazed. If you're lucky, the worst that will happen to you while the film is playing is getting pelted by rice and confetti but you might end up getting soaked or get hit upside the head by toast. Ideally, at least one person will know the "scripted" lines to appropriately riff on the movie and will have just as much dialogue as all of the characters put together. That's really the only way to see the film: barely being able to hear what is going on unless the characters are singing, not really caring about what the plot is unless Tim Curry is on the screen and gleefully pointing out all of the flaws in the production.Reviewing the film really feels kind of pointless. The fans of the film are die-hard fans and would gleefully come at me with an ice pick if I recommend that you don't watch the movie. Unless you've seen the movie with an audience and know what the experience is like, there's no sense in watching the movie at home. I like to think of "The Rocky Horror Picture" as one of those indoor roller-coasters where a screen shows graphics while your seat rumbles and swings back and forth. The video by itself is pointless to watch on its own and if you did, you would be very disappointed. You would be missing the point though, it isn't even meant to be seen on its own. It's meant to be seen with all of those people screaming and throwing stuff in the air. Having seen the movie by itself at home, I'd give it a middling 2,5/5; nothing special. This is where that asterisk comes in though. With an audience that knows what it's doing, an MC and people dressing up, it's a blast and easily comes up to a 5/5, if only because it's an experience you will never forget.

		<fullReview>For Halloween I am re-watching some classics such as Halloween, The Crow and this. Being as that my memories of this movie were very distant I decided after watching to review it and it is by far one of the strangest movies I have ever seen.The plot is that Brad and Janet announced their engagement, they drive to... someplace and in typical B-movie horror fashion, their car breaks down so they decide to go to the nearest place they can find and ask the residents to use a phone. Unfortunately, the closest place they can find is a castle with hunchbacks, people dressed up in clothes very reminiscent of the 70's and the person running the whole establishment is a transvestite doctor that creates life in Rocky, a fully grown, muscle bound man with blond hair of which the scientist uses as his own personal sex toy, and the weirdness only builds from there.So, this is a musical so if you haven't heard any of the music you might wonder how it is - I actually find it really good. I mean - hey, it's not the best music I've heard in a musical and I'd be lying if I said I liked every single one of the songs (Rocky's opening number for one) but with other songs, I'd freely admit that I enjoyed almost all of them.Then there's other technical aspects, well - did you remember when I said the movie is weird, yeah well for stuff like the cinematography, it's standard and the acting is suitably over-the-top (all I have to say is remember seeing Tim Curry do a goofy villain performance... Well no matter which villain performance you've seen him do it isn't anywhere near as goofy as this one) but from an editing point of view it is really strange, not in a "this is bad!" way but I have yet to see a movie put in a Star Wipe that fits with the rest of the movie.If there is anything negative to say about the movie... it would have to be the Criminologist. It is clear that the sole reason for putting the character in was to off-set the strangeness of murderous transvestite scientists but all he does is just say exposition and show the moves of the Time Warp, It just doesn't feel needed.So beneath all that strangeness is there a movie worth watching and memorizing (as fans of this movie have done for the Midnight Screenings)... Well, yes. I mean it's no masterpiece but there is something there worthy of gaining it the cult film status it has now... Hell, this movie invented the Cult film and it's easy to see how it is well-liked by people today as well as why audiences... Didn't really warm up to it when it was first released in theaters. I maybe have to do a midnight screening to appreciate it enough to give it a higher rating but I actually think if you're open-minded and think the strangeness of what I described to you is worthy of a laugh then I recommend it, it is NOT a movie for everyone - but beneath all the weirdness is actually something worth celebrating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With Rocky Horror you either get it or you don't, it's that simple. It really is an excuse for a heterosexuals to embrace their inner fetishist and embrace the hidden campness within. It has no equal, it has no rival and it will live forever more. The fact that such a trendy series as Glee sees fit to pay tribute to it in one ep with actors who weren't even born when the movie version was released ably demonstrates its' timeless appeal and popular resonance. What's great? What isn't great? Tim Curry is the ultimate Franknfurter, better even than Anthony Head who also excels in the role. Barry Bostick and Susan Sarandon are also terrific, Richard O'Brien, Little Nell and Patricia Quinn all brilliant, much like Dickens there's no such thing as a small role in this film. Interesting to see Christopher Biggins as one of the Transylvanians and a very young Koo Stark as one of the guests at the wedding. And off course this is the film that made Meatloaf a star, he makes a huge impression for having so little screen time and actually no spoken lines, he sings absolutely everything. Charles Gray makes a wonderful narrator, so weird to think he actually never met the rest of the cast. Great music, Richard O'Brien must have a terrific songwriting ability to produce all these crackers. Love Time Warp, Sweet Patootie, Sweet Transvestite, I'm Going Home, Burning at the Frankenstein Place. Not so fond of Janet Bryce and a few of the others which tend to slow things down a tad in my opinion.Contains 2 of the best lines in movie history. Firstly; Franknfurter; "Magenta, you and your brother have served me faithfully" Magenta; "I ask for nothing" Frankfurter; "And you shall receive it in abundance!" plus Magenta (surveying the carnage wreaked by Riffraff); "You killed them! But I thought you liked them? They liked you" Riffraff (hysterically, exposing all his inner insecurities);"They didn't like me! They NEVER liked me!" Priceless!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still amongst the greatest cult classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is often considered to be one of the ultimate cult films. Whenever you go to any screening of the film you'll always find many people dressed in drag, singing the songs and of course dancing the time warp. Part of the reason for the films great success is that it's a parody of many of the things that are popular in culture. Everything from cheesy romances to gory horror is mashed together in this bizarre film of insanity that is The Rocky Horror Picture Show.It all begins when our heroine and hero get caught with a flat (how bout that?) so they go in to a nearby mansion to use their phone. Little do they know that there are strange people to occupy that occupy that house with a night filled with monsters, aliens and Transylvania Transvestites to follow. The plot is silly, wacky and makes little sense, making it just right for all the absurdity that happens over the course of the night. Even when the laws of physics are broken, we just shove it off because in this weird world it actually makes sense.But more importantly than that, this weird world allows for some of the best songs in musicals to come out of nowhere. Just like many of the classic musicals, there's never much reason for the music, with the simple act of someone entering a room being cause for a dance number. Certainty these songs are the most memorable moments in the film as well and the main reason that it has become such a cultural hit as each song has a unique style and catchy lyrics which mocks other musical styles in gorgeous fashion, ranging from an Elvis inspired Eddie to the stereotypical musical numbers in the time warp the songs are always original and entertaining.Through this music the film successfully allows viewers to fully embrace the film, with entire audiences getting up to do the dances and sing the lyrics. The most memorable of these tends to be the time warp and sweet transvestite with every lyric in each being both memorable and hilarious. Beyond that, the time warp even tells you exactly what dance you should be doing, meaning there are no excuses for those who say they don't know the dance. Whilst the entire soundtrack is also incredible, these are definitely the leading songs that will get people singing along in any screening.Also I think the film chooses what is probably the perfect cast for their characters. Firstly you have Meatloaf, who whilst only has a short time on screen makes his impact in that time with his fast paced style and legendary singing voice to ensure that we remember his short time on screen. Then there's Richard O'Brien (who is also the writer of the film) playing the handyman and is the lead voice in the now iconic time warp. It's a tough thing for anyone to do his song simply because it's tough for any other singer to match his voice with its ever changing style and impressive vocal range. Brad and Jaret are also perfect as the leads because of how typical they seem at the beginning of the film for a romantic couple. This makes their entry in to the world of insanity far more entertaining.And most importantly lets not forget the legendary Tim Curry. Any moment Frank-N-Furter is on screen, you're damn sure that he dominates the show with his brilliant over the top style perfectly personifying the nature of such an insane character. Certainly if there is any character who anyone can instantly recognise from the film it is Furter. Everything about him makes him stand out amongst an already insane cast, with his ridiculous costume (becoming regular dress for fans) and even more ridiculous voice carrying the perfect tone for such a memorable character.There's been some talk of doing a remake of this film in recent years, though personally I don't think that there should ever be another version. Sure, you can do different versions at the theatre, but this is the definitive version of the film simply because there is nothing that a new film version could add to it. This version carries with it all the charm and humour that no remake could ever recreate with this film standing alone as a unique film in the musical genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2012's Rocky Horror Midnight Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2012, the weekend before Halloween, The east coast was threatened with a devastating hurricane, an appropriately named "Frankenstorm." This ended up pulling a tree down in my yard and leaving me without power for a week. So where was I that Saturday? Standing out in line in front of our local theater for a midnight screening of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show." This was the third year I had done the Rocky Horror Midnight Experience. The theater was less crowded then in the previous years, only a little more then half-full. The crowd was still decent, shouting along, dancing, having a lot of fun, as you'd expect. However, maybe it was just me and my lack of sleep, but it seems the excitement peaked a little early. The oddly poetic image of toilet paper and toast filling the air above us, silhouetted against the screen, a little pass the hour point, seemed the natural conclusion to the night. It's also fair to say the shadow cast this year wasn't as good as 2010's. They weren't bad. Everyone was enthusiastic and in the spirit. Janet was very busty, which I didn't mind, and the actor playing Rocky was very popular with the ladies. (And seemed to be smuggling a roll of quarters in his speedo.) Overall, everyone just seemed a little less in to it. Anyway: The movie itself. Is it actually any good? That's an important question. From a critical perspective, it remains divisive. I found myself feeling a little bored with the picture this year. It's certainly an entertaining film. The music is roundly excellent. The cast is extremely good, with everyone inhabiting their roles fully, to the point were this film has defined most of the cast's careers. Tim Curry is obviously the stand-out performances but this year I found myself admiring Barry Boswick's comedic timing. The production values are actually pretty good too. Most of the jokes land successfully. In particularly I love Charles Gray's deadpan framing device and the long sequence of name-calling. There's enough general weirdness in the performances and delivery to add some appeal. But from a writing perspective, I found myself wondering. The pace meanders quite a bit and several of the songs don't actually contribute to the plot. The latter half of the second act basically lumbers around until we get to the floor show at the end. Dr. Scott doesn't actually contribute much to the story. Frank is the most popular character in the film even though, you know, he's actually a textbook psychopath, right down to the charisma. He doesn't care about anyone but himself, manipulates and hurts the people around without pausing, not to mention murdering someone with a pickaxe because they glanced at his boyfriend. The rule clue that he's an asshole is that, despite doing all this awful stuff, he still considers himself the hero of the movie. "I'm Going Home" is basically Frank telling us that he's the victim, of an uncaring world where he doesn't fit in. He imagines an audience cheering and applauding for him, in a blatant act of self-deluded narcissism. The movie acknowledges this by killing him off at the end. The ending, which leaves our lead trio collapsed on the ground, worn out by their embrace of hedonism, says that attitude of sexual wantonness is bad. Even though the rest of the movie basically goes on about how this is awesome and you squares need to be less uptight, maaaan. The themes are jumbled and uncertain is what I'm saying.It's possible the people who made the movie were too high to notice this disparity. And, considering the general mood of the midnight screenings, maybe the viewer is suppose to be as high. Perhaps Richard O'Brian is saying that you should accept yourself and be open with your sexuality but don't go overboard with it. Anyway, I enjoy the movie, flaws and all. It's certainly an intriguing mess of pop culture references, rock music, and sexual confusion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is literally the best thing I've ever seen. I'll change "favorites" through the years but I know that this one will stay forever in my heart, its music, its characters. Everything about this film is simply amazing; and it basically covers every genre possible. I'm completely in love with every single character and song, and I'd happily watch it a thousand times. Rocky Horror has thought me many things, made me laugh and cry. There isn't a single thing I don't like about it, except that it should have been a little (lot) longer, so we all could enjoy some more of this greatness. Please please give it a try, it may seem too much but, personally, I wouldn't rate it R. Everybody has to see Rocky Horror, period. I could say more but I don't want to spoil anything, so, give yourself over to absolute pleasure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is wonderful. It is getting long in the tooth, yet it is never dated. The humor is lasting, and the inside jokes are still hilarious. Rocky is gorgeous. Dr. Frank-N-Furter's makeup is excellent. Meat Loaf is a great musician, and also gross to look at while being served at the dinner table! UGH.The dancing group in tuxedos are great. Brad and Janet are hysterical. That they are stranded and uptight in the beginning only serves as the springboard for their later ruination and baptizing into the "reality" of the bizarre castle.The professor in the wheelchair is a laugh riot, even though pathetic. Everything in this movie has biting wit, and the memories are long-lived. I have not seen this movie in awhile, but now in 2013 I am still chuckling. Viva Rocky Horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably the most famous cult movie, The Rocky Horror Picture Show (RHPS) holds the record for the longest theatrical run in movie history ? it has been shown continually since its release in 1975, and even though initially it wasn't very popular, it gained a cult following after its midnight screenings. Tim Curry, who plays Dr. Frank-N-Furter, even got to meet Prince Charles and Princess Diana because she loved his role in the movie.Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) proposes to his girlfriend Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon) at their friends' wedding. She happily accepts and they decide to go visit Dr. Everett V. Scott (Jonathan Adams), their college professor, to tell him the good news. During the travel, they get a flat tire and go look for help. They get to a castle where they are greeted by a butler who tells them his master is having a party, and they are forced to stay.Not only is the movie extremely funny with never a dull moment, but if you go see the play or a midnight screening, you're guaranteed to have an even greater time. In fact, it is tradition to bring props, like for example rice, that has to be thrown during the wedding scene. But as it may get noisy and confusing, I'd suggest to watch it at home first. Apart from this, RHPS is a mix of everything: sci-fi, horror, trash, comedy and, of course, musical. Therefore, it can't be enjoyed by everybody, as it can seem chaotic and pointless from time to time. But there's no need to take it too seriously, since it's also a parody ? you can just sit back, relax and especially sing along since the songs are absolutely wonderful and help the story go on. The don't stop the action, they are the action, and fit the movie perfectly.The actors flawlessly play their roles, especially Tim Curry as Dr. Frank-n-Furter. I really can't explain how he, a man in drag, manages to be so sexy that it confuses straight people, but I love it. He also proves to be a great singer, and the movie received good reviews mostly thanks to his performance. But the rest of the cast is very good too, they are really into their characters. I said before that this is, among other things, a comedy. The fact is, it only makes you laugh the first time. After you've seen it more times, and thought about it, you notice it's really tragic. You can't be mad at Dr. Frank-n-Furter even though he's evil ? he just seeks approval and love, but finds (and gives) only sex, which leaves him, Brad and Janet ultimately empty and unhappy. And there is no happy ending for such an uplifting musical that has more to offer than meets the eye. A must see.Rating: 9/10 Read more at passpopcorn.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The difference between if they are laughing with you or at you depends on who tells the joke first. Tim Curry steals the movie with absolute mastery of his campy role as transvestite recluse. His comfortable persona and plea to 'give yourself to absolute pleasure' is strikingly charming. Smoking hot Susan Sarrandon and nerdy Brian Bostwick deliver classic naivete as the cast takes Richard O'Briens musical beyond the English Stage. RKO Hollywood is turned into a personal twisted extravaganza while the supporting cast and tacky set weigh it down. No problem as it gives more room for Tim Curry to take over the film.... and the "Time Warp" is one of the weaker scenes only setting up Tims' entrance as a "sweet transvestite". Many complain of the slow burn towards the later portion of the film, but after many viewings, I found this to be the endearing Curry bearing his soul for the GLBT viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Good Musical Parody!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon, Barry Bostwick, Richard O'Brien, Patricia Quinn, Nell Campbell, Peter Hinwood, Jonathan Adams, Charles Gray and Meatloaf star in this 1975 musical comedy based on the Broadway play. This is basically a parody of sci-fi and horror films where we meet newly engaged couple, Brad Majors (Bostwick) and his fiance, Janet Weiss (Sarandon) who have just attended their friend's wedding. They run into car trouble on a stormy night and find a castle owned by transvestite scientist, Dr. Fran-N-Furter (Curry) who has an odd group of people working for him. Soon, Brad and Janet are in for a night they'll never forget and discover their host and his associates are aliens from planet, Transsexual in the galaxy, Transylvania. O'Brien not only plays handyman, Riff Raff, but wrote the play and the film, Quinn plays Magenta, Campbell plays Columbia, Hinwood plays Frank-N-Furter's new experiment, Rocky Horror, Adams plays scientist, Dr. Everett Scott, the late, Gray (Diamonds Are Forever) plays a criminologist who narrates the film and Meatloaf plays biker, Eddie. This is a good musical parody with a great cast I recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated but fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie once late at night on the TV and recently with a friend at a wonderful open air venue in the summer. So my opinion is based on two very different experiences.What sticks in the mind after those two viewings how great the cast of this movie is. Tim Curry is just plain sexy. And thats very difficult for a hairy guy in high heels. If never much cared for him in any other films but here he is just dead on. The same does apply for the rest of the cast. Susan Sarandon with her big big scared eyes. Riff-Raff and Magenta are excellently played with their exchange of meaningful glances.The tunes are all very catchy, but don't look for a great story or any meaning in it. This is a comedy and a persiflage to all lot of trashy science-fiction and hammer-films.I had to realize that the fact that it's a persiflage can be overlooked by some younger viewers. The friend I took along to the viewing hat never heard of the RHPS and it wasn't until I told her during the break that they it's not a serious approach and that all those goofs and tacky special effects are there deliberately. However I must admit that it's a little bit dated. All the outrageous moments and actions in this movie are mostly not outrageous anymore. A lot of the attire can nowadays be seen on a normal Saturday night at a disco near you.But it's nevertheless an enjoyable movie and I highly recommend seeing it with public interaction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From its origins as a stage production to its current status as an enduring bit of cult cinema, "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" is not for everybody but proves to be an irresistible bit of schlock, send-up, and musical. One has to love it for its kink factor, considering the costumes characters are often required to wear, and the performers just completely throw themselves into this thing, especially the dynamic star, Tim Curry. Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick play a "normal" couple on a trip who get stuck in the middle of nowhere in inclement weather and are forced to seek shelter at a nearby castle, which is being populated by oddball characters from Transylvania, which in the case of this film is a planet. Curry is aces as Dr. Frank-N-Furter, cross dressing scientist who contrives a being he names Rocky Horror (Peter Hinwood). Paying heartfelt tribute to genre movies and B movies from cinemas' history right from the start, "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" never runs out of wild, inventive ideas, energetic musical numbers, and catchy rock tunes. Among said rock tunes are things like "Wild and Untamed Thing", "Dammit Janet", and the immortal "Time Warp". Its off the wall sensibility helps to keep it refreshingly unpredictable, and it's got some pretty good atmosphere going for it. Music and lyrics are by Richard O'Brien, who plays the role of Riff Raff, and who is delightful along with such other great characters as Patricia Quinns' Magenta, Little Nells' Columbia, and Meat Loafs' Eddie. It's hard to imagine somebody watching this and not digging these characters or bopping along to the music. Overall, this is good fun for any fan of B movies, musicals, or rock music, a rousing and raucous experience with plenty of humour and pizazz to sustain it. Followed six years later by "Shock Treatment". Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The DVD is a apocalyptic renascence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I happen to have seen the original theatrical show in London in the 1970s before ever discovering the film, on VHS first and then on DVD. This is indispensible to understand the new dimension given to the show on this medium, a filmed show on DVD.The show itself is a myth and the plot is known by heart. Some Extra-Terrestrials came on Earth with their spacecraft in the shape of an old medieval castle that is in fact a laboratory. The master of the place is Dr Frank-N-Furter and he is a re-composition of the never decomposed or decomposing Dr Frankenstein. He studies one emotion known as lust and being an extra-terrestrial he knows no limits.A young couple going on a trip to visit a professor of theirs, Dr Everett V. Scott as a sort of celebration of their engagement have a car breakdown in the night in a fierce storm. They decide to knock at the door of the castle they see and they get into the ET lab. After many incidents, detours and other adventures in this labyrinthine castle, they will both be initiated to sex by and with Dr Frank-N-Furter. But Dr Everett V. Scott arrives in a wheelchair and kind of saves the situation by explaining us and them what it is all about. At this time the main servants of the castle/spacecraft decide to go back to their planet Transylvania leaving behind Dr Frank-N-Furter dead but his creation Rocky Horror runs after his body and takes it away: he is in love with his maker and he is immune against the laser weapons of the ETs.The three humans, Dr Everett V. Scott, Brad Majors and Janet Weiss manage to get out of the castle before take off and end up the show in the mud. Brad concludes that "inside he is still bleeding", Janet that "the beast is still feeding", and the storyteller that "on earth some insects call the human race lost in time, lost in space and the meaning." The show was not erotic but sexy. The film is the same sexy but not erotic. Yet it is a comedy that plays on sexually ambiguous situations, on words tremendously and on all kinds of strange costumes, effects, lightings, music. The proportion of music, singing and dancing is enormous. It is an entertaining story with a slightly titillating content.Now the DVD, which is the film, made and still makes this play a success beyond the theatres where it was performed.Apart from the opening wedding scene the whole film systematically keeps a distance from real cinema. It is not a play per se, far from it, but it is not a film either. It is somewhere in-between the two and that's the interest of the film itself over the play.The first element that is obvious is the filming on location for outside scenes and when it is filmed in a studio the set is that of an extremely vast castle, at least that's what they want us to believe and that vastness is emphasized by the long "travelling" of Dr Everett V. Scott in his wheelchair to come to, or be brought to the laboratory. But there are some other scenes that amplify this vast dimension; The action itself takes place in various rooms and these rooms are big and large enough to entertain a dancing body of twenty people or so. You cannot get that effect on a stage. Including several motorcycles and cars, one motorcycle in the main room of the castle too, running and smoking.The special effects are numerous and all add something to what a stage play would be. Sound and visual effects create the storm and the suspense necessary for the evocation of fear and danger. But there are other special effects that are more subtle and less visible. Yet without them many scenes would be flat. The main visible element in that line is the constantly changing camera shooting angle and probably camera too, and the editing that emphasizes this whirling effect by cutting and pasting small sequences one after the other of the same scene all from different angles. Then you have a lot of smoke, artefacts of all sports, the apparition of a swimming pool where you had not seen it, the falling down of the radio tower of the RKO Radio Picture logo when Rocky Horror and Dr Frank-N-Furter try to climb on it to escape Riff Raff and his sister Magenta, the ET masters of the spacecraft.Of course we must also think of the special effects needed to turn someone who is dressed into an entirely nude stone statue. That is both special effect and editing. And there are many instances present giving to the film a speed that it could not have on a stage and at the same time an intensity of action and peripeteia that would also be difficult on the stage.Finally along that line the use of TV screens to put people under surveillance is possible and frequent in the film because of the close-up shots on them that enable us to see what is on the screen, like for example Brad being sexually served by Dr Frank-N-Furter, which Janet will eventually see on the screen, though after the act itself. The film enables us to see these moments which would have been awkward on the stage, or plainly invisible.The last remarkable element that the DVD and film provides is the storyteller, called in the credits the criminologist, in a private library in a completely different place and atmosphere. That trick is rarely used in films, certainly not that often, at least eight times in the present case. He explains and creates a perspective, which forces us to listen and think a little bit to understand the craziness of the situation.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably the best musical movie that exists and it entirely deserves its cult status. You may adore this movie or hate it because there is not much left in the middle but the sure thing is that you will never forget this film once you have seen it.The crazy, diversified and simply unforgettable characters where each one seems to be at a near equal level even though everyone seems to have a personal favourite (mine is probably Columbia), the catchy songs where one hit hits literally the next, the very creative and surprising scenario which honours many clichs of the horror and science-fiction genre and the different actions that have to be done during certain scenes of the movie have all contributed to the fact that this movie has become a masterpiece that has still a big group of fans and followers nowadays and has been presented as a musical in many countries. I have seen the musical as it came into my hometown when I was ten years old and I will never forget it. This is the perfect movie to get together with friends and have a good time, to sing, drink and laugh along no matter to which generation you belong as this movie seems to connect them all.To keep it short, anyone who likes the cinema and music in general should have seen this movie at least once in his lifetime as it would take too much place and would effectively never really work to describe this flick about transvestites in a few words because there is such a high amount of sex, drugs, rock'n'roll, love, passion, horror, drama and slapstick in this masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Almost unbelievably, I first saw this movie in around 1976 on a double feature with of all things George Harrison's "Concert For Bangla Desh" movie, which as a young Beatles fan was the main attraction (and second feature on the bill). I thus had to sit through "T.R.H.P.S." and had absolutely no idea about its content or otherwise. It's fair to say, I was about as shocked as Brad and Janet at the castle by what I saw...Looked at now, it actually still has the power to shock, which of course was no doubt the point. It's one thing to parody 50's science fiction B-movies, listed at length in the title sequence song, but it certainly takes Tim Curry in a Basque and suspenders to drive the point home.For me, the movie does sag in the middle as the songs get a little weaker, after the triple whammy of "Damn it Janet", "Sweet Transvestite" and of course "The Time Warp" but there's still some funny, if naturally, smutty humour en route particularly when Dr Furter "does the double" on Brad and Janet. There are numerous nods to other classic movies including of course "Frankenstein" but also Busby Berkeley musicals, "Sunset Boulevard" and climaxing on "King Kong" before the movie remembers it's primarily a sci-spoof with its alien abduction ending.As for the actors, everyone enters into the spirit, hot on the heels, literally, of Curry's example. The lip-sync-hing is sometimes clumsy, the settings occasionally too studio-bound and the music not always inspired, but where else would you get to see as much of Susan Sarandon in her underwear as Tim Robbins on a good night, Meatloaf served up as, litearlly meatloaf, an elderly wheelchair-bound scientist in suspenders giving it, well, low kicks and Charles Gray exhorting us to give it some pelvic thrust (they should have got him into drag mode too - a major mistake!!!).Let's do the time warp again, once more with feeling...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thirty five years in limited release and still shown in midnight theaters throughout the United States, its The Rocky Horror Picture Show. It was unknown and neglected when in theaters in 1975. But now cherished, loved, and welcomed by a heap of cult and film fanatics around the globe. It's now being sung and danced to in the theaters by people dressed and resembling the characters in the movie, like Tim Curry's famous role of Dr. Frank-N-Furter. I was lucky enough to see it with a close filmmaker friend, Brian Patrick O'Toole (screenwriter for film Atlas Shrugged and producer for Dog Soldiers) who basically made comments and remarks throughout the film. Hes seen the film over 200 times and has to be the biggest fan I know. I've caught his disease.A criminologist tells the story of a newly engaged couple by the names of Brad Majors and Janet Weiss who become lost with a flat tire on a rainy night. They find a castle, asking for help, but are soon victims of Dr. Frank-N-Furter, a "sweet transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania" who's minions are his sister Magenta, servant Riff Raff, and a fan named Columbia. Numerous twists and turns go along with this film, but the fun comes from the enjoyment had by the musical numbers and bizarre acting. I had fun just dancing to the great fabulous score and just loved Brian's quotes.This shows you how big movies can be, even when ignored. This movie has made $139.8 million dollars and probably didn't even make $20,000 back in 1975. This is true beauty film-making, even with a weird premise. This is a movie that I can say, I have never seen as many soundtracks for. There's the original, the Say it! Karaoke CD, the audience participation CD, the re-release CD, the instrumental, etc. DVDs are a little less. The 25th anniversary tape in 1990, the new DVD, and a future Blu-Ray this year. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a sequel....well there is.The sequel is called Shock Treatment that was released in 1981. It wasn't a strong sequel from what I hear. Tim Curry originally planned to cast in it, singing all the songs written for him, but refused last minute, and then the singers were replaced and they got new ones. It only made $2 million dollars which is dirt compared to the money the first film made. It even performed worse than RHPS's first run which is hysterical because it seemed if anything, Shock Treatment's gross would have been larger than biblical proportions compared to RHPS. But, it flopped, miserably, end of story.Now to be fair, critics hate this movie, and my parents aren't to fond of it. But this is the ultimate test. If you can sit through this film, hating it, and still having the nerve to shut it off or walk out, but make it through, that proves you can make it through any film. But I for one enjoyed the film and hope MTV Films reconsiders with the remake.A remake of The Neverending Story is also in the works, and though I haven't seen it, I heard its a flawless film. Same goes with RHPS, remakes never do the goal they should, make the original film better. No remake is better than the original, except for maybe Scarface. But 99% of the time, remakes fail. So since The Rocky Horror Picture Show is such an overwhelming success, MTV Films thinks they can get a piece of the pie by making a remake of it. News to MTV Films: It may draw money, but not like the original. It will not be attended, by true fans. But by far, it will not be shown at midnight showings every Saturday and be attended by die hard fans dressed in almost identical apparel to the actors on screen. That will be in store and exclusively for the 1975 film.Starring: Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon, Barry Bostwick, Richard O'Brien, Patricia Quinn, Meat Loaf, and Nell Campbell.

		<shortDescription>A must-see camp classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Love it or hate it this film is a classic which surprisingly doesn't seem dated, presumably this is because the props and special effects always looked a bit ropey... deliberately so I'm sure.The film opens with Brad proposing to his girlfriend Janet after a friends' wedding, the two of then decide they must go and give the news to their friend Dr Scott in who's class they had first met. On the way they have a puncture and are forced to go to a nearby castle to use the telephone. It is soon clear that something is going on here, there is a strange gathering with an even stranger host in the form of Dr. Frank-N-Furter... played by Tim Curry in over the top form wearing a costume which must be seen to be believed. After the introductions he invites Brad and Janet up to his lab to witness the birth of his creation Rocky; a blond muscle-man wearing skimpy gold underwear. Things get a bit gruesome when a motorcycle riding Eddie, played by Meatloaf, bursts out of a vault singing a song... Frank is not happy about having his moment interrupted kills him with a pick-axe. This doesn't seem to bother people too much and soon the guests have departed and Brad and Janet have retired to separate bedrooms. Once in bed Frank sneaks into each room in turn and proceeds to seduce our previously innocent heroes. Janet doesn't stop there, she goes out and has her way with Rocky. The plot thickens when Dr Scott turns up looking for his nephew Eddie, Frank assumes that Brad and Janet must be spying for Dr Scott. After a rather uncomfortable meal he immobilises them and forces them to take part in a strange floor show. After which underlings Magenta and Riff-Raff announce that they have had enough of Frank's excesses and are going to return to their home planet.While the plot isn't that great it is still a fantastic film due to the wonderfully over the top characters and the memorable songs. The actors did a great job, Susan Sarandon had a great singing voice and looked great wearing little more than plain white underwear for much of the film; she managed to look innocent and incredibly sexy at the same time. Tim Curry's Frank never looked or sounded innocent everything he said and did oozed with decadence and sexuality. Comment must also be made about Richard O'Brien who not only did well as Riff-Raff wrote the original play on which the film is based.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1972,Richard O'Brien wrote a play (then)titled 'They Came From Denton'. This title was later changed to 'The Rock Horror Show',then once again changed to 'The Rocky Horror Show',and wowed them at the Theater Upstairs,in London's east end. The play was brought to the attention of Lou Adler,one of the producers of the Monterey Pop Festival of 1967,who wanted to bring this wild-assed play to America. The play &amp; (most of)original cast was brought to Los Angelas,where it became a hit. Two years later,the play was turned into a movie (guess the title),where it royally bombed,big time. Within three years,it became a midnight cult hit,packing cinemas for years to come. It's easy to see what would bring most young people to the cinema on a Saturday night. The Rocky Horror Picture Show,directed by Jim Sharman, with a screenplay by Sharman &amp; O'Brien is a satire on cheesy,low budget horror &amp; science fiction movies,old school rock &amp; roll,sexual abandon,and other diverse elements that make for a fever dream of a romp that will delight some &amp; turn others off. The cast is mostly (for that time,anyway)made up of relative unknowns (Tim Curry is Dr. Frank 'n'Furter--a mad scientist,Susan Sarandon,Barry Bostwick--an engaged couple,right out of 1950's Eisenhower Americana,Richard O'Brien,as Frank's assistant,Riff Raff,Pat Quinn,as Riff's weird sister,Magenta,Little Nell,as a groupie,Columbia,and Peter Hinwood,as the aforementioned,Rocky Horror,as well as a host of others,just as demented).The plot:when newly engaged couple,Brad Majors (Bostwick)&amp; Janet Weiss (Sarandon)are en route to visit an old friend,they experience car problems,prompting them to seek help at a creepy old mansion,which is the abode of Dr.Frank 'N' Furter (Curry),and his weird band of crazies. After dealing with an evening of debauchery,as only Frank &amp; company can delver,their lives are forever changed. This is a movie/experience that is intended for audience participation (the audience at the proper cues,tosses rice,water,toast,etc &amp; shouts out a series of "cat calls",mostly all of which are down right funny,and most of them are pretty vulgar &amp; crude). At some screenings,audience members are known to dress up as their favourite characters in the film,and at most screenings,there is a shadow cast acting out the film as it is being screened,just to add to the deranged fun on screen. The Rocky Horror Picture Show is guaranteed for an evening of fun &amp; outrage (the good kind,of course). Rated 'R' by the MPAA,for some strong sexual content,violence,drug related material &amp; brief strong language. Not for the little ones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I think of musicals, I immediately think of 'Grease': a romantic, progressive, light-hearted comedy that explains itself in one screening. Not that 'Grease' isn't bad, however. But, this film definitely redefines the "musical" category! Tim Curry was sensational! How could you not give credit to such a hilarious (and certainly brave) actor like him? His performance was so sweet and funny that it's impossible not to like him, despite his character's dirty and sensual antics :) His transvestite performance was truly memorable. Susan Sarandon, who in my opinion isn't a bad actress, performed her role admirably as well. What really sold the movie, and made it truly enjoyable however, were Patricia Quinn and Richard O'Brien (forgive my spelling). Who better to play the crazy yet creepy Riff-Raff than the Rocky Horror creator himself! A wonderful touch, Mr. O'Brien! Patricia Quinn was an awesome Magenta, so creepy, yet sensational and wacky. She portrayed every kind of emotion imaginable for her character, from flirty to disgusted, and annoyed to outgoing. Those two have to be my favorite characters!The music was great! I was singing "The Time Warp" for seven days afterward! It's one of the only musical numbers that actually teaches you the dance while you enjoy it (believe me, being in a musical is not as easy as it looks)! The Transylvanians were awesome! "Hot Patootie" (sung by the cool Meatloaf) was sweet and sexy, and a great song to sing to! I will definitely go to future midnight screenings. Though its also good to own this musical masterpiece on DVD, as a previous member noted the rowdiness of audiences at midnight screenings. Mr. O'Brien, you have truly changed musicals forever! For those of you who HAVEN'T seen this movie yet:"Come up to the lab, and see what's on the slab."8/10 sweet transvestites! We WILL return to sweet Transylvania.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something in there for everyone....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a movie that's 33 years old, it's still being talked about. Which is still quite good for a movie that was branded a failure upon it's release. But I believe it was the midnight screenings that help make the movie what it is today(and a HUGE thank you to Sal. For all you fans, if y'all don't know about Sal, you are not a fan). While not everyone is aware of what goes on in movie theaters on a Saturday night, there is always at least one Rocky fan in the crowd. But let's shift it towards the film itself. The story is pretty simple. A happy go lucky couple get stuck in the middle of nowhere and find shelter in a environment that is different from their own. Soon they are wrapped up in this world and can't help but shed their former skins and give in to absolute pleasure. At the end of the film, they find themselves not knowing what happened or what to do or where to go(and it was genius of Richard O'Brien to leave it at that). Now it seems normal to toss rice, do the pelvic thrust and to deal cards for sorrow and cards of pain but when watching the film in the privacy of your own home, you realize that the film itself is quite innocent and that although we root for Frank and his crew, we also feel just as innocent as Brad and Janet themselves. Over the years it has shifted a way that films are seen. Any Rocky fan today can't help but go to a regular movie and wanting to shout at the screen, but unlike Rocky, we know that if we yell(often and loudly) we will get tossed out. But enough about my comments, it's time to slip into something less vulnerable and kick on a pair of stilettos and do the time warp. But all of this has me wondering, "whatever happened to Saturday Night?" (My screen name should tell you how much of a fan I am, as sad as that is.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most people know this as the ultimate cult classic, which is a good thing to be, but even many fans will downplay the movie itself.That's a shame, because this is an excellent movie on it's own merit.First, it is a musical, so the law of reality goes out the window, and the law of reality does go out the window! We've got a musical comedy with the zaniness of Monty Python or the Marx Brothers.The plot is more about the characters than about the story. Brad and Janice are two all American innocents who happen upon the depraved antics of the castle of Dr. Frankenfurter and his crew.In the beginning, the characters are all stereotypes, but the movie molds them into fascinating three dimensional characters, one sign of great writing. You'll actually care about these people.The songs are outstanding. There is a perfect mix of lively songs, thoughtful songs, and some that are just beautiful.There is too much to this movie to talk about in a critique. It is nonstop action, which darts from scene to scene abruptly. It is high on emotion, high in music, and high in excitement.</fullReview>

Could be consider a horror movie but not the typical movie with blood and screams. It has definitely a lot o...(read more)f 70's influence with lots of color. The story is so great, interesting and original. A couple get lost after their car broke down, they arrive to a mysterious house where a transvestite and his servants live, in there they experience a lot of weird adventures. The cast is simply wonderful, Tim Curry in the role of Frank N. Furter is really flawless, his performance is astonishing. Susan Sarandon an Janet Weiss besides she looks really gorgeous delivers an amazing performance. the supporting roles of Meat Loaf (Eddie), Nell Campbell (Columbia), Patricia Quinn (MAgenta) and Richard O'Brien (Riff Raff) were excellent. A great direction job from Jim Sharman, he delivers a very good rhythm to the movie. The soundtrack of the movie is simply awesome, one of the best music I've ever heard. This is a 70's classic but it remains thru the ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected a lot from "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" because it is such a huge cult-favorite of my friends. They are those type of huge fans who go to screenings all dressed up like drag-queens, singing along with the songs and waving around cigarette lighters. I guess that is part of the problem, that I expected too much out of it. I was just disappointed. Some of the songs were really catchy. It really is almost impossible not to start swinging yourself when the legendary songs such as "The Time Warp" and "Touch Me" are being sung by the vivid cast. Something tells me I would have liked it more if I either saw the play first or the movie on my own instead of going to see it with such a huge group of screaming super fans, to be honest they kind of ruined it for me and drowned out a lot of what I suspect to be the best parts. But I didn't get a lot of it, it seemed too weird for me and some parts really creeped me out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What hasn't been said (or for that matter,written) about RHPS in the last thirty odd years now? The film has been the mother of all midnight cult flicks (although by no means the first midnight flick) to draw a steady audience of freaks that like to dress up like the characters in the film, throw stuff &amp; yell crude &amp; vulgar things at the screen. It's all about good clean dirty fun. The film's plot lifts elements from old school rock &amp; roll, low (no) budget science fiction &amp; horror flicks (especially some of the cheesier ones from the 1940's thru the 1960's),and loads of pop culture references to make this a delightful fever dream of proto sexual abandon. Get a bunch of like minded friends together, get dressed up as your favourite character in the film,gather audience participation props &amp; don't dream it---BE IT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only way to do this film justice is to see a midnight showing !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have surprised even myself by rating this film a ten. It is really a god awful film if the truth be known. But after it initially bombed at the box office, some college students figured out how to make it fun, and thus the greatest cult film of all time was born. At that time Charles Gray was the only established actor to be seen in the film, but out of it careers would take off for Tim Curry, Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon. Over the years a whole experience called the Rocky Horror show has built up around it, with amateur actors in theatres acting out the characters on the screen while the movie is shown behind them. I actually had a chance to play Eddie (The Meatloaf part) for part of one summer when the original guy in our area broke his leg. This film is just a bit naughty and a lot of fun. Not for children, however. Again to experience it at it's best go to the theatre and be a part of the happening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching the trailer of The Rocky Horror Picture Show and you may think it looks weird, but this is something completely different which has never been seen before.The characters are amazing from everyone including Eddie (Meatloaf), Riff Raff (Richard O'Brien) and Frank 'n' Furter (Tim Curry). Their costumes have been carefully designed and created. The costumes aren't the only eye catching items, but also the set pieces.The songs are a mixed bag. There are some songs which aren't too fantastic and really seem to drag on, but there are some real gems. 'Time Warp' and 'Sweet Transvestite' are two of the best songs.There's a basic plot story which isn't too hard to understand and anyone could follow it along easily.If you love the weird and wonderful, watch this. If you don't, still give it a try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A line from the trailer says it best..."You've seen all kinds of movies, but you've never seen a movie like The Rocky Horror Picture Show".Some say it's impossible to enjoy this movie without the audience participation. I disagree. The performances, the music, the costumes, and the dead-on parodies of various horror/sci fi movie clichs are perfectly enjoyable on their own...but, of course, the film lends itself to collective experience in a way none others have before, or since.All the performers seem to have a sixth sense about how to play their roles - no small feat considering the rather offbeat material - but for me, it's all about Tim Curry. With the wrong actor playing Frank, the film would have crashed and burned (actually, with the wrong actor playing Frank, the original play would never have had a life past its initial run in London's Theatre Upstairs). He became a true film icon with this role, and it's easy to understand why. His performance is a delicate balancing act - feminine flounce with masculine power; outrageous but always controlled. His Frank is gorgeous and unbelievably sexy, with a voice from the gods - both speaking and singing.I think it's time to do the Time Warp again...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rocky Horror Picture Show is one of those fantastic films that everyone just has to see. Once you have seen it you will never forget it. This has been my favorite film for many years and every time I watch it it is like I'm watching it for the first time again. It never gets old and it is hardly on t.v so it isn't over played. It. has a fantastic cast, great music and a wacky and wonderful plot. Films like this are few and far between. I don't want to say much about it because I don't want to spoil it for you. One thing I stress is that the first time you see it you should rent it and not go see it in an interactive theater just yet. This way you can put your full attention to the movie. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the fact that this film was made 10 years before i was even born, i have to say how much i enjoyed it. Its just a fantastic send up to all those B-movies. Having it playing in my house for as long as i can remember i can't help but love it. The songs are catchy, a bit of 70's rock n roll that the cast sing perfectly. I mean who doesn't know the time warp even if they haven't seen the film? Having seen the live show a few years ago, i have to say that this film must have one of the most devoted followings ever. There's nothing quite like seeing a six foot tall man dressed in a black corset, red leather hot pants, fishnet stockings and giant red shiny platforms to really show you how much the film is loved.My favourite character is Magenta, but Brad, Janet, Frank, Rocky, Columbia and of course Richard O'Brien's Riff Raff are all fantastic to watch and the wry humour and sexual innuendo are perfectly timed by all of the actors.Although i'm going to enjoy seeing the live show again in a few weeks, there is just no beating the film. So grab a copy, open your mind a little and give yourself over to absolute pleasure!!!!</fullReview>

It has a great mixture of catchy songs and a surreal storyline. The cast are excellent especially Tim Curry who fits into the character so well. It also shows that a great film doesn't need a big budget at all! When I first watched this film I did get quite freaked out, so don't worry if that happens to you the first time. It is very strange and is best not to compare it to any other films or have any expectations - it is in a whole different category! And a meaning? The whole Rocky Horror philosophy is really to be who you want to be ignoring the social stereotypes whilst having fun - Don't Dream It, Be It!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bizarre, strange, other-worldly. There's really no way to explain the movie, but it has kick-ass music at least! This is a movie that everyone should find time to watch at least twice at some point in their lives. I had watched it before, but had not extracted nearly as much amusement out of it the first time as I did the second. It's over-the-top, and totally silly, but that's what makes the movie fun. The whole idea of using loose genders, and having all sorts of "gender bending" antics just can't be anything else.As said, the music is top-notch, as is the choreography. It shows that this was a Broadway show before it became a cult film musical. Some of the lines that are used within the music, and even the beats, are just catchy and have translated well into the film 2006 film realm. This film could take the likes of modern musicals like Chicago and The Phantom of the Opera any day.The acting performances are all great in their own little way, even if everyone is shown up by Tim Curry, who spends most of the film wearing female clothing. It is amusing even more so to see Susan Surandon and Barry Boswick's acting well before their time.If there is anything I can say against it, it's the fact that not much happens in the middle of the film, and before you know it, it kinda just fizzles right out. In that way, it just seems like someone came up with such a brilliantly bizarre idea, and just didn't know how to keep it going until its conclusion.But that's just a small quip in an otherwise excellent film with cult written all over it. I just only wish I could see it with a live audience. Now why hasn't the soundtrack come in for me yet?8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can see why people rave over this movie, it's one of those movies that is really bizarre but because of that people are attracted to it. "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" is about a newly (very newly) engaged couple, Brad (Barry Bostwick) and Janet (Susan Sarandon) whose car breaks down at night in the middle of the woods after their friend's wedding. They walk up the road to a castle that is home to Dr. Frank- N - Furter (Tim Curry), a transvestite from the planet Transsexual (very strange, I know), who has created a human being. Based on a play, "Rocky Horror" is a thoroughly strange but highly entertaining little slice of cinema history. The entire plot is ridiculously unbelievable, but the fantasy land that is created makes this irrelevant. The sets are strange but fitting, and the movie is very atmospheric. It's not a movie you are supposed to take seriously. The music is probably the most memorable thing about this movie though, after watching it a few times you'll likely remember every song word-for-word. Good acting is present as well from Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick, and Tim Curry as the flamboyant Dr. Frank-N-Furter.Bottom line is, you should enjoy this movie because of all of it's catchy songs and bizarre events that take place. It has a lot of random but funny scenes and I can see why it has become such a classic- because of how off the wall it really is. Some find it stupid, others find it enjoyable. Either way, don't take this movie seriously, have fun with it, and you should enjoy it. "Let's do the time warp again!" 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, though very uneven, cult classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS**Enough has been written about the cult phenomenon (of which I was a part while in college) surrounding this movie that one tends to forget the movie that started it all.THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW is an immensely entertaining, funny, sexy and sometimes even creepy little piece of cinematic weirdness. It works well even when watched without a cast mimicking the actions onscreen or the audience yelling back at the screen (though that's a lot of fun as well).Of course, it has it's faults. The editing is rather poor, with several sequences sloppily put together that are saved only by the music and the enthusiasm of the performers in the scene. Peter Suschitzky's kinetic photography also adds some spunk. It is unclear whether the numerous continuity errors and glimpses of the crew in the frame are actual mistakes or intentional in-jokes.Another major flaw is the perplexingly downbeat finale. In the play, Frank-N-Furter and Columbia's death is funny, because Frank doesn't believe that Riff Raff will really do it, and Columbia makes a poor decision to step in front of Frank to block him. When Riff Raff unceremoniously kills them and they drop dead simultaneously, it's shocking, but funny. In the movie, the scene is played so straight that it becomes depressing and kind of ruins the fun of the movie.I also prefer this movie without the song "Super Heroes" for much the same reason. Again, in the play, it's so campy and over-the-top that it's funny, but here, it's just sort of disturbing.But those are just a few problems in an otherwise terrific gem of a movie. The performances are all great, though Tim Curry, Little Nell and Meat Loaf are the obvious highlights. I recommend that you see this movie without the audience participation part before going to a theater at Midnight to see it. Despite all its flaws, it will always be one of my all time favorite movies, as much for the movie itself, as for the nostalgic place it has in my heart for giving me two years of fun and lifelong friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here I am, fresh out of high school in Toledo, Ohio, and already an unabashed movie nut. Then one day I hear a radio commercial for a film that combines Rock and Roll, Horror, and Sci-Fi into the film to end all films. Strange, it only shows at midnight, but why not?The costumes outside didn't tip me off, after all, it was midnight. But the NOISE! Didn't anyone come to watch the movie? I mean, nobody in it was anybody yet, but even then you could see that Susan Sarandon had something. In fact you could see exactly what she had, and that ain't bad.Then, with just a jump to the left, it hit me. This wasn't a movie. It was a phenomenon, and I wanted to be a part of it. In the countless midnights afterward when I left behind my real life, and bonded with a rolling crowd of strangers being their real selves, this movie etched itself in my psyche. Oh yeah, the movie. It's about some aliens who conduct experiments on Earth, and throw wild parties to celebrate their work. Yadda yadda yadda. Meatloaf does a great sax number! Sarandon and Barry Bostwick look great in their underwear, and Richard O'Brien, who wrote this masterpiece, is magnificent as the henchman.Most people have a hard time taking this movies seriously, but consider a few facts. Sarandon has been nominated for four academy awards, and won Best Actress for Dead Man Walking. Tim Curry is one of the most sought after voice talents in the business. Peter Robb-King, the film's makeup artist, is the exclusive makeup man for nearly every major film with Sean Connery (Entrapment, The Rock) Harrison Ford (Star Wars, Indiana Jones) not to mention Tommy, Aliens, The Princess Bride and Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Ian Whittaker, set decorator, also gave us Sense and Sensibility, Anna and the King and Remains of the Day. And cinematographer Peter Suschitzky filmed The Empire Strikes Back, Immortal Beloved, Red Planet, Man in the Iron Mask, Mars Attacks! and Naked Lunch. Many alumni from this historic work went on to greatness. Others, like Peter Hinwood have disavowed the film entirely. But the greatness of this film transcends it contributors. It is timeless and wonderous, and a tribute to the accumulated genius that made it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So lousy it blew my mind.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a certain charm to this movie but it's redeeming value is lost on me. Granted, it was a spoof on 1950's musicals and the songs were catchy, however, the heavy duty homosexual overtones didn't fly with me. This film spawned a huge cult following in the 1970's (back when midnight movies were in vogue') which continued until about 1988 or so. People of all ages would get up on stage and in costume act out the movie. I never went to one of these, however, I can only imagine what one of these showings was like. I recently saw it on tv and my mind was blown...I can't believe that these guys put all this on film. The one thing I did enjoy was seeing SUSAN SARANDON in her underwear...what can I say. I don't know if I will ever watch this again....but it was worth it to see it once. With all the refrences to it I've seen or read, it was good to finally know what all the "hub bub" was about....not much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's a reason why this movie is so popular and it's not the movie itself...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rocky Horror Picture show movie is terrible. That's what I'm rating, the movie itself. The reason this movie happens to be so popular is because at the theaters where it is shown, people have fun making fun of it. At the midnight showings, not only do patrons dress up, they bring props. (rice, cigarette lighters, newspapers, etc.)and they dance, sing along and laugh at it. I have yet to meet a fan of this movie who actually likes the movie itself; most of the fans of it I've met only like it because of the theater activities that go along with it, which are apparently very fun and exciting and I wouldn't mind going to see sometime.The movie itself is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Tim Curry was sort of funny but that's about it. Usually I'm a big fan of 1970's movies (I loved Hair, Go Ask Alice, I Drink Your Blood and Harold &amp; Maude), but this movie just went too far. It was weird, not in a cool way but in an annoying way. And I realize it's a musical, but it's so annoying when the characters have to randomly burst into song for no apparent reason. The Time Warp song was pretty good, though. Anyway, maybe there's something I missed about this movie that makes people love it so much, but I just don't get it. It just seemed to be a really perverted movie just for the hell of it. I'd probably appreciate it more if I saw it in a theater but I don't recommend watching it on just a television or computer screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An acquired taste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My ex dragged me along to a cinema showing of this three years ago, where the audience largely sit in fancy dress and an MC gave out prizes in the intermission for the best dressed characters. For those who haven't seen it, Rocky Horror is a story about a couple whose car break down outside a mansion and ask for help, only to be drawn into the weird world of Frank N Furter and his friends.Rocky Horror works OK as a musical for students to perform in fancy dress, but as a film I wasn't struck. Yes Timewarp is an excellent party song, Tim Curry as ever was on top form as the transvestite Frank N Furter, Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick were good as the newlyweds Janet and Brad, and the scene where Eddie the servant( played quite well by a young Meatloaf) is eaten at a banquet is quite amusing. Also good is Charles Gray as the narrator, although seemingly committed fans of the film start chanting abuse whenever he appears.However, Rocky Horror to me was just one long, dull exercise in camp and shock horror that while quite daring 40 years ago, just looks dull and dated now. I suppose you have to be like my ex, a fan for decades, and an enthusiast, but this is one film I didn't get and has always divided opinion. I'm afraid to say it has some good points, but isn't a film I'd watch again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Bad It's Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Rocky Horror Picture Show' is a cult classic that revolves around Janet and Brad who stumble upon a very unusual group of people.The acting in this musical is overall very good; a lot of actors pretend to be bad at acting at some points but just for comic effect. Tim Curry is fantastic here and it's no surprise his career took off so well after this. Susan Sarandon is a little bit disappointing and doesn't really provide any comedy. A lot of performers come straight from the musical and you can tell they have a great time doing this show.The story might be the most confusing, pointless, manic story ever but it still works somehow. You still enjoy watching it and there's never a moment where you are bored. Overall, this is a great film. There are a lot of points where it's too random to even bother to try and understand but it's still enjoyable. It's so bad it's good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cult Classic Comedy Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975): Starring Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon, Barry Bostwick, Richard O'Brien, Charles Gray, Patricia Quinn, Nell Campbell, Meatloaf, Peter Hinwood, Jonathan Adams, Jeremy Newson...Director Jim Sharman, Screenplay Richard O'Brien, Based On The Stage Musical/Music and Lyrics Richard O'Brien. Produced By Lou Adler, Michael Whiet and John Goldstone, Cinematography Peter Suschitzky, Costume Design By Sue Blane Since 1975, The Rocky Horror Pictures Show has delighted audiences during its long run of midnight movie showings and it has a high place among cult classic films. Outwardly, it's a hilarious, campy, nutty homage to sci fi movies and horror movies pre-1970's (RKO films like King Kong are spoofed, Frankenstein, Dracula, and 50's aliens from outer space movies). But its inner magic comes from the no hold-bars liberal spirit which belonged to the 1970's, a time of gay pride, open sexuality, vulgarity, craziness and overall non-conformity. The film showed an openly bisexual transvestite as its lead character. The movie was released after the success of the stage musical in London by Richard O'Brien who did the music and lyrics (and starred in the film version as Riff Raff). O'Brien followed the success of Rocky Horror with a less successful sequel "Shock Treatment" in 1982.Plot: Brad Majors (Bostwick) and Janet Weiss (Sarandon) have just gotten engaged after attending a friend's wedding in the old-fashioned, 1950's like town of Denton, USA. During a rainstorm, their car breaks down and they enter an old castle to call for roadside assistance. Here, they immediately become the new prisoners and playthings for its decadent and wild master, the scientist/vampire Frank'N'Furter (Curry). After a Transylvanian party, Frank'N'Furter invites his new guests to witness his latest creation- a muscular blonde man named Rocky (Hinwood) whom he later marries. But Frank'N'Furter's crazy sexual cravings soon includes both Brad and Janet, whose morals are corrupted. Not used to the craziness of the castle, they soon become victims. Before long, it becomes necessary for wheelchair-bound Dr. Scott (Adams)to save them. Wo are Frank'N'Furter and his servants Riff-Raff and Magenta? Ghouls ? Aliens ? What devilish plan has Frank'N'Furter formed ? Tim Curry's performance as the transvestite castle master is sheer comic brilliance. With his powerful rock star voice and over the top personality, he shines in such scenes/songs as "Sweet Transvestite" and "I Can Make You A Man". Other numbers include an homage to rock music "Hot Patoo-tie" by Meatloaf as a psychotic motorcycle rider. There's the famous dance number "Time Warp" and more moving and artful songs "Science Fiction Double Feature" which opens the film and "Over At The Frankenstein's Plac" and the sad concluding songs "I'm Going Home" and "Super Heroes". Nelle Campelle "Little Nelle" is delightful as his groupie Columbia and Patricia Quinn is exotic as the Transylvanian maid Magenta. The cinematography by Sushutzky is meant to resemble the Hammer studios/Eastman color horror movies with its depiction of haunted houses. There is never a dull moment in this highly entertaining 2 hour film. But keep in mind, this movie has always been an adult movie, not so much because it includes partial nudity, but because it deals with the themes of bisexuality, transvestite lifestyle and jokes that adults could understand but are lost to minors. Also, the age of this film shows when compared to comedies of today. It's a classic that is still beloved by many who still flock to midnight showings.</fullReview>

But after a while, scenes from the movie started to pop up in my head, I just HAD to see it again, and then I was hooked.My mind is blown away by this movie! Great songs, great dancing, great acting, great lines and great humor. It has everything and more. Tim Curry makes, what must be, his best part ever and Richard O'Brian has to get a BIG thank you for the writing of the script and the songs.It is a very bold movie for it's time with a lot of jokes about sex for example. I have to warn you about that this movie is very, well, special. For me that is what makes it so good, that it's totally strange.This is one of many movies you have to see!</fullReview>

There's no beating about the bush...when it comes to pace of the movie. You empathise with the characters and enjoy being shocked and tantalised by the down right filthiness of Frank. I cannot speak higher about this film. It rightfully has a high following of fans and has reach cult status for a reason. Because it's great! If you don't love it already, learn to love it!

		<shortDescription>hot patootie, bless my soul, i really love that rock and roll.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ah, possibly my most favorite film of all time. like others have said, you either get this film, or you don't. and the key is to suspend disbelief. this is not a film for the overly logical. its full of little blunders, intentional or not. the film has an energy unlike any other films i have seen. i reckon the devotion rocky horror inspires is due to that it offers a way for people who are a bit left of center to really come out and just be decadent and sexual for a night. in this day and age especially, such nights are few and far between. it creates an environment for those who want to sing and dance and to genderbend without reproach. they can put their masks or makeup on and do the time warp into the night. this film is just a fun, freakish romp through 50s B horror and sci fi films with a rock and roll edge. imo, rocky horror is what rock and roll is supposed to be: shocking to your parents and rebells against the uptight squares. i adore this film because frankly, it makes me happy. it gives me a sense of confidence i wouldn't otherwise have. the songs are amazing, and i really enjoy the cheekiness of the entire film. its definitely NOT a film they could have made in the states. it would have been weird and sort of awkward.this film came out 4 years before i was born. i actually hated it when i saw it as a teenager at a friends house. i didn't understand it. i ended up seeing it again around halloween about 6 years ago when i first got cable, it just clicked. this film just makes me really happy in a way a lot of things don't. the music is solid, the acting is sublime, and its just pure campy fun. i like both seeing it in the theatre with the cast and at home on my own. so just hitch up your fishnets, put on your heels, and dance to the dark refrain that is rocky horror picture show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a kid I always wondered what was th big deal about this film. I know people went to see it in movie theaters late at night and acted it out while the action on screen played. I knew it was a little strange. I had no idea though. If you watch it once you can forget it. You have to see it multiple times to really get into it. It's not for the squeamish or those who like chick-slicks. For get it. This is hardcore camp and ironic fun. I love SciFi and music so I love the blend of the old fashioned science fiction with the old musical style soundtrack. You can listen to the soundtrack first and then watch the movie to enjoy it better. Also what can I say, it was the seventies and could only have come from the punk, alternative, dark, depression that overcame America at the time. Tim Curry is fantastic as Dr. Frank-N-Furter and Susan Surandon looks pretty hot in this roll. Barry Boswick was brilliantly understated and confused. Loved it all. Although it's campy I found it to be very layered as well with the sexuality, lyrics and madness. It was a movie that didn't take itself too seriously because it was all for fun but at the same time said something about the time it was made. Also who can forget Meatloaf on a Motorcycle! It's horror, it's science fiction, it's a love story, it's a social commentary, it's a musical! It's cult! Just go out and see it and hang-up your hang-ups at the door.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rocky Horror is an excellent movie. But to really appreciate it you need to see it live at a midnight show with lots of other veteran Rocky Horror Fans. To really appreciate this movie you need the audience interaction that you can only get with fans who have scene this movie 50-100 times and know what to do and when to do it. Too bad they don't really allow the audience participation they had when I first saw this in the 70s.When I first saw it was at midnight shows and the key to really enjoying it was the audience participation where they act out whole parts of the movie, throw stuff at the screen, and have lots of the movie lines memorized. When you saw it live a big part of the movie was the live audience. Only after you experience the audience participation can you really appreciate this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to see this film in a test audience WAY back when it was first released...I loved it then and I love it now.I knew that it was a filmed version of a stage play and that made it all the more fascinating; simply because filming something that has been on the stage and making it work is always a challenge and is very rarely successful... but it certainly worked this time.No one knew who Susan Sarandon or Barry Bostwick were; now of course they are both major forces in film and television.I wonder if now they are embarrassed by this small but important film.Even to this day, when I hear or see "Rocky" I am impelled to get up and dance or sing along with the film -- something that did not happen when I first viewed it. But shortly after my first viewing -- when it was still a fairly unknown film -- people started reacting to what they saw on the screen...The first hint that this was a very special film came when a woman in the audience clicked finger cymbals together at an entirely appropriate moment -- I was enchanted and amazed -- this was audience participation on a level I had never experienced before.As time went one -- as it seems to do -- audience participation grew and grew; until what was happening in front of the screen was as important was what was actually on the screen.This is probably the first film where audience participation grew to be as important as the film itself.I must admit that I do miss the quiet nights where a person could sit in the dark and just watch an amazing film without someone with a squirt gun or toast or cards is compelled to 'add' to an already brilliant film.See this one at home and be amazed -- then see it in a public venue and be even more amazed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this back in the 70's. It had Rocky and Horror in the title and that was good enough for me and my biker mates. We hadn't a clue what it was about when we went into the cinema.Needless to say we were pretty much astounded by it all. I've never seen the stage show or done the dancing or dressing up but I'd never argue with anyone who said that it was one of the best musical movie experiences ever.I'm sure it is not as jaw dropping for audiences now as it was back then, but every time I've seen it over the last 30 years it has left me with a smile on my face a tune bouncing around inside my head.In it's day it was fun, shocking, exciting and innovative. Today it still has an edge that I guess makes some people uneasy. Some guys just can't handle finding Tim Curry ever so slightly appealing when he first appears in the lift. No mate you are not gay!I've got the soundtrack but it really needs the visuals to make the songs shine. It's great that the shows have become such events.A musical movie gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It doesn't happen often that a movie has something going for it that the original stage production lacks, but with a few exceptions (one e.g. is the Charles Atlas song), the screenplay beats the stage script. You don't get Tim Curry in the (sigh) flesh, but even on celluloid, he's raw sex, whether you're male, female, gay, or straight. I've probably seen the movie 50 or more times and it doesn't get old (for me, anyway). Sure, the midnight shows are a blast, but if you actually want to see the movie,rent the DVD. Rocky rocks. Brevity may be the soul of wit for the Bard (thank you, Hamlet), but it isn't the soul of IMDb, which wants me to write ten lines even if I can get my point across in eight.

		<fullReview>Lethargic glitter-rock musical adapted from the stage show (which was initially a failure) about a young, square couple stumbling upon a mysterious castle right out of an old horror movie from the 1930s; the occupants are a decadent and weird bunch, with Tim Curry heading up the brood as lascivious transvestite Frank-N-Furter. Director Jim Sharman packs in quite a lot of low-brow style without much of a budget, and some of his smaller moments are brilliant (particularly the opening wedding scene and our introductions to leads Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon). The hypnotic credits sequence and several of the musical numbers are charged with the same type of sordid showmanship that permeated Bob Fosse's "Cabaret", yet Sharman can't do much with the piqued plot (reedy to begin with) that doesn't fulfill the early promise. Sexual shenanigans and strange bedfellow-slapstick somehow lead incongruously to a sci-fi climax, endearing the picture to the midnight-movie masses but certain to leave most other audiences out in the cold. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rocky Horror, what can I say. It has lasted 30 years as a cult movie. I remember the first time I saw it when I was at Uni about 25 years ago, since then I guess I have seen it at least 15 times. It is always viewable and enjoyable, brings back memories of people around me at the time that I have lost contact with and the 3rd grade theaters that it used to show in twice a week. I think most of the enjoyment came from the audience participation more so than the movie itself but it was the cause. The few "Sweet Transvestities" that would get dressed up and the more normal crowd that would take along newspapers, rice, water pistols etc to shower the crowd with. What other movie has created such a following? It became a participation movie, whether designed or not - it did. Also it opened a few eyes to what is normal, gay, or other without ramming it down your throat. Live, love and be who you want to be..... 15 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film that escapes the aim of the serious "movie review". It just has to be seen and experienced! The news that a midnight showing is happening in your town should make your quiver with antici......pation. And dig out your fishnets, basques and high heels (and that's just the boys). The film experience, even with live action cast playing along, does not equal the brilliance of seeing it totally live (Jason Donovan as Frank 'N' Furter has to be one of the most surreal and heart warming sights in the world) BUT it is the next best thing and livens up a dull Saturday night no end. It is a totally different viewing experience from the usual - talking back at the screen is positively encouraged, and dancing in the aisles too. It does lose it a bit at the end BUT 1) Susan Sarandon - marvellous Janet (slut!) 2) Richard O'Brien - sets up that campy persona that also worked brilliantly on the long lamented Crystal Maze (Channel 4 TV show from the 80s) 3) Tim Curry! The close up on his heels as he comes down in the lift... 4) The opening number with the disembodied lips - an absolute classic and cinematic genius tooare enough reasons for even the shiest among you to give it a whirl.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film about the second year in college, BUT not in the movie theatre, but on video. I had heard so much about it that I decided to finally watch it. Can't say I was impressed at that time.Well, I'm a little older now, and I did have a second viewing of the film. This time, I was more impressed with the first 1/4 of the film, but then I felt that the rest of the movie just bombed. Oh, I wasn't expecting Oscar-Caliber performances, but I was wanting to see entertainment. And let's face it, the first 1/4th of the movie is just that. With "Time Warp", "The Sweet Transvestite Transexual from Transylvania", Rocky's Song, and Meatloaf's song, it was great. But then everything just starts to blur from there. I actually was hoping for more of the ensemble campiness. By the end, it just swirls into an incoherent plot that leaves you tired and wasted.Now, I'm not saying don't go and see it in the movie theatre. That's another experience in itself, and I think every person should have at least one go at it. But strictly from a movie going person's perspective, it sucks. A much better musical about a transexual rocker is "Hedwig and the Angry Inch", which makes far more sense and is indeed more fun. Heck, they could make that into a theatre experience in itself!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' probably is the cult-classic most people will name if you would ask them. 'This is Spinal Tap' could be another one but in my opinion that movie is for a larger audience.'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' is a musical with great songs. Performances by Susan Sarandon, Barry Bostwick, Richard O'Brien, Patricia Quinn, Meat Loaf and especially Tim Curry as Dr. Frank-N- Furter are all very memorable. 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show is also a comedy. Every scene has a spoof on a horror movie or a science fiction movie so that makes this movie also a horror and a sci-fi movie. The movie, even with all its 'stolen' sequences, is so original you almost have to like it. I can understand why you wouldn't. It is one of weirdest movies you will ever see. Whether you'll like it or not, you will remember it.I liked it very much. There is one little thing I didn't like. It was funny and I found myself smiling the whole time, but there were no scenes with really great laughs in it. I had fun so it didn't bother me much. Anyway, you have to see this movie for yourself because it is too much a matter of taste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently watched this on TV, as a lover of cult films i expected a lot from this but i was left disappointed. while I understand why this film has acquired its cult status, its a bit overrated. Its not a bad film, its just not that great. It starts off promising as a recently engaged couple get stranded on a road and seek for help in a castle they passed by, only to find out its full of freaks. The beginning has some really good scenes and also the best songs in the film. It starts going down hill when DR. Franken- Furter unveils his Frankenstein's monster like creation and from there they seem to forget to add some plot in-between songs. The songs from there on are pretty mediocre. there not bad but i only watched the film a couple of days ago and I've forgotten them completely which isn't a good sign.My main issue with this movie is that for what are supposed to be a deeply in love couple they don't have much interaction. In fact from my memory they don't even talk to each other for the last 2/3 of the movie which is ridiculous. They both cheat on each other but there is absolutely no conflict/consequence because of it. Instead of addressing temptation in a relationship the film just acts like it never happened. The characters are also all over the place. They can go from mild mannered to angry for no apparent reason and you cant tell who's side the characters are on. DR. Franken-Furter starts off as the bad guy then becomes the good guy with no context. If the films excuse for that is that the couple has been driven mad then they must have been mentally unstable beforehand because it doesn't take much to push them over the edge. I get its supposed to be a parody but that doesn't excuse bad writing.The biggest redeeming feature of this film are the actors. Tim Curry is amazing as DR. Franken-Furter and the film is worth seeing for his performance alone.Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon are also great (and it helps that she is half naked for the majority of the film). The whole cast does a great job. regardless the film is fun and worth a watch even if it is dumb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rocky Horror Picture Show was one of those glorious films I began watching with no preconceived notions about it or any clue what it was about. I knew that there was a cult status that had followed this film since it was first released in 1975, but I knew little else about it. So rarely does one get the chance to go blind into a film, and I took that chance and could not be any happier with the result. Directed by Jim Sharman and starring Tim Curry in his film debut, along with the film's writer Richard O'Brien, Patricia Quinn and Nell Campbell reprising their stage roles, The Rocky Horror Picture Show has exploded into a phenomenon filled with audience participation, props and shadow casts making a viewing of the film a rite of passage for young people. Beginning as a stage production before being made into the film, The Rocky Horror Picture Show has withstood the test of time, crowned as the longest constantly running film in movie theatre history.The film opens at a wedding outside of a church in the idyllic city of Denton Ohio. Friends of Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) and Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon) have just tied the knot, and Janet has caught the bouquet. Taking his cue, Brad proposes to Janet and the two decide they must travel to see their former science teacher, now friend and mentor, to share the good news. Along the way, the two experience car trouble and wander upon a mysterious castle to ask for help and use a telephone. What Brad and Janet have come upon disturbs them as they meet a peculiar group of people who have come to see an affair of a transvestite scientist. Brad and Janet are undressed by the domestic of the home, Magenta (Patricia Quinn) and the handyman Riff Raff (Richard O'Brien) and taken up to the master's laboratory. Once they formally meet Dr. Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry) they begin to learn that he is a scientist interested in reanimation and has the secret to human life. The affair that they happened upon is one in which Dr. Frank-N- Furter is going to reveal the muscle man he has created. After the reveal of Rocky (Peter Hinwood), things take a turn for the strange, and everyone is escorted to bed as Frank and Rocky get better acquainted. After a night of trysts, it is unsure whom should be paired with whom anymore and everyone, including rival scientist, and friend to Brad and Janet, Dr. Everett V. Scott (Jonathan Adams), who happened upon the night's activities, is invited to dinner. After a raucous dinner reveal/birthday party more sexual liberation occurs and everyone participates in Dr. Frank N-Furter's floor show in full formal attire. After spending time in Frank-N-Furter's palace and submitting to his plans, Brad and Janet definitely don't leave the same way they came in. From the opening sequence of Patricia Quinn's infamous red lips singing to the audience, one knows they are in for a wild ride. The beginning of the film is filled with fun nods to classic cinema, including The Wizard of Oz as the same characters that are at the wedding will also appear in Transylvania. There are also tons of nods to B-horror movies of the early days of Hollywood making The Rocky Horror Picture Show a treat for fans of classic films. My first experience with a rock musical did not disappoint. Since I first saw this movie just two months ago, I have bought the soundtrack in two different mediums so I can listen to the music anytime I please, yeah, it's that good. Speaking of the music, am I the only one that thinks that, as cute as Time Warp is, Sweet Transvestite is the song that really steals the show? Although, to be fair, any scene with Tim Curry stole the show. It's unbelievable to think that this film was Tim Curry's film debut; what an introduction! He was extraordinary in this role and proved that if he can do Dr. Frank-N-Furter, he can do anything. It's truly unfortunate that he has been so underutilized in Hollywood, with acting ability and a voice like his you would expect him to be in just about everything, alas, this did not turn out to be, although he has an extensive filmography of voice work to his credit. I suppose such is the life of a character actor, it's just so disheartening to see how great he can be (If you need any further evidence check out Three Men in a Boat or Blue Money) and to see him act in the worst American movies imaginable. I wonder if Tim Curry's entrance coming out of the elevator in The Rocky Horror Picture Show isn't the best on film. The Rocky Horror Picture Show does many things that are hard to do well on film. Not only does the film use a narrator which can bog down the story line and come off clunky and often disjointed, but several of the characters also broke the fourth wall as well. This device is almost never done well but executed flawlessly in this film. What's more, however, is that The Rocky Horror Picture Show encourages rebellion of expectations, tolerance of differences, and acceptance of our own individuality. Of course, sexual freedom is explored in the film but so was rebellion from a meaningless middle-class existence where a new wife is praised for her cooking or a new husband is commended because he has a promotion on the way. The Rocky Horror Picture Show offers viewers the message of sexual freedom, but that's not all. Being true to yourself if the heart of the film, and to go after what you want no matter what it is; don't dream it, be it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fantastic musical that became a midnight special and sent Broadway riding to the bank on a golden pig.Curry (Tim Curry) hams it up as the absurd over the top transsexual from planet Transyvania who came to rock and roll the night away. Brad and Janet never knew what hit them.What makes it a spectacular romp is the music from Science fiction to I'm going home all created by O'Brien for the stage show that's catchy, fun and you find humming to yourself during a slow work day.All the caste members deserved praise for the choreography, amazing voices and dance steps done to perfection.A favorite of mine was Columbia and Eddie two lovers torn apart by their devotion to the doctor who doesn't allow anyone to come before him.While the Rocky Horror wasn't the first, yet did better then the rest, was get the audience involved in the action. Theators would line up with fans dressed in costumes, handed props and were lead on when to react. I've been a few times myself, fishnets and bad wig, it was a hoot.Every time I watch I find something new or interesting not picked up before. The pool scene shows the painting of Man touching God are we to suspect that maybe Frank may have visited before and was Dionysus the God of wine and pleasure?Whatever you believe, you have to agree that the Rocky Horror picture show is spellbinding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Newly engaged couple Brad (Barry Bostwick) and Janet (Susan Sarandon) are travelling to visit their old college professor Dr. Scott (Jonathan Adams) when their car has a blow out. With no spare tyre, they seek help at a nearby castle, where they encounter a group of decidedly strange individuals, including handyman Riff Raff (Richard O'Brien), maid Magenta (Patricia Quinn), groupie Columbia (Nell Campbell), rocker Eddie (Meat Loaf), and, of course, transvestite scientist Frank N. Furter (Tim Curry), who has been busy building a man in his lab (Rocky, played by Peter Hinwood). I remember reading the novelisation of Fame, back in 1982, in which a couple of the characters attended a late night showing of The Rocky Horror Picture Show; it sounded like a lot of fun, and as an inquisitive young fan of cult cinema, I knew I had to find a copy of this film. Eventually, I was able to buy it on VHS and was hooked by its uniqueness, its energy and its catchy songs. Over the following years I watched it repeatedly, learning the words and memorising the details.I've just watched the film again for the first time in well over a decade (maybe even nearer two), but within seconds it all came flooding back (as if I was in a Time Warp): the excellent tunes, the quotable dialogue, the wonderful cast. That's the sign of a true cult movie: it's more than just a mere film? it becomes ingrained in your very being. The story is extremely silly and scattershot, but that is all part of its charm. Let your inhibitions go, and you'll have a blast. Or to quote Frank N. Furter: give yourself over to absolute pleasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eccentric and Energetic Fun For Everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the look of its DVD cover, you may think the 1975 cult classic "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" to be very weird and whimsically creepy. And that analogy is rightfully fitting, because its 100 minutes of fun singing, dancing and enough fueled up energy to likely keep you up awake for long hours of the night. From the narration of an unnamed criminologist (Charles Gray), the story centers around a normal young recently engaged couple named Brad (Barry Bostwick) and Janet (Susan Sarandon) who's car gets brunt out in major downpour. The couple end up in a castle and are greeted by a transvestite scientist Dr. Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry) who has in the same tradition like Dr. Frankenstein has found a solution to create life. After successfully bringing his creation Rocky (Peter Hinwood) to life, Dr. Frank-N-Furter show Brad and Janet to their rooms where he embarks on a passionate experience this young couple will remember till the day they die.With all the whimsical weirdness dominating the screens, "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" is the ultimate fun a movie fan can ever have and Tim Curry is at his most zaniest he has ever been. Sporting full transvestite regalia, Dr. Frank-N-Furter takes Brad and Janet and his entire viewers to his delectably scary house of horrors while leading them on through a variety of spontaneous tunes. With his demeanor set on abrasiveness, his seductive ways goes both sides as he utilizes his persuasive charm to engage in intercourse with both Brad and Janet. The house of Dr. Frank-N-Furter is the estate where normality is extremely alienated. The spiritual guide is his loyal butler Riff-Raff (Richard O'Brien) and his is ghoulish maid Magenta (Patricia Quinn). It's Dr. Frank-N-Furter who decides on the the differences between right and wrong and Tim Curry looks like he is having a blast in his performance where the boundaries of moral decency has absolutely no limits. A major idiosyncrasy that has made this film reach cult status is the the rightfully selected music. The opening scene which features a pair of lips singing "Science Fiction Double Feature" that pays homage to classic science fiction movies, makes it clear that the music matches the over-the-top characteristics to the leading character. If I was to choose a favourite song of choice it would have to be "Time Warp" in which Riff-Raff and Magenta lead a pair of oddball characters in an upbeat dance. Who could forget the song "Sweet Transvestite" where we're first introduced to Dr. Frank- N-Furter. These two songs come right after one another giving us the double pleasure that keeps our fingers snapping and our toes tapping. Directly after its release, "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" launched a fan following. Fans just threw themselves into movie as they hollered back at the screen, taking quotes from the movie, having performers decked out in costumes as the audience is watching them like from the song "The Perks of Being a Wallflower". I was born in 1976 so I never had the chance to see those midnight viewings (sigh!). It would have been a ton of fun to have had experience something like it. But from the comfort of my humble abode, this film was truly a riot. But in front of crowd, it would have been a lifetime I would never forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not perfect but mainly enjoyably bizarre stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, whatever you may think of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, you can't say it's not unique. It didn't do very good business on initial theatrical release but, like the earlier Night of the Living Dead (1968) and the later Eraserhead (1977), it slowly gathered a significant following while being shown at midnight screenings at various cinemas. It became one of a very select few movies where audience participation became actively expected. Needless to say, this has gone on to become a cast iron example of a cult movie. It was based on a theatrical musical written by Richard O'Brien, who appears in the movie as the manservant Riff Raff. It features a stellar turn from Tim Curry as the transvestite mad scientist Dr. Frank-N-Furter, a wide-eyed and sexy performance from a young Susan Sarandon, a pre Bat out of Hell rock 'n' roll cameo from Meat Loaf and strange deadpan narration from Charles Gray. The cast are all commendably game and over-play things to the max.The story is really just a means to an end. It has a naive WASP couple called Brad and Janet wind up as reluctant guests at a strange mansion after their car breaks down on a rainy night. The people they encounter are spectacularly odd - Riff Raff the hunchbacked handyman, the full-on Dr. Frank?N -Furter, Columbia the rock groupie, Magenta the goth house maid, Eddie the bike riding rocker, Rocky Horror the creature and the guests, the Transylvanians. These characters alone give significant interest to this bizarre film but what elevates it to another level are the songs. From the opening 'Science Fiction/Double Feature' through to 'Eddie' there is an unbroken sequence of nine or ten songs that work brilliantly. They are both musically and lyrically good but also pretty amusing. The cast all make them work very well on screen. What I have always thought though is that after this very strong opening two-thirds, the film drops in quality somewhat in its final third. The stronger material is loaded at the front and the movie always seems to suffer a bit from this in that it winds down with weaker material.Despite this reservation, this bizarre movie gets far more right than wrong. Even though it is unashamedly silly, it has a strange atmosphere where it's quite easily to get drawn into the world where strange gatherings of oddballs happen at Gothic mansions in the dead of night. There are a real mish-mash of influences thrown into the pot and mixed together such as Frankenstein, RKO Pictures, 50's sci-fi and rock 'n' roll music; all these elements are then thrown together mixed up with light sleaze, high camp and knowing comedy. The combination is pretty unprecedented and Rocky Horror still feels utterly unique, whether or not this is a good thing for you comes down to a matter of taste, as this is certainly a film which alienates a sizable number of people. For me, despite the weaker final third, this is a lot of fun and terrifically bizarre stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie recently, and I'm sure I'll definitely be watching it again soon.This movie is everything you'd expect it to be; cheesy, hyper, and just over all, fun! Remember that word with this review: fun.The good is extremely good, of course! The plot is twisted, the characters are memorable, and the music numbers are practically contagious the way they make you want to jump up and dance with them.(Just the little touch of having characters dance and NOT be involved with the music number is actually a very nice move!)As much good as there is, there definitely are some bad things about this movie. Some characters (like Brad and Janet!) aren't as well developed as the others. The same goes for a couple of the music numbers; they're GOOD, just not really AS GOOD as the rest. And THAT ENDING! The last 10 to 15 of this movie comes literally out of nowhere. It involves aliens, deaths of the main cast that really didn't need to happen, and no real climax to speak of.But, over all, this movie is definitely something that is a must- watch for anyone! I'd especially recommend this movie as a party movie for friends who haven't seen it yet. And if you've seen this movie already, you'd know it's best to have that party on Valentine's with that certain someone. It'll be filled with laughs and maybe a dance or two!Take care, and we'll be ready to welcome you to the fandom any time soon!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow this sucked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love bad movies, I really do, I love cult classics like 'The Toxic Avenger' and 'Class of Nuke Em' High' and other such exploitation films. But why don't I like 'Rocky Horror'? Well, it's pretty easy to explain. So easy in fact, that those of you who are raging just because I don't like this oversexualized piece of crap should understand. And here it is; Sex is the only thing they focus on. I'm not going to say that if you choose to live that way your a bad person, but in movies, often sexualizing people has two outcomes. 1.) It's a porno and that's the point, (and I couldn't care LESS about those) or 2.) A man in a hockey mask, or a fedora and a razor- glove hand, or with a mask made of human skin and a chainsaw shows up and kills you. In this, sex is just shown as "Hey, do it with everyone. (And I mean EVERYONE) and nothing bad will happen." Sure, I get it. it was the 70's, everyone was high off their asses but today... It's just uncomfortable. I really struggled to watch the movie and that sucks, because the music (mostly) is amazing and the story has a really cool premise! Yet the whole thing is just utterly destroyed by the really disturbing sexual content which this movie focuses the last 30 minuets on! The acting is really good from everyone (except Little Neil, she was REALLY annoying.) and the music is FANTASTIC! (Aside from 'Rose Tint My World') even the song 'Sweet Transvestite' is catchy enough that I don't care about the lyrics. Probably the best songs are 'Time Warp' (obviously) 'Hot Patootie - Bless My Soul' and 'Eddie' (BTW Meatloaf is by far the best part of the movie.) The audio and video quality are surprisingly low for a blu-ray. But I guess they were trying to capture the feel of when this first came out. (Maybe...) Going into the movie, I really wanted to enjoy it, but no matter what I did. I just couldn't. this movie is just BAD. It's not enjoyably bad, and even if it was I would still have a hard time recommending it because of the f**ked up content. Also, just to be clear, I enjoyed 'Fritz the Cat' more than this. And that was rated 'X'. It had great ideas, but a terrible execution and unlikable characters and really left me questioning why I bothered to watch the damn thing. Overall, don't bother with this film. Save your cash and go watch Nightmare on Elm Street or something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An LGBT cult item</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before finally watching The Rocky Horror Picture Show to review I asked a young friend who was visiting me what he thought of it. I offered to give him the DVD when I was finished with it. He said fine, but he thought that The Rocky Horror Picture Show was better as a stage show. God only knows it's revived often enough and has been taken to heart as a cult item with shows in just about every where there's a visible LGBT community. In fact I know at least one person who in Toronto every year plays Dr. Frank N. Furter in a production.The three leads in fact saw their breakout performances in this science fiction parody which takes its plot partly from the Frankenstein story and from the Island of Dr. Moreau. Having Mary Shelley and H.G. Wells as inspiration gives you a good start.Young couple Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon get themselves lost and wind up at the home of mad cross dressing scientist Dr. Frank N. Furter played by Tim Curry. If you've seen both those classic films than you have some idea of the story line.I'll say this if Dr. Frankenstein was gay Peter Hinwood would be exactly what he would dream up for an artificially created man. Whatever happened to him?The musical numbers performed stylishly by drag performers are staged well. And certainly the pyrotechnics are probably better seen in a live production.So I guess I'll have to take my friend's comment and judge that for myself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2015 will mark the 40th anniversary of this classic. I first watched this on a VHS tape back in 1990 and became hooked immediately. According to history, this movie originally did not get any rave reviews. But the loyal fans who watch it over and over gave it life. The idea is you have the VHS/DVD at home to "dream it", then go to the midnight showing to "be it". RHPS has everything. Catchy music, dance routines which are taught to you ("Time Warp" literally walks you through it), great characters, and a little "naughtiness". Those with the deluxe DVD can learn about interacting with the film (such as throwing toast, wearing newspaper hats, tossing toilet paper). I have watched this movie so many times, I could quote it word for word. I have gone to midnight showings. I usually dress like one of the Transylvanians (which is basically an ill-fitting tuxedo, wild sunglasses and party hat). For most, I suggest you watch it at home to learn basics, then when you feel brave, go to a midnight show with friends that have done it before. Anyway, I love the movie, and most who enjoy having fun will love it as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very long time ago someone told me I needed to see this movie so I gave it a shot but I couldn't make it past the wedding. He told me to give it 5 more minutes,so I did.That time I made it until Frank showed up. The third time I made it all the way through and was in love with this movie.Since that day I have seen it over 300 times. RHPS is a science fiction musical comedy with a twist. An engaged couple gets a flat tire and go to a nearby castle to use the phone.Up to that point the movie seems like it's just a corny comedy but it gets really good. It turns out that the castle is actually a space ship from the planet Transsexual. The music is awesome and the story is great. This is a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975): Dir: Jim Sharman / Cast: Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon, Barry Bostwick, Richard O'Brien, Meatloaf: An event film where viewers dress up and interact with a show of their own. What it represents is unknown but it introduces Brad and Janet, two love birds who profess love to each other through song. We hear such corny lines as, "Damn it, Janet" or "Can it, Janet...I love you!" When their car breaks down in a stormy night they seek refuge in a spooky mansion occupied by transvestite goons. Tim Curry enters as the "sweet transvestite" and orders his guests to strip to their underwear. Hardly normal and dressing up as such is not observed as normal behavior in society. Why anyone would dress up as such is beyond me. Intriguing with many strange developments until it diminishes in its third act. Directed by Jim Sharman with an outrageous performance by Tim Curry who seduces his reluctant guests while revealing his strong man creation. Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon are hilarious as the All-American couple. Richard O'Brian plays the eerie Riff Raff. Meatloaf makes an appearance as a biker named Eddie who makes the mistake of stealing the moment from our "sweet transvestite." Technically well made production with nifty performances and weird catchy songs that render this the strangest musical. Pointless romp that demands a show in return. Score: 7 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh my god, my head is spinning from seeing this movie. Crikey like Tim Curry was the one who was mind blowing in this film. His singing was incredible and he just added so much personality to his character that I couldn't keep up with him. In my childhood like, he played the Mouse King in the Barbie film: Barbie and the Nutcracker, he just was so good at being evil but I think he sang only little. I knew he was an excellent actor and singer especially playing in drag version!Susan Sarandon had such a cute little singing voice. It's like she was singing a Disney song in the movie although she didn't sing in the Enchanted regardless of her playing a villain. I would've loved to have heard her sing. She looked really sexy in the film, although I bet she was cold having just a bra and underwear on. Oh well, she did a great job anyhow!The songs were amazing, the cast were amazing and the storyline was hard to follow but good at the same time. Watch this film!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pure over-the-top camp!! What really stands out for me is the fabulous original music by Richard O' Brien - his song writing is quite excellent!!! Tim Curry is absolutely superb as the Frankenfurter character!! It's great seeing Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick in their early careers - they look so different then!!! This is a fun movie to be enjoyed at face value. I did actually see the original stage show at a small theatre in Chelsea, London back in 1976. I was taken along without knowing anything about it. I remember being blown away by it then! I would love to go and see this movie at one of the theaters where they act out the parts and dress up as their favorite characters! Don't watch this if you are easily offended by sexualized behavior. It really isn't offensive, it's Frankenstein meets transvestitism!! It is NOT tasteless, it's good fun and is not meant to be taken seriously! Enjoy it for what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rocky Horror Picture Show is about as cult as it gets, without actually getting illegal. Taking into account the year it was released and the mostly unknown cast that were picked, the success of the film was phenomenal. Richard O'Brien writing the songs managed to do what seems impossible to most - writing a musical where all the songs are catchy and don't come across as "fillers". The low-budget works perfectly with the camp tone and is great for adapting the stage show into a memorable "picture show". The film is definitely a spoof of B-movies, hammer-style horror films and a general tribute to "giving yourself over to absolute pleasure". Tim Curry as Frank N' Furter is quite something and its great to see foetus Susan Sarandon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A classic movie, changed my life. Really important to finding out who I am, helped me discover my personality as a whole. The moment I heard about this movie I fell in love, and the best part is my family made it a huge affair, we all watched it together. Everything from creating a lead character that is comfortable not only in his sexuality, but his skin. The quirkiness of the lead couple, Brad and Janet, contributes to the overall atmosphere of the movie. The tiny squabbles and the antics of sexual affairs between the couple, the transvestite, and the creature. I have absolutely no complaints about this movie, I hope it maintains its popularity, and continues to be loved by all who watch it! The campiness of the movie gives insight to the time in which it was created, and how it has developed into a cult classic. Also, it provides a sense of commonality among people who watch it, a true born love for this movie and the entire culture surrounding it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a movie, it has some fun songs and good camp until it becomes tiresome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) and Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon) are a sweet innocent newly-engaged couple. Their car gets a flat in the rain. They stop at the mansion of transvestite Dr. Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry) where they meet various weird characters like Riff Raff (Richard O'Brien) and Magenta (Patricia Quinn). The Doctor creates golden boy Rocky Horror (Peter Hinwood).There are obviously two ways to rate this movie. My first encounter with the movie is when some people put up a viewing party. I didn't know what they were talking about. It was only about 10 people but it was a lot of fun. Needless to say that most of it had nothing to do with the movie. I would give that experience a 9/10. I'm sure watching it in a midnight madness theater would be a 10/10. However that's not really the movie as much as it's the audience participation. The movie itself has some great songs. Its intended camp and craziness is quite compelling. However it wears out its welcome after about an hour. It gets tiresome as it becomes obvious that the film has nothing to offer other than being bizarre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is, in my opinion, the best cult classic out there. It has an interesting plot, a colorful cast of characters, and of course, great music. I mean, who could forget classics like "The Time Warp" or "Sweet Transvestite"? The plot revolves around Brad Major and Janet Weiss, who get a flat tire on their way to visit an old friend. They decide to ask if they could use a phone in a nearby castle. They are greeted by Riff- Raff, who tells them, it's a "Very special occasion". After some characters are introduced during "The Time Warp", Frank N. Furter makes his entrance with "Sweet Transvestite". He invites them over with open arms, before he brings life to his creation Rocky Horror. I'm not going to spoil too much, so I'll stop there. So overall, I give this movie a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is really a awesome movie I've every seen. I think not much people around the world can imagine that movie can be like think before this movie, but it appeared, like a super nova. It's strange and cult. If you like cult movie you may thought it's such a awesome movie like me but if you don't, you might think it sucks, it's awful. Maybe that's one of the character of cult movie, similar with art, perhaps only less people can really understand it and feel the feeling and that part of people become followers of these kind of art.Although the actor and the director in this movie are not that famous but they also did a very good job. Especially the acting of Tim Curry. Tim act Dr.x in the movie which become one of my favorite movie characters. He did a very awesome job from the acting of Dr.X to the singing and motion, even the clothes so that he create such a successful psycho.The music of this movie is great too. It's funny and strange from the beginning to the end. It mixed rock classic and lots of kinds of music. The music in this movie is also cult. No such a movie can compare with it.</fullReview>

Another great claim are the songs. They fit the film in a very organic way, and the actors voices are spectacular. And in addition to this, the LGTB topic is treated in a super natural way. They don't use any "queer clichs", which is something I'm actually glad of. Almost every character respect and live the transvestism in a very healthy and happy way, acting like it should be, something normal and familiar to everyone.I definitely recommend watching this movie, which I'd sum up with the chorus of one of its songs: "don't dream it, be it".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those cult films. OK the actual story of the film isn't really that original as it's very similar to FrankensteinCouple break down Couple enter creepy house Couple find some mad doctor doing mad experiments Doctor creates human being Doctor goes mad and kills his new creation and attempt to kill everyone else Doctors servants turn on Doctor and kill him However the music in the show is really good and catchy. Some of the tunes aren't too good like the Sword of Damocles but there are certainly more good songs in it than bad.Also the main thing that makes the Rocky Horror special is going to see it in a theatre or cinema. If you've never done this - do it! the film is only just about all right when you watch it in your own home.But turning up to a theatre or cinema and finding most people in some kind of cos-play dress from the show - loads of frank-n-furters in stockings and suspenders, people dressed as Brad and Janet, and many others. It really does add to the effect.The whole show is geared around audience participation, which there isn't any other film I know of that expects the audience to shout words out at the characters, or decorate the theatre in rice, confetti, water. Forget Dolby 5.1 in the theatre when you see this you get full interaction, the feeling of rice going over you at the wedding scene, the rain and the newspaper to protect you, the noisemakers when Frank is about to unleash his creation, the party poppers for when Frank-n-furter is coming, and of course the chance to get up and dance around to the Time Warp.It really does make this film unique.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historical For Impact on A Revolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story behind this musical can't be spoiled very much. This film was a major, groundbreaking film during the late 70's and early 80's. MANY people hated it passionately, while many of us that were young and rebellious heralded it. As you likely already know, it was an adaptation for film from the musical, "The Rocky Horror Show," but little was changed of significance during adaptation. For nothing else, this film deserves full stars for audience interaction like none other. It was and remains as the supreme cult classic. Today, one can watch similar risqu material on a cartoon channel, without being surprised. But back then, we didn't have nearly as much of the outrageous in our entertainment that we have today. Sure, 'Jesus Christ Superstar' and 'Hair' pushed some boundaries, but we didn't have the amount of competing stimulus as is present today. The media was very tightly controlled, and we were inhibited and repressed by this as to what was acceptable. This musical would not have been possible without the influences of the narrated Sci-Fi B movies (and the humor of how ridiculous they were), British programming of shows like Monty Python's Flying Circus, and the hippies and musicians of the late 60's &amp; early 70's.I had long hair back then, and that was a radical thing to do, because family fought over such matters. Seriously, the television shows of our youth would not even show a husband and wife in the same bed without them having to keep at least one foot on the ground. We were raised to believe that sex was a "dirty" thing by our government and many of the social customs that seemed left over from the decisions made by the Council of Trent and the Inquisition of the Dark Ages.I admit that I tried my only hit of LSD in my life on the day of my first viewing of this film in a theater back in 1978. When those red lips came on the big screen singing, it blew my mind, because it was so novel. Then, the story continued to work away further at the constructs in my mind. When it transitioned us from a wedding in a conservative, rural setting, to entering the Frankenstein place with Dr Frank-N-Furter, a transvestite from the planet transsexual of the galaxy Transylvania, in a hot drag outfit, pushing boundaries about sexuality, music &amp; dance styles, some of the mind-fabrications from our culture that needed to be questioned, were falling down. When the audience began shouting phrases, holding up umbrellas, throwing toast, carrying around "virgins," it occurred to me that this was a profound moment in my life. We were up dancing together, as a community, to "Let's Do the Time Warp Again," and I had never experienced anything close to it. Wouldn't it be grand if a new production had the ability to get people to unite together dancing in a movie theater?The scene where Janet wants to get dirty with Rocky, singing, "Toucha Toucha Toucha Touch Me," tells much of the story on its own. She was overly repressed, and viewed sex as dirty due to her upbringing, and wanted to be dirty. She and Brad were exposed to events and people they could never have even imagined based on their upbringing. In some ways, we were rebelling and being dirty to a degree by just being at the show.The musical gets more ludicrous in the Sci-Fi, B movie style. I don't think the particulars of the story matter much, so don't be upset that you may miss some of the story due to the audience being radical. I am a major fan of both Sci-Fi and musicals, as that was what our generation had available: Elvis, Bing Cosby, West Side Story, The Wizard of Oz, etc. I acted &amp; sang my heart out in musicals. Plus, I grew up cultured by my parents with theater. But, the musicals were mostly wholesome. This musical was turning our definition of wholesome on its head. Now, when I watch it, it seems strange to me that it doesn't really contain anything I wouldn't want my grand-children to see. Similar risqu material is shown during regular family watching hours now. It really does not contain anything shocking for today, but back then, the shockwaves ran deep and long. If you are a Rocky Horror Picture Show virgin: I read one of the top reviews that suggested that it should be watched on video first. I dissent with this, as I tried that approach with a RHPS virgin back in the 80's, shortly after I was married. I watched this film with my then wife (and current friend) on VHS. Seeing it for the first time on our television, without the audience, seemed lame to her. I tried to add to the experience with my shouts in the living-room, but no props in the house. It just fell flat. My suggestion for virgins to this show is to go to the theater, without reading any further reviews, and make certain everyone knows you are a RHPS virgin, so they can take care of you. Don't mind if you get carried around with your legs spread open, as happens in some places. You are in for a treat! DRUG DISCLAIMER: Just because my LSD experience was profound with this picture, I am not promoting you to take any hallucinogens before you watch it. My only reason for mentioning it is due to the cultural significance of hallucinogens back then. Very shortly after my first viewing of this picture, I had a very bad trip when someone snuck some Angel-Dust into a bowl of weed we were smoking, and it messed me up for several very scary days that you would not wish to endure.</fullReview>

The movie may be inappropriate for some viewers but it is still a one of a kind classic film. I never liked musicals until this movie and now I love lot's of musicals like Les Miserables and many other musicals. My favorite character is Frank-N- Furter. I don't really want to be bi-sexual but, I want to have is confident personality and kinda the "boss". I also love Columbia, Magenta, and Riff Raff.

The two sidekicks, Rif Raf and Magenta steal the show and makes the film so enjoyable...SPOILER!!! The storyline that they are aliens was strange, but fit right in to this style of movie and stage show. I think overall Richard O'Brien struck gold and it is still going strong in the film world now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The line for critical objectivity ends at "The Rocky Horror Picture Show." Either you love this one, or you just don't get it. (Count me among the former.) The story centers around super-square high-schoolers Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) and Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon, most definitely in her pre-Oscar days). They get engaged and prepare to meet up with an old professors of theirs, when their car gets a flat tire. The only place for help is a nearby castle run by a demented doctor named Frank N. Furter (Tim Curry)--and brother, the kind of help he offers.The movie's legend has long been part of modern film folklore: how rock impresario Lou Adler picked up an obscure stage show from L.A. and had it made into a movie; how the movie was considered a flop because it only attracted about 50 people per showing, until someone realized that it was always the *same* 50 people; how it was moved to midnight screenings and became an established cult classic.And of course, part of the legend is the show-within-a-show, where moviegoers come dressed as their favorite "Rocky Horror" characters, bring their own props to the theater (such as waterguns to shoot during a storm scene in the movie), and shout dialogue cues at the screen. (When an audience member yells out, "What's white and sells hamburgers?", a screen character says, "Didn't we pass a castle down the road?") The movie is still best seen at a full-participation public theater. But if you strip away the midnight extras and watch it on DVD, the movie still has much to offer, such as: * Gloriously trashy sets and color--it's a treat just to look at.* References to seemingly every movie ever made. Just for starters, check out all the sci-fi film reference in the movie's opening theme. And of course, there are the obvious references to "Frankenstein," with the spooky castle, the mad scientist, and his unique creation.* A terrific soundtrack of rock songs, all composed by Richard O'Brien (who plays Frank's flunkie, Riff Raff, and who also wrote the original play and its screen version).* Wonderful performances, from everyone from Bostwick and Sarandon to heavyweight rock star Meat Loaf (in an all-too-brief turn). And then there's Tim Curry, whose fishnet-stockinged Frank made an indelible mark upon pop culture with the first swish of his satin cape.The DVD version includes the film's concluding song "Superheroes" (formerly available only in the British movie version) and an alternate soundtrack where you can learn the participation "script" without having to go out at midnight.Whether you're a "virgin" (the cultists' term for "Rocky Horror" first-timers) or veteran, it's definitely worth the time warp.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those who "don't understand why people like this movie," remember its earliest days and remember that this is more than just something to sit back and watch, it's become an interactive experience, it's a common ground where the outcasts of society can meet and feel as if they belong.That being said, this is low budget cheese at its finest! I love looking back and seeing all these huge stars back when they were young at the beginning of their careers. The music is fun and often just outright ridiculous (in a good way, of course), the plot is hilariously so bad it's good, this is the ideal movie to pop in when you have friends over.I wasn't born yet when this movie was made, but I understand it's significance in social cinematic history and I've grown to love it as one of the best classics out there. You need to approach it with a fun attitude and no specific expectations, but once you give it a try, most people I know have been hooked for life. Happy viewing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, or should I say musical is so memorable it's no wonder it is a cult classic. The songs are awesome rock and roll/ poetic ballad types that you will not be able to get out of your head. I mean, you must be able to look at this movie as a compilation of artwork that is meant to freak you the hell out! The songs, the costumes, the over-acting, the beautiful suspense between lines, and the eccentric everything all come together to make you question what your eyes are truly seeing. The characters are very lovable and they are all funny, which helps the zany atmosphere of the movie.Tim Curry.(see all films)One of the coolest and bravest actors of all time absolutely makes this movie! And he accomplishes it in many different ways. I would have to say his first stroke of brilliance in this flick are his first two lines. "How d'you I, See you've met my, faithful handyman. He's just a little brought down because when you knocked, He thought you were the candy man." (que groovy-ass rock tune)In these lines he expresses his character in one fell swoop. Total tranny, mock feminism taken to the enth degree. Lots of confidence, sexuality, seduction, mystic, and the way he moves his lips is absolutely genius. I love just watching his facial expressions when he talks. Next it's his ability to be the most powerful person and character on the screen in every scene he's in. He is, by his introduction, the most interesting character. Then I must give it to the script and the director. The scenes that he is in and the things he says are so funny and true to his character that seeing an actor excel as much as that is a privilege. The seduction of both Brad and Janet is such an untouched subject and such a taboo. It is so refreshing to be the viewer and to see the story hold nothing back. Tits and dick grabbing and ass slapping and man caressing is just part of the world of this story and just goes along with the anything goes mentality of the personality of this guy from transsexual Transylvania.This movie is memorable, unique, funny, catchy, adventurous, insane, sexy, ludicrous, and will leave a lasting impression on you if you have an open mind, love great singing, and find sexual humor and situations hilarious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How do you review a movie that's become a cultural icon?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is there a soul alive nowadays who doesn't know about this movie? Given that, it's difficult to do a straightforward review. Almost everybody knows, or thinks they know, what it's all about.If you don't know what it's all about, here are some hints: Transvestites. Cannibalism. House of horrors. Pure unadulterated 200-proof camp. Singing and dancing. Zombies. Over the top.It stars Tim Curry. And let me right here disabuse people of a common misconception: Curry is NOT Rocky Horror. He is Dr. Frank N. Furter. (Peter Hinwood has the title role, and a surprisingly small role it is.) It also has Susan Sarandon, Barry Bostwick, Meat Loaf, Nell Campbell, and Richard O' Brien. And a bunch of other people.If you go get a DVD of this movie and spool it up on your TV and just sit down to watch it cold, you'll find that the first part is campy fun, but that in the end it dissolves into a mess that goes on forever too long. As a straight entertainment movie, it would rate maybe 3 stars out of ten.But it isn't a straight entertainment movie, and that's the point, and you shouldn't sit down to watch it cold.I was lucky: I saw this movie in the best of all possible circumstances, in fall of 1976, at a midnight showing at the Nuart Theater in Venice, California. Ladies and gents, viewing "Rocky Horror" doesn't get any better than that. I was as innocent and clueless as Janet is at the beginning of the movie. My then-boyfriend, now husband, took me there on our third date ever. Good thing it was our third date, I was ready to give him benefit of the doubt; had this been our first date, there wouldn't have been a second."You HAVE to see this," my boyfriend told me. "So what's it about?" I asked. He wouldn't tell me. That should have been my first clue.So we went, and I noted that a lot of the people queuing up at the Nuart were dressed...oddly. Oddly even for Venice, California, in 1976, near midnight. That should have been my second clue.And then the movie started, and that's when the show REALLY started.People throwing rice during the wedding scene. People spraying the rest of the audience with water-pistols during the storm scene. People who got up on stage, and danced along with the actors in the movie, during the dance scenes. And that's just the stuff I can mention in a review that might be read by kids.It wasn't a movie, it was an EVENT. No mistake about it. I emerged stunned and drop-jawed, at this glimpse of a culture and a gestalt that I'd never known existed before. "Did you like it?" my boyfriend asked anxiously as we walked out, past people in drag and wedding attire who were acting out their own bits of the movie.And he wasn't talking about just a movie, he was talking about an event, a scene, a shared experience. And I really think that's how you have to deal with "Rocky Horror Picture Show": you can't take it out of cultural context as a movie you sit down to watch cold. If you want to really understand it, you have to try to experience it as an event in a theater (or a party at home) with people who aren't just watching it, but who are BEING it, to paraphrase the chorus from one of the songs.I'm 35 years on down the road from my initial viewing of this movie at the Nuart, but it's an experience that has stood out more strongly for me as time has gone by. There aren't more than a handful of movies that have done that for me, but it wasn't this movie just by itself. It was the totality of the experience: the movie, the time, the theater, the person I was with, and most of all the crowd. All coming together to make something greater than the sum of the parts.I was very, very lucky to experience "Rocky Horror" in that way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film, is like love, the song that gives you goose bumps or your favourite jacket. You don't need anyone to agree or accept it. It's there for you, and the other(s) who understand it - without intellectual reasoning, without analysis.It's like why you became a punk or go of to the grassy hill near the rubbish dump to wait for the sky to become turquoise and the sun to set slowly.(the following is added to fulfill the minimum line criteria of IMDb)In effect the Rocky Horror Picture Show melds burlesque, Sci-Fi B-movies, "Sunset Boulevard" and "I am a Camera" into . . . well, . . . something new. Something youth culture of the mid-70's would subconsciously understand and appropriate. OK, it's a bit softer than punk, but something the later punk and fetish generation of the late 70's and 80's embodied. Directed between a decade of the outright drugs and peace perspective (i.e. Easy Rider), near the ominous bleakness of post-Vietnam madness (One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest), and before the hedonistic and ominous, but brilliant "Blue Velvet", the Rocky Horror Picture Show is a true Goth Film - not meant to be understood by everyone, therefore remaining ominous and threatening to the establishment, but, nevertheless, nothing but emotional.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great music, Great story, Great acting, Great everything. This is the perfect musical. Its got a rockin' soundtrack, a fantastic cast, some wild costumes, an even wilder story, sex, anything you could want from a film, its got it all. It doesn't take itself seriously at all. This is a movie about sex obsessed transvestites coming to earth to show humans how to have a good time. This film is a good time. Its even better seeing it in the theater with people. Audience participation will provide some of the most fun you will ever have in your life. Tim Curry owns this film, Frank N Furter is possibly the second best character in film history, right behind Indiana Jones. The music in this is so good. I dare you not to tap your foot during Hot Patootie. I could say more but it would be nothing but good things. This film isn't for the faint of heart or for the close minded. If you're looking for a good time however, look no further</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I started out as Brad and blossomed into a Frank N Furter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mere days after the UK premiere and a few weeks before the US premiere, I moved with my parents from the real Denton, Ohio (Toledo) to the closest thing we had to the planet of Transsexual in 1975 (Los Angeles). A few years later I worked at a movie theatre which rescued itself for a short time from the inevitable obliteration of the old fashioned single screen movie house via twice weekly (!) midnight showings of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show." It changed me forever and I shall always be thankful for that. An awkward, bi-spectacled dork, I was shocked to see my high school classmates give themselves over to absolute pleasure in a way I'd never suspected as I tried to blend in with them for those years. I quit that job a few months later (trying to go to college while working until 3:30 AM every Friday and Saturday proved to be a Sword of Damocles however exhilarating it was viscerally). But I never forgot the fresh faces of my classmates in throes of that rush of lust from the pelvic thrust. I realized no matter who you are or where you go, you can always be seduced by the sonic transducer. So I shook off the nice guy pathology of Brad and determined to never dream it, always be it. Just went to see the way they do it now a few weeks ago with the Sins O' The Flesh cast at the Nuart Theatre in West Los Angeles. Happily it was more or less as I'd left it a decade or so before ... a perfectly lovely mixture of hopeless nerds and hipper-than-ever scenesters, virgins and de-flowerers. Enchant indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>all those things have been important for ages, many wise men have known it before, philosophies and religions have been built around them, the search for pleasure keeps going in every thing that lives on earth, and apparently in other planets as well, perhaps Epicurus was an alien from a planet where hedonism is religion, wearing lingerie is all right and rock &amp; roll rules. So what if after watching this film you might consider wearing stockings, make up, do some dancing or maybe do someone, it's all right in transsexual Transylvania. So the songs are great and Tim Curry should have won an Oscar for this performance, he really was being it as a sweet transvestite from transsexual Transylvania.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the few movies that you can replay and enjoy time and time again - the cast is just perfect ! No wonder that it is the cult movie that it is. Tim Curry as Dr. Frank n Furter is brilliant, brilliant! Susan Sarandon as Janet and Barry Bostwick as Brad are ideally cast as country bumpkins about to get the ride of their lives. And who can possibly fault the supporting cast portraying Riff Raff, Columbia, Magenta and the divine but empty creation, Rocky?. The songs are unforgettable and never fail to lift the spirits and gets the feet tapping. I make a point of attending every stage play revival in my country and never come away without feeling just so little better about the world and the curved balls it is inclined to throw at you from time to time.Dudley.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unexpectedly Genius (Must Watch)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On paper The Rocky Horror Picture Show had everything that would suggest a poor movie. Small actors (Susan Sarandon became the massive A-lister after), low budget, niche target audience and what was then a crazy concept, a musical parody of 50's and 60's b-movies and horror films that didn't take itself seriously. This is quickly establish in the opening credits, featuring a dark background with blood red credits along with the track Science Fiction/Double Feature (which is reminiscent of the main theme from Ruggero Deodato's Cannibal Holocaust, suggesting TRHPS may have struck a chord with horror fans worldwide). Going into the film all I wanted to do was dislike it, expecting it to be a tacky, camp musical thats just agonising to watch. Sadly (or not on the other hand) this was not the case. All the factors for which it could be disliked blend together beautifully to create a masterpiece. Its hard not to sing-a-long (even if it is in your head, as in my case) to such upbeat perfect songs such as "The Time Warp" and "Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me" and Meat Loaf's "Hot Patootie". Throughout the film, you'll struggle to conceive what is going on and by the time Dr.Scott comes, along with the ending the film goes beyond silly. But that just makes you love the film even more, particularly the scene where Dr.Scott's wheelchair becomes attracted to a magnet operated by Frank N Furter(A rather convenient name, as its a phallic object and pokes fun at his androgynous look) and goes all around the house including Magenta in a bath tub twice, as she fails to bat an eyelid, furthering the comedy of the film. After the camp and kitsch ending where Riff-Raff kills Colombia and Frank N Furter with what is quite clearly a TV Ariel, you cant help but feel that the film was silly and ridiculous but also a comedy and masterpiece. For this reason, I'm going to have to agree that the film is worthy of it's cult classic status and is also quite possibly the greatest musical film ever (In my opinion Phantom Of The Opera (2004) and Mamma Mia are 2nd and 3rd respectively). This really is one film you have to see, its more than just a film, it's an experience!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rocky Horror Picture Show is a strange sort of film. This is not because one of the main characters is a transvestite from outer space or because it has inspired a following that congregates on Fridays or Saturdays at midnight or even because the highly regarded Susan Sarandon got her start here. It's strange because in all it's oddness, it's actually good. It's also achieved a certain fan base that has worked Rocky Horror into modern culture. Dare I say, it's a classic.A classic does not necessarily mean it was better than the rest of the films that came out that year. It's a classic because it is something that was so different and memorable that it sticks with you over time. It's not just because of the audience participation midnight shows either. Rocky Horror Picture is campy fun with a good soundtrack to boot.The film (and the play it's based on) is both a send up and tribute to horror films. At the same time, it seems inspired by the sexual exploration of the day. While it dwells on sexuality on a larger than life scale, the film's openness of this exploration is a sign of the time it was made. The characters of Brad and Janet seem like they are ripped out of the opening scene of Night of the Living Dead. Brad has those glasses and never does seem to get the right words out, looking bound to stumble into trouble. Janet, meanwhile, is the lovey dovey blonde. Their weaknesses allow them to stumble into temptation quite easily.But the star, of course, is Tim Curry, who shamelessly prances around the screen as Dr. Frank N. Furter, singing such classics as "Sweet Transvestite" and "Rose Tint My World" with impeccable quality. He's never had a sweeter role that utilized his musical talent. The rest of the cast is rounded out by a lovely ensemble, including Meat Loaf's memorable cameo as Eddie belting out the rockabilly inspired "Hot Patootie." The music, by Richard O' Brien, is brilliant. Although funny, this was a musical that broke conventions by fusing it's naughty dialogue with a non traditional mostly rock n' roll soundtrack. It's not without sentiment either. "Dammit Janet" is funny and a cute profession of love, while "There is A Light" merges ironic hope to a tearful lament. Then there's the dance number. You know - "The Time Warp." It's a classic that even people who don't know Rocky Horror know this one.Then would you believe the film has a moral? In all it's sick brilliance, it still manages to churn out a theme about lost innocence and temptation. Watch the movie again - laugh as you always do. Yell at the screen. But remember, there is a work of art here. Oft referenced, parodied, and played every Friday and Saturday night somewhere, The Rocky Horror Picture Show has become part of our culture. And yes, I would say it's a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had seen horror musical Sweeney Todd by Tim Burton, and then I saw this cult classic based on the play, I was very impressed. It is a very good send-up of old horror flicks, including Frankenstein, haunted house mysteries, sci-fi clichs and Carry On sexual identity confusion. Basically newly engaged Janet Weiss (young rising star Susan Sarandon) and Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) have their car break down, and they wind up at the castle of Dr. Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry), a transvestite alien from the planet Transsexual in the galaxy of Transylvania (lol). They also meet brother and sister Riff Raff (Richard O'Brien, who wrote the play) and Magenta (Patricia Quinn), and they have come on a "special night", Frank's creation is to be born. This creature, Rocky Horror (Peter Hinwood) lives successfully, and after a quick burst in, Frank kills his last creation, rebel Eddie (Meat Loaf). Then in comes rival scientist, and Eddie's uncle, Dr. Everett Von Scott (Jonathan Adams), and Frank is chasing and freezing everyone. The finale, where Frank plans to go back home to Transylvania, and it becomes a floor show (where everyone must be hypnotised), and in the end, Frank and Columbia ('Little' Nell Campbell) die horrifyingly, and the house blasts off, Brad, Janet and Dr. Scott survive with torn clothes and battered bodies. In between, The Criminologist (Diamonds Are Forever's Charles Gray) is commenting on the incidents. Also starring Jeremy Newson as Ralph Hapschatt, Hilary Labow as Betty Munroe Hapschatt and Christopher Biggins as a Transylvanian. The songs (of course all performed by the actors themselves) are all rocking and rich, in particular: "Sweet Transvestite", "The Time Warp" and "Touch-a Touch-a Touch Me", Curry and Sarandon stand out from all the other actors and characters, it is a treat musical. Susan Sarandon was number 25 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and the film was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Musicals. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is summarized on one of Frank's lines... "In another dimension, with voyeuristic intentions".Whilst some describe it merely as a twisted version of Frankenstein, I'd say it's a totally new film concept. It's lack of common sense and morals is replaced with erotism and sexiness. You should understand American sarcasm to live the Rocky Horror experience to its fullest!Irreverent, irrelevant and irrational, this film's voyeuristic intentions will absolutely fascinate anyone who's sick of rubbish Hollywood movies and looking for some good laughs. I strongly recommend you have a lighted joint on each hand, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a well-known cult classic. I only just watched this and I have to say it was crazy and out of control but it was very funny. This movie doesn't really have a plot to it, just about an engaged couple that have a breakdown and must visit the residence of Dr. Frank-N-Furter. After that, they just sing songs and do a whole lot of crazy stuff. It is really good fun to watch. And when you do watch it, you will find yourself doing the time warp and singing the Hot Patootie. The "Sweet Transvestites" song was disturbing.I really hope this comes back into the theaters because it will be even better at the theaters. This has taken place as one of my favourite comedies. If you haven't seen it then buy the 25th anniversary edition. Trust me, you'll love it. 5/5.</fullReview>

This cult classic beings innocently enough, but don't be fooled. You will soon be engulfed in one of the wildest movies ever made. I can't even begin to count the amount of times I have seen this. It is my favorite movie of all time. As soon as the end credits begin to scroll up the screen I am tempted to hit the rewind button and begin the wild ride all over again. The movie world would not be the same without the RHPS. There is nothing like it, trust me! If you're a movie lover and are looking for something a little...different, you'll love this!

		<fullReview>Up until a few weeks ago, I have never watched this film, and was told by certain people that I have not lived life, until I see this movie. So I went out an bought the movie on DVD, and instantly fell in love with it.Considered the longest running film in theaters do this date, this is just a fantastic movie to watch.Basically a young couple's car breaks done, and they must call for assistance. The come to the weird house of Dr. Frank-N-Furter and his weird house guests.The couple meets Dr. Frank-N-Furter a bisexual cross dresser, who creates Rocky, and they also meet Eddie (at the time an then unknown Beat Loaf).This film is not really for every body. If you are over 18 by all means watch this film. It's a musical, and it's a fairly long movie, but overall you should enjoy it. If a movie theater near you plays it, go see it.</fullReview>

The Songs are catchy and you will soon be singing the songs over and over in your head, whether your driving to work or your sitting in a classroom. RHSP is loved by so many people and i don't think any other musical such movie could be as outstanding as this movie could. So if you haven't saw this movie yet, i suggest you see it, you will love it. So enter the time-warp and have a jump to the left.' &amp;#9829;Tanya&amp;#9829; -r.h.s.p is love</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine a young couple in the mid-seventies, which just got engaged and takes now a journey to tell their closest friends about their future-plans. This is what Brad and Janet do on rainy and cloudy night. As of course in every horror movie, no matter if comedy or not, they have a blow-out. To find help they go to a castle, where they meet rather strange characters, such as Columbia, Magenta, Riff Raff and of course Dr.Frank'N Furter. This is the stuff that makes a great and enormously funny movie. Totally weird and so unexpected that all the while you really can have no idea what is about to happen next. Even if you would expect the craziest things you can imagine, you would still be wrong. Next to that the amazing set just makes someone believe the entire story, even though it is more than, as already said, crazy. The set and costumes are colorful and beautifully happy! The cast as well gives you the thrills! There is of course Tim Curry, who is just stunning and has the greatest mimic of all actors ever been on screen. There is the wonderful Susan Sarandon, who plays the shy little Janet makes everything the character does really believable. Everyone else who was also part of this great cast just gives his or her parts to make this movie a cult-classic-must-see-movie!!!!SO WATCH IT!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you haven't seen The Rocky Horror Picture Show before(live, DVD, whatever) then SKIP this review. No amount of words I could use would do it justice and you really must experience it for yourself.The Joe Cool Review: The Rocky Horror Picture Show(1975)Starring: Tim Curry as Dr. Frank N Furter(A scientist), Susan Sarandon as Janet Weiss(A heroine), Barry Bostwick as Brad Majors(A hero), Richard O'Brien as Riff Raff(A handyman), Patricia Quinn as Magenta(A domestic), Little Nell as Columbia(A groupie), Johnathan Adams as Dr. Everett V Scott(A rival scientist), Peter Hinwood as Rocky Horror(A creation), Meat Loaf as Eddie(Ex Delivery Boy), Charles Gray as The Criminologist(An expert)Plot: A newly engaged couple get a flat tire outside of a castle. They enter to use the phone and become involved with Dr. Frank N Furter, a transvestite who is about to unveil his creation. What happens next is a bizarre series of encounters with the occupants of the castle, sexual and otherwise.Openers: Let's get to the "review". I say review loosely because Rocky Horror is not a movie you review on it's quality. If we reviewed it as a movie, well, it's not that good of a movie. Memorable songs yes, but the whole thing is so bizarre and out there that you can't watch it as a movie.The Good: The songs are the most memorable part of this movie. Whether it's the worst love song ever(Dammit Janet) or the popular Time Warp. My personal favorites would be Time Warp and Sweet Transvestite. Both are really catchy, but most of the songs are. Speaking of which, who would have thought Susan Sarandon could SING? She does, several times. It's not bad either. Meat Loaf also has a memorable role here, and a memorable song. All this time I only thought of him as Bitch-tits Bob from Fight Club. Now he's also Eddie, who loves Rock and Roll. Tim Curry is fantastic as Frank, but I have a soft spot for him anyway(He did play both Darkness in Legend and Pennywise in IT, after all). There are also quite a few laughs in here as well.The Bad: This movie is really out there. It may not be suitable for those who don't like cross-dressing, homosexuals, transvestites from Transylvania and other things of that nature. Or if you're offended by Meat Loaf. This movie can be very offense to those who take it seriously(and if you do, shame on you). Plus it's just not that good. The story and whatnot. But it's not a movie you view objectively anyway. Go in with an open mind and enjoy the hell out of it.The Ugly: Guys in wheelchairs with garters on! Yikes!Final Verdict: It's hard as hell to objectively review this, and so I didn't really. Just pointed out what I liked and what others may not like. Again...the best way to watch this is live. I recommended viewing it, but definitely don't rent it on DVD unless there's just not a way to watch it Live. Even then, get together with a group of friends and watch it, preferably some who have seen it before who can show you all about audience participation. Highly Recommended.Rating: For entertainment value, this gets *****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Schitzo's Review of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rocky Horror Picture Show has become on of the greatest Midnight Movies of all time (number first place for me, second place being Night of the Living Dead). The story is plain and simple and spoofs all the dumb science fiction movies of the 1950's. It works wonders ans a musical, with songs like Double Feature, Dammit Janet, There's a Light, Time Warp, Sweet TTransvestite, I can make you a man, Hot Patootie, Bless My Soul, Toucha, Toucha, Toucha, Touch Me, Eddie, Wise up, Don't Dream it, Be it, and I'm going Home. The movie starts with Brad Majors and Janet Weiss are caught in the rain with a flat tire and decide to go a couple miles back up the road to see if they can get help from the castle they passed. They shouldn't have done that. At the castle the y meet Riff Raff, a faithful handyman, Magenta, the maid, and Columbia, the Mistress. Then we meet the one and only Dr. Frank N Furter, a transvestite who is very open about his sexuality and Frank has just finished a creation AKA monster that he names Rocky Horror who looks just like a muscle man. Brad and Janet lose sight of their sexualities that night but something cosmic definitely happened. The cast is fantastic with Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarrandon as Brad and Janet, Peter Hinwood as Rocky Horror, Patricia Qinn and Richard o' Brien (the writer of the original story) as Brother and Sister Magenta and Riff Raff, Meatloaf and Little Nell as Eddie and Columbia and Tim Curry as Dr Frank N Furter. All in all the cast does wonders with this "rock opera" that became a cult classic and one of the most greatest Midnight Movies ever to grace our presence.3 out of 4 stars</fullReview>

If you really understand the meaning of the movie, it can be very powerful. Yes it is about transsexual aliens, but it is also about humanity, love, and the desire to be human and to have love. It's about not waisting the opportunities of the present, and trying to live as fully as possible. It has a diverse cast, witty lines, fantastic music, and a fabulous spirit. The last line of the movie is one that will stay with me forever. I won't spoil it, but it is an incredible line.

		<fullReview>If you're into comedy, science fiction, and sarcastic horror; this movie is for you. The Rocky Horror Picture Show is truly one of the best movies that's ever been made, and one that I've ever seen.It's about a couple that just got engaged, Brad and Janet. They were driving to see their friend, Dr. Scott when they get a flat tire on the way. Since they saw a castle on the way, they get out of their car and go to see if they can use their phone. Turns out that when they get there, there's a festival for Dr. Frank-N-Furter, a transsexual mad scientist, going on. He's created a man named Rocky and that was the night when he was to be completed. Brad and Janet stay at the castle overnight and are forced into exploring their own sexualities without even really knowing it. What goes on in the castle over their period of time? You'll have to watch the movie to find out...There's lots of points to this movie, so it's sort of difficult to explain it all. But really, it's a wonderful movie and you'll have to see it if you never have. It's become a popular movie over the past couple of years, even though it was always popular, I find more people who've already seen it and love it. And not all of them have lived during the time that movie was made. Tim Curry has an excellent performance as Dr. Frank-n-Furter and he plays up the character's personality very well. Other people starring in this movie are Richard O'Brien and Susan Sarandon.</fullReview>

Before your eyes, the story unfolds of Dr. Frank-N-Furter; a more-than-your-typical mad scientist whose greatest desire is to create a muscle man for our "sweet transvestite" to have sexual relations with. Throw in an Egor-based handyman, a Bride-of-Frankenstein look-alike domestic, a few average American citizens, some Transsexual Transylvanians, classic rock n' roll- based music, and of course heaps of sex-related material, and you've got The Rocky Horror Picture Show! Warning: This movie is not for everyone!Considering the amount of sexual references (although no more than nipples are ever really exposed), those who oppose homosexuality, trans-sexuality, incest, (or roughly any kind of sexuality) need to steer clear!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>yet again as a young person, i love this movie. My friends and i did a "lipsynch" performance at our school to the song "Time Warp" and got 2nd place.I vowed after that day to buy the DVD. IT'S THE BEST!!!! The first time i watched the movie my mom had just rented the old school version(aka VHS) and told me that" i should so watch it.. it's the best... my first R rated movie" . To understand the movie you must have a little bit of personality. It's a good way to test if someone's a complete conformist, because if they are they'll hate the movie until you say otherwise. If you're really stuck up and ,i hate to say it, have a one track mind i doubt you'll like this. But that's just people that lack a soul and brain. It's so much better when you're watching it with friends, making comments, having fun, singing along... it's a really involved movie, well to me. If you can sit through the whole hour and 30 minutes and stay absolutely silent...i'd suggest to your family to call a hospital..because you've died. RHPS is for the strongly opinionated, different, and the strange... which i totally fit in with. No matter how many people bad talk this movie, i completely suggest that everyone watch it at least once before they can actually disrespect it. BTW the UK version is no better it just includes about 1 minutes of extra song.... really crappy song.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie can be taken apart and examined or simply enjoyed for it's hedonistic goodness. It's up to you! The songs are catchy, the jokes are funny, and once memorized, you are automatically part of the small, but close knit, Rocky Horror Cult!!! So basically, there's these two kids, Brad and Janet, who decide to get married. On a trip to see the professor in whose class they met, their car breaks down and they stumble onto a spooky castle. They go in, hoping to use the phone and leave peacefully. NO SUCH LUCK. They meet the diabolical transvestite, Dr. Frank N. Furter, who forces them to explore their deepest, darkest desires. I'd recommend this movie to anyone looking for something unlike anything they've ever experienced. It's a great spoof of campy horror movies with some messages about sexuality and stuff... dissect and enjoy, and do the Time Warp gleefully with the scary actors...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie, it makes me dance along with the characters from the film. You will defiantly enjoy this classical musical. It is one of the best. The entire script is brilliant. When you first step into Frankenfurter's mansion you get many sensations. It made me feel like I stepped into a haunted house of Rock and Roll. Like I said this movie is brilliant. It is smooth and never loses it's momentum. This film is based on the stage show in England and Tim Curry did play in it. So, you can say that The Rocky Horror Picture Show is what started Curry's career as a comedic actor. Unfortunately, the only time you hear from him is on cartoons. He is now doing voices for cartoon characters on t.v. shows.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to wonder just how uptight people have to be to NOT like this show? After seeing it for the first time I ran straight to the mall to pick up a copy and then watched it every day until I knew every word of every scene! Absolutely hilarious and contagious! Occasionally I find someone who can't "get into" it and I have wonder if there is something wrong with them OR something especially twisted about myself! If you are into "funny" and not too sexually uptight, then you will love this cult classic! It was so affective that my (now ex) husband who is totally hetero said that HE would "DO" Frankenfurter! The DVD version slightly differs from the VHS in some musical parts, but this show is one that will be remembered and replayed thru the years. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rather naughty musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not having seen this epic movie for a few years, it ill behoves me to make any criticism, but rather to advise potential viewers of the incredible enjoyment this movie offers.A parody of the Hammer genre but transposed to the US, a send up of American musicals, and by inference the American way of life, this is one of the few movies to generate a cult following, the inculcated celebrating each showing by gyrating in the aisle, suitably Gothicly attired.The references visually and musically are arresting, Sarandon is seductive, Meatloaf almost believable, Currie achingly camp, but overarching is the genius of Richard O'Brien, author of the original play, and here playing a pivotal role.Not for the under 23s or the over 50s, go see this movie, not on video or DVD, but at a cinema, preferably after midnight, and hopefully with some suitably attired fans, ready to leap into the aisles when the command goes out "Let's do the time warp again"Enjoy.</fullReview>

I just went and rented it myself and i was instantly hooked. The movie is obviously very fantasy filled but who wouldn't like seeing Tim curry in fishnets? The cast of characters is a nice variety of fun, eccentric types all with good dance moves and voices. Shocking to see Susan Sarandon in her early years and being so risqu. This is by far the best musical and Tim Curry's enthusiasm is contagious. Since my first viewing, i have since seen it at least a dozen times, and will probably see it more. It overall is just a fun sing along, great for any get together. It really gets people excited. All ages, all genders will enjoy-I know I did!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Absolute Pleasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're able to give yourself over to the schlocky pleasures of old sci fi and horror pictures, you'll probably love "The Rocky Horror Picture Show," a tongue-in-cheek, cross-dressing valentine to the type of features once shown on the late show or at drive-ins (and what better way to send up the camp of B-movies than through the camp of drag?) While seeing this movie in a theatre with a participating audience is a lot of fun, I disagree that this is the only way to really enjoy it: in fact you'd be well advised to watch it at home first, because otherwise you'll find it hard to follow the story with a noisy audience throwing rice and toast at the screen. Even without such distractions, the plot can be a bit hard to follow at times, what with the (wonderful) distractions of songs such as "The Time Warp" and "Whatever Happened to Saturday Night?" but in a nutshell it involves a sweet but uptight young couple who learn to loosen up one rainy night when they end up at the castle of a Transylvanian, transvestite scientist and his kinky entourage of servants, old and new lovers and hangers-on. To say as others have suggested that the film is a celebration of bisexuality seems accurate enough, but it also makes the film seem more earnest than it is?besides, half of the happily bisexual cast ends up dead! If I had to chose stand-out moments, besides the aforementioned songs I'd pick Frankenfurter's near simultaneous seductions of Brad and Janet, Dr. Scott's first enraptured gaze at his fishnet stocking-clad leg, and Richard O'Brien's sly, sexy turn as the butler Riff Raff (perhaps because everyone else is so over the top, the scenes in which he subtly flirts with his lover--and sister--Magenta are among the most genuinely erotic in the film).A must-see for anyone who likes offbeat films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Normally different.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The term "Never judge a book by it's cover" could easily be used for this film. To some, it just a bunch of homosexual content just because of Tim Curry being a sweet Tranvestite, but to viewers who give it a chance, they may find a film that's normally different.The film starts off at a wedding, goes into the first song almost immediately after the theme song, and then it goes into what could clearly be the most predictable idea in the movie. From the beginning sequence to that time, you may almost want to shut the movie off, but it gets better. After Brad and Janet head to the big manor, and engaging into yet another song, they finally get into the old mansion and soon experience a group of people who are weirder than the extras of a Marilyn Manson music video, then they meet the head master, Dr. Frank N. Furter (Played by the brilliant Tim Curry) and find out about his new invention, but that's just the beginning, to anyone reading this, I'll leave the rest to your mind, or rent the movie and see for yourself.I saw this movie on a movie channel not to long ago, of course, I had never seen it before, I had heard of it from a friend of mine, but never seen it before, when I saw it, I wondered why I hadn't seen it sooner.The film does come off as weird, very musical, a bit disturbing, colorful, and with lyrics that are as great as they are funny, it's a laugh fest for the rest of the film. Some may look at Tim Curry as being extremely weird, and like I said, almost the whole movie comes off that way, but when it gets to the second to last song "I'm going home" preformed by Tim Curry yet again, it almost feels like the whole film is human, even though it's rather sci-fi, with the slow sad or love songs in the film, you feel a little bit of sorrow towards these characters who are trapped in this place and are in a predicament unlike any other.with songs like: "Sweet Transvestite", "Dammit Janet", "Hot Patootie", "wise up Janet Weiss" and many more, there's nothing to dislike, better than all the musicals I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILERS WITHIN* I've been watching Rocky Horror ever since I was younger and (since then) it has always been a favorite of mine. From the intro of the lips to Frank's death, I was shocked by it all. However, the one thing that always upsets me is how many people like the movie WITH Audience Participation. I've seen it with an audience quiet a few times and although it's fun, it takes away the charm of the movie. Some people I know that have seen it in a theater a few times don't even know what it's about but just like to "yell at the screen". So for those who are similar, here goes.The movie's plot starts off with a young couple, Brad Majors and Janet Weiss, who have just gotten engaged. They decide that they are going to visit their old friend Dr. Scott. In so doing, their car gets a flat and seek help at a nearby caste. They are greeted by Riff Raff, a servant of the house, and his sister Magenta and soon enough a whole set of Transylvanians and Frank n' Furtur himself.But anyway, if you're interested in the movie, you should consider seeing it in your own home rather than a theater, first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest movies of all time! It has the audience sitting on the edge of their seat the entire movie! The Rocky Horror Picture Show has an amazing line up of actors including Tim Curry (best movie I have seen him in yet) and every actor plays the role of their character extremely well. And the soundtrack to The Rocky Horror Picture show lets you actually see what is going on in the movie. You'll find yourself singing all of the songs and dancing along with the Transylvanians during the "Time Warp". After watching it for the first time, it is also fun to go to the extra features and turn on the audience partici.....pation (any RHPS fan understands that)track.The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a great display of what the 70's was all about; sex, drugs, and rock and roll. (well maybe not the drugs part, but definitely the rock and roll part). If you have never seen the movie, then go rent it RIGHT NOW! Actually, you'd better buy it...you will love it too much to take it back once you've seen it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rocky Horror is most definitely my favorite movie/musical. It is such a different kind of movie, you can't help but not like it. The music is original and the plot is out-of-the-ordinary to say the least. You either love this movie or hate it. If this movie isn't good, then why has it lasted in theaters for the past 30 years? So if you haven't seen it, WATCH IT!. I promise, you will like it. The movie takes place in Denton, C.A. where a couple goes through strange events in a castle that is owned by a very peculiar scientist and kept tidy by a weirdo butler and his "sister". The dialogue is corny on purpose but the look and costuming of the movie is greatly entertaining. ENJOY!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rocky Horror picture show is unquestionably the most original, quixotic, most fun you can possibly have in one place... Over and over and over. I was about thirteen when the Rocky Horror h it the Roxy on Bloor Street in Toronto. It was a surrealistic experience, (still is more than twenty five years later) with everyone decked out ala Frank'n'furter, Brad &amp; Janet, Rocky Horror (you didn't see too many of those in the winter!), Magenta, etc... all of them. Imitation is the greatest form of flattery, that you can bestow upon anyone;(particularly with this cast of considerable nobodies, four of whom grew into very famous people - I don't know about the rest). Even though and especially since it was outlandish, tacky,harmless, fun, made it all the more memorable. Throwing toast all over a theatre is something you wouldn't ordinarily do ANYWHERE you were, but it was okay to do it at the Roxy. I've seen the movie and heard my CD thousands of times, but it only continues to top my list of favorites. We salute those who hung out at the Frankenstein Place. And the Roxy.</fullReview>

The dancing really brings you back to the time it was recorded, and you feel like you're one of the Translyvanians too.

		<fullReview>This movie was made for us, a specific generation that grew to young adulthood at a certain time. It was a breaking away from convention. It made us look at ourselves differently. That we enjoyed it was a surprise to ourselves. The thought that a silly low-budget movie could impact a whole generation is ridiculous, right? Except that it did. The fact that I'm here, writing this, almost 30 years later is proof of that. Rocky Horror took us to new places in our mind. If you just watch it, you miss it. You have to experience it. The movie is more fun than funny. It's like a carnival ride. First-timers are virgins. You pay the fare then go for the ride. It's so much fun, you do it again, and it's more fun the second time. Even 30 years later, I still take the ride from time to time. Mike</fullReview>

There were no deep thoughts involved with this movie. This movie often leaves one questioning what in fact they are actually watching, and that is the beauty of it. It is a fun, dark comedy which thrives on sexuality and music. I now watch this movie and wish I could be a part of it. The humor is wonderful. The characters are memorable, especially Tim Curry as the transsexual Dr. Frank N Furter. The music is the kind that gets stuck in ones head. It is a cult classic and after nearly thirty years of being on screen it is still going strong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading the other comment posted concerning this film, I felt I had to write. Yeah, Rocky Horror is an over-rated cult classic. At the same time, though, it is entertaining and amusing. You have to take into account that it was written by Richard O'Brien as a play, which took off in London long before it was filmed. When one just looks at the film itself and its plot, it is ridiculous. What makes it fun is the aura surrounding it. I must say that the only times I have seen it (which I can't count on both hands), there has been a second cast present, of local young adults performing along with the film. This increases audience participation and makes the experience worthwhile. Besides, I really enjoyed seeing Tim Curry running around in a teddy and high heels. If you can take the film as more of the joke that it is, and if you are open to people running around in all sorts of outfits, having sex with everyone, it is a great way to spend a Saturday night.</fullReview>

It may not make sense the first time you see it, but watch it a couple more times and you will get it. It isn't a simple movie, that is for sure. The songs are addictive. You will find yourself doing the "Time Warp" at the most random places! Or at least wanting to! Besides being a good musical, this movie is also a good comedy. You will find yourself laughing just as much as Frank sings in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie to be very original(though loosely based on the story of Frankenstein).A couple of average, everyday Americans, Janet Weiss and Brad Majors, had been a part of their friends', Betty Monroe and Ralph Hapschatt's wedding, when, on their way to visit their old school teacher, Dr. Evrett Scott("VON SCOTT!") when they have flat. "Didn't we pass a castle a few miles up the road?" They decide to venture out to see if the owners of the castle have a phone they could use. Riff-Raff, played by Richard O'Brien, answers the door, weirding Janet and Brad out a little. They enter, to find a party going on. "Are you having a party?" "It's one of the master's affairs." Soon, we find out who this "master" is. It's Dr. Frank N. Furter, played by Tim Curry, a "sweet" transvestite alien who had come to earth to create a "perfect" man, Rocky Horror, played by Peter Hinwood.There are other characters: Columbia, a tap-dancing, pink-haired groupie, played by Little Nell. Eddie, the half-brained(literally), old-fling of Frank's, the (ex)delivery boy, played by Meat Loaf. The Criminologist(or Narrator), played by Charles Gray. Magenta, the German-accented domestic, played by Patricia Quinn.Now, this movie isn't for everyone. Those who hate it are really close minded to the experience. It's about the freedom to express who and what you really are: a freak.I give this 8.5/10 stars. To me, it never gets old. And, if it's so disgusting or so bad, then why has it never once stop showing in theaters, since it's opening in 1975, 29 years ago?Cast: Dr. Frank N.

		<fullReview>I watched this movie when I was nine years old. Saw it on VH1's Halloween Special. Needless to say, even at such an early age, I became a RHPS loon. You watch this film, and know why its #2 on the top ten cult films nationwide. (I can't believe it lost first to This Is Spinal Tap. What a GYP!) It accurately portrays the worst of every B-film out there. That's what they're trying to convey. You've got the mad scientist, the 'innocent bystanders', the creepy servants, the narrator, 'delivery boy', the good doctor, and then every thing goes wrong in the end, thus enabling the servants to go free. you even have a wedding. well, the end of one. and, of course, sex. can't forget that. when watching this, you must keep in mind that its all for sihts and giggles. thats what makes cult and campy fun. hey, it bombed at the box office whenever it was first released. but its more then made up that debt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I watched The Rocky Horror Picture Show was a real let-down. This was in 1975, after having had my fill of The Rocky Horror Show in the King's Road Theatre. Goodness knows, I had seen the stage show so many times and knew every nuance of every actor, from Tim Curry and Meatloaf, to Little Nell, and, of course Richard O'Brien himself.As each actor changed (the stage show ran and ran) so did the performances. Little did I know that I was caught up in the making of a cult. We would dine at the trendy Borsch &amp; Tears if we had time before the show, and scoff Donner Kebabs on the way home, often rubbing shoulders with the cast and crew. On the final night in the King's Road, Richard O'Brian threw a party. Johnny Rotten wore his Suzuki Sweater inside out (ooh ? the little rebel) and we all had a fine time. Stage props, including the ushers' transparent masks, Rocky's black knickers, suspender belt and stockings, and Dr. Everett Scott's wheelchair all ended up at my house!So what was the problem with the film? Well, nothing, but I guess, at the time, the stage show was so exceptionally good; filled with atmosphere and unexpected interpretation by the cast, that it made the film seem second best! Now when I watch the picture show it brings back the glow of my misspent youth, and the great times we had; Hot patootie, bless my soul! I really love that rock n' roll!The scene is set when Brad Majors, and his fiance, Janet Weiss (a couple of ordinary college kids) get a flat tyre on a dark, wet, lightening-filled night and go to the nearest house to use the phone.The door of the Gothic Transylvanian-style mansion is answered by Dr. Frank n Furter's butler/handyman ? a punk rocker named Riff Raff (Richard O'Brien).On entering the house they are subjected to an internecine night of deceit, and sexual trickery that introduces them both to carnal knowledge ? not of each other, but of Dr. Frank n Furter (Tim Curry), the bisexual scientist who is making Rocky "a man, with blond hair and a tan'.The film cleverly blends references to the American Movie Theater of the late 1930's with sci-fi, monster, horror flicks and musicals! Performances by the maids Little Nell (Columbia) and Patricia Quinn (Magenta) stand up well against the overwhelming presence of Tim Curry. Richard O'Brien (who wrote the play, music and lyrics) brings his own personality to the film.Susan Sarandon (later famed for her superb performance in another cult film, Thelma &amp; Louise) plays excellently as the virgin fiance who is a little more willing to experiment than her geeky partner Brad (Barry Bostwick). Meatloaf is Eddy ? ex delivery boy who is the Geezer from the Freezer, one of Dr. Frank n Furter's failed experiments.There is an uncreditied appearance by Koo Stark, and even Christopher Biggins sneaks into the cast as a Transylvanian!The Rocky Horror Picture is destined to run and run ? the 25th anniversary DVD has been released, and in 25 years from now we will all be going out to buy the 50th Anniversary version with 3D and Smell-o-Vision!Maybe not a film to watch with the family, but if you like it, you will want to watch it again and again; if you don't like it, well? at least you won't forget it!'It's not easy having a good time! Even smiling makes my face ache!'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably one of the few movies that actually have to be seen in a cinema to properly enjoy. First saw it at three in the morning as part of an all-nighter, and even given the late hour was left feeling totally cold and very confused.Saw it again with an audience who were familiar with the movie, and loved it to bits. The plot, far from being confusing, is a cross between innocents-in-peril and Frankenstein. Performances are larger than life, and songs perfectly acceptable in a warped way. Tim Curry is priceless, chewing up the scenery to great affect, and I still have a crush on Susan Sarandon's Janet.The audience participation makes a viewing more of a social occasion than any other movie, and can be a bit challenging for those expecting a normal passive viewing - I advise you to go with the flow, and, as Frank'n'furter says, "Give yourself over to absolute pleasure".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, but padded out.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, let me just say that I love this film. But I'll admit it does have its faults. First, the good points. It's a spot-on spoof of those terrible old B-movies, from the terrible special effects to the ridiculous story to the wooden characters. Yes, it's pointless and dumb, but it's meant to be. Watch 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' or 'The Blob' and you'll see what the makers were getting at. It's funny in the same way- ridiculous lines like, "This sonic transducer- it is I suppose some kind of audio-vibratory physio-molecular transport device?" and "Throw open the switches on the sonic oscillator- and step up the reactor power input three more points!" that can't possibly be taken seriously abound. The look of the film is unique. Apart from the costume and makeup, the background is full of references to art, film and history while at the same time looking wonderfully cheap. There is an unsettling confusion over time and place (it takes place on a "late November evening", yet Nixon's resignation speech is playing on the radio) and this is helped by the editing- is it deliberately bad? And there are some excellent musical numbers which are definitely a triumph of style over substance- not that this is a bad thing. Unfortunately, the film does run out of steam towards the end. It feels very heavily padded- the Criminologist seems to fulfil no function other than to state the obvious, and the last two musical numbers go on too long without being very memorable. And if you're not open minded, you may find the film's frank portrayals of homosexuality, transvestism, incest and S&amp;M disturbing. To quote about nine hundred reviewers before me, "you either get it or you don't". If this sort of thing is not your bag, you won't enjoy it. Simple as that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rocky Horror Picture Show is the essential B-movie: cheesy script, bad special effects, and odd costumes, characters, and plot lines. But despite the budget, it is a great movie. The quality of acting is amazing, the songs are excellent, and although odd and cheesy, the script is amazing. The rating it is given in the U.S is unnecessary; it is not meant to be rated R.This is one of my personal favorite movies, and it never grows old. The story is indeed timeless, being set in a fictional place, and muddling the time as it does. Because of the simplicity of the script, no matter how out of date the costumes or the newspaper becomes, it will always apply to life in the ways it can.</fullReview>

If you can't stand anything of that sort, don't watch this movie. This movie is very sensual and has some nudity. But otherwise, this movie was fun.

I could watch this move 100 times over and over again and still not get bored with it. It is absolutely hilarious. One thing I think is overlooked is the singing and songwriting which is incredibly good. The costumes were also fabulous as well as the set. This movie has pure raw humor which nobody can deny. Even in the first scene you can tell that it's a classic never to be forgotten.

And it is also on the top 10 of the more weird movies of all time (did I say it already ?). Oh, and the music is great, specially the "Time Warp" one. My favorite scene is the part where the Riff Raff goes hands up and hands down screaming "Lets do the Time Warp Again".

		<shortDescription>Delightful Cult Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard O'Brien's 1975 "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" is a delightful cult classic involving a couple in love, a man (well, this is arguable) and his creation, and a swarm of transvestites. The story of Rocky Horror began on a stage in London, and has now evolved into a cult classic delighting audiences of a certain sort all over the world. In this colorful musical comedy, the audience witnesses the adventures of the naive Brad and Janet as they spend the night in a castle due to some unfortunate circumstances. Dr. Frank-N-Furter is the head of the house, and his word goes. Supported by an assortment of domestic staff, such as Magenta, Columbia, and Riff-Raff, Frank toys with Brad and Janet, sending them on a wild ride they never dreamed of riding. The question is, will they make it through?The great Barry Bostwick plays the character of Brad Major well, if a bit one-dimensional at times. Bostwick does an acceptable job of playing the part of the young, headstrong, in-love hero. He believes he can do anything, but usually ends up doing just the opposite. Susan Sarandon is delightful as Janet Weiss, newly engaged to Brad. She is a gem to watch as this charming, naive girl discovering things she never thought possible. Tim Curry is simply wonderful as the eccentric and outrageous Dr. Frank-N-Furter, a character dead set on song, sin, and sex. A supporting cast including O'Brien as Riff-Raff, Patricia Quinn as Magenta, and Little Nell as Columbia, plus Jonathan Adams as Dr. Scott and Peter Hinwood as the title Rocky round out a magnificent group of actors. There's also an unforgettable appearance by music legend Meatloaf, which you'll want to see.One important thing to keep in mind while attending a viewing of RHPS is a suspension of disbelief. Often, things will not make sense, and the movie will seem like a load of garbage. Do not leave without seeing the entire thing; it will make more sense in the end. However, one viewing is not nearly enough to understand all the nuances of Rocky Horror. It is advisable to attend at least the first show with a RHPS veteran, as this person will be able to explain what the heck is going on.Technically speaking, this film is no "Star Wars," but it's definitely tries it's darndest. The sets are large and colorful, well lit, and suit their purpose. The sound, at times, appears random and not quite right, but it works here. Any oddness in it only adds to the individuality this movie holds. The special effects are a bit sketchy, but hey, it was 1975. This movie is not meant to be taken seriously; it's meant to entertain. RHPS's costumes are most enjoyable. Each character has an average of two distinct costumes worn throughout the movie, ranging from suits to pajamas to underclothes. Rocky Horror enthusiasts and Halloween celebrators alike have copied these costumes time and time again since the movie came out. In fact, it's tradition for theatergoers to dress up like their favorite character when attending RHPS in theatres.In addition to dressing up as characters, participating with the movie is one of the main reasons Rocky Horror as survived as long as it has. In theatres, it is standard practice for the audience to shout obscenities at the screen, get up and dance, and throw objects all over the place. For many people, this is the best part of the movie. Regardless, clean-up is not a desirable job after a showing of RHPS. For the rest of the public, Rocky Horror is definitely worth the few bucks it costs to get in. If the theatre has audience participation kits available, by all means, get one. It may feel a bit foolish at first to wear a newspaper over your head, but over time the oddness leaves.Rocky Horror is not for everyone. Children, the elderly, and the more conservative types will probably not enjoy this film. As for everyone else, it's bound to be an experience to remember. Peppered with memorable songs, imaginative costumes and set, and containing more twists than you can count on one hand, The Rocky Horror Show is not a film to miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are two types of people in this world: those who get The Rocky Horror Picture Show, and those who don't. I get it, and I love it. First time I ever saw it was on TV, and I was totally terrified. But I loved the music enough to watch it again - it wasn't until I was an avid fan of the movie that I went to a midnight showing, which is probably the most fun anyone can have with any movie. It's hard to explain Rocky Horror's appeal, because most of us who love it could never say why. We just do. For me, I think it's mostly the music. Richard O'Brien's songs are all great ("Science Fiction" being a personal favorite.)People who criticize this film to no end are obviously just afraid of it. They're generally just too uptight to let loose and yell at a screen at midnight. No, it's not a great artistic achievement and it wasn't meant to be. It's meant to be what it is - a fun show with some great songs. If you get it, great I'll see you there - if you don't, oh well, your loss.</fullReview>

I believe that it is a movie that can be appreciated by many different types of movie goers. It is a wonderfully sinful take on Rock-N-Roll, old monster movies, and the 1970's themselves. Not to mention that this movie launched the careers of Susan Sarandon and Meatloaf among others. I love the music and everything about this wonderful classic.

Also steer clear if you are adverse to pelvic thrusting, drugs, singing (good or otherwise), partial nudity or swearing of any kind.

		<fullReview>There is one reason why everyone should see `The Rocky Horror Picture Show': it is the best cult film ever made. There are also three reasons why everyone should want to watch it: 1) It is one of the only ?R' rated musicals in existence. 2) It has strong science-fiction overtones. 3) It is very funny. The movie starts Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon (before they were stars) as the recently engaged Brad and Janet. However, they are upstaged in nearly every scene by Tim Curry who plays Frank N. Furter, the mad doctor. The cast delightfully performs many memorable songs including `Over at the Frankenstein Place' and, of course, the `Time Warp'. To fully enjoy RHPS, one must not be closed minded or the picture could prove to be quite offensive. Don't think it's gratuitously violent- it isn't. Merely, the situations the characters find themselves in could shock or appall overly sensitive viewers. If you think you won't enjoy RHPS, going to a midnight screening might be your best bet. The live audience participation will guarantee you a good time, despite your opinion of the actual film. So overall, RHPS is quite a good adaptation of Richard O'Brien's original concept, which always honors its roots on the stage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For a selected few, the movie of the century.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>God knows why we love it, but some how we just can't keep our minds off this intoxicating and attractive movie. Only a selected few understand the beauty behind this film: The incredible Dr. Frank's expressions, the catchy and somehow brilliant songs, the off-beat, one-of-a-kind subject matter...It's these kind of people who have made the movie what it is today: the most influential and largest cult movie ever made. Perhaps this explains why all around the world it is still being played in theaters, of course, at midnight. Props, costumes, call lines, virgin initiation and a cast are only some of the things one can expect in theaters. The movie it self is unexplainable, and for some people, the most amazing movie ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a weird, wonderful gem!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing this legendary, campy cult musical for the first time is an experience I'm sure I will not forget for a long time. Of course, I didn't exactly walk into the viewing with an ignorant mind: I knew exactly what I was getting into (more or less - I had read an online script not too long before) and, much to my surprise and delight, I found out that it was to be playing on television one night! Never having seen the full movie before (I saw some fragments of it late one night around Halloween a few years ago - I was understandably disoriented and turned off the TV), I became very excited and looked forward to finally catching this much-worshipped "secret".Well, I'll tell you something, I sure wasn't disappointed! Far from what I had imagined when I first saw the movie's cassette cover when I was small (I vividly remember being a little creeped out.), it was an amusing and original farce from start to finish! Beautiful music, surprisingly decent acting, and a rousing last number that left me frozen speechless - I can see why this movie has garnered the phenomenal reputation it has over the past several decades. It doesn't surprise me now that people around the world flock to see this classic and participate in jam-packed theatres at midnight! In all honesty, however, I couldn't see myself being a full-fledged "participant" (although I have a fairly open mind); it would be great just to OBSERVE everything from a distance, and marvel at the sheer energy of it all!Kudos to all involved in this hilariously bad (I mean that in the most affectionate way possible) picture show. It's a great, great flick that deserves all the notoriety it gets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely the best movie ever!!!!!!!!!! Funny story, great actors, gorgeous music..., just great!!! Tim Curry is marvelous. And I think it is one of the best characters, Susan Sarandon has ever played. I've never seen movies with more charismatic actors. Every time I watch it, I'm nearly laughing myself to death. From the first second on you're fascinated and you can't evade its magic. The biggest party I joined was in a theatre which should be pulled down. Hundreds of Transylvanians were there, armed with rice, water pistols and toast. Mostly, you're not allowed to bring these things, but then it was ok. And Rocky Horror was shown in the undubbed version without subtitles, which is very rarely in Germany!!! Those of you who do speak German and ever saw the German version will probably agree with me, that most of the jokes are terminated. Funky greetings from Germany. Keep on rocking, folks!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>and personally I LOVE IT!This has a massive cult following for obvious reasons. It's satirical, funny and sexy all at the same time. Having said that, I can understand why some people would dislike it as well. It takes a certain warped(Time Warped??) sense of humour to appreciate fully.Although to say it mentally scarred you for life is going a BIT far!Richard O'Brien was truly inspired when he wrote this, and to watch Barry Bostock (Brad Majors) in Spin City nowadays just brings a smile to my face.If you enjoy Fawlty Towers, Monty Python or any other wacky humour, this is for you. If you've had a sense-of-humour bypass, then don't bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Michael Rennie was ill the day the Earth stood still, but he told where we stand"... Whoever said Rocky Horror Picture Show was bad, didn't like the music, or missed the point is really uptight. The whole point of going to those late night showings is so you're wild side can let go a little. I ask these people are you a Rocky Horror virgin*? Cause if you are, how can you judge? All I can say is when you jump up and do the time warp, something comes over you, your other half takes over and you feel amazing. The music is the greatest, very original, and it helps you escape into that freer world. It has got to be one of the musicals with the most original casting, and adding the writer as one of the actors was pure genious! Have you noticed that if you listen closely everyone has a different accent? For instance, Columbia has an Austrailian accent, Frank's got a pure Brit's accent, and Magenta's got a Romainian one. I say, remove the stick from your butt, check the listings for it and let go to your dark side. *A Rocky Horror Virgin is a person who has never been to a showing of the movie in a theatre. Videos DVDs and on TV don't count!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Misunderstood Film of All Time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[Spoilers}If you asked an RHPS fan what the film is about, the answer might likely be "Don't dream it, be it." Yet, I don't believe that is what writer Richard O'Brien intended, and the film, I think, confirms this.In the film's first scene, the wedding of Brad and Janet's friends, a sign in front of the church reads, "Be just and fear not." This seems to be Brad's credo as he and Janet begin to see Frank N. Furter turn their world upside down. "We'll play along and pull out the aces when the time is right," he says as Riff Raff and Magenta are stripping him down.What aces? He and Janet soon learn they have none. Frank controls everything, and despite a little bit of resistance, they soon are conforming to his hedonistic, "don't just dream it, be it."It looks like the film is affirming this philosophy. The "Floor Show" near the film's end becomes a show-stopping musical number with the cast as a chorus line (including even wheelchair-bound Dr. Scott!)Then, when it seems the film is over, Riff Raff and Magenta enter and announce they're taking over and Frank is their prisoner. Frank's arrogance gone now, he kisses up to his new leaders with "I'm going home." Riff Raff then reveals he intends to kill Frank, which he does along with Rocky Horror and Columbia.Riff Raff discloses no real philosophical basis for his action. The only clue is his response to Magenta's "I thought you liked them. They liked you." "They never liked me!" He has no belief in being just or living his dream. All he has is dislike--and the power.At the real end of the film, Brad and Janet lie on the ground, exhausted and confused, singing of bleeding inside. RHPS, then, truly has a pessimistic message: you've no guarantee of coming out all right whatever you believe in unless you have the power to dominate everyone around you.This is hardly the goodtime message thousands of devoted RHPS attendees see in this film, but if they did, would it have the following it does? And this is undoubtedly why the sequel, "Shock Treatment," which reflected Brad and Janet dealing with these shattering experiences, never achieved anything near the cult status of RHPS.This, of course, does not diminish my love of the film, which I view as brilliant at all levels--music, acting, writing. And I do sing along with the songs and recite some of the dialogue when I watch the film. But the film does deserve to be viewed, as a previous post indicated, as a "straight" (no pun intended) film. If so, I'm not sure everyone would get the uplift from it which is the popular belief as to what it gives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Musical I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a great musical. Not only have I seen the movie more times then I can count, but I've now become a regular goer to the stage production in Portsmouth. It's one night a year where I get to dress up and be with people that feel the same way as I do about it. I've always enjoyed musicals and this one is just the ultimate one to be a part of. If I ever get the chance to actually be in a stage production I will totally take it. I don't like it because it's a cult movie. I didn't even know it was a cult movie until about two years ago. I enjoy it because of its terrific music and amazing characters. The story line is outstanding and I hope that one day I'll be able to meet Richard O'Brien. I'm a great fan of his for the work he did writing and acting in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you ever run out of petrol in the middle of the night and the only house nearby is a grotty old building, where the butler looks like he should be in Notre Dame, I strongly advise you to stay away and do not enter the house!Clearly, Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon) and Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) hadn't taken their sensible tablet before leaving the house that night. They drive along the road and low and behold, the car breaks down in the middle of nowhere. There is one lonely house nearby and they decide to go to the house, seeking a telephone. They are greeted by Riff Raff (Richard O'Brien) who invites them into the house and proceeds to tell them about a gathering, being hosted by the master. They also meet a wild maid called Magenta (Patricia Queen). Together, Magenta and Riff Raff sing them a song that will probably be loved by every generation?. Yes it is of course, the Time Warp.After a while, a little excitement fills the air, someone is coming. The elevator is coming down to the ground floor. In it we can see a tall, long legged person, tapping their feet to the rhythm of the music. It reaches the bottom, the doors open and out steps Dr. Frank N Furter (Tim Curry). Wonderfully dressed, he (or she) greets everybody with yet another song (Sweet Transvestite). It is clear that Janet and Brad are not comfortable however, at the end of the show they have their clothes removed and are invited to the lab to see whatever is going on.Once in the lab, they see that Frank N Furter has created a life form, in the shape of a very well toned, muscular man named Rocky (Peter Hinwood). The rest of the film/show is just a series of crazy events, all orchestrated by the mad doctor and his gang of nutters, including an appearance and a song from the legendary Meatloaf. Another one of the very few stage shows which has been taken off the stage and transformed into a Hollywood blockbuster movie. This film has seen many ups and downs. It flopped many times before finally becoming one of the biggest cult movies of all time. The best thing about this movie is that it has kept most of the original cast members from when it was first put on stage in London. Tim Curry began his career playing Frank N Furter on a tiny stage in London, a few nights a week and he has gone on to be one of Hollywood's most successful actors.The music is fantastic, the dance routines are mad, the characters are brilliant and the storyline is warped; the perfect ingredients for cult madness. You will come away singing the Time Warp ? that is guaranteed!!!Another great thing about this film is the fact that the whole thing was filmed literally 2 miles from my house at Oakley Court (Better known as Frank N Furter's Mansion).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprise ending that loses nothing after 1500 viewings!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most I ever had spending 17 years seeing the same movie over and over again. Getting to act out various aspects of my own persona by playing different characters from the film helped me figure out who I am. Indeed, one could say that I became at RHPS, that in many ways I was born there. God knows it certainly got me laid a lot. And winning 3 (count 'em, 3) lifetime passes didn't hurt when it came time to deal with the box office. At one of the theatres we used, the manager even let me have the area behind the screen as an office. I thinks RHPS's glory days may be past, but for the best possible reason... In this day and age, the doors are blown off of most of the closets. Even if you can't come out about whatever makes you feel alienated publicly, there's a Yahoo Club for you. The internet provides a level of fellowship while allowing anonymity so that you can let it all hang out without getting hanged out to dry. But for some of us, the illegitimate children of the damned who came of age in Richard O'Brien's rose-tinted world, the glory of the horror will never fade to black.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight Movie Madness at it's very greatest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone and their granny has been to this movie at one time or another and it still keeps getting bigger everytime you turn around. Despite all the commercialization from Television and Video, Rocky Horror Picture Show keeps packing them in every Friday and Saturday Night at midnight. People come dressed or undressed as it maybe in full blown "Rocky Gear". They know the Time Warp better than the Electric Slide. They shout obscenities at the right moments in the film that would make Satan himself blush. The Theaters get trashed wall to wall and the theater owners sit and count out the ticket sale profits on Sunday morning. Many movie companies have tried to make their films into cult movie hits by playing them at Midnight but they just don't got what it takes. 20th Century Fox originally wanted to scrap the movie after disasterous mainstream movie goers did not show up in 1975. In 1976 Fox gave RHPS a rebirth on the Art House Movie Circuit at midnight and from that day forward things just clicked. NYC Cast (The First Rocky Horror Audience Participation Cast) gave the world it's first Audience Participation Lines ever. Nowadays new and improved A.P. Lines are cropping up all over the globe in many different languages. RHPS has led to life long friendships and even marriages. RHPS's main ingredient for being the Number 1 midnight movie draw of all time is plain and simple. "Don't Dream It.... Be it !" RHPS has come along way since 1975 and will go on and on till the very last ticket is sold and the last curtain falls.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a ridiculous movie. A high school friend recommend that I watch this. So, one night when home alone I decided to go up to the rental place and see what all the fuss was about. I sat there in horror as this innocent little love story turned into a movie about sex, rock 'n roll and more sex. I didn't know what to make of it, I only knew one thing...I HAD to watch it again. So, I did and I LOVE it! People say the plot is ridiculous, people say it's cheesy, people say it's pushing the boundaries (well, for the 70's, maybe). I say "DUH!" That's what makes it so much fun. If nothing else, watch it to see a very young Susan Sarandon in a role unlike any other she's played. (She's in her underwear for half of the movie and at one point sings a song entitled "Toucha-Toucha-Toucha Touch Me"). But, here comes the really strange part. I'm always telling people that I love this movie and they usually agree with me on that. Then I tell them I have never seen it with audience participation (although I'd like to) and they're like, "Oh....." I just like it as a straight (well, not "strai...", nevermind) movie. Finally, I must add that Richard O'Brien's music and Tim Curry's performance are definitely the highlight of this unique picture show.</fullReview>

Vaguely reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland, this film contains more oddball antics then any tea party I have ever witnessed, from drag queens to obscure musical numbers that seem endless, bizzare sub-plots, and oddly-themed activities that are supposed to take place at key moments during the film, such as holding up a hot dog when Frank N. Furter is introduced. If watching with a group of girls, be prepared for sing-along time, which can draw one close to the edge of sanity. At least pretend to enjoy it.

		<fullReview>Judging by most of the user Comments, you either Love this movie, or hate it with a passion. I can understand why becuase say this. I however contest it. I think it was a very Good Movie from what they had. Even though it was very Wierd, very hard to understand and in some places, completly outthere....it was a well made spectical. The Soundtrack and acting was excellent. I mean, who didnt like Meatloaf bellowing his mucial Tunes and Saradon singing,"oh Dirty dirty...touch me touch me". Tim curry puts up one of the best performances i have ever seen. Saradon was very Tight and Sexy giving the part of the film that Sexy edge it needs. And in the Spoof catogory, its a top 3 no doubt. It however dosen't fullfill all my pleasures. Even though the plot is clever..its still a little uneven and at times..your wondering why did he do that...and you have to wait a while for the answer. My Point is, I like this movie...but i dont Tresure...Its not a Top 100....but I have watched many many many movies...so i'm not saying its not a Must Buy.

		<fullReview>I've only recently (a couple of days ago) seen this movie and now I finally understand why it's achieved the classic cult status it has. "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" is absolutely amazing!Granted, watching the movie as "just a movie" will make you hate it. The story doesn't make much sense, most of the characters are almost too far out and several of them are downright annoying. However, what makes this movie so great is the music, the costumes and last, but most certainly not least, Tim Curry. His performance as the transsexual Dr. Frankenstein-wannabe, Dr. Frank-N-Furter, is amazing and hilarious, to say the very least. I've always liked Tim Curry and I must say this is one of his best performances ever.If you can watch this movie and not have "Time Warp" and "Sweet Transvestite" playing in your head for days afterward, you are simply unable to appreciate good music. I actually managed to learn how to do the Time Warp myself, because I just couldn't help it - I have to do it everytime I hear it!I just wish I could've watched this movie in a theatre and experienced full audience participation, but nevertheless, I had a great time watching it on DVD.So, the final thought: If you like rock n' roll and Tim Curry, if you are not too homophobic and if you have a somewhat bizarre sense of humor, this movie is for you! If not, you'll probably want to steer clear of this one, but give it a chance anyway.Let's do the Time Warp again! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably the best movie I have ever watched. The music in this flick is amazingly good, the casting is awesome, the plot is great, and the camp atmosphere is heaven. This is one movie I can watch over and over again and still be entertained. There is a reason it is the most famous of all cult movies and has garnered such a following.One thing I will say though, this is a love it or hate it movie. Most likely you will think it is great or you will think it is horrible, no in-between.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when I was 14, on a badly dubbed recording when Fox aired it one Halloween. I have been a fan ever since. I was a little upset when my parents wouldn't let me dress a Frank N. Furter for Halloween. Since then, I have bought an andience participation CD, the movie on VHS, the movie on DVD, and the soundtrack. I even have Frank figures that adorn my home. I love this movie. It is one of the best spoofs I have ever seen, because it spoofs so many things. I didn't get to participate until I was 19, and I dressed as Magenta (I couldn't find a corset or platforms on short notice). I had the maid costume, the fishnets, black eyes and red lips. It was the greatest movie experience I have ever been to. Nothing like being a "virgin". This is an extremely fun movie to watch. I can't listen to "Time Warp" without actually doing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not by any means a great film. It is a fun film, with a slightly shaky but unique plot, tied together with some of the most catchy rock'n'roll songs you'll ever hear. I defy you to watch this movie and not find yourself humming Hot-Patootie or Toucha-toucha-touch Me. And if you can stay on the couch while they are dancing the Time Warp you have no sense of fun. Granted, this movie is not for everyone--you do need a wry sense of humor, an appreciation of the just plain silly, and a love of rock'n'roll. In addition, since it is an audience participation movie, it is not as much fun in your living room as it is in the theater. But with a cue list from any Rocky Horror site and a little imagination, you can still have a great time. I've seen Rocky at least a hundred times, both in and out of the theater and I always enjoy it. I highly recommend that you use crumpled paper or packing peanuts instead of rice and confetti if you do the full participation thing in your living room ;)Don't dream it--watch it!</fullReview>

Yes there are those who don't like it but to refer to it as not being film-worthy is totally unjust.I'm 17 and I first saw this film when I was 15 and since then I've been a complete fan! Yes some of my friends look at me as though I'm strange when they find out that I love the film but I don't care.People don't see the film for what it is. It is a masterpiece considering the money spent on it, it completely kicks the c**p out of other films that have been made with millions.There are those who don't consider this film as anything more than trash but they need to look at the following it has accumulated, that doesn't happen very often so when it does surely its because the film is something special and something worth adoring. It is adored by millions of people and I'm proud to say that I'm one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rocky Horror Picture Show is: pointless, bizarre, weirdly sexy, and wildly funny. There ARE no plot twists to give away, because everything happens in a quick and tangled rush of music, humping, fishnet, massacres, motorcycles, and Mickey Mouse ears. Anyone who tries to figure this movie out is either an unlikely genius or a prententious quack. It's camp, at its kinkiest best: Tim Curry minces and stomps through the movie, winking and licking his lips, seducing everything with a pulse, throwing fits of jealous rage, flamboyant in platform heels and mesh corsets. Susan Sarandon is the big-eyed virgin; and that guy with the glasses whose name I can't remember is her sensible and emotionless fiance. There's Rocky Horror, the muscular sun-bronzed creature who hardly ever speaks a word. There's the alien brother-sister couple. I can't say anything more about them because, obviously, there is ONE plot twist. All in all, kiddos, if you like weird music, kinky sex, and unapologetic camp, then go get yourself a copy of Rocky Horror Picture Show right now. It's only good if it makes no sense.</fullReview>

No, it's no "Sophie's Choice" or "The Godfather", but it IS so much fun, with great songs and way over-the-top performances, not to mention that 27 year old Tim Curry is SO HOT, with those fishnets and bustiers and that attitude! (My favorite part will always be when he says to Riff Raff "Coming...",which is always cut or sanitized from the TV versions. It really is a movie best experienced in the theater with...shall we say...friends?) I will watch it and love it until I'm old and gray, and I've requested "I'm Going Home" be played at my funeral!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is THE cult film of all time. It is a spoof of monster, horror, and sci-fi flicks. But the audience participation is what made it a classic. However, even if you don't know about when to throw the rice or light the candles, you can still enjoy the silliness of the movie and the wonderfully hokey performances. Also, in my opinion, it's one of the best movie musicals ever! Full of great songs, a terrefic cast and Tim Curry gives his best performance on screen, personally, as the "sweet transvestite"!So just keep doing the "Time Warp" again!</fullReview>

And the whole story, I mean you have to really think what kind of person can think of all these weird ideas and stories *but, was very unique, nothing like it* But though, I must say, I dont think everyone would like Rocky horror as much as others. It is kind of twisted and has... well........ Adult humor, some sex humor, but if you dont take it to seriously you will enjoy it a lot!!

		<fullReview>It's a pity that people are making strong comments against the RHPS. Obviously they haven't realised that this is a PARODY and not a serious documentary.Tacky scenery, funny plot, extreme songs... it's all part of it but thats because it's meant to be tacky, funny and extreme, and it does it with style. It's become a cult because of it's unplanned greatness.The plot isn't something that you should try to stick to anyway - think of all the B-movies that have had awful plots just for the sake of making a film. Or all the dodgy scenery/effects in many sci-fi films. This film laughs at it all and is something to be laughed at.I first saw the RHPS when I was 14, some 16 years ago, and I saw the humour then. It still makes me laugh (and the DVD version is easier to rewind, for the good bits, than video) and I hope that never ends.However, for those who are still unsure, just learn the Time Warp (the proper one, not that one Damian created to sell records....), get a group of friends together, turn the lights down and enjoy.You'll soon be doing the Time Warp one more time.......</fullReview>

Richard O'Brien, where do i start, he is a lyrical and writer genius, and there arn't many genius' in this world. My favourite charactor (apart from Frank n furter) is the wikid Columbia, she has the coolest voice and the best look, i so model myself on her! There is not one talentless actor in this fantastic flick, the whole thing rocks from beginning to end and the theme "Don't Dream it Be it" is so right and anyone can relate to this film in someway, i did.

The music in Toucha Toucha Toucha me is really great, despite the 'tee-hee' lyrics. If you've never seen this and plan to go to one of the famous Sat. midnight showings, prepare yourself. There is everything from flying toast to people prancing around in nothing but birthday hats. Once again, everything about this is classic. Every line is memorable and quotable.

		<fullReview>There are a chosen few movies that defy description and split people into two uncompromising factions: those who absolutely love them and those who hate them with equal passion. This is one of these pictures, and, consequently, I have no other choice than to give it ten out of ten. The profound impression it made on me was largely due, of course, to my first love (at the age of five): Frank-N-Furter. Ah... Tim Curry. As Richard O'Brien says, Tim IS Frank. And the show's main attraction. I still get goose-bumps every time I hear him sing "Sweet Transvestite". When he's on screen, the air crackles with energy - and sexuality. It may seem tame now, but back in 1975, this movie was shockingly explicit (and got the mandatory R rating in the States). In more than this aspect, it is one of the most daring productions ever made for the big screen, and maybe that's why it flopped the first time it was released. This piece of art is not meant for the masses: it is for an enlightened and select following...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, what can I say? This is a great movie in so many ways. I've been singing "Dammit Janet" ever since I saw this masterpiece. I can't pinpoint what makes it so good. Maybe its the fact that its so bad, its good. It was watching this movie that Susan Sarandon became my favourite actress of all time and I have now seen sooo many of her movies. I think it's hard not to love her innocence and beauty in this movie. She's said in several interviews that out of all her movies, this will be the one that makes it into the Time Capsule and I agree with her. She's just so beautiful.And Tim Curry? He IS Frank'n'Furter. Noone could have played that role like him, so BRAVO!!! Richard O'Brien said that women have come up to him saying that they were turned on by Tim Curry in fishnets and platforms and I have to admit, I was one of them. Richard O'Brien, of course, can't escape credit here. With great songs such as "Time Warp" and "Hot Patootie" it is obvious that he has a great mind. Also very creepy as Riff-raffThe 'coolest' character in this movie, I would say, would have to be Columbia despite her tripping during her tapdance. Her sequined coat and hat...she's just the best. Magenta, Brad, Doctor Scott and Eddie, all are perfect in their roles. The movie could not have been made without Charles Gray - great work for someone without a neck.haha!!

It's very '70's and today's viewers may not get all the jokes, but it's still a lot of fun. With all the friends I've made over the years watching Rocky, it's another aspect of the film that makes it uniquely enjoyable. I'm still amazed it's lasted this long. It's definitely earned itself a niche in kitsch. To all the fans past and present, and to Sal Piro, thanks! Give yourselves a Rocky cheer.

(again) in this movie! I personally think that the acting on all parts was great, actually beyond great because it was soo real, in most musicals the acting is never really the song point in my opinion, but this was no ordinary musical! Ok, some of the things i don't really agree with, like putting Barry Bostwick in nylon tights, but i did like the music!All in all, i liked this movie alot, altho i'm not such a big fan in seeing a grown man in tights, this movie was something of a revalation for me! HeheheSee this movie and have a giggle with a bottle of red and LOTS of popcorn! U won't be dissapointed, but then again, if u like Tim Curry u might consider striking this one of ur xmas lists, he is incredible in this, but he is also, in tights........</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this movie around the time that it came out, but i didnt get it. i saw it a few years later, but i didnt get it then. i saw it a few weeks ago, and i finally got it! this is a movie of utterly twisted proportions, mixed with great music and hilarious dialogue! im still trying to figure out the rest of the plot, but i get the gist of it. its a mix of horror, sci-fi, comedy, and musical all warped and fit together like unmatched puzzle pieces to create a totally enjoyable film! Tim Curry was awesome! he can sing, dance, and walk in heels better than I can! this is totally recommendable to anyone who wants a good laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I urge EVERYONE to watch this. I've absolutely loved this movie since forever the whole thing is just one great ride. The songs, the characters and just about it's entire aura is bloody brilliant. Richard O Brien is a genius! I love watching this because (a.) Tim Curry is a fantastic actor and (b.)The Time Warp is a classic.Yes it's completely camp (which we Brits are good at being) and the sight of men running around in stockings and corsets and suspenders might not appeal to everyone, but it's not a documentary IS IT? It's just a bit of a laugh.Watch the first 15 minutes and I swear you'll be hooked plus you have to stick around to hear Frank N Furter sing "I'm just a sweet transvestite from transsexual Transylvania". I thank you. 10/10</fullReview>

Great music, great costume, great characters (GO MAGENTA!!!!!! yaaaaaaaay), and great errr..audience! Anybody who has not seen this movie (in the theatre) is missing a whole part of life! I really do hope, however, that that is not Susan Sarandon's real singing voice, because that is pretty scary! Anyway, go see this movie, its worth every moment. PS.

		<shortDescription>Actually, a very keen spoof</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having seen this over 30 times in theatres, I've seen it an equal number of times on home video and DVD. The thing that strikes me the most about this movie is the parody involved. It's a wonderful parody of the monster and rock 'n' roll movies from the 50's and 60's, thrown together with the burgeoning sexual revolution that was growing in the movies during the early 70's. It also makes a statement about how things aren't always as black and white as many people would like to believe. Richard O'Brien's music and script are inspired lunacy, and the cast give memorable performances, especially Tim Curry. His facial expressions are simply amazing and help add dimension (dementia?) to everybody's favorite transvestite. One of my favorite overall scenes from a movie appears in RHPS: during the close of "I'm Going Home", when Frank steps between the kleig light and the camera, so that he's in silhouette, singing the final line. (sigh!) Even though I can recite most of the dialogue from memory, this movie continues to be one of my overall favorites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that the "Rocky Horror Picture Sow" is the best movie that was ever made. It is a cult classic about giving yourself over to absolute pleasure. i am a 14 year old girl, and I have seen this movie 49 times on VHS and Once in a theatre at a midnight show. If you would like to go to the same midnight show as I did, it is at 2190 Empire Boulevard, Loews Cinema, Webster NY. I think this movie is wonderful because of the message: Don't dream it, Be it". Thank you for reading this. I wish that more movies like this would be made. It has carried on for 26 years, and I hope it will continue long after my time on this earth is done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ode to Richard O'Brien's masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I watched Rocky Horror I was sat in a field, dressed in suspenders (rather uncomfortable) and wearing Tim Curry-esque red lipstick. I didn't really know what to expect, and although I knew a few of the songs (Time Warp, Hot Patootie etc.) it was going to be a very 'new' experience for me... A week after watching it in that cold damp field, I had bought the film, the soundtrack and believe it or not, the T-shirt. It had certainly become my "favourite obsession". From the very beginning of the film (Science Fiction/Double Feature)I was enthralled. It was such an amazing song, and the single red lips on the screen were so effective. The credits began to roll over the teeth. First Tim Curry (a fantastic actor, in maybe his best role) followed by other fab actors (in equally fab performances) such as Susan Sarandon, Richard O'Brien, Jonathon Adams, Peter Hinwood and even Meatloaf! How could this not gain my attention? Within the following 1 1/2 hours I was truly taken on a horrific, gender-bending, camp, clever, beautiful yet ridiculous journey of music and mayhem. The songs kept on coming, from the toe-tapping 'Time Warp' to the fantastic 'Sweet Transvestite' to the raunchy 'Toucha Toucha Toucha Touch me' to the glamourous and emotional 'I'm going home'. Of course the film is a cult phenomenon - it gives people the excuse to dress up, sing out loud and have fun. The film is funny, ironic, beautiful and brilliant. It's a p**s take of so many genres and a homage to so many others. The music is great, and the acting is genius. Just to see the likes of Susan Sarandon in suspenders is enough, surely? Well done Richard, you've certainly created something very special here - and folks, if you haven't watched it before, go ahead. If you don't enjoy it - you'll be lying!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a history of me and this movie, i must say I am a MeatLoaf fan. Liked Hot Patootie so much that i told myself "Well, honey, you have to get your hands on that videotape. And I did. In my country there are only two original tapes and three copies. I have one. Seen the movie more than 20 times already and I'm not bored. As a teacher, I showed it to others and now I have people to discuss it with. Many don't understand it but, my guess is that's for the best...is so special that I feel like only some of us should really appreciate it. Great Curry (I sow a lot of his movies, but none part as good as this) great O'Brien, not sure if his mad or beautifully mad, not to mention Bostwick and Sarandon. Funny, I didn't even had time to watch my favorite (MeatLoaf) because of all the rest. Wonderful music, no matter the occasion. Just one word: worthy."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>magic is where you find it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm probably different from a lot of people in how I got to love this film...I first saw it at a full audience-participation screening when I was in college--1980, thereabouts. As an overprotected,sheltered, and seriously introverted individual, I hated the experience! The audience made it much scarier than it would otherwise have been! It wasn't until some friends in the dorm bought the soundtrack and started playing it practically nonstop that I got hooked on the songs...Flash forward some 15 years. Married...3 kids later, I run across the movie late night on cable ,unaccountably think "Oh, cool!" and watch it again...Chalk it up to nostalgia or what have you, but I have seen this a number of times since then, and have loved it every time. I still haven't had a repeat "audience participation" experience, but the music, the glitz, the sheer audacity of this movie always wins me over. Tim Curry as the "Sweet Transvestite" Frank-n-Furter never fails to gain my attention. He does an undeniably sexy job, and I was quite gratified to see his character swing both ways (Heck, he probably swung more ways than I could even think of!)Despite the fact that I had originally thought this to be perverted, and shocking beyond words, I found myself, the other day, renting it to share with my teenage kids.Somehow, despite the outrageous premise and characters, it has morphed into something approaching a gentle fable. Not for everyone, granted, but the basic idea seems to be one of open-mindedness.I was somewhat surprised that my 16 year-old boy (whom I have successfully introduced to Monty Python) was entirely thrown by Frank-n-Furter, and refused to sit through the whole thing.My 14year-old daughter while taken aback here and there, generally found it a hoot! As for my 10-year-old, I'll not try this on him for a little while yet, I think....Anyway, as with most things, this seems one of those films which is utterly dependent on your personality, and the circumstances for how you will perceive it, but all I can say is that if you once despised it, there may well have been enough emotional involvement there for you to find the magic the second time around!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange gyrations deep below...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine its 1975. Out of some closet-vault explodes a film based on amusical - but not just any musical. A musical called The Rocky HorrorShow. Strange, you may say, but nonetheless true. Its story tells thetragic yet tantalising tale of a Dr Frank N Furter and his crew who areholding a convention of sorts in a castle in the middle of nowhere onlyto be interrupted by a terribly sweet, newly engaged - somehow strandedin a storm at this far-away castle - couple named Brad and Janet. Itsnarrated by a Narrator named simply that but from the start you realiseall is not as it seems and never will be again. For one day, acrossdistant and not so distant lands, it is foretold that people will breakout into a dance as this film still screens late - very late - in theeternal night. They call this strange gyration... The Time Warp........You will do the time warp again? Won't you? I envy the person who hasn't seen this classic. Its amazing how magicalthis film remains almost 30 years after its initial release. It remainsa rare incredible gem full of joy and yet so sincerely clever. One ofthe best examples of this film's brilliance is its subversion of thehero/villain relationship. Nobody is who they seem in this film and theroles turn every character inside out. Dr Frank N Furter switches wildlyfrom camp queen to vicious leader to crumbling diva. Tim Curry'sperformance remains a spunky, full throttle embrace of absolutepleasure. The songs remain rollicking, engaging and even beautifullymelancholic - especially Frank's final tunes in the film. "Don't dreamit, be it" is so sad and yet so brilliant a final coda for the film.This is a dream made cinematic. Long may it live to do the time warpagain and take us back to our first corruption/eruption.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****POSSIBLE SPOILER**** What more can I say? Is there one person in America who doesn't know the Time Warp? How many times have you sang "Hot Patootie" with MeatLoaf? How many times have you ever said "Dammit, Janet!"? How many times have you danced to "Wild and Untamed Thing"? What I'm getting at is that RHPS is simply the greatest musical ever! The music, the performers (as hokey as they might seem), the hilarious story, and everything else about the movie are just unparalleled. How can you disagree that the moment when Tim Curry takes off his cloak during "Sweet Transvestite" is the most electric moment in theatre history? A moment of sexuality, hilarity, self-exploration, etc. How can you deny that this has the best and most exhilarating music in a musical? I rest my case. There is no comparison to any other musical.</fullReview>

This movie is totaly unclassifiable ! Its impossible to describe what this movie is all about to someone who never seen it. The Rocky Horror Picture Show, its not a movie, its an experience ! An experience wich defies our senses and our perception of what a movie supposedly should look like, and instead of showing us what we are expecting or hoping to see, it throws sounds, graphic references and images of all sorts in a way, no spectator was ever bombarded with ! AND ITS BRILLIANT ! I know, the movie is supposed to be a bad movie...but is it realy ? I cant call a movie, wich brings such happiness, fun, relaxation and joy, a bad movie. Just because it doesnt follow the all the rulles of how a real movie should look like. The RHPS might have been bad a long time ago, but if we look at it very close, we can see how clever this film is, in getting every clich of the innocent days of sci-fi and turning them into such a festival of mindless fun ! THIS MOVIE IS A MASTERPIECE, even in the most cinematic sense of the way, if not by anything else, just by the fact it goes against every rule wich suposedly says how movies should look like, and despite all that still creates something that its a pure pleasure to watch.I bought the dvd of this movie, about a week ago, and it hasnt left my dvd player since then ! Everyday when i get home from work, i put it on play just to listen to it sometimes and enjoy the music! This movie has probably the best soundtrack ever, (on par with South Park the movie), simply because the fact, these musics are now more than 25 years old, but strangely enough they dont look dated at all, and if i didnt knew these are old tunes, i wouldnt believe it ! RHPS has the most anti-stress music i ever eard, making this movie the greatest movie ever made for when we are feeling down. Believe me, if you feel sad, dont take pills, see this movie, and youll be dancing and cheering in no time. And watch it in dvd, because it has one of the best editions i ever seen put into a disc (two discs actualy). From probably the best and funnier animated menus ever, to the amazing stereo surround sound and extraordinary image quality wich makes it even harder for a newcomer like me to believe this movie has now 25 years. Believe me, if youre going to buy a dvd player, this is the disc you have to buy first ! And if you have a surround sound system and a widsceen tv, you wont believe your eyes and ears ! Incredible dvd edition. Filled with every sort of excelent extras wich are a treat, particulary if youre like i was, and youre going to watch this movie for the first time without knowing anything about it.Now the only thing i reggret is that im stuck here in Portugal-Europe, and i cant go and experience a live audience participation in America any time i would like, but the fantastic extras in this dvd, more than make up for it, as there are plenty of things wich almost give the viewer at home, the feeling of what must be like to be there.Anyway, i only know, im going to show this movie to all my friends. Im already "huntting" for them, actualy, because everytime i see this movie once again, i feel like sharing this with everybody i can find !The Rocky Horror Picture Show, is a totaly unknown movie here in my country, but if anybody who bought this dvd, has had the same reaction to it i had, i suspect it wont be an unknown movie for much longger.Transilvanians from Portugal unite !

		<fullReview>I remember the very first time I saw this movie: I was 9 years old, and my best friend was watching it with me. We were very much into "scary" movies at the time, and unwittingly thought the title of this movie would be the ultimate in frightening features. Well, it was...but more so to my conservative parents who happened to be watching it with us at the time... and who exuded more than one shocked gasp! (not to mentioned embarrassed laughter) Saying that-- movie has gone on to be one of my favorites of all time. You can't beat a young, toothy, (and most cheeky) Tim Curry in garter belts and torn stockings; or a fresh-faced (and at her most demure) Susan Sarandon. This movie is a classic-- glam rock at it's bi-sexual peak; with memorable songs that morph Caberet-esque with the Thing from Outer Space. After you see this movie, you will never again relate "Franknfurter" to a hotdog; and will practice daily to perfect the steps of the "Time Warp". Prepare yourself-- you're in for quite a celluloid ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate audience participation movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Let there be lips."There are two, completely different, versions of _The Rocky Horror Picture Show_. One is the movie that you will see if you watch RHPS at home, the other is the event you will witness (or participate in) if you see it in a theater.If you have never seen RHPS before and see it at a theater, expect to miss much of the dialog. There are two reasons for this. One is that in many cases, noise from the audience will obscure or obliterate the sound from the film. The other reason is that sometimes you may be paying so much attention to other goings-on in the theater that you ignore the movie.In order to avoid spoiling the experience for first time attendees, I won't go into any details of what may or may not occur, except that before the movie begins, there may be a call for "virgins" from the audience. This refers only to whether or not you have attended an appropriate showing of RHPS before -- there are *no* other connotations. If you have not attended one before, step up smartly when the call is made.I rated this movie as a 9 (a 10 would be the best movie ever made) for the theatrical version, as a video watched at home it is only about a 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I watched this movie I was 18 and extremely naive. I had no idea what the movie was about and didn't get much of the humor. A few years and an ounce of intelligence later, I realized what a fantastic movie. I dress up as Magenta every year for Halloween, I know all the words by heart and the tune of Time Warp is permanently stuck in my head. I am a huge Rocky fan, and if anyone thinks this movie was bad, give it one more try, I promise it gets better with age!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies and I don't regret saying it! Personally, I think Tim Curry should've been nominated for an Oscar. Susan Sarandon is phenomenal! Richard O' Brien gives a performance never to forget!Until I saw this movie, I never though Sarandon could really sing, but she was excellent. Barry Bostwick was all right, but he could've done better. Hell, they were all great. But, nobody could beat Tim Curry's performance. "Sweet Transvestite" and "I'm Going Home" make the entire movie worth seeing</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi allThis is the only really cult movie ever made. Its got all the B-film elements but its packed in sensational songs and acting. Tim Curry as a drag queen is perfect and even though the others doesnt reach the same level, they are very good. The soundtrack is great and the plot is funny. Its just a totally wacky and crazy film, so when you see it you will laugh till you get cramps. Its a film that just gives you a warm feeling inside and leaves you happy. If you havent seen it I can only give you one advice, DO IT.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without a doubt, my favorite musical ever. I know that a lot of people have a problem with the gay and transvestite themes of the movie, but that's part of the hilarity of the whole thing. Obviously a spoof of the "great" B movie generation, Rocky Horror takes those monster/sci-fi elements and combines them with a topic that was just starting to reach growing awareness at the time it was released. Not to mention the soundtrack. Admit it, you still laugh when Frank N. Furter throws his cape off. Crazy, ironic, campy, and just generally fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whatever happened to Saturday night?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have yet to see the DVD version, so I will limit my comments to the film itself.I first saw the film during the 1980's when the initial wave of popularity was strongest (Yes, as a "virgin" I was pelted with rice). The film had emerged from cocoon of "gay kitch" to semi-mainstream success. It has now become a quasi-religion for an ever-growing number of faithful.A sexy, high-camp parody of the horror movies of the 1950's and 60's, it celebrates the odd and unusual to the point of veneration. Those who feel out of place will find a calling to it. The nerds, the freaks, the outcasts, the kinky folks, those who are questioning their sexuality, all will see a character they can identify with (for me, it was Brad, although many will say I'm more like Riff Raff now).The shouting back at the screen has created something unusual for any film. Audience participation! Not since Shakespeare, when actors had to be on their toes to deal with rowdy Elizabethan audiences, has the viewer become part of the entertainment in such a glorious way! And taken on it's own terms, the song "I'm Going Home" is quite touching. I wouldn't be surprised if it's played at Tim Curry's funeral.With the advent of home video, the midnight shows that brought so much money to struggling theatres has vanished, save for this film. Despite being shown on TV, and the video releases, the devout still arrive at their shrines for the Friday and Saturday midnight masses to take part in the passion play that is the "Rocky Horror Picture Show".And yes, the film has a message. Lighten up, and don't be afraid to indulge yourself. Or as Dr. Frank N. Furter sings:"Give yourself over to absolute pleasure! Swim the warm waters of sins of the flesh...erotic nightmares beyond any measure, and sensual daydreams to treasure forever! Can't you just see it? Don't dream it...be it!"It's been playing for 25 years now. There's a second generation of fans! O'Brien and company must have done something right!Not for the timid or bigoted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a wonderful example of cinematic entertainment. It is also THE definition of a cult classic. If you don't believe me, watch this film in a theater. The theater experience is like no other. It combines the cinematic experience with live action entertainment and audience participation.Below I have reviewed the new DVD re-release of the filmThe Rocky Horror Picture Show (25th Anniversary 2-Disc): This review is easy. This is the best money I have spent on any DVD. Ever.And, this is the best money I've spent on anything in a long time. However, I'm biased. I love this film. If you like the Rocky Horror Picture Show, this is the collection to get. It isn't just how they put things on the discs, it's WHAT they put on the discs. These discs won't be known for their menus (although I like them), there are two things that definitely make this collection worth picking up.First, disc one includes an audio track that let's you hear a theater full of people shouting back at the movie. That's worth the money right there. (This is also a great way to learn what to say and when to say it.) The second fantastic inclusion is the subtitle track that tells you when to use your props.This collection is extremely affordable, considering what they give you and how much it costs.The two discs also include a musical number that the USA has NEVER SEEN! I couldn't wait to see this "Superheroes" number edited back into the film. I've been a fan of this movie for over ten years and I've seen it more times than I care to mention. These discs really impressed me. I would highly recommend this collection to any Rocky Horror Picture Show, Richard O'Brien or musical fan.From The Back Of The DVD: "It was great when it all began..." Celebrate 25 years of midnight movie madness! The Rocky Horror Picture Show is an "erotic nightmare beyond any measure." Relive Richard O'Brien's sinfully twisted salute to horror, sci-fi, B-movies and rock music - a "sensual daydream to treasure forever" - starring Tim Curry (in his classic gender-bending performance), Barry Bostwick, and Oscar winner Susan Sarandon. Do the "Time Warp" and sing "Hot Patootie" with Meatloaf again...and again...and again...at home, or in a movie theater, where it will probably be playing for another 25 years!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rocky Horror is the greatest mix of sci-fi, horror, comedy and music you will ever find in a movie. From the opening, Science Fiction, to the song Superheros (which was cut from the movie) the songs will have you moving around the floor trying to dance along. In fact, I don't know one person, even if they had not seen the movie, that doesn't know how to do the Time Warp (have to thank Drew Carry and a few other shows for that).The recently released DVD includes many things that will keep you coming back to watch again. My favorite part was the Commentary by Pat Quinn and Richard O'Brien, but it also has many other options. Not to mention the second disc which includes the cut songs and has a great documentary. And we can't forget the VH1 clips and the Pop-Up Video. If you like the movie (who doesn't??) and have a DVD Player, definately get this DVD! Now I have to buy a DVD-Rom Drive for my PC to play the DVD-Rom Games included ;).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time that I saw the "Rocky Horror Picture Show" the thought formost in my mind was "what the hell is this?" My father had purchased the video tape having never seen it either but had heard that it was a realy great film. The family sat around the living room and watched it not knowning what this film was about even when it had finished. The version that he had was just the film and mentioned nothing about the audience participation aspect of the film. A few years later I went to see it in the theater as the halloween midnight movie. I had originaly gone only because they were showing the movie "Scream" for free and I hadn't planed to stick around to watch "RHPS." After scream was over I was about to leave when a friend of mine spotted me (not an easy task since I was in costume) and invited me to sit with her during the showing of "RHPS." I told her that I had seen it before and hadn't thought much of it. She got a confused look on her face and asked me "why didn't you like it? I thought it would be exactly your style?" At first I thought that she was making a joke that that I was into cross dressing or bisexuality or one of the other non-mainstream moral activities celebrated in the film. But she went on to explain that she thought that I would have loved the audience participation and heckeling in it. I told her that I had only seen in on VHS and that I had never seen it in the theater. After having a red V painted on my forhead to mark me as a virgin I sat and watched "RHPS" the way that it was ment to be seen. I laughed, I cried, I danced the Time Warp, and I had the best time ever. So, to any one out there who hasn't seen the "RHPS", please be sure that you watch it in the theater (and hopfully with the simultanious stage version) before you rent or pruchase the movie. See it the way its meant to be seen.</fullReview>

It's the kind of movie that in 20 years, people will wake up in the middle of the night, turn on the tv, and see, and think..."What the...?" It's good. This is an enjoyably bad movie, but it's not really bad at all. This is the kind of movie that deserves a place on some top 100 list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect parody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time that I saw RHPS was at the World Science Fiction Convention, in 1976. It had been out just a year, but I had never heard of it. But when I checked it out, there was someone next to me singing along.The program book mentioned the references and parodies of horror and SF films. It also mentioned the "toe-tapping" soundtrack. But it didn't mention that it would steal my soul.I am a long-time film nut, and I loved the fact that I could watch this film ten or fifteen times and still find another cinematic reference. Like when I was reading Stephen King's "Danse Macabre" and found that Eddie's LOVE/HATE tattoos on his fingers are a reference to "The Night of the Hunter".By the time that the Village theatre showed the first of their midnight showings, I had seen the film a couple of more times in a regular theatre and acquired a soundtrack from the Roxy stage show.Over the years, I've attended dozens of midnight showings of the film as well as seeing the play in London and down here in Dallas (They tried to bring my handicapped friend up on stage, unaware that he really uses that wheelchair)During my trip to England I also got to meet Richard O'brien, who was talking up the sequel to RHPS. As with most sequels, it was interesting, not great.This movie succeeds: as a parody, as science fiction, and as a musical. Nine Stars. Uncle Steve says check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still crazy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not just a unique and brilliant film with great acting, singing, timing, dancing (especially from Charles Gray), but a time (warp) capsule of a fleeting moment. Time: the early 70s, when the 60s wave had broken and left dull conformity as far as the eye could see. But a few brave souls dared to do the forbidden: wear huge pearl chokers, stockings, black, and drainpipe trousers that are emphatically NOT flares. They dared to tapdance! They dared to like rock and roll! Those of you too young to remember won't know that the 60s tried to obliterate the recent past, and those who wanted to cut their hair short and use Brylcreem had to meet at night in cellars. Naturally this film appealed to the eccentric (as you will realise if you have read this far). Several years later, punk was born. But RHPS got there first. Tim Curry - what a guy! He can oil me up any time. (Funnny how he looks exactly like Ruby Wax, though.) xxx</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The "Rocky Horror Picture Show" may not be to everyone's tastes, but you have to admit the music really stands out. I couldn't get "Time Warp" out of my head for days. Besides, Tim Curry is always enjoyable to watch...even if he is wearing black lipstick, a corset and garter belt throughout the whole frigging movie!The queer musical that rene_tsang mentioned isn't called "Zero Tolerance". It's called "Zero Patience". And believe me, compared to "Rocky Horror Picture Show", it BLOWS big time. Aside from queer viewers, that film is almost unwatchable for anyone else - that is, unlike you like seeing male full-frontal nudity and two anuses singing to one another. At least "Rocky Horror" didn't have any nudity.</fullReview>

It's supposed to be stupid and campy. Whoever said the film was pretending to be high art or attempting to convey some sort of relevant message (which ZERO PATIENCE tries but utterly fails)?</fullReview>

More than 25 years old, its original cult followers are now grandparents, but that doesn't diminish the film's distinctive style and music. Stretching credibility at times, the plot of "Rocky Horror Picture Show" shows little age or dust, and was produced when no one had heard of young talents Susan Sarandon, Barry Bostwick, or Tim Curry.

		<fullReview>Justly famous for being an interactive late-show cult favorite, Rocky Horror brought gender-bending gothic eccentricity to American middle-class audiences in the late 1970s. Every cliche of horror, sci-fi, and musicals, is lushly lampooned amid the lurid red cinematography of Peter Suschitzky. It's a fun party all 'round but the main attraction is the extraordinarily unnerving but appealing performance of Tim Curry. His Frank-N-Furter is the Age of Aquarius Frankenstein. Watch also for a very young and fun Susan Sarandon!</fullReview>

See the movie with a live cast, watch the video, then see the movie again and again, where there is a live cast. And RHPS will continue for another 25 years, showing at theaters around the world, Friday and Saturday at midnight. " Hotpatoote bless my soul I really love that rock and roll" You've got a movie, a live cast in costume and audience participation. All going at once. Is this a place to help your worries and problems of the past week disappear ?

		<fullReview>Bar none, this is one of the greatest musicals, right up there with THE WIZARD OF OZ or JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR or any of the others. It's an exceptionally clever movie, even for a spoof. It simultaneously pays tribute to horror movies, X-rated movies, and dance movies, and that is not an easy task! I think this is the movie that made Tim Curry the classic villain actor he is today, and also the movie that spawned the "horror camp" film genre of the 1980s and '90s. It's fun to watch for many reasons: the old movie references, the music, the costumes. Heck, even Meat Loaf did a good job, and he's not even an actor!</fullReview>

And since then I've started working towards becoming an independant director. I wouldnt like my life as much or have as much fun with it had I never seen this movie.

		<fullReview>Having seen this movie a few times over the years &amp; not being that impressed with it (apart from a few good songs), I was a little hesitant to see it again at an audience participation event. I shouldn't have been. I had a GREAT TIME!!! I've been back several times as it is so good. If you are going to see this, make sure it is at a venue that has audience participation, it's well worth it.

		<fullReview>Wow! An absolutely WONDERFUL movie! RHPS, or Rocky as cultists lovingly nickname it, is...well...interesting. No doubt its "dirtiness" is enhanced by audience participation from various movie theaters, but the movie is also one that can be obsessed over from your own home. WARNING: There is NO plot... Well, actually, there kinda is, BUT when you look at the movie as a whole, there is no plot that starts at the beginning and is solved at the end. Period. I recommend this movie for those who love a great laugh, and who won't be offended by anything (well, almost anything!), especially if you are "de-virginized" at a theater, where you are bound to hear some very offensive "call-backs". CONTENTS: One Sweet Transvestite, One Creation, One Rock-n-Roll Dude, Two "Normal" Adults, and Many Laughs OTHER MOVIES: Shock Treatment (the unofficial sequel), A Clockwork Orange, Little Shop of Horrors GRADE: Off the charts! HAVE FUN AND GOOD LUCK!</fullReview>

And when the "Time Warp" comes on you have to restrain yourself from getting up and doing it yourself. This movie may seem strange to some the first time you watch it but it will grow on you.

However, you will be missing out on a cult classic. I always hated musicals, but the hilarious songs (Sweet Transvestite, Touch-a Touch-a Touch-a Touch Me) make this an exception. It is impossible not to love this film. I'm a freshman in high school and I recently did a report on this movie. My English teacher seemed to like the subject (he wrote the lyrics to each song mentioned). I recommend seeing this film in a theater at midnight.

		<fullReview>RHPS is, in my opinion, the best movie ever made or that ever will be made. It is not just about sex and drug use but about how sometimes its best to just give yourself over to absolute pleasure. It portrays a message of being everything you want to be. RH changed my life totally and acts as something for me to return to whenever I feel that lifes not worth living. RH is best viewed in the theatre if you are truly someone who absolutely adores the film. However, it is not always the best way to view it, especially if you can get offended very easily. There is no reason to not understand why some dislike it, but it is truly a movie to at least be given a chance as it is written by a true genius and is more than many think it is. See it... you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this film and thought it absolutely excellent. Tim Curry provided a lively and enjoyable performance in the role of Frank N Furter. I loved the performances of most of the actors the only two exceptions being Raynor Burton as Rocky Horror and Richard O'Brien as Riff Raff. Richard was good in the role but I do not personally like the way he plays Riff Raff as it is rather dull. Raynor Burton is abysmal in the role of Rocky Horror, he didn't even sing his own songs and did not speak either. A good yet brief appearance from Meatloaf as Eddie too. I know that the film has been criticised for bad special effects but that adds to the effect of a glamorous and sexy film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ah, Memories</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On my sixteenth birthday, a bunch of my friends kidnapped me and took me to see "The Rocky Horror Picture Show," which showed every Friday night at a local theater. I remember sitting in the theater as the lights went down. Then someone yelled, "Hey, any virgins here tonight?" (meaning, anyone seeing the film for the first time) My friend Kim huddled down in her seat and pressed herself against my arm and whispered, "I'm gonna get raped, I know it."Honestly, the movie itself isn't much to talk about, but the kids who see it on video or on VH1 are missing the whole experience. There's something about being in a dark theater in the bad side of town after midnight, surrounded by a bunch of people in weird costumes and makeup -- it really imprints itself on your memory.I haven't seen "Rocky Horror" again since. Honestly, nothing can live up to the memory of that night. I don't know if any theaters have midnight "Rocky Horror" screenings anymore -- the theater I went to got pushed out of business a few years ago by the big multiplex down the street. It's sad, in a way...Oh, well. Anyone up for the Time Warp?</fullReview>

Basically, this film is a parody of the all-time worst science-fiction movies ever made - including one legend, King Kong, with at least one extra reference to westerns. But that's not why this film is a must, though finding all those references may be fun. The reason of its success is the fun you may get going to the cinema to see it. Three events for the price of one - the movie, the entertainers, the audience - and one single rule, everything that happens in the film is to happen in the room. My advice : go and see it, no matter where you are, but avoid New York - the entertainers don't involve the audience enough to make it real fun. A long, long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, God said, let there be lips, and there were, and they were good...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brad and Janet come to the home of Dr. Frank N Furter when their car breaks down and get caught right in the middle Franks plans. The Rocky Horror Picture Show has become the most popular cult hit ever. People would go see the movie and say things to the action on the screen. Is the movie entertaining on its own? It certainly is worth watching on its own. I have never seen this movie with audience of fans that know every line in the movie. I think the film is very entertaining and twisted. Great performances from the cast especially Tim Curry as Dr. Frank N Furter. The songs are excellent and funny especially the songs Time Warp, Sweet Transvestite and Touch-A, Touch-A, Touch Me. Said to be the King of bad movies it has out lived any critic smashing. I have seen this movie many times and it's still quite entertaining. I have the special edition version, which features two never seen before songs "Once In A While" and "Superheroes". 10/10 An excellent musical tribute to bad movies.</fullReview>

Why wasn't that placed in the movie, I dunno, but it was a kick a** ending and it should have been in the movie..

		<fullReview>Once upon a time, I used to go to Rocky Horror Picture Show regularly on Saturday nights. I thought it was a strange movie, a not-too-successful adaptation of a stage musical. I did the Time Warp. I shouted at the screen. I threw stuff.After educating myself about old horror movies, however, I am convinced that Richard O'Brien (who wrote RHPS and stars as Riff Raff) is a genius who is a true movie buff, and I am further convinced that RHPS is a wonderful puzzle of a movie that contains hundreds of homages and references to old horror and sci-fi movies.The movie contains references galore to many, MANY old horror and sci-fi movies. I couldn't even begin to list them all, but a few of the more obscure:1934's "The Black Cat," which contained a honeymooning couple who are sucked into a strange adventure. The movie ends with the couple fleeing the evil mansion just before it blows up! 1955's "Night of the Hunter" contains a character whose fingers are tattooed with "L-O-V-E" and "H-A-T-E" (like Eddie). There are more obvious references (Rocky carrying Frank up the RKO tower before he crashes to the ground, and the whole plot itself is a kind of homage to Frankenstein). Plus I think the whole cross-dressing angle may have been influenced by Ed Wood's "Glen or Glenda."So if you've seen RHPS hundreds of times (like myself), next time pay attention and see if you can spot the references. I notice something new</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a cute movie, and really couldn't be anything else than a cult. Tim Curry sure does ham it up as Dr Frank 'N' Furter, and Susan Sarandon never looked better as Janet Weiss. In fact, the whole cast ham it up like pros, except for Peter 'I'm a bit wooden' Hinwood as the thankfully mute Rocky. The tunes are catchy, highlights include 'Damnit Janet' and the infamous 'Time Warp.' The directing and design is suprisingly well done for this type of movie, and has aged rather gracefully. The jokes fall flat, however, and the film suffers a real low point after the lab scene.While no masterpiece, RHPS is great fun, and is worth it alone to see a young Barry Bostwick (the mayor on 'Spin City') in a teddy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The TOP cult classic of all time!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rocky Horror Picture Show has to be one of the greatest films of all time! Though some may not get the concept, it is very tame compared to some movies today. Time Curry brought Frank-N-Furter to life. This is Tim Curry's highest achievement. He made you think that he was really Frank, and he REALLY got into his role. Susan Sarandon played the perfect Janet Weiss. Young and vulnerable, yet at the end not so vulnerable. And her high voice made you think she was a 12 year old girl. Barry Bostwick was a great Brad. Though a slight bit 'dorky', he fit it nicely. (No offense Barry). As for Little Nell, Patricia Quinn, Peter Hinwood, Charles Gray, and Johnathon Adams, they all played their part very nicely. As most of the 'freaks' in the movie, their make-up and costumes made you believe that they really were. Last but not least Richard O Brien, the creator and Riff Raff of the Rocky Horror Picture Show, he deserves the most credit, because without him we would not have our famous cult classic today. RHPS is definitely a great movie, although weird, very great. See it soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a VERY simple tale of temptations... and how to fall for them... or not. It doesn't make any difference who you are... it's an either/or scenario. Be tempted or not. This unforgettable movie uses almost every Sci-Fi cliche that had been invented (like Star Wars... but in a quite different way) to invent the ultimate crowd pleaser... the original audience participation movie. Share and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am willing to admit that I am an absolute fan of this movie. I know there are a lot of people out there how completely detest this flick, but, when I come across these people, I hold my ground. This is because, when I first saw the movie, I didn't like it much. I was a little entertained by the openness toward controversial issues, but felt little else. However, I came home from work late one night and had an overwhelming urge to see it again. I watched it, studied it, and found that this was one of the best pictures of all times. But the thing is, the more I watch it, the more I like it. There is just so much under the surface of this movie.For example, the number 7 keeps coming up (# of Transylvanians, cards Frank deals during his schtick at the end) and I don't find it a coincidence that there are the same amount of "Deadly Sins". I may be condemned by fellow fans when I say that I only gave it a 9, but if you ask me in a month or so, I will probably be more than willing to up my vote.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Through high school and college I saw RHPS in the theater over 50 times. The video edition is great, but *only* if you're familiar with the live presentation. Let's face it...it's a really "bad" movie. I doubt it was truly meant to be a "good" movie. It's a pun on sci-movies, morality, and transvestites...what a mix! Understand that there are also good and bad live casts as well, so seeing one bad show does not a bad RHPS experience make. I'm delighted to see that the "Super Heroes" version has finally become available. Only true RHPS fans will care about that sort of thing, but after you've seen it 50 times and memorized every line, it's exciting to see a "lost scene". My advice: see the video first (so you'll understand the plot and characters) then see it in the theater several times with a live cast (you'll have a bigger appreciation because you understand the plot and characters).</fullReview>

I really doubt ANYONE could have pulled off the Role of Frank-N-Furter on the big Screen.. and it goes without saying that the WHOLE cast was well chosen as well.. it would be hard to imagine another actor playing Brad.

		<fullReview>I like this film. Tim Curry's always been my favorite actor and I inevitably had to check out his big-screen debut. And after viewing it for the first time, I thought... "WTF did I just watch?" I mean, it was colorful and all but this film was jam-packed with more sexual undertones than a softcore porn video. Tim Curry as Dr. Furter was just... AGH, WHY?!Then, slowly but surely, this film started to grow on me. I eventually checked it out and found the songs and story were not that horrifying after the initial shock of seeing five people cross-dressing on screen had worn off. Despite that, I feel the movie starts to drag a bit towards the third act and it stops being fun. Then again, the two best songs in the movie are in the first act. What can you do?The first time you see this, you'll probably be repeating the title of this review over and over again to yourself. But if you give it time, it might grow on you. Be warned: this film will inevitably turn you into a total weirdo if you end up going back for more. EMBRACE THE WEIRDNESS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing the trailer for this film many times and also hearing about how great this horror film was. I oddly put it off so much and then decided that one day, where I had nothing else to do, I decided to pick up "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" and give it a good shot. I thought to myself at the time, if I don't like this film, I'm glad I would've given it a try. I had put it off for so long, but I found that after I viewed this well crafted, colorful 1975 masterpiece, my views totally changed.The story is quite simple and it contrasts very well with the songs and strong cast. The entire film round was not a creepy, scary or clich'd horror film. It never intended to be a dark, gory or sad horror film which depicted disturbance or shock. Instead, for me, it was a massive change that I have ever encountered when watching a horror film. This film was oddly bizarre and crazy. It had the typical themes of musicals and horror aspects going for it, but it overall produced and presented a light hearted value which I had never seen before in many horror films.Sure there were killings, but the crazy chase scenes, the bizarre acting from the cast (especially Susan Sarandon and most notably Tim Curry) and the fantastic musical scores kept this horror film on the lighter side of things. I was never afraid of it.I have to strongly point out that Tim Curry as the wickedly posh/stylish doc was really impressive. As a kid, I first saw him in Muppet Treasure Island where he didn't do to badly with the script he was given. Then the 2nd film I saw him in was Stephen King's IT where to me his performance was a great improvement from the last as he was able to pull off a very scary and sadistically insane clown which showed much humor. But in this, my gosh... it was the best acting I have ever seen in his films.His character was fascinating as I watched the way he did his moves and actions on screen. He truly brang a memorable horror character to the table. The make-up, attire and light-hearted accents also gave a chime of great contrast to the way he started to sing songs.Many of the other cast were strong including Susan Sarandon who I had never seen in a roll like this. I first saw her in The Lovely Bones where she didn't do a bad job, with the little amount of time she had on screen. Then in Dead Man Walking, she did an excellent job and it was a powerful and very provoking performance. In this, I just didn't expect her to play such an out-going roll, where she would prance and 'let the guilt go'. Even if she was excellent here, I just found it so odd to see her in a role like this one.Lastly, the musicals were excellent. Many musicals don't work, but this one kicks the nut out of the shell. Tim Curry especially is the pioneer in mastering the skills and techniques of the way the musicals were shown, contrasted and revealed.Overall, it a classic but very unusual horror film which shows a lot more than your average dark, gory film. Most of the 1970's films were excellent, but the age they were made in were so grim and bleak. Especially films like TCM, Halloween, Wickerman, The Omen or Dawn of the Dead. This film really caught me by surprise with its musicals contrasting with acting and scenarios.Its a good ol' Trabsvestite! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a musical film written by Richard O'Brien that was released in 1975 and is still today recognized as a classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is the abstract story of a well-balanced newlywed couple that are forced to visit a mysterious castle and persuaded into staying the night. Over the duration of the stay Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) and Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon) have experiences they would have never thought possible. The film has a variety of colorful songs that provide an explanation of the plot making the movie sometimes difficult to follow, but if watched carefully the story line falls into place. Tim Curry plays the character Frank N Furter who is a transvestite scientist who has obtained the knowledge to recreate a human being. He stepped up his performance considerably for this role, doing a flawless job at entertaining. The film is packed with glamor, madness, and rock n roll attitude, causing it to become a cult favorite and is still played in many interactive theaters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw it was in 1976,after it opened with relatively little notice. I thought it campy and corny, with a lot of puns, sight gags and prop humor that was not permitted on TV at the time but not any more clever than a mediocre sitcom or sketch. I was amused, but my wife became obsessed. She and I went to midnight showings more often that I would have preferred. My opinion dropped with each viewing and eventually I just gave up on both the marriage and the film.The screenplay is juvenile, the acting amateurish, and the props are annoying.

		<shortDescription>The best movie about alien transvestites ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rocky Horror Picture Show was first released in 1975. The movie is based on a United Kingdom play from 1974. The movie has a cult following and still airs in theaters in certain cities. The movie is known for doing something new and the songs. The songs include "Time Warp", "Sweet Transvestite", and others. This movie has a bunch of transvestite characters which makes people assume that it's not for heterosexuals. That is obviously not true. If it was true, there wouldn't be such a huge cult following and the movie wouldn't still be airing in theaters after 35 years. The plot is about a couple that wants to visit a doctor that they know. Their car breaks down so they walk to the nearest house which just so happens to be the transvestite Dr. Frank-N-Furter's house. They are first introduced to the butler Riff-Raff who guides them into a room in the house. The room is full of people doing a performance of the well known song "Time Warp". After that song, Dr. Frank-N-Furter appears and sings "Sweet Transvestite". The end of the movie parodies science fiction movies. This movie started the beginning of Tim Curry's acting career.As you can tell by the description, the movie is not meant for kids. This is a movie where you especially have to pay attention to the R rating. Kids may want to see it because it is a cult classic and they may have read great reviews about it, but they shouldn't watch it. This movie is good for older teens and above. Despite the three family friendly songs in the beginning, the rest has sexual undertones.I wasn't sure if this movie would be good because of the plot, but I was surprised. There is two versions of this movie. The original United Kingdom version and the edited United States version. The only difference between the two is that the United States version removed one of the songs to make the movie end at a lighter note. The DVD release has both versions.The DVD that I have only says rated R and not what it is rated R for. I think that it is rated R for sexual undertones and violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>how do you praise a film that already has so much praise heaped on it? i guess try to say something different that hasn't already been said. easier said than done. for one thing it's hard for me to think about this film in a detached way since, like 'Mary Poppins', i've also seen this over a hundred times at least. no exaggeration. i've seen 'Rocky' and 'Poppins' well over a hundred viewings. it's like my brain has become so meshed with these film experiences it's a little hard to accurately assess what i'm feeling or these film's effect on me as i view them.i could go on about the cleverness of the whole production, the incredible performances, hilarious, ribald script, or the truly memorable and tuneful score. i could even wax enthusiastically about the deep brilliance of Curry's performance, most notably in the ballad 'I'm Going Home', but it's been done and i won't.probably the most original and unique thing to say that other's don't say is this; you don't need the audience experience to get the best viewing of 'Rocky'. i know. i can hear a primal scream arising from my generation and 'Rocky' fans at this idea, but i believe it to be the case. this is such good musical theater that you don't need an audience yelling out the dialogue and songs to enhance it. actually the audience only distracts from the great music and performances. so much in fact,that i never realized how truly good 'Rocky' really was until i started viewing it at home without the audience participation and distraction.to each his or her (in this case you can't be sure) own, i suppose. the audience participation is fun and worth a look, but not ultimately the best way to see this. i wouldn't go see a Lloyd Webber play with everyone shouting out the songs and dialogue, so i don't really want to view 'Rocky' that way either.it also seems like some of the die-hard fans miss the experience somewhat. i've actually talked to fans who loved the film but thought it was cheesy and poorly made schlock. couldn't be further from the truth. i am always amazed at what a slick, glossy, professional production the film makers achieved on such a low budget for the time. 'Camelot' and 'Hello Dolly' might have been twenty times more expensive, but as good cinema, those films are disasters. not to mention their grotesque budgets almost sank the studios. 'Rocky' was made for a mere million dollars, and is far better than it's grotesque, behemoth, counter parts. i can't watch the likes of 'Camelot','Oaklahoma', or 'Hello Dolly', without feeling bored and nauseated by their conventionality.it's also funny to note how many people are still uncomfortable with the films outlook and message. that's cool. that's the way it's supposed to be. the film is about crossing the line and shaking up the norm. i was surprised at how many Gay men i've met who hated this film and were uncomfortable with it. but then again those were the "log cabin" types of Gays. you know the ones that try so hard to be straight acting and normal.even though many would disagree, this film has a lot of class. it is also very good cinema(on stage it was a spoof of 'B' movies), and much better musical theater than most of the gobbly- gook Broadway and off-Broadway has to offer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you'd had said that I would love a film that involved song and dance numbers, a character who cross dresses and Susan Sarandon, I'd call you crazy. Yet here I am, reviewing the Rocky Horror Picture Show. The craziest film that gets you singing along. I had the great opportunity to see this in the theatre once for a midnight showing. It was a blast. Brad (asshole) and Janet (slut) have car trouble and take refuge in the Frankenstein Castle. While there, they run into some Transylvanians and a mad doctor, Dr. Frank-n-Futer. He is creating his masterpiece, Rocky. The film blends horror, sci/fi, comedy, musical, camp, and thrills in one unforgettable package. The moment those lips appeared on the screen singing the opening number, Science Fiction + Double Feature, I knew I would like this film.I was wrong, I loved this film. Riff Raff, my favourite character, is played by Richard O'Brien. Half of the creative team behind this piece. The most iconic character in musical films, in my opinion, is played by Tim Curry. In an unforgettable role as Frank-n-Futer. The film has catchy songs, every single number I seem to like. Of course I have my favourite, but there is not one song that I can't stand. A rare thing for me and musicals. The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a hard film to sell to people. It might make them uncomfortable to watch, but I love it every time I see it. It's campy for sure and it knows it. People didn't get that back when it was released, but they did once it played to the midnight crowd. It holds the record for longest film release for theatres, because it's still going.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a Kiwi, I'm kind of biased towards this movie. Man, we love Rocky Horror. There's a bronze statue of Richard O'Brien as Riff Raff in Hamilton; he lived up that way between 1951 and 1964, and we claim him and Rocky Horror as national icons. Anyway, watched this one (again) on TV the other night and realised that it really is best viewed with other people, even if they aren't actually there in the room with you. It's knowingly cheesy, definitively camp and so utterly daft that you'd have to be a completely tone-deaf homophobe to dislike it. If the spot-on characterisations don't get you (the cast is mostly drawn the well-oiled British stage version, which had been running for almost two years), then the plethora of addictively catchy three-chord singalongs will. If you're of a certain age, these songs are probably tattooed on your DNA. The acting is perfectly-nuanced all round, but a sublimely innocent/sexy Susan Sarandon (who'd have thought?) and an entertainingly louche Tim Curry are excellent. As a cinematic exercise it's neither technically brilliant nor totally sound script-wise (the narrative gets a mite confusing toward the end with the puzzling 'floor show' sequence), but 'TRHPS' is way more than the sum of its parts. This movie is a bit like the music of the Beatles; it's always been there and its almost beyond sensible criticism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Among Classics ... Only Crazier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If one were to ask a film critic what they consider to be the greatest movie ever made, "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" would most likely not be a popular answer. If you look at this madcap rock 'n' roll musical from a purely cinematic point of view, it's easy to understand why: an amateurish attempt at a story, less than stellar performances, virtually nonexistent production values, and some of the cheapest special effects ever captured on film (even for the year 1975). When caught up in technicalities and a longing for mainstream purity, then one would have a perfectly good argument for "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" being one of the worst movies ever made. But if one were to ask a fan of the film why they love it so much, I guarantee you that their reason has nothing to do with production values or mainstream desirability. Quite the opposite--it's a film that's shunned by most audiences. This hasn't stopped it from becoming one of the most successful cult films ever made, grossing to date over $100 million (this is over a thirty year period, mind you; it's initial release was a disaster). This is because "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" is not just a motion picture. It's a pure social and cultural experience, one that has liberated numerous people labeled by society as "misfits" or "outcasts" with its message of, "Don't dream it, be it." It's also a ritual that warrants midnight gatherings on Fridays and Saturdays dressed as one of the film's characters. The fun is enhanced through the use of props (such as rice, water pistols, and toilet paper, all of which are used on cue) as well as by the act of shouting vulgar lines back to the screen. This trend of audience participation has remained a staple in "Rocky Horror"'s successful history and only adds to its appeal. Can you imagine how uninteresting it would be to view this film in the privacy of your own home? Above all else, it's an opportunity to have fun, allowing for (and often encouraging) the release of the party animal within us all. Only at a "Rocky Horror" showing would no one blink when seeing an audience decked out in fishnet stockings, glittering corsets, and pasty makeup plastered on their faces. Everyone is uninhibited and no one cares what others may think. What a great excuse for a year round Halloween party. "Rocky Horror" is also about the music, with some of the most classic songs ever recorded, including the show stopping "Sweet Transvestite," the delightfully sappy "Dammit Janet," and "The Time Warp," the film's signature song (which prompts the audience to get up and dance along with it). In fact, I'd go so far as to say that the very fabric of the film's greatness depends on the music. And why not? The oddball mix of science fiction, horror, sex, and comedy just aren't enough; all that can be seen in plenty of other cult films. Give us something more, something that would leave a lasting impression on the ones who took the time to see what this movie was all about. Through music, "Rocky Horror" does that, and does that well. Of all the performances in this film, Tim Curry as the transvestite mad scientist Dr. Frank N. Furter is the most memorable. His decadence and sexual overdrive hits us like a ton of bricks and never lets up. (And who really wants it to?) In the tradition of Frankenstein's Monster (who has just come out of the closet), Frank actually creates a muscle man named Rocky for the sole purpose of "relieving his tension." The Middle American, wholesome young couple Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) and Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon) couldn't be more out of place in the world Frank lives in, which makes the situation they're in all the more entertaining. Things only get weirder when you throw in a houseful of servants with quirks of their own, such as hunchbacked butler, a voyeuristic maid, and a tap dancing groupie. Top that off with the film's sinfully twisted story about the night that Brad and Janet spend in Frank's castle, and you have all the ingredients for a cult classic. Like such offbeat films as "Forbidden Zone" and "Pink Flamingos," "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" is a film that is experienced, not seen. From its humble beginnings as a London stage play to the creation (and initial failure) of the movie we all know today, "Rocky Horror" has given story creator and Riff Raff portrayer Richard O'Brien a godlike status among fans. The film is pure camp from start to finish: fun, cheesy, and entertaining. Whether you've seen it 1,000 times (some have actually seen it more than that) or are seeing it for the first time (which would label you as a "virgin"), it remains to this day a very unique piece of celluloid history. Well, what are you waiting for? Pop in the DVD. Don your garter belt, spiked heels, and party hat. Get your water pistols, newspapers, and lighters. And above all else, let's do the Time Warp again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Cult Classic Example!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, let's get to the bottom line. It had an extremely low budget. Completely. A little over a million dollars. It's very clear to see that it is, with the "amazing" special effects and the "synchronized" dance numbers. I have to say, it is a very poorly put together movie.What I also have to say is that I truly did like this movie. Didn't love it, but the musical numbers were fun, jokes were sometimes clever, costumes over-the-top addicting, and actors not all that bad. I'll probably watch it again and enjoy it even more! What makes this a perfect example of cult film, because the audience doesn't care how bad it's made or how poor the quality of the set, but they love how much fun you can have when watching it. How much you can get into everything that happens in it.I truly hate how people think that just because it's poorly made and quite random at times means that it's the worst movie ever made. A lot of people don't care about the quality. Otherwise, we wouldn't even have cult films (mostly because 95% of them are badly made) and we'd just be stuck with all serious movies.I give this movie a 7, because it's not fantastic, nor bad, nor completely awful, or even okay. It's just...rocky horror. You should know what you're getting into when you press the play button.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. The catchy songs like "Time Warp","Sword Of Damocles" and others are memorable and fantastic, and so is the story line. It's about an engaged couple whose car breaks down, so they go to a castle for assistance, where they meet the sweet transvestite from Transsexual Transylvania, Dr. Frank N Furter, who is working on a buff man. The acting is great, Susan Sarandon, Tim Curry, Barry Bostwick, and everyone else is great, which helps this movie. I want to see it in theaters, but I can't seem to stay up until midnight to see it! This is a great film, and is really enjoyable.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best cult movie ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have this on VHS, and it is one of my all time guilty pleasures. It has a great cast, a catchy music score and unforgettable satire on monster movies, like Frankenstein. If you haven't seen it already, give yourself a treat! I will warn you though, it is extremely silly at times, but that is all part of the fun. And I seriously don't care whether it's poorly made or not and I don't think so personally, all that matters is that it's entertaining, and that is what exactly RHPS is. The cast is wonderful. Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick do a great job as Brad and Janet, although I didn't know they could sing, which really surprised me. Richard O'Brien is solid as Riff Raff and he also wrote the songs. Also solid are Patricia Quinn and Peter Hinwood. The best performance, however, comes from Hollywood's most underrated actor, Tim Curry, who I must say looks hot in fishnets and heels. He has a great singing voice, that is always overlooked. FrankNFurter is a landmark performance, but Tim Curry has also done other great films such as Clue, Legend,Muppets Treasure Island, Blue Money and It. (which has his career-best performance by a mile.) Voiceovers include Captain Hook, Slagar, Hexxus, Drake, Forte, Von Talon and the Mouse King. The songs are so catchy, especially "Time Warp" and "Sweet transvestite" that I actually wanted to dance to the music, but I am a novice at dancing. The complaint about this movie, which is undoubtedly the best cult movie ever, no matter how many times it's been imitated, is the song "Science fiction" which is not in the same league as the more uplifting songs. Still I am happy, and lets do the time warp again! 9.5/10. Bethany Cox.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Musical EVER!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie, with high hopes. I knew that it started the "cult classic" trend, so I was expecting a lot. The first time I saw it, I hated it. I thought it was one of the worst movies I had ever seen. The following day had me bored to death. So, I decided, with nothing better to do, I'd put the DVD back in for one last spin before it went back to Netflix. I watched it again, and absolutely loved it! There is almost no plot, but I'll do my best to explain it. A newly engaged couple, Brad Majors and Janet Weiss, are driving in a storm one night when they get a flat tire. So, with no car, they decide to go back and see if they can find a phone at the castle they passed earlier. Once they enter the castle, you enter a wild ride as you encounter transvestites, handmade humans, and even aliens. The movies a blast, and the music is some of the best I've ever heard in a movie. The movie has enjoyed an unusually long stay in theaters, and I doubt it will ever leave. The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a film unlike any other, and it is the best musical I've ever seen. If you haven't see Rocky Horror yet, see it now. Twice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are You Tingling With Antici...pation?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was positively exquisite. I originally watched it with my two closest friends during a sleep over because one of the two said it was the perfect sleep over movie. At first, I was totally apprehensive. I didn't know a thing about the movie, had heard it was relatively stupid, and had been told there was some sort of "pelvic thrust" dance which appeared really weird when performed by my friend.I couldn't have been any more wrong. The movie was excellent. I fell in love with it from the start. Brad and Janet made me laugh my head off, Tim Curry made me lick my lips with antici...pation, and Riff Raff and Magenta gave me a taste of one of my favorite love pairings (incest). My friends and I couldn't stop doing the Time Warp dance, and we now have "Sweet Transvestite" and "Time Warp" on our iPods/MP3 players. You could call us Rocky Horror Picture Junkies.The thing about Rocky Horror is that either you're going to love it or you're going to hate it. There really isn't a gray area. It's just one of those movies. It's a musical, which most people either like or they don't. Lots of yummy transvestites, which can conflict with religion, principles, morals, etc. (which normally I wouldn't care for but in this movie it works). Also, it has a wonderfully sci-fi subplot, and normally people either spring for that stuff or they don't. Like I said, either you love and become a junkie, or you don't and consider it a tremendous waste of your time.In reality, this isn't a good movie for kids or really even pre-teens. Lots of nudity, lots of lewdness.... However, it's excellent if you're a cult fan. I'd recommend this movie to anyone with a golden sense of humor and a love for audience participation and/or songs that get stuck in your head.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Movies ever, PERIOD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cult classic, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, is about a clean-cut, all-American couple who get mixed up with sex, science fiction, and aliens. One stormy night in Denton, Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) and his fiance, Janet Weiss (Susan Surandon), are in their car off to visit their good friend, Dr Everett Scott (Jonathan Adams). However, they get "caught with a flat" and have a spare tire badly in need of air, so therefore stop off at the castle they passed a while back for use of a telephone. What they don't know is that within the castle resides Dr Frank-n-Furter (Tim Currey), a Transvestite, his domestics that practice incest (Richard O'Brian and Patricia Quinn), and his groupie (Little Nell) who's in love with a motorcycle bad boy (Meat Loaf). Brad and Janet are soon invited up to Frank's laboratory, where they witness the creation of his newest sexual playmate, muscle-man Rocky Horror (Peter Hinwood). Despite their protests, the couple are invited to stay the night, and so begins the craziest sleepover the world has ever seen. Based on a premise that is reminiscent of B movies, "Rocky Horror" is absolutely brilliant. It is full of laughs, sex, and some really magnificent musical numbers. There is, I think, nothing more enticing and amazing than Tim Currey's brilliant portrayal of Dr Frank-n-Furter, who he makes incredibly sexy and yet repulsive at the same time. And, again, surprisingly enough, ALL OF THESE ACTORS CAN SING WONDERFULLY! I can see why people don't like it, I can Definitely see why people do. What I can't see is why anybody wouldn't find at least one thing in there to love; there's romance, there's raunch, there's comedy, there's drama (although it's highly satirical), and there's music. If you haven't got this movie in your home, if you haven't bought the soundtrack, do so immediately! It's SO worth it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie, it was on tape. No, I didn't go to any midnight screenings. And you know what? I loved it anyway! I'm a huge film buff, and even I missed quite a few of the classic film references that are used so liberally throughout the movie. You really have to watch, and listen, to get them. O'Brien's songs are exactly the sort of high-energy, get-down music that is needed to pull off this wildly imaginative spoof of horror/sci-fi/crime film.It's a hoot to see future Oscar winner Susan Sarandon as an uptight, recently engaged, virginal Janet (with pink dress, of course), having a night with her fianc, the equally uptight Brad, that neither of them could ever have imagined.Every now and then, a poll is taken to list the best film performances of all time. This one has never made the list, but for my money, one of the top ten performances in the history of film belongs to the "Sweet Transvestite" himself, Tim Curry. He inhabits the role with such verve and engaging weirdness that you WANT him to win out, even though you know that (among other things) he's a murderer and a cannibal. You even try to tell yourself that hey, what he did wasn't THAT bad.In every scene, the eye is drawn inexorably to Curry (no mean feat, with Sarandon as costar). Everything he does, whether drooling over his latest creation, using an electric knife to slice a "turkey", or merely raising an eyebrow, is magnetic; it's impossible to look away. He's funny, he's frightening, he's amazingly sexy, and his performance is sheer genius. He makes full use not only of his body, but of his powerful, full-throated voice, a voice of black velvet and thick cream. This is a performance that deserves its own special place in film. Viva Tim Curry!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot imagine this movie being much of anything were it not for the charisma brought to the character portrayed by Tim Curry. Although I'm in my 40s, I saw THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW for the first time last year, at the Queen Mary Theater in Long Beach, California. Performed with a local ensemble cast and all the usual lunatic fringe that this cult classic is famous for attracting.I was also delighted and surprised at Susan Sarandon's charming vocal talents. She also did a first-class acting job at bringing Janet to life.The faithful handyman is also unforgettable and another fine example of perfect casting and directing and acting.But above all, it's Tim Curry who completely steals the show. When any other scene was on the screen, I found myself willing to look away, to watch the local actors playing along on the stage below the big screen, to look at the crazies in the audience doing their bit. When Frank (Tim Curry) was on the screen, I could not take my eyes off him. His every little move, gesture, facial expression, inflection - he's a joy to watch! I've enjoyed him in other movies and TV shows as well.This movie is a phenomenon and wildly entertaining - a sexual horror - a spectacle! It should never be remade. The campiness of this version is a perfect fit. Trying to improve it with better technology will only be taking it too seriously and will spoil the charm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh, what a bizarre movie this is. I was a hung jury for at least six months. My initial reaction was, "This is the biggest piece of garbage I've ever seen!" but there was still a part of me wondering if it really was that bad. So I watched the movie again. And I'm honestly glad I did.Let's get one thing perfectly clear. This is not a movie for sane people. If you're expecting anything that even comes remotely in the vicinity of normal, you really shouldn't watch it. It's a story that involves many things. Those things include: a transvestite alien, a pair of incestuous household hands, a flat tire, a radio broadcast of Nixon's resignation speech, and a group of very, very weird and strangely-dressed individuals randomly bursting into song and dance. Plus there's a lobotomized former delivery boy (played by Meatloaf), a monster, and a jealous, whiny tramp (played to perfection by Little Nell Campbell). And it all unfolds to a very unusual rock-and-roll soundtrack written by Richard O'Brien (who appears in the movie as Riff Raff).Oh, and let me tell you something. The sight of Tim Curry throwing off a shiny cape to reveal the lingerie he's wearing is one of the most jarring events of my entire life. But if you can move past the initial shock factor, you'll find a witty movie full of fun, packed with odd laughs at unconventional places, and with practically no real sex at all.Then, after you've decided you like this movie, tune in for the 1981 sequel, a delightful box of fun called "Shock Treatment."Best song: Meatloaf's "Hot Patootie"</fullReview>

This movie and show is 32 years old and is still being shown through out the world. It has influenced the "Gothic" style of films and the musical style of films. This movie introduce us and got us to really notice Oscar winner Susan Sarandon (Janet Weiss), it also showed us the "Transexual" side of Tim Curry (Frank-N-Furter). This movie even influenced my life, when I first saw it at 7 years old I was never ever the same.

		<shortDescription>A Cinema Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" in 1976, shortly after it's release. It was shown as a double feature along with the movie "The Ritz" with Rita Moreno. There were only about 10 people in the audience and no audience participation. I was so shocked and impressed that I convinced some friends to go see it with me the following weekend. There were about 30 people there that weekend. My friends were so impressed that we came back with a larger group the next night. That night there were about 50 people in the crowd, many of them, like myself, had seen the film several times or more. Gradually the audience size and participation level grew. I feel privileged to have seen it grow with each time I saw the film. I saw the movie about 35 times before the audience participation became extreme and annoying to me. Now it is virtually impossible to see the film at a theater as I first did, without any distractions or interference from the crowd, and that's a shame because the movie and music are very well written and show best on the big screen. To many the participation is what makes the movie fun, but this flick stands very well on it's own. I consider it to be a cinema classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rocky Horror Show (the musical play) debuted in 1973 and two years later, The Rocky Horror Picture was shown to the world. This bizarre cult favorite is one of the best movies I have ever seen (and I have seen MANY movies). My other favs include anything with Cary Grant, Gene Kelly, The Marx Brothers, Charlie Chaplin &amp; other classics. Anyway, RHPS is still popular in this generation and continues to play weekly in many theaters (usually at midnight). Fans often attend viewings dressed as characters from the film and respond ritualistically to certain events by throwing food, using props, yelling jokes, dancing, and cheering. This movie has a lot of memorable songs and moments. IF YOU Haven't SEEN IT, SEE IT. YOU MUST GIVE YOURSELF OVER TO THIS ABSOLUTE PLEASURE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rocky Horror Picture Show is one of my favorite movies of all time. Why? It's entertaining and not to mention, original. I've never seen a movie like this one before, that's why I love it so much. It stands out from the other movies and just doesn't care about manors. This movie have actors that knows how to make fun of themselves for not getting scared of embarrass themselves. Tim Curry is best on that. The plot is original. They make fun of science fiction movies back from 30s up to 50s and becomes their own plot out of that. The music is hilarious. You hear the songs once and somehow you just remember them. Especially Time Warp. I saw this movie for the first time when I was 14 but I hated it 'cause I just didn't get it. But I saw it again about two years ago and I just fell in love with it. I get their humor and their acting is just brilliant. Watch it. And when you watch it, you want to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rocky Horror is an amazing film. It's got amazing songs with brilliant actors and a creative script. Some find the thought of a man wearing women's clothes scary, if this is the case the film will most probably offend you. At the start of the film we see Janet and Brad witness a wedding, Janet catches the bouquet. Soon after Brad erupts into song asking Janet to marry him with "Damit Janet". The young couple then decide to see the man that made it all happen. Dr Scott, if it wasn't for him the couple would never have met in one of his classes. They happen to brake down and find the only hope they have is to go to the Spooky castle they saw. The spooky castle is Frank N Furters castle. In this castle they will do and see things that they can never forget. It's such a good, entertaining film, watch it once. Next time you'll be singing along.</fullReview>

It has all the necessary ingredients: young couple in love, stormy night, car trouble, creepy castle with eccentric host etc., but some things sailed over my head. With the audience in a theater though, it's an experience not to be missed (watching it at home yelling the lines at your TV just isn't the same).

		<fullReview>A fun, vigorously entertaining romp that never gets old. Jim Sharman's take on the Richard O'Brien stage play is filled with wonderful, bizarre characters, a memorable score, and splendid set designs by Brian Thomson. Tim Curry contributes one of his most memorable performances as the beloved, outrageous, and ultimately tragic figure 'Dr. Frank'N'Furter', while Pat Quinn, Ritz O'., and the other cast members rise to the occasion, turning in equally stellar work. From Bostwick and Sarandon, to the delectable Little Nell, everyone shines. The score, written by O'Brien, is as relevant a player in the film as the actors are, and is one of the key ingredients to the piece's continued success. It is difficult, now, to refer to, or to even consider this work as a 'cult' hit, or chic phenomenon. It really is too good of a movie and nearly everyone who has access to the home video market has seen it. I only hope that the real triumph of the film, which is it's message, isn't discarded, or eclipsed by it's more apparent offerings of camp dialog, and witty, off-beat humor. The central theme of the film being that there are no real 'freaks' in the clinical sense of the word, that genitalia doesn't necessarily specify gender, and that we are all capable of turning our innermost desires and fantasies into flesh and blood reality. A glorious treat for the senses! As genuinely moving, as it is clever and well-made. You really must see this lovely work to truly understand the rabid devotion of it's ever-growing fan base.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK. I've never seen the movie before. Until about last night, when I was frantically flipping channels to keep my parents from seeing what I was watching.This movie is the best musical ever made. It tops The Sound Of Music, Chicago, and (as a purist it hurts me to say it) even Moulin Rouge. It's crazy and dirty, and it's still great, for a movie made in 1975. I can see why it became a classic. After watching it, I find myself singing the songs (Touch- a touch- a touch me and Sweet Transvestite the most) over and over. It's a movie you watch, and get woken up.I watched Moulin Rouge when I was twelve, and that jazzed me. It's all I thought about, and really became and obsession. At Fourteen, I watched this, and I felt the same way. It's so nuts and dirty that it's charming. Everyone should watch this movie once, and even if you say you hated it, you know you loved it. It's essential to watch.As for the performances, everyone did a great job bringing to life the colorful characters in the movie. Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick make the ultimate squeaky clean couple, and Patricia Quinn, Richard O' Brian, and Nell Campell make the oddest henchmen. I got a kick out of the Translyvanians, they where so weird. Now, last but not at all least, Tim Curry. Tim Curry is SO bizarre, and crazy. He's doesn't make an ugly man, or an ugly women. I must say, he has great legs. I'll have to buy the DVD for this and pull out my fishnet stockings next time I'm feeling down, because if this does'nt make you feel good about your sex life, nothing will. I'd love to see it in a theater at midnight, and definitely do the toast thing. Now I have to just find someone else that likes it.....This film is truly a movie that rocks.

		<fullReview>Title: Rocky Horror Picture Show Director: Jim Sharman Cast: Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon, Meatloaf, Richard O Brian Review: Its a cult phenomenon, people go to special midnight showings of this film and have audience participation which includes throwing everything from rice and water to screaming "Asshole" and "Slut!" in certain parts of the movie. So having heard all this I had to finally find out exactly what the heck the big deal was about and I was pleasantly surprised.Brad and Janet are a couple who are very much in love and have plans of getting married soon. On their way to a hotel, their car breaks down in the middle of rain storm so they try and look for a place to stay. They find Dr. Frankenfurters castle and decide that its the best place for them to maybe use a phone. What they don't know is that there's a bunch of cooked up loons waiting inside having the craziest party ever.Well, what can I say I'm a sucker for musicals, and as far as musicals go this is a very good one. The songs are fun, the characters are crazy and the story line is whacked as it could ever be! I devoured every song of this film! I must have re winded "The Time Warp" about 500 times and "Science Fiction/ Double Feature" is just as catchy. All the songs have this sleazy sci/if, horror, lusty, slutty vibe to them that is very entertaining.As for the horror element of this film well, its there. Its not as abundant as the title might suggest but its there. Lets see, there's the helpless couple coming to stay in a spooky castle in the middle of a lightning storm. There's the butler dude that looks like he was Igors long lost causing, there's an evil doctor trying to create the perfect man which is an obvious nudge to Frankenstein right down to naming the main character "Dr. Frankenfurter" and then there's the aliens and zombies. As you can see this flick has many horror elements to it, so that might attract a few horror fans. But of course this is first and foremost a musical and a comedy, so be aware of that. If you cant take people braking into song every 10 minutes, then stay away.Then there's Tim Curry as Dr. Frankenfurter. After seeing him on this film I have to say that I respect they guy. I don't know if he is gay or not, but damn it takes balls to do a role like that. To know that people will remember you for all eternity as a "sweet transvestite from transsexual Transylvania" who walks around in high heels and make up...well it just takes gut to do that. And he did it very well. This character is so incredibly memorable, he is evil, he is selfish and lustful. He goes for pleasure and desire and the pursuit to fulfill them. He is kind of repulsive to look at...but at the same time you cant take your eyes off cause he is just so entertaining! I enjoyed every second he was on the screen. Memorable in deed.There's many more memorable characters on this film like Richard O Brian as Riff Raff, the bony hunch back of a butler and my favorite of all...Columbia and Magenta. I love those two gals! They are demented! My favorite of course is Nell Campbell as Columbia! Her squeaky voice and seeing her tap dancing is a special highlight for me, I think I kind of fell in love with that actress while watching this flick. There's also Meatloaf as Eddie. I got a kick out watching him playing the saxophone to "hot patootie". He was like a fat Frankensteins monster.And of course there's the beautiful Susan Sarandon. She actually looked hot back in the seventies! I would never have pictured her in a movie like this one, but heck, there she is dancing in her underwear and making out with Tim Curry.Anyhows all in all it was an entertaining ride. The movie just has this really strange aura about it, you feel like you are watching something thats coming from another dimension and time, crazy, demented...surreal. But like watching an Almodovar flick, if you are a homophobe then don't even get close to this one! Its a movie that makes obvious references to the gay way of life and sexual liberation (so seventies!) so if those themes don't sit well with you don't rent or buy this one. But if your open minded about these things you'll find yourself enjoying what is a great musical and a weird, intoxicating fun film, with memorable characters and songs.I'm certainly going to be doing the time warp again and again!Rating: 5 out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a 70's flick, i must say it wasn't half bad. Good tunes, freakish story line, but amusing. Tim Curry rocked as Furter. Though the transexuality was a bit awkward in the movie. Still, a decent movie. Exceptional cult classic. 3.5/5 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Upon viewing this movie, I had high expectations that were ultimately not met. During the movie, I kept glancing to and fro hoping that my disappointment was not betraying me, but since the cult-like adoration is contagious, I assumed a fake admiration for the flick w/out really liking it. Eventually I shook off this pretense when I realized how truly lame and uninspiring it all was. The Sexual Liberation at the end was just plain stupid. What specifically annoys me about this film is that is seems to be self-indulgent cinematic masturbation rather than a clever, quirky little parody, as can be demonstrated by the entirely self-congratulating pansexual fan base. So why is it so popular? The fans are divided. Some have an intelligible answer, that it is a good satire, they have their reasons, somewhat respectable. But by far the most ridiculous (and common) reason for elevating scantily clad, effeminate Tim Curry and His Random Sexual Minions to cult status is that they initiated some sort of personal/sexual epiphany for the viewer. I mean, come on...This is proof that most Rocky Horror groupies are simply rabid, foaming at the mouth hedonists that should be avoided at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Growing up is easy to do...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie back in the early 1990s, when Britain was being choked in the grip of political correctness and it seemed 'fun' was already a thing of the past. I'd never seen any of the CARRY ON films, only knew a little about Monty Python, and the likes of Russ Meyer and John Waters were complete strangers to me. So when THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW turned up on television late one night, I tuned in out of curiosity, and quickly became hooked. Not that it was a particularly good film or anything like that, it was just very brash, very different, very daring and outrageous, and that was all that mattered to a somewhat repressed seventeen-year-old growing up with a dull family in a dull provincial town. Fast forward a year or so. I'm nineteen, I've been drunk dozens of times, had a few girlfriends, seen something of the big bad world and have decided to check out a live cinema screening of this film. What a mistake. There I sat, gamely dressed like Eddie, surrounded by the most pathetic and disturbed people I have ever met. Sweaty, middle-aged businessmen and their giggling, peroxide secretaries dressed up like the Transylvanian party guests, geeky students revelling in the naughtiness of dressing in well-holed stockings and thick layers of black make-up, boring nerds doing Riff and Magenta's hands-together salute thing and quoting the dialogue ad nauseum, rice flying everywhere, water pistols being sprayed this way and that, toast crumbs down my neck, drunken morons screaming "SLUT!!!" and "A**HOLE!" every time Brad or Janet were on-screen...the whole experience was loudly, defiantly screaming "This is FUN!", but nothing could prevent it from feeling extremely forced and desperate. Worse yet, a friend of mine was working at the venue, and he loudly complained to me about the drudgery of cleaning up rice, toast, soaked newspapers and God knows what else off the seats and carpets that awaited him once the transvestite speed freaks had gone home to their snooty semis or halls of residence. I did a lot of growing up that night. This film, like it or not, IS the audience participation. The antics of the obnoxious cultists are the main attraction, the film itself a sideshow. And what a rotten film it is. The whole thing, intentionally or not, looks cheap. The acting (especially by O'Brien, Quinn and Little Nell) is horrible. Every scene has the look of a cut-price student revue that must've looked hilarious on paper, but stumbled badly at the rehearsal stage. Anyone who seriously thinks this is a masterpiece, or even a cult classic, needs to either get a life or do some growing up. Hell, I managed it. Maybe you can too. To paraphrase Frank, don't dream about maturity...be it! Sorry to sound like a killjoy, but that's the way I feel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can you really argue that point? It's been in theaters over 25 years now, and there's no sign of it ever leaving. It's the most interactive movie ever, and the most likely forefather of Mystery Science Theater 3000.But I'm not here to divulge my opinion of history. I'm here to talk about the movie.Part Sci-fi, part musical, part comedy, part B-movie sex flick. It's so bad, it's good. It's silly, but you can't help but be endeared by the thing. Straight-laced couple Brad and Janet, through an unfortunate twist of fate, end up in a party house from the flip-side, and end up sex prisoners. Hearing it without audience participation loses half the fun of the film, but even then, it still has its memorable one liners, and some undeniably catchy songs. And how could one even comment on this movie without a mention of Tim Curry's outrageous performance as Dr. Frank N. Furter?Even though it's never really mentioned anywhere, this HAS to be the highest-grossing film ever made. Certainly after 25 years, it must have been able to outrank "Titanic" or "Star Wars". But cult films don't rank the same as mainstream films in commercial reports.It's a strange film. It's not my favorite movie of all time, but it stays in my collection; it's just one of those things that you can't help but like because it is so quirky. By itself, the film is okay. With the comments, squirt guns and toilet paper, it's a blast. It's worth a watch, especially in you've lived in a cave and somehow never managed to see it. But go to the live show or watch it on DVD with the commentary. That's what makes this film so special, and you'd be denying yourself the fun otherwise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat baffling at times, but it's still highly entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of any movie that I remember as a complete or part musical ("Grease", "The Blues Brothers", "Streets of Fire"). "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" is about the weirdest one that I've seen. It combines the music with sex and humor that is extremely bizarre.A criminologist (Charles Gray) tells the story of two straight (and I mean "straight") American ordinary people, Brad (Barry Bostwick) and Janet (Susan Sarandon), who make the mistake of spending the night at the home of Dr. Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry), a man who thinks of himself as transvestite and is throwing a party for some friends of his (I assume).The movie is a bit baffling at times, but it's still highly entertaining. Bostwick and Sarandon are both okay, but Curry and Richard O'Brien are fun to watch and give very good performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My All-time favorite movie &amp; The Queen of Cult Classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seriously now. The very first time I saw this movie was on Comedy Central back in 2001 and I caught it halfway through. I honestly had no idea what it was about, but I loved the music. I'd honestly forgotten about it until several months later when my friend pulled it out and suggested we watch it. After watching the movie all the way through for the first time, I concluded that it was my new favorite movie. Of course, that was back when my favorite movie would change every once in awhile, but seven years later, it still holds strong as my all time favorite movie! I have to confess, I am a Rocky Horror Virgin. I have never had the exhilarating and liberating experience of seeing it in theaters, but I will as soon as I can find the nearest showing.Anyway, now that I've explained how I've come to love the movie, let me explain the movie itself.It all stemmed from a play that I believe debuted in 1973 in London, written by Richard O'Brien. The play was transformed into this movie and released in 1975. Although UK audiences accepted it well enough, the US rejected it. Critics panned it, no one went to see it and the film was dubbed a bomb. After some time, a theater started playing it at midnight and soon people were lining up to see it at midnight, dressed crazily or as their favorite characters or both. Audience participation, funny games and acting it out on a stage in front of the screen also became a huge part of it and the film has become the queen of all cult classics in my opinion. You can still find midnight showings today.For those of you who couldn't guess, it's a musical. And it opens with what has become perhaps one of it's most trademark images, the big red lips on the screen singing the opening song which is most an ode to old Science Fiction movies (hence the title of the song "Science Fiction/Double Feature".It then moves in to a wedding where we meet two of our protagonists, Brad and Janet. Brad pops the question and the two set out to meet their old professor who introduced them. Along the way, they get a flat and decide to check for a phone at a nearby castle.Once inside the castle, they come to realize they've stumbled upon something of a nightmare and a freakshow. A mad scientist, a creepy butler, a deranged maid, a groupie, the mad scientist's creation, a party of guests and they all refer to them as Transylvanians. For those who think they mean the country, you are sadly mistaken.After a weird string of sexual escapades and shocking revelations, who shows up but Dr. Scott(the professor Brad and Janet were on their way to see). It is revealed he works for the FBI, investigating UFO's. However, he claims he is there because he is looking for his nephew Eddie. Eddie was a victim of Frank-N-Furter, the mad scientist, who used half of Eddie's brain to bring his creation to life.After they've all discovered they've been eating Eddie for dinner, Frank turns them into stone and dresses them for the random-yet-genius Floor Show.Ready for the final twist? The butler and the maid have had enough of Frank running around and doing whatever he wants. They kill Frank and his creation before telling the guests to leave and blasting the castle, which ends up being a space-ship back to their home planet, leaving Brad, Janet and Dr. Scott dazed and rolling around in the front yard where the castle blasted off from.Confused? Maybe The Criminologist who narrates along the way can help you understand. Just watch the movie! Still confused? There are many website devoted to explaining everything out. And even though some of them are so thorough, you would have to believe them, they are all theories.Want more? A follow-up called "Rocky Horror Shows His Heels" was planned, but after extensive rewrites and budget cuts, the movie "Shock Treatment" was made. Is it a sequel? Sort of. A lot of fans call it an equal and don't hold it as high as they do this movie. There are also a lot of RHPS fans who disown the movie altogether and ignore it. If you plan on seeing it, I suggest listening to the soundtrack thoroughly because if you don't know the music enough to help you into the story, it may slightly bore you.However, this movie is my all-time favorite movie and I highly recommend it. 100 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie as a triple feature with Eraserhead and Freaks. I was fourteen years old. I saw the poster for Eraserhead in the theater window and thought that the haircut was real cool, so I bought a ticket and went in. Six hours later I emerged from the theater in a daze that was way more intense than any drugs I've ever taken. Rocky Horror is actually a very old fashioned musical. That's why its survived for so long. That is why millions of people know all the words to all of the songs. At the age of fourteen, i found the cross-dressing to be shocking and kind of scary. But in the context of the story it was so believable. This movie is very similar to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Facory in that the director create a 'complete' world. Everything is plausible and anything is possible. This film is not self-indulgent like Warhol's Frankenstein. This film welcomes the audience into its world and takes them on a journey like Alice down the Rabbit Hole or Dorothy on the Yellow Brick Road. This film changed the way that I saw movies. I put this film in the same category as Greaser's Palace, Fearless Frank and much of David Lynch's work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can you say about "The Rocky Horror Picture Show," the quintessential cult movie? Here we have a movie that was based on a stage show that was a smash on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, yet failed miserably in theaters. At least, at first. Once it caught on for audience members to get in on the fun, "Rocky Horror" became a legend! This movie wasn't made with a big budget (and it shows!), and it pokes fun at the genres of horror, sci-fi and musicals. Whether you come to see it equipped (water guns, toilet paper rolls and the like), or not, you will be encouraged to not dream it, but be it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, I'm not hating on cult films, transvestites, nor the 70's.However, having watched this movie at the age of 22, hearing nothing but good things about it, I was thoroughly disappointed.I found this movie boring, slow, and above all, the music is awful, just awful. I had no idea that "Time Warp" came from this movie.I understand that at the time, this was a huge achievement for homosexuals and trans-genders, but now in 2014, this movie holds no relevance, nor does it entice the viewer. So dear readers, feel free and watch this film, you yourself may enjoy it. However in my opinion, this film is famous due to the older generation, the buzz the film created when it was released, and the sway it holds in the gay community.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Any movie that makes me contradict myself this much must be at least decent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As of 2009, it's official that there have been more classic horror rehashes/remakes/homage films than actual classic horror films. It's almost humorous when a movie like Hatchet or Wrong Turn will come around and proclaim to the masses that it's here to bring back oldschool horror . . . for literally the 500th time. Obviously, there is something about nostalgia of overtly bad movies that captivates directors and audiences alike. In modern cinema, nostalgia has become such a driving force that things like originality, intelligence, and quality have been discarded. So, looking back on The Rocky Horror Picture Show from a modern viewpoint, I can't help but find it refreshing to say the least. Instead of just wholesale copy/pasting past films, The Rocky Horror Picture Show relives nostalgia through semi-original ideas. If more modern homage films must be made?and I really wish they weren't, but it's inevitable?and if they have to copy/paste anything, then they should copy/paste The Rocky Horror Picture Show's formula.It's always hard to review a film that everyone loves but you've just seen for the first time. Very few movies mean the same to the modern viewer what they are to those who saw it at midnight on the day it was released. I watched The Rocky Horror Picture Show for the first time last night, and it simply failed to awe me. Do not misunderstand me: I'm not saying it's a bad movie by any stretch of my words, but it was just a little dull. I can't put my finger on why, exactly?it just was. I guess it could have been due to the overhype it receives. I was expecting some god-awesome transvestite musical with a plot like none other and characters that I'd never forget. In reality, The Rocky Horror Picture Show was just average, even for its time. It's creative, but it's not original. The characters are memorable, but they're not wholesale unforgettable. The jokes are funny, but they're a lot more typical than I thought they'd be. The entire movie is intentionally pumped with clichs, but that dulls it all rather than creates obvious homage. Maybe I'm being overly critical, but I'd go as far as to say I was very disappointed.What I'm trying to say is this: The Rocky Horror Picture show isn't as amazing to the first-time viewer as it's hyped to be.All the actors play their roles perfectly. Tim Curry certainly does not disappoint. But a lot of the supporting characters are all just clichs-with-legs, and that really dulls the movie further. It's as if they were rejected by The Munsters and The Adam's Family and decided to get together and make a movie with the exact same exact character profiles. It's sad to see such a lack of imagination on less important details.The story itself primarily unfolds in a single room, and that gets boring quickly. Though there is a lot of homage to sci-fi/horror films, there isn't enough of it. The writers incorporate a few over-the-top 40s moments, but they're few and far between. The story itself is mostly a long, linier clich, and I do not think that was intentional. Even if it was, it's boring. It's predictable. It doesn't hold your attention. Once your mind can get past the awesome-creepy Tim Curry character, everything just falls into predictability.So, as you can hopefully tell, my review contradicts itself more than once. One paragraph I call The Rocky Horror Picture Show a great movie, then the next I call it pathetic. But those contradictory statements represent how I feel about the overall movie. It's both semi-original and painfully predictable. It's certainly not everything that the hype says it is, but that doesn't mean it doesn't deserve that hype. AHH! Okay, before I contradict myself again . . .Overall: The Rocky Horror Picture show is an essential piece of cinema. It demands at least one viewing. However, it isn't as imaginative as it appears to be.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two squeaky clean innocents--Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) and Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon)--get a flat tire while driving in a rainstorm. Fortunately there's a castle down the road that might have a phone. They are greeted by Riff Raff (Richard O'Brien) (the butler) and his sister Magenta (Patricia Quinn) (a domestic). It's the night when the Transylvanian transvestite Dr. Fank N. Furter (Tim Curry) is making a man (Peter Hinwood) for relieving his...tension. Oh yeah--and it's a musical!OK probably EVERYBODY knows about this by now. It's on video, TV (although horribly edited), DVD and CD. In it's initial release it bombed but became a monster hit as a midnight movie--which still runs to this day.Seeing it on TV, DVD or video doesn't work. Basically this is NOT a good movie. The low budget shows, there are some tacky special effects and a real slipshod script. BUT if you see it WITH THE RIGHT AUDIENCE as a midnight movie it works. The theatres usually have a cast recreating the events happening on screen under the screen and the audience yells out some very funny and dirty remarks. If the audience knows what to do it's great fun. If not it can be deadly dull.I do love this movie (in a way--I'm giving it a 10) but I won't say it's good. It just makes no sense! Still the movie works beautifully when the songs are on. The songs themselves are great and very well-directed. Also the cast is going full throttle all the way through. Curry is just superb, Quinn is hilarious and Bostwick and Sarandon have fun (take a look at some of the faces they making during the "Time Warp" song). Also this is a classic of pop culture. So--it's not good as a conventional movie--but it's great as a midnight movie and probably the best midnight movie ever. A 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupidly entertaining celluloid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd had The Rocky Horror Picture Show on tape for a good few months before I finally got round to watching it. I was expecting to hate this film with a passion due to my general dislike for musicals, and the fact that the idea of men wearing stockings and suspenders doesn't really appeal...but, to my surprise, The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a damn good time! The songs, most of them famous in their own right, are very catchy (if somewhat irritating), and a great ensemble cast gives life to a whole host of weird and overly camp characters. Quite what the point of this film is, is anyone's guess, as it doesn't really have a plot and if there's any substance at all, I couldn't detect it; but what The Rocky Horror Picture Show does is prove that films don't need to have substance to be great, and can achieve that acclaim by simply being deliriously entertaining. The film, being made in the seventies, does have something of a social value; as it somewhat sums up the carefree attitudes of the decade. The Rocky Horror Picture Show is just out to make sure it's audience has a good time - and although I can see why many, many people hate it, it does achieve it's aim.Tim Curry has the role of his career as Dr. Frank-N-Furter. Camper than fifty rows of tents, Curry gives great vitality to the film, and it's hard to do anything but laugh (or stare in sheer horror, if you prefer) as he performs his entrance song (and the best song in the film) 'Sweet Transvestite'. Despite some other nice performances, Curry is always the standout and I honestly don't think that anyone else could have played the role to such great effect. The film is constantly silly throughout, and this works massively in it's favour as it gives the film free licence to basically do whatever it wants. The Rocky Horror Picture Show can throw absolutely anything at you, and it's easy to buy it because, after seeing 'The Time Warp', it can't really get much more stupid. The film does, however, get a bit too overwhelming at times; and at about the half way point, it throws so many songs into the mix that it's hard to keep up. This is the film that the phrase 'love it or hate it' was made for ? it's the sort of film that gets a reaction. If you cant buy into the style and verve of the movie, you will undoubtedly hate it; but if you're in the mood - this is really good stuff. I recommend that everyone sees this movie, as this is the sort of film that people become film fans for. It surprised me anyway...</fullReview>

The main question I have when watching it like a normal movie is how could you NOT make fun of this demented movie?I suppose this is a good time to share my own experience with the "Rocky Horror" extravaganza. My college always put it on around Halloween as an annual tradition, and my friends and I always wanted to go all together but were never able to arrange it until our senior year. Now, I wouldn't find this out until later, but it turned out that I was the only person in our group who had any idea what would happen in this show. Now, can you imagine going to a "Rocky Horror" production, expecting something like a normal play or movie, and not having ANY idea what it was really like?The good news is this, one of my friends who is still kind of our ringleader gave the perfect capsule review of this show: "It's about two hours of 'What the Hell *IS* this???"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not care for this rock &amp; roll, twisted version of a transvestite Dr. Frankenstein-type creating a male hunk to satiate his strong sex drive in the least. The story concerns a couple, played by Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon no less, having the unfortunate mishap of a flat tire near a castle occupied by a weird group of sundry sexual miscreants. The story is tied together through songs sung by the characters and by a narrator seemingly in an omnipotent state of being. The film is meant to be high camp...and it is. It does not at any point take itself too terribly serious. Which is good. But, for me, it was just too bizarre, too perverted, too outlandish, too much singing. I know many people love this film. I wish I had liked it more. I wanted to like it more. But, alas, it was not meant to be. The acting...if you wish to call it that...is decent. The music will appeal to some. And I suppose the sight of Tim Curry in garters, stockings, and other feminine attire will even have its fans somewhere. Not here. I really could not tell you what exactly happens in the end. The biggest plus for me was seeing a very suave, dapper Charles Gray as the narrator reciting ridiculous lines and even sing a line or two. Gray was a great actor who for many has been immortalized through this film. That is good, but I hope they also know that the late Mr. Gray was an actor of the widest range and ability. He had presence and such a distinctive voice. At any rate, I must give a negative nod to Rocky Horror for myself. For what it is...and for those that like "that" kind of stuff....enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A total waste of money and time......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am still trying to understand WHY this rubbish was made in the first place! It has a cult following to boot! I saw this thing in high school and to this day, do not even know WHY I wasted my money. The only thing about this flick was we could take newspapers, light matches/lighters and throw rice without getting thrown out of the theater (for us rebellious teens, that was a miracle!) If I were Tim Curry and Susan Sarandon, I would be embarassed, they must have been hard up for cash or just starting in their careers.......both MUCH more capable of doing better stuff. Enough said!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far out and crazy different type of drama comedy musical that teases and tries to entertain.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that the "Rocky Horror Picture Show" is one film that's a cult classic and is on many of lists for midnight shows in art house cinema's and it even plays at many homes late at night. So I decided to check it out and clearly the film did not hold my interest as it just wasn't my cup of tea. I for one found it a bore as the music just did not strike a note with me nor did I find the picture very funny. To me it's just a different far out far off march to the beat different type of movie. It featured some well known people in early roles like Susan Sarandon, Tim Curry, Barry Bostwick and even an appearance by singer Meatloaf is seen! The story is just about a couple who happen on an old house a mansion type and they find it's a house with a Frankenstein type and a gender bending transsexual in stockings and garter belt hoses! Overall crazy far out picture that tries to entertain but doesn't for my taste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Was Bored Within The First Ten Minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though I purposely allowed for the fact that this demented Musical/Comedy is now 40 years old, that still didn't prevent me from giving it a below-average, 4-star rating.If you ask me - On top of having way too many abrasive characters in its story (who were repeatedly being loud and annoying), this utterly wacky wonderland tale (with its 100-minute running time) also went on and on for far too long with so much of its nonsense that it quickly became pointless and tiresome.I'm completely convinced that this "Rocky Horror" picture could only appeal to those who (back in the late-1970's) were still in their youth and were easily caught up in all of its silliness, while viewing it at some movie theater's midnight showing.This is definitely a movie meant strictly for die-hard nostalgics who are still able to forgive it (flaws and all), as they persistently hang on to their fond memories of viewing it from the good, old days of yesteryear.</fullReview>

Welcome to this 1970's transsexual, Transylvanian romp where archaic gay-camp (mixed generously with pure nonsense) is bound to tickle you pink.So, come on down to the lab to see what's on the slab with Brad &amp; Janet (and all the rest of this loony gang), where non-stop scenery-chewing and neurotic silliness prevails (like never before) in this decidedly dated, time warp production.For all of the endless raves of positive reviews that this particular Sci-Fi/Musical/Comedy has garnered for itself over the past 40 years, I was certainly quite disappointed, indeed, to see just how unbelievably tame this one-note-joke-of-a-movie actually was, in the long run.It was so tame, in fact, that absolutely no profanity, whatsoever, was ever uttered, at all, throughout its entire 100-minute running time.... Can you beat that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cult that hasn't aged well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me get this straight: I'm not going to deny RHPS was likely groundbreaking in its day and dealt with subjects that weren't easily featured in most movies.However, I'm still baffled by how such a campy and disjointed work has transcended the boundaries of its own niche, achieving pop-culture relevance since.The whole thing is (consciously?) so out there you can't possibly take it even remotely seriously, regardless of how many times the message (whatever you are, be it!) gets hammered home. Sexuality as a whole is so ridiculously overplayed it loses it's edge after the 3rd musical number featuring what must be the take on cross-dressing/homo- and bisexuality of a horny and confused teenager.Again, it may have been relevant in the mid-70s, but for today's standards it just looks, sounds and feels lame and painfully outdated, something you'd expect to see in Austin Powers as a throwaway gag.Maybe even the fans don't take it seriously, and the whole "cosplay" thing is the parody of a parody, but it's hard to tell where the line between ironic fandom and bona-fide support lies.Either way, to me RHPS is still a terrible movie and a mediocre musical with an incredibly outdated feel to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A newly engaged couple have a breakdown in an isolated area and must pay a call to the bizarre residence of Dr. Frank-N-Furter. The first half is actually quite good, as it occasionally borders on being a clever satire. Of course, much of the dialog is too functional for the social commentary to really work, but every once in a while a little gem of a scene appears. Or a little gem of a line. This movie was great! The is was one of the best cast ever assembled, and the dialogue was great. I don't think there was one ounce of bad acting, and the comedy was pretty much clean. I suggest this movie to everyone.

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rocky Horror Picture Show is probably THE best movie ever made. Great soundtrack, great cast. It's one of those movies that never gets old no matter how many times you watch it. Tim Curry puts on an amazing show and I think that's probably what makes this film so exceptional. I love the eccentricity and the aura of the film, and the script is quite good. One thing I've always found very memorable is when they're at the table and Frank N Furter pulls off the table cloth and Eddie's body is all pulled apart underneath, and he's wearing his heart on his sleeve. A truly fantastic modern(ish) Frankenstein story. However, I wish that Rocky had more lines and sang more songs, as his performance on "The Sword Of Damocles" is very good, but I also think the movie wouldn't be nearly as good if anything was different. I would recommend this movie to everyone. You can sing to it, dance to it, cry to it and laugh to it. Even if you don't like the film itself, you'll probably never forget it, and you'll be able to say you've seen it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Will Probably ........Keep Rocking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first half of this strange and camp movie is much better than the second. By that time...it is becoming tiresome...Tim Curry no longer looks astonishing, and the songs are getting weaker. The millions who see this as a cult film would disagree. Indeed this movie has brought great joy and happiness --probably to more people than most "Blockbusters". Curry does a great job as Frankfurter, and is easily the one who carries this. The actual story is so bizarre, fans (when it was released in 1975)...simply went along with it. No one had ever seen anything like it before...or since. The humour is feeble, but its the whole "spectacle" that the cultists appear to enjoy...and of course dressing up like there heroes...and having a jolly good time</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An allegedly normal couple make the mistake of looking for shelter at a creepy old mansion and find themselves mixed up with a motley crew of what can only be termed freaks, led by Dr Frank N Furter, a fishnet and basque-wearing mad scientist.This film of Richard O'Brien's classic pastiche stage musical satire of old horror and sci-fi movies is, of its kind, first rate. Utterly tongue-in-cheek from start to finish, the outrageous material is embraced enthusiastically by every cast member with Tim Curry, in his debut film performance, gleefully delivering possibly the campest character to ever grace a cinema screen.To be frank, this isn't really my sort of film, but I would have to be more of miserable curmudgeon than I am to fail to recognise the joie de vivre which inhabits every frame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for Me to Criticize</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was never part of the cult following for this film. I saw it nearly 30 years ago. I went after midnight with a roommate and found the experience quite interesting. I don't criticize people for enjoying life and having fun with something like this. God knows, life can be boring at times and whatever puts a smile on your face and gets you through another day is OK with me. The movie itself is unlike anything I've seen. The songs are clever and over the top. From Tim Curry on down it is one strange kick after another. It is, of course, filled with every representative of what came to be the GLBT experience. It was a bit much for me at times but it was like watching an event that you can't explain to another person. It sounds stupid to describe it and yet it has an unfathomable charm and a place in the movie musical canon. It was kind of cool to see it again, thirty years later.</fullReview>

How many rocky haters can really justify their reasons for not liking the time warp??! I like the plot. It's none too believable, but it's a lot of fun. Also, Meatloafs appearance is fabulous.

I also listen to the soundtrack a lot (probably more than one should).I know there are a million billion trillion kabillion other Rocky Horror Fans out there. But I had to throw in my two cents too.I love 'Shock Treatment' too. A lot of fans thought that movie was crap, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I listen to the Shock Treatment soundtrack maybe more than I do the RHPS soundtrack.Speaking of Rocky Horror music: if you can find them, I highly, highly recommend the albums 'Songs From The Vault: A Collection of Rocky Horror Rarities', and 'Dark Refrains'. Also, Tim Curry (Frank-N-Furter) and Little Nell (Columbia)had very impressive singing careers as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfect Film to See in The New Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched the great Rocky Horror Picture Show. What a wonderful way to see in the new year. Not only a cult classic, but this film shows how diverse and challenging British Culture has always been. Cross dressing, sexual ambiguity, great songs, satire and a helping of Christmas turkey (alongside a electric meat sharpener and a missing delivery boy) who could ask for more. Tim Curry in suspenders could seduce me (female) or a third of the population of straight men in an instance. A morality tale for the truly immoral. A pantomime festival in that great British tradition of Men wearing Frocks. Get your high heals on, dance the "Time Warp", shout at the baddies (Janet Dammit and Lame Brad) A feel good film for people with a sense of humour,humanistic morals and a double helping of irony.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>so, yeah, it's a terrible movie. the problem is that no one really seems to understand that it's meant to be just that.Rocky Horror is a spoof of all of those low-budget sci-fi films that came out in the 50's and 60's. There was nothing great about those films other than that there was no cgi or advanced editing techniques that we have today.All of the "effects" were done manually, and they still managed to freak the hell out of their audiences.Rocky Horror is an ode to all of those movies made with low budgets and big hearts. If you haven't been COMPLETELY tarnished by modern cgi, then you will get a lot of joy out of this movie.__________________________now, with the review of the actual movie through with, I can get on to the real reason I watch Rocky Horror Picture Show.The Live Showings.the live showings count for about six of the ten stars.If you have never been to a live showing of RHPS, call all of the theaters in your area and find where it's shown.right now.here in Denver, we "Start out by making fun of the holocaust, and go downhill from there"if you do not know what a sit and wiggle is, or what it entails to be a virgin, then prepare to get visually and audibly plucked (couldn't use the real word) repeatedly in the course of the movie.not just plucked, but plucked three ways from Sunday. you will leave there a new person. A decidedly more perverted and insane person, but new nonetheless.At seven bucks a pop, it's hardly a huge investment. And it's much better than going to see most of the bullshit that comes out in theaters now.Make sure to take your conservative and republican friends, too.They;ll get a real KICK out of it.</fullReview>

Several reasons to love Rocky Horror Picture Show:-catchy songs -hot guys -wonderful acting -all out FUN!!!!To be honest with you, the real reason i wanted to see the movie once again, was for Tim Curry. He is absolutely amazing. You know from the beginning that he is the villain, yet you love him.With the Voice, the wildness, and the 6 in. heels, he is one of a kind. I strongly recommend it to Johnny Depp fans (Tim Curry is some what a Jack Sparrow kind of guy) and any body who loves seeing men in lingerie. (Is there anybody who doesn't?)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Rocky Horror picture show" is crazy, uncontrolled, touching, strange, bloody, musical, sexy, happy, sad, dancing, sticky, addictive, unlimited, gay, wet, imaginative, erotic, unconscious... and well... of course is a movie too.This is a movie about much things. Things like sexual liberation, visitors of unknown places, Lily St. Cyr, silk stockings, rare dances and a great topic for midnight.The story is about the funny Janet and the four eyes Brad. The transvestite Frank, the sexy Rocky, the rare handyman, the strange maid, the girl who loves Frank, Dr. Scott, Eddie and our narrator. It is a story that perhaps arrives to the unbearable thing, to the tedious thing. But if you change your mind, and see it with other eyes, you will have, maybe, one of the most craziest nights of your life. Songs like "Touch a Touch a Touch a, Touch me" (which is my favorite), "Sweet Transvestite", "Superheroes", "Science fiction double feature" and of course, the distinguished and fun "Time Warp" are the qualities that make this exotic and delirious movie. "The Rocky Horror picture show" is a bad movie... but i loved it!!! *sorry for mistakes, if there any</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always been ridiculed as being a movie fan who as not seen this movie. I normally wait to see all of a films installments if I can and that is one reason I took so long to watch The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Another reason is because I felt if I was going to watch this I was going to watch it the way it was meant to be watched and that is with a group of people who love. Since I live in a small town this was never going to happen, but recently they released this with it's follow up Shock Treatment and I just had to watch it. As I watched I found that most of the film is just Okay. The story moves about like any other movie. The garbage in this movie was the pool number, that should have been cut as it holds the film back from it's ending and makes the pacing awkward. The things that make this film a masterpiece are the songs Time Warp and Double Feature. I also like the Meatloaf segment and the gay themes that ran throughout the film as that was risky back then and I love that they tried to push the envelope. Tim Curry is the reason to see this if you do. He is great as always and I wish he would come back to this character although I know that that is quite impossible with the ending, but others can be brought back to life and so should he. Wathc this and dance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is something that is impossible to debate but Patricia Quinn's performance in this movie is an absolute stand out. She has four lines and yet Magenta has gone on to become the cult icon of this movie, and 30 years on, you get more Magenta's at conventions and shows.Pat Quinn relied totally on looks and expressions alone to make her stand out, and she pulled it off better than anyone. For Jim Sharman, it must have been effortless to direct Pat.When she is in the background, you are instantly drawn to her, and what she is doing because she conveys all this mystery that no one in the movie does.It is amazing to think that the worst performers in this movie Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick are the most successful.

		<fullReview>THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW (1975) directed by: Jim Sharman starring: Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon, Barry Bostwick, and Richard O'Brien plot: On a dark and stormy night, Brad (Barry Bostwick) and Janet (Susan Sarandon) take a road to announce to their scientist friend (Jonathan Adams) that they are getting married. Before they make it, however, their car breaks down and they try to find help. They find a mysterious castle and enter, to meet Dr. Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry), a transvestite who has created a beautiful man (Peter Hinwood) out of lifeless body parts, his servants (Richard O'Brien and Patricia Quinn) who have a dark secret to hide, and his quirky guests (Little Nell and Meatloaf).my thoughts: This is my favorite musical of all time, for many reasons.The performances are perfect. No one can beat Tim Curry as the transvestite version of Dr. Frankenstein, Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick are great as the suburban virginal couple, while Richard O'Brien, Patricia Quinn, Little Nell, Peter Hinwood, and Meatloaf perfectly portray quirky characters and Jonathan Adams and Charles Gray lend their professional presences as older but equally great characters.I also love the music. The classic 'Science Fiction Double Feature', the fun 'Time Warp' and the entire 'Floor Show' sequence happen to be my favorite songs, while the rest are great as well. They all provide to the campy nature of the film.The plot is also a great tribute to horror and science fiction movies, which mixing musical and transsexual elements into the mix. Perfect.While some people may prefer GREASE, I think nothing can beat THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW as the greatest musical of all time.</fullReview>

Rocky Horror is truly made to be enjoyed with the screaming, and throwing, and dirty comments, as strange as that might sound to most movie-goers. Being rowdy is encouraged, and should be. Sal Piro is among many of those who've helped make this cult-classic a phenomenon. The songs are catchy, including Hot Patootie (which according to Richard O'Brien, only Meatloaf was able to sing at proper speed). The movie is about two recently graduated high-schoolers who after attending a friend's wedding get lost during a wrong turn and end up broke down by a castle.

		<fullReview>"The Rocky Horror Picture Show" (1975): I hesitantly put R.H.P.S. in my "Guilty Pleasures" category, because much of deserves my "Quick! Duck!! It Just Hit the Fan!" category. It is NOT a good movie, let alone a good Film, and I have no nostalgic memories of it woven into those heady years my twenties. When I saw it first-run at the local Tucson art theater, NO ONE was "responding" to it (as would soon become the "tradition/obsession"). What I DO enjoy about it is seeing so many actors who would go on to create serious careers (Susan Sarandon, Barry Bostwick..even Tim Curry and "Meatloaf"? but none of THAT is about the actual movie of 1975. 1975?when Disco reigned, and shallow glitz was Queen. When David Bowie, Klaus Nomi, Gary Numan, and all the rest of the androgenous gang were making careers on vague sexuality, and, Punk or New Wave was still 2-3 years away. This was a sad time. Viet Nam had just ended, but everyone was wounded. No one wanted to think about anything any longer. Activism was a burn-out. Cocaine was fashionable, but not yet acknowledged as dangerous or addictive. A.I.D.S. was an unknown disease. Gays were trying to find some respect, and busting out of the closets. New York City was back on top as the center of the Decadent Uni-verse. Everything would be alright if you just DANCED enough!!! Well, thank god, Punk, even New Wave, DID come along as soon as it did, reacting against, or at least parodying those vapid years between Altamont and Patty Smith. R.H.P.S. was the Poster S/He of that time. It is an Artifact?as are the sad, SAD people who gave a significant chunk of their lives to that movie/it's audience every weekend midnight for the last 30 ? THIRTY ? years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Number 1 Favorite..... A True Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a cult classic made in 1975, written by Richard O'Brien (who also stars in the film). It is a comical musical featuring Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon, Barry Bostwick, Richard O'Brien, Patricia Quinn, Little Nell, Charles Gray and Jonathan Adams. The film begins with Brad asking his girlfriend Janet to marry him. They drive off, leaving Denton, Ohio, only to have a car breakdown in the middle of the pouring rain. They notice a castle, so they decide to knock on the door and ask if they can use the phone. Little did they know this stop would be much more than they bargained for! The castle belongs to Dr. Frank-N-Furter, the "sweet transvestite" from planet Transsexual, Transylvania! He is holding an annual convention of all the visitors from the planet. The night Brad and Janet arrive is also the night Dr. Frank-N-Furter plans on revealing his new creation named Rocky Horror, created to relieve the doctors' sexual "tensions". But Rocky Horror fears the doctor and does not want to get sexual with him. Dr. Frank-N-Furter decides he is going back to Transylvania, but little did he know Riff Raff (the butler) and Magenta (the maid) had a different agenda... This movie has hilarious lines and situations, most delivered by Tim Curry, who does a fantastic, hysterical job as the transvestite! He is perfect for the role and had me cracking up! And needless to say, he is absolutely gorgeous in this film, you can't take your eyes off him, he is greatly entertaining! The others are fantastic, too, and everyone fits in the film so well, each holding their own place as a great character. All the actors fit their parts perfectly and by the sets, the dialogue, the actors and the singing, your eyes will be drawn to the screen. As a musical, it has some catchy tunes such as "Sweet Transvestite", "Dammit Janet", "The Time Warp", "Rose Tint My World" and "Toucha, Toucha, Toucha Touch Me". If you didn't know already, Rocky Horror has been playing in the theater for over 30 years! It still manages to attract a major audience of all ages. Young fans find themselves drawn to it and older fans find themselves feeling nostalgic with memories. You toss rice, hold newspapers, squirt water-pistols, throw confetti, throw toilet-paper and call out comical lines back to the screen... after experiencing it at a theater, I can honestly say it is the definition of a good time. What I find amazing is how this film has never managed to go out of style. It always has this amazing, fresh feel to it that makes you want more! I think it's safe to say The Rocky Horror Picture Show will never die. So see it home, see it at the theater, but however you do it, just make sure you see it! Love it, hate it, you're never gonna forget it. Long live Rocky Horror</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time i rented this movie from the movie store i managed to make it through the first song, you know the one where Brad is singing to Janet and them proposes to her, then i had to shut it off because i thought it was so cheesy. Well about one year later i finally rented it again and told myself i was going to watch it all the way through no matter what. Well i did, and i am so happy that i did, i don't regret one minute of watching it and now The Rocky Horror Picture Show is one of my favorite movies. I love to dance and sing along with the songs, and i practically know every line and every word by heart. It truly is a classic and it is always going to be one of my favorites, the acting was great and i don't think they could have gotten a better person other than Tim Curry to play the part as the head transvestite. It is truly a classic film that only comes along every once and i while</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, the movie is cheesy, the acting over-dramatic and the sound effects corny, but I love this movie. I first saw it 20 years ago at a midnight showing in Seattle and it was the best night of my life. I didn't know what to expect, but my best friend said it would be great - just watch out for the flying toast?! When I saw the elevator descending and that high heel thumping to the beat, I found myself on the edge of my seat in great antica........pation. When it came out on video, I immediately bought it. Today my 2 daughters love to watch TRHPS, and I can't wait to take them to a showing where they can really experience the audience participation. It's true that it might not be a movie for some people, but for me, it's entertaining, fun and I can't help but smile (and sing) throughout the movie. The facial expression of Frankenfurter makes the whole movie. I wish he didn't have to die at the end so they could make a sequel, with Tim Curry of course. It's definitely a one of a kind, cult classic that I will never get tired of watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scrolling through the "hated it"-comments of this movie was actually quite funny. As fun as the movie itself I'd dare to say. To find it too silly or too crazy I can understand, but to hate it? You have to see things in life quite uptight. But yes, this movie pretty far out there. Actually its plain crazy. If you want to find out if you would like this movie, here's a test for you: What would you think about the idea of a movie about a rock'n'roll zombie cabdriver singing opera while killing vampire prostitutes from Venus with an X-ray gun with a rainbow colored beam? Rocky Picture Horror Show is kind of a movie in THAT theme, though a different tale of course. If you think that sounds like barrels of barrels with fun, go for the movie. Or if you would like to see how a movie like that would be, because you can't picture it in your head. (That was kind of what I did) If you on the other hands find that too crazy or too far out for your taste, think twice before seeing it. It might not be for you. Still this movie has been shown to be a huge success, being one the longest played movie in theaters, and along with Eraserhead actually invented the term "cult-movie". The strength of this movie is not only the crazy and nihil plot, but also that it is so well done on every other level too. Every character is memorable and the spaced-out songs very catchy. On the technical level it is actually striking, which is a rare find when it comes to these kinds of movies. So that is has been successful is actually no wonder. What makes you hate this movie is beyond me, but feel free to explain.This is a movie for you if you like some far our, non-serious, incoherent crazy fun from outer space. Which can be fun sometimes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Rocky Horror Picture Show" is not one of the most greatly directed movies ever. Actually it is, by the merits of direction, mostly mediocre. But, unlike most mediocre films, TRHPS is not a mediocre film. It is quite interesting.For me, the savior of this film is, and probably always will be Tim Curry (Dr. Frank-N-Furter), who is one of the most underrated movie actors ever: He overacts, but he is one of those actors who can over act very well, actually brilliantly. He has charisma. But from some reason he never actually become a big star. Also Susan Sarandon (Janet Weiss) is absolutely fantastic, and what surprises me the most, she is still as beautiful as she was back then in 1975.So quick plot: newly engaged Janet and Brad (Barry Bostwick) go in the mansion of Frank-N-Furter because they suffer a flat tire. At the mansion they encounter a punch of weird transsexuals from planet Transylvania. The movie is narrated by The Criminologist (Charles Gray), which has never actually made any sense for me, but it does work in the wacky atmosphere of whole film. Besides it's not about the plot, it's about the music. The movie is a musical after all.Also there is a lot of references in older RKO horror and sci-fi films. The whole plot is actually just a huge change to make fun of old horror clichs.But as I said, the flick is a musical, so the music does play important part in the film: so if you don't like rock'n'roll you might have hard time liking this film. But if you do, there are some great tunes in the film. My personal favorites are Time Warp song and the introduction song of Frank-N-Furter. But there is lots of tracks to choose from.And for a note, this is a cult movie, probably the only real cult movie in the world, in the sense that people gather around in theaters, dressed up in their favorite characters, sign along with the film and know exactly how to behave with certain characters. You might not like it, but it is forth seeing for anyone who considers himself to be a movie fan. And who knows... maybe you'll even like it. I know I did. But I wouldn't dress up as Frank-N-Furter. I'm not tall enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>He may be just a sweet transvestite but damn does he look good in a pair of tights! As can be clearly seen in this movie, he has a fabulous pair of legs for a man. Frank N Furter really makes this movie what it is and is oddly attractive throughout. Its rather frightening really, he does look rather good in those hotpants. Tim Curry is a wonderful actor with a really individual voice and face.The good bits in this film don't really start until the Timewarp begins. Up until then it is really slow moving- unlike the characters- and really rather boring. The songs are also sickeningly lovey-dovey. The good songs are a lot of fun to sing along to, they're so catchy and have hilarious lyrics- they even get me singing! Admittedly, it does get a bit scary during the first part of "I Can Make You A Man" when Frank runs his (rubber) gloved fingers down Rocky's exposed stomach. Those gold lame hotpants are about as low as is possible without a blatant outburst of pubic hair, therefore revealing the need for a severe bikini wax. The dyed blonde hair with the tanned skin is not pretty, not to mention the "ugh"s and "uhh"s that make up his entire vocabulary.One character for the guys has to be Columbia. With her extremely pert behind and exposed breasts, I'm sure she is extremely pleasing to watch prance about, needing to be charged with indecent exposure. Her screechy voice does get on the nerves slightly though I'm sure it doesn't rub any men the wrong way too much. Especially for the men, there also happens to be a lesbian kiss, though it looks more like they're trying to eat one another.Overall this film is really very good. Not for those who scare easily or anyone with a nervous disposition.</fullReview>

The second time, the audience was a show in itself. That was fun, too. You can look for messages, or sing along and have a laugh, and either way it's great fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard not to know about The Rocky Horror Picture Show or its influence, but it certainly took me long enough to finally watch it. Pretty much what I expected, for the most part. Just a lot of corny nonsense really, but I say that in the best possible way. It's hugely enjoyable, and where other musicals tend to lose steam for me as they go, this one was pretty consistent and managed to stay surprising and intriguing throughout. Tim Curry is the star here in a extremely giddy and fun portrayal of madness. The songs are also pretty catchy and most are entertaining, including the stand-out Time Warp.This isn't an incredibly significant film, and I'm still sort of shocked it has gained the huge, huge cult following it has. But it's very entertaining and a perfect definition of a midnight movie. I'd be lying if I said I didn't get way more enjoyment out of this than other more prestigious musicals like West Side Story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To me, the most telling part of the films title is the word 'Horror'. I found sitting through an hour and forty minutes of it close to unbearable. It's not that there aren't some funny scenes, there are. It's just mainly I find the whole thing to be too excessive, too over the top and extremely over acted.It's trying to raise issues about Gender equality and Transexualism, it does raise these issues, but I felt a lot of the time it was doing so in a stereotypical and obvious way. People have claimed this is done in a satirical way, but I really can't see this. I think the film is obvious, over acted, and poorly directed. I would say that if anything it is not a weapon against prejudice it in fact encourages it. Everyone has a stereotype of what Transexuals and Transvesties are, and this does nothing to challenge it, it simply confirms peoples stereotyping. If you have actually met someone who is transgender, you will realise that they act nothing like the ridiculous Curry, in fact they usually tend to be down to earth normal people.Nothing but an over the top, silly and over acted piece of cinematic junk. It is to caught up in blowing it's own over sized trumpet, and doesn't stop for a moment to consider what stereotypes it is pushing into the mindset of the people who watch it. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rocky Horror Picture Show, The (1975) *** (out of 4) It's hard to view this film today without taking into account its history of bombing when first released to the fact that it continues to play packed houses each Saturday across the country (and perhaps world). This musical is pretty simple story wise and love birds Brad and Janet (Barry Bostwick, Susan Sarandon) show up at a creepy castle where inside awaits all sorts of strange creatures including the one and only Dr. Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry). I've seen this film around four or five times at the midnight screenings including once on Halloween night, which was a real blast with well over a thousand people in attendance. I think a live screening is the best way to view this film but even without the crowd there's enough charm here to make it worth seeing at home. I think what makes this film work so well are the three leads as they each give a wonderful performance. You can believe both Bostwick and Sarandon are their characters as he makes for the perfect dork and her the perfect virgin. I love how at times they're so serious in their roles yet at other times, when the film calls for it, they go over the top and are completely charming. Curry is simply wonderful here as the crazy doctor and it's one of those cases where you really can't see anyone else in the role. The three of them work extremely well together and they really make this film special. We also get some great songs with the highlights being "Dammit Janet", "Sweet Transvestite", "Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me" and the wonderful "The Time Warp" that could get anyone up and dancing. The cinematography is another major plus as are the wonderful sets and costume design. Is this a flawless movie? To me it's not even close as I've always felt that the last half-hour is a bit of a letdown especially coming after the wonderful first hour. I also think some of the supporting performances are less than stellar but there's no denying the cult appeal of the film and it's certainly worth viewing but anyone who is a fan of the weird.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just people clomping around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie presents itself as wild and outrageous, but now seems about as far-out as "The Munsters," and old-hat besides. With one exception: the scene in which the mad doctor seduces the husband. This is still startling, and surprisingly erotic (especially considering how sterile the movie is in general, notwithstanding its drag queen trappings); it also seems to be the central scene, since it conveys the movie's message: a plea on behalf of sexuality--not homosexuality, as might have been expected, but bi- or pan-sexuality. Its proselytizing quality makes it seem slightly offensive; but maybe I was just responding to it by the standards of its period.Although the music is obviously a pastiche (it sounded to me like Kurt Weill by way of The Who, with borrowings from the Stones, but this is strictly a guess), it is by far the strongest element of the work, and seemingly what the work was built around. The form, to the extent there is one, is that of a cabaret show. And here I must pause to point out, in old-fogeyish fashion, that in some circles in the early '70s the true cult item was not the film but the stage play, whose adherents unanimously agreed that the movie didn't measure up. I can easily believe that, since it looks like a stage play amateurishly transferred to film. On stage the physical detail of the production may well have provided a kind of subtext; the theatre can do that in a way film can't. In the absence of a substitute, the work becomes incoherent. It isn't an accurate parody of the type of movie being parodied; even the logo behind one of the dance numbers belongs to a studio that didn't make those movies. But all the movie-buff paraphernalia is really a red herring; the atmosphere isn't Hollywood but Underground, not faux Whale but faux Warhol.As for Tim Curry in the lead: was he the performer who created the role? He seems like an understudy filling in for Lou Reed or David Bowie, and he's neither very camp nor very tranny. The two cast members who stand out are Susan Sarandon, whose talent couldn't help showing through even then, and Meat Loaf, who in his one number brings the show to life (as Queen Latifah did "Chicago" in analogous circumstances): at last, someone who can channel the music! He is perhaps not very graceful, but he's plainly musical, and getting a charge out of the music, and this informs his every move. By comparison the rest of the cast is just people clomping around on a cluttered set.However, I can say one thing for the movie: I didn't hate it. I had expected to, since I dislike camp, female impersonation, and that whole side of gay male culture which I perceive as woman-demeaning. (However, I quite liked "Hedwig and the Angry Inch," which, if it's about anything, is about that; and so perhaps I don't dislike it as much as I think.) The way I could tell I didn't hate "Rocky Horror" was that the DVD contained something else I did hate, or a simulation of it: the audience response (which the user can choose to mix in or not). Hearing it on a recording is obviously not the same as being there, but it enabled me to imagine closely enough what that would have been like--which would be close to my idea of Hell. I had expected that the spectators' comebacks would make the time pass faster, but they were just irritating, fannishness at its most conformist. The audience talks back to the movie, but the backtalk isn't clever or original; it's a received catechism of obvious, unfunny responses, whose ritual inanity set my teeth on edge and made me cringe for any similar offenses I might have committed, in my salad days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun as a midnight movie experience, but only once</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a strange and witty stage musical of the early 70's The Rocky Horror Show was probably a fun experience for the theater goers when it originally ran in London in 1973. Successful Austrailian stage director Jim Sharman directed the original play by Richard O'Brien with O'Brien who also wrote the songs in the cast that included Tim Curry. Lou Adler brought the production to Broadway in the spring of 1975 with Sharman again directing Curry and O'Brien in the cast and rock star Meatloaf also added to the American production. Adler put the play into production as a Hollywood film with Sharman directing the film and Curry, O'Brien and Meatloaf reprising their stage roles and costumes by Sue Blane who did both the stage productions. Film actors Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick were cast for the film as the young couple who's car breaks down in a rain storm and they seek refuge in a strange castle of a transvestite scientist and friends from the galaxy Transsexual. As a film and a musical it was a little too bizarre and over-the-top for audiences to last very long in general release. Years later marketed as a midnight movie that evoked audience participation it became a cult classic. Tim Curry is good and so is O'Brien but it's hard to actually judge their campy performances when the rest of the cast is purposely bad. The songs are witty lyrics set to bad music. As a theater play it might be fun and as part of a theater audience where the theater goers around you are dressed up like characters from the film and talk back to the screen and throw stuff at the screen it's definitely entertaining. For one viewing. I can't image anyone watching this at home as a film. I would give it a 5.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been reading the reviews here,both the all praising and downright bashing. A few in the middle, which is where I am with The Rocky Horror Picture Show. I watched this some years ago, how I watched it has no bearing on my rating and makes no difference. Watching a movie is just that, 'watching'.Whether it's a crowded theater with people enjoying things the way they like too or seeing at home. (Although I do like seeing more standard types of movies on the big screen.) I watched the movie and I did like the songs, they're very well performed. "Time Warp" is an unmistakably catchy song and some of the others are good too but not as memorable. As for the story, well it's simple Janet &amp; boyfriend are typical straight-laced boy &amp; girl in love, whose car breaks down in the worst possible place. They're let into this already creepy place and find even creepier and/or insane people / creatures. That particular segment was played many times on a local music video station here in Phoenix on Halloween in 1983 and '84. I liked that much of it then but what I saw later...kind of like "why the cruelty &amp; harshness?"I'm not saying there are not bad things in the world or that filmmakers should "never" be predictable,but like one person said here,"this movie isn't for everyone." I just feel that some of the more disturbing things in the film just really weren't called for. Janet,boyfriend &amp; the Dr. (It's just a jump to the left) are basically humiliated for no reason. The ending was no surprise to me but I was hoping those three would escape in time. In short,I'm no prude but just a good guy who lives &amp; lets live. I'm not one to look down on others for things they enjoy,as long as it harms no one else or themselves. However,Rocky Horror is just not really my taste when it comes to movies. I like the dancing and singing and some of the comedy but the rest is just not as appealing. For those who cherish it,more power to you. If you supposedly hate it outright,well at the very least "lighten up" a bit. It's only a movie,not the end of civilization as we know it. (END)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rocky Horror Picture Show starts late one stormy night as Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) &amp; his fianc Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon) break down near Denton the small town where they live, the approach a Castle to ask for help &amp; are invite din where they find a Transylvanian transsexual transvestite named Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry) who also happens by an alien scientist &amp; his unusual guest's &amp; servants as Brad &amp; Janet experience an outrageous night they will never forget...This British American co-production was co-written &amp; directed by Jim Sharman &amp; after having seen The Rocky Horror Picture Show last night for the first time in a very long time I am baffled as to it's cult status &amp; why it's so highly regarded. I suppose the main thing that stands out about The Rocky Horror Picture Show is that it is a musical &amp; people burst out into song every so often, the biggest single problem I have with this film is that none of the songs expect the popular &amp; somewhat catchy Time Warp number are that good. None are overly memorable or catchy, I just thought they were very dull songs that didn't inspire me at all. While something like Grease (1978) has three or four instantly recognisable songs which have worked themselves into popular culture the same cannot be said for The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The story itself is secondary to anything else but if you want to examine it there's not much here to keep one entertained, character's &amp; plot are basic &amp; certainly didn't do much for me. The film borrows most of it's influence &amp; ideas from other films, just listen to that opening 'Science Fiction Double Feature' song which is littered with name-checks &amp; references.The film does look good with some nice colourful cinematography &amp; some nice sets but it's merely window dressing to try &amp; cover-up what I think is both quite a poor film &amp; musical. The film does have a bit of energy &amp; it's quite often rather bizarre but I am not sure that's enough to justify 100 minutes of your time. The costumes are outrageous &amp; there's plenty of cross-dressing going on but these days it comes across as silly rather than daring or shocking.With a fairly modest budget of about $1,200,000 the film does look nice &amp; is well made. Shot on location &amp; in the studio here in the UK. The acting &amp; singing is alright but I can't bring myself to be any more positive than that.The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a film with a strong cult reputation that I can't fathom out at all, what it boils down is that I didn't like it &amp; it's as simple &amp; straight forward as that. An acquired taste to say the least. A sequel Shock Treatment (1981) reunited the writer's, director &amp; some of the main cast &amp; character's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you walk into the Theatre of my old high school, through the scene shop, and down the stairs in the time leading up to pre-curtain rituals you will always, always hear the soundtrack to The Rocky Horror Picture Show blasting from the make-up room at least once, if not five times. Always. During one show I had to sit there putting on make-up with "Touch-a touch-a touch-touch me! I wanna be dirty!" being drilled into my ear drums by not only the CD player, but by every person in that bloody make-up room singing-two dress rehearsals and six performances. And it didn't help one bit that I shared my dressing table with a friend who is obsessed, let me put it this way, she has "Time Warp" on her MySpace.I rented The Rocky Horror Picture Show a few years back because it was one of those cult classics among many of my friends, and I felt as though I should give it a shot; after all, I like horror, I like musicals, I like corsety goodness, and I like Tim Curry. But I didn't like it. Did I tell anyone? Of course not. If you were to even whisper you don't like The Rocky Horror Picture Show within even 50 feet of the Theatre, you would become an outcast before you could say "Damn it, Janet".So, while today at the library, I saw it. I sighed as I picked it up and Tim Curry stared back at me in those stockings and guarders while sitting in a pair of blood red lips. Give it another shot, I told myself. And I did.And, guess what...I still hate it. Like the quote says, "Lost in...meaning". Yes, that is exactly what The Rocky Horror Picture Show is. It has no meaning whatsoever. Brad and Janet don't even 1. get to a phone, or 2. talk to Dr. Everett Von Scott about whatever it was they had to talk to him about! Somewhere I heard that a musical is difficult to create, because you have to be able to insert songs during moments when talking simply isn't enough, and where it doesn't seem awkward. Most of the time it was just plain awkward. Not to mention, most of the events that happened had no explanation. Um, why was Eddie in a coffin which was the table? Just so we could have that stupidly "dramatic" reveal? And what was with the electric knife? Oh, and why were the Transylvanians there in the first place? Some movies I can sit back and not question things like this...but when a movie has nothing to offer but Plan Nine as a musical on crack topped with sparkles and wrapped in velvet, I'm going to wonder.What saves this film is Tim Curry, "Time Warp", and and some of its costumes. Tim Curry is one of the best actors who ever lived, and had he not been in the role of Frank, the film would have been lost.

		<shortDescription>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To celebrate the Halloween, inadvertently I found out that this perennial cult classic would be shown in cinemas with its original version, which prompted my belated viewing of this notorious B-movie tour-de-force for the first time, although B-movie has evaded my entire childhood and I have barely watched any the classics to which the film pays its overt tribute, but, the film is a satisfactory and daring musical with its campy costumes and music arrangement (a cocktail of Glam Rock-New Wave-Nu-Disco musical numbers and giddying dancing routines), a perfect option for its groupies and people who are repellent to horror genre in Halloween. There were a bunch of devotees inside the full-packed screen hall, but the sing-along spectacle didn't happen as I expected (incessant hails were very much present nevertheless), anyhow, we were all enthralling with the atmosphere and the film per se. For me, the musical numbers rendered throughout the film are the predominant assets which should be much appreciated, Richard O'Brien (who is also the sidekick Riff Raff in the film) has managed to write a bunch of utterly spirit-rousing theme songs pandering for the sub- culture habitants, especially for the gay and transvestite disadvantaged groups, which facilitates its iconic status through its conspicuous delivery of messages such as sex liberation, homosexual impetus, free-your-mind and ravished by life. While you can decry its escapism and hedonism misappropriation in your hindsight, but at the moment the film was playing, the invasion of ubiquitous pleasure could encroach upon all the sensory passages, which is an undeniable achievement of the crew. Tim Curry, arguably has delivered the best music performances in a film, whose knockout fabulousness alone could make the film stunningly enjoyable and substantially controversial (from the blood-red lips singing in the opening credits until his valedictory song near the end, it all justifies that either garishness or sappiness could be put into a moment as a revelation!). Susan Sarandon's voice bent is creakily suitable for her shallow and flashy character, which is in tune with other standard B-level performances from the rest of the cast members (although Meat Loaf's one-off interruption of the Transylvanian orgy has the only slash movie quality).An atypical exploitation of Frankenstein (e.g. Peter Hinwood's immaculately sinewy body and a young Robert Redford resemblance is a slap in the face to the usual disfigured stunt of the monster), both male and female bodies should be worshiped in an equal scale, which uncannily prefigures today's zeitgeist. It is a pity director Jim Sharman's career has never taken off, even in his own cult way, but at least he has built a miracle, the film's leggy longevity will never wane, and it will summon its zealots generations after generations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE hard-out music of the century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most insane box-office top ever created is one of the few musicals I would deem acceptable to the delicate ears of music-lovers. However, there are problems. Why does this movie randomly change from a Frankenstein parody to an attempt at 70s science fiction halfway through? You do not change the genre of a movie halfway through, it is a crime! However, this can be forgotten once you listen to (or sing yourself) the words of the fantastic songs, featured as with most good musicals at regular intervals, but not so often that you get bored or misinterpret the story. When most of us think of musicals, our mind jumps to cheesy claptrap such as 'A Streetcar Named Desire', musicals made back in the days when corny group-singing was not a tiresome clich. However, in THIS instance, one can sit and watch the insane action on screen and fit it perfectly with the genre of the songs, a hard genre to describe. I suppose one must call it rock, but it contains a kind of weirdness, a combination between group-singing and rock, making it fall under the musical genre but also providing engaging music for the lovers of rock in the wild 70s. The characters themselves are fantastic. Frank N. Furter (played by the unexpected Tim Curry) has to be the best, his curly wig, his fishnets, his pearls and his corset (but especially his makeup) make him a piece of cinematic history. Also, Riff Raff (Richard O'Brien) is wonderfully weird with his creepy sister Magenta (Patricia Quinn) who retains her position as creepiest actress I have ever seen on the big screen. The instruments used in the music also make the genre lean more towards rock, electric keyboards and guitars, saxophones et cetera. Most people love the Rocky Horror Picture Show for its wackiness, though I was more interested in the quality of the production (especially for a low budget 1975 creation) and the SONGS.The Time Warp, Hot Patootie, Sweet Transvestite, Touch-a-touch-a-touch-a-touch Me, The Sword of Damocles and the rest are all memorable and bring back the life and energy of the REAL musical. So what will it be? 'Let's Do the Time Warp Again' or 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow'?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I watched it because Meat Loaf was in it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge Meat Loaf fan, so in 2000, I decided to check out some of the movies he has acted in. First on the list was Rocky Horror. I had never heard of the movie, and had no idea that it would turn out to be a cross-dressing musical. However, I was highly entertained by this picture, thanks mostly to the musical numbers. If not for songs like "Hot Patootie" and "Eddie's Teddy," I doubt I would have even finished watching it. I have to divide this into 2 halves: the good half and bad half. The movie is awesome up until the Transylvanians leave. The script is pretty good. But when Brad and Janet retire to their separate quarters, things begin unraveling.I have to admit that watching this around friends and family is embarassing, probably because they don't appreciate the music and think that I'm watching it for the cross-dressing aspect. If you get the chance, go see the musical on stage somewhere. I went to it in Minneapolis and loved it. All time, I rank this #25.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not for me but I can see why many people can't get enough of it. It's a musical and falls across many a genre and into none. A sort of sci-fi, comic horror musical, The Rocky Horror Picture Show celebrates the unusual and the outcast and does so with sex and sexuality centre-stage.The plot is rather similar to the manner in which porn films play out: a couple find themselves stranded in the middle of nowhere and the household they are invited into turns out to be a den of nymphomaniacs. Tim Curry is the principal draw of the film, playing the phallic-monikered Frank-N-Furter whose principal predilection is consonant with his cross-dressing. Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick (so all-American he went on to play a New York Mayor in the hit sitcom Spin City) are the gradually emancipated couple and play parts with pantomime shock and fear. Richard O'Brien, who wrote the play on which the film is based is the darker presence at this feast of the senses (but it needs something to temper it all).Ultimately, descriptions are difficult if you haven't seen it and redundant if you have. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a humorous College kind of movie. Even me a heterosexual named Brad can enjoy the film. The characters Brad and Janet make for humorous situations. I would not let my Daughter Julia watch this until she was 18 but thats a protective Father for you. Thats mainly because of lines like "Eddy now there's a tender subject" implying cannibalism which is always wrong for any Human. The scenes with motorcycles and the songs are entertaining. Tim Curry and Susan Sarandon are certainly good actors. My Daughter Julias Artificial Intelligence computer on the Planet Coaltrain said "Daddy I love you through the Storm. " That is in keeping with her personality because once on the telephone she said that she thought a storm was going to take the roof of her house off. Do not worry about storms Julia you are safe in the arms of Love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rocky Horror Picture Show. I don't know really if I like it. The movie starts out, which what seems to be a completely different movie. It seems like almost an hour before we see Tim Curry. The the movie continues with Susan Surranden in he bra, and the guy in his underpants. Then it starts on a weird, acid like trip, to a tribute to Frankenstien. This is where they make Rocky. Then the movie takes another twist, it turns out they're are all sex fiends. The movie seems to go down hill from here. And apparently it's a very long hill to the bottom. The movie is overlong, and very bizarre. Some cool things I found were the sets that were very stage like, so it was like the musical. And the bizarreness is sometimes very funny. Also Tim Curry is great This movie is definitely a colt movie. I know that a lot of people love this movie, but I just can't see what's the "hubub." So I give it a 6, because it's better than 5, but I'm not sure if I liked it. This is a movie you want to watch with your friends, and at midnight showing all dressed up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By writing this review, I will probably confirm my total lack of coolness. The fact is that I really liked about 12 seconds of this movie--the rest of it seemed like a barrier to my going home and getting some sleep. "The Time Warp" and "Dammit, Janet", receive my highest rankings; that one song that features Sarandon squealing, "T-t-t-t-t-t-t-touch me, I want to feel dirty..." receives my very lowest. Frankly, that part scared me, and I never, ever want to see anything like that again.

Yep, I said it - It sucks BIG TIME! Really bad all the way around. (Oh no! There's a dissenter among us! ATTACK!!!) Maybe I was born too late to be able to see this movie when it first came out in the 70's and just didn't know any better OR maybe I was born too early... As far as being cutting edge, I don't see that either. Perhaps it was for its time, but now it's a relic - and a BAD one. Either way, I just don't see the fascination with this film. It's bizarre, full of bad acting, singing and heaven only knows what else. Someone was STONED when they thought this thing up, that's the only way it makes sense to me. Perhaps the folks that frequented Studio 54 are the base audience and keep the cult status going. I don't fit into that demographic and I think this film should go quietly into the same place as Cape Fear (yet another horrible movie).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad at what it does</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main problem I had with this movie was that it tried to shove quirkiness down your throat but then ended up not being as quirky as it intended. OK, we get it, the guy is a transvestite. We don't need a four minute song illustrating that. And sure, a transvestite accomplishes the task of "being weird", but it does so in the same way that "riding horses on the beach" accomplishes romanticism. It's clich, boring, and obvious. Complete the "clichd weirdness" of transvestites with the laborious "trifecta" of aliens and vampires and you are left with a five minute "hilariously random" YouTube skit; draw it out for an hour and a half and you get Rocky Horror Picture Show, a movie I found boring.You might be a fan of this film because you find it "charming", however, I prefer the more psychological reason: because you like to buy in to peer-pressured cult followings where you disregard every shortcoming of the film just so you can think of your self as elitist and can pride yourself on being part of the in-group. If this is indeed the case, you may want to consider turning off your computer and locking yourself in your room for a few thousand years so that the rest of the world can be liberated from your obtrusive ego.</fullReview>

And people kept talking and reciting lines throughout the whole movie! Huh? I even saw one guy dressed as the main character. Real Sci-Fi is a movie like "Quatermass and the Pit"!

		<shortDescription>The Movie Version Doesn't Really Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie deliberately intended to be schlock entertainment; it makes that obvious. It's a clichd idea of a newly-engaged couple who are forced to enter a strange house and see all sorts of weird things and people. It's campy and meant to be so. It has had a significant cult following since it came out. So how is it, as entertainment? I don't know if this was originally a movie and the stage version followed it, or vice versa. But this is clearly a stage-type musical on a video screen. It's silly, flashy, and breaks into song and the movie has no real plot.This would be greatly suited for the stage; loud music, a large cast of dancers, lots of flash and glam. But on a small video screen "Rocky Horror" doesn't really work, any more than stage magic works if you don't see it in person.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong. I have nothing against Tim Curry. But I just find the movie he's most famous for to be utterly pointless, and lame. I remember all the hype about it being a cult classic when I heard my younger brothers and their friends brag about taking toilet paper and other items to the theater to throw at the screen while the laugh at all the people dressed up like the cast, but when I finally got the chance to rent it on VHS, I found out it was utter crap. What was supposed to be the big deal about it? Transvestism? Gothic transvestism? So what? The story sucks. It's about a young virginal couple on the brink of getting married, who stumble across a typical Victorian house after their car breaks down during a rainstorm, where they meet Dr. Frank-n-Furter and his cross-dressing gang, among other weirdos. Brad and Janet were pathetically naive even for the 1970's. You'd think they've been living in a bomb shelter since 1962 and never heard of the sexual revolution.The Music(most importantly) sucks too, except for "The Time Warp" and "Sweet Transvestite." The rest of it sounded like glorified, jazzed-up, lame show tunes. If either the story or music had been better, I might've been willing to put up with it, but neither are any good. Don't believe the hype. This movie's status as a cult classic is NOT well-deserved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you enjoy disjointed plots that make no sense, comedy that falls flat on its face behind garbled lyrics and bad sound editing, and if you think that weird for the sake of weird is funny, you'll love this movie.For those former theater majors who go giddy over the mere sight of stage singing cross dressers, this movie will be a visual delight.If you're looking for a movie that's anything beyond a demented, kaleidoscopic blur of random thoughts and inside jokes between the writer and himself, shat into screenplay form and brought tragically to life by a largely career-suicidal cast, spare your brain from the nightmare that will echo through it for decades. This movie is not for you.It bounces interminably between inexplicable, downright awkward and frequently painful scenes that range between unintelligible psychotic bisexual rantings and drug-induced musical numbers seemingly written during the filming of the scene.For those who understand the value of entertainment and think actively melting their brain is a negative instead of a positive, every scene is horrific. I have plenty of gay friends, but many scenes in this movie were so slathered in useless, preachy sexual androgyny that it made me practically turn my head away in disgust.If you haven't shot your DVD player or thrown it off a balcony by the one hour mark, spare yourself any additional emotional drama of panning your eyes between the screen and the nearest clock and just shut it off. The final hour of the film is almost entirely superfluous.Only in the final five minutes of the film do gaping holes or just plain missing pages from the plot become hastily written into the accidental trick ending. It turns out that the horrific mess you've endured through your now bleeding eyeballs was all just a farce of a farce of a farce that you frankly shouldn't have given a damn about in the first place.Some movies make you laugh. Others make you cry. The better ones do both, and send you out of the theater fulfilled and with maybe a sense of greater purpose in life. This one makes you wish you'd died before your soul got its first glimpse of hell, burned though your retinas onto the back of your skull forever.I gave this movie two stars simply on the merits of my girlfriend somehow liking it, and I like most movies she does. Maybe there's something I'm just completely missing here, like my IQ is too high or I'm handicapped by not having taken drama class for four years in high school. With my possible fallacies taken into account, I have no idea why she not only can endure this, but thinks it's harmless enough to force upon unwitting victims.People call this movie "the ultimate cult classic." There's a reason it's a cult classic. Cults tend to be full of nutcases. I like a ton of crazy, nutty movies - even campy B movie comedies like "Cannibal! The Musical" - but this film is flat out atrocious.</fullReview>

The highlight of the movie is many interesting scenes and good wardrobe. I used to like this movie when I was younger, but after getting away from it for a while, I see that it's really a sad movie. This movie encourages sexual promiscuity and abandoning yourself to pleasure - but that's because in the movies people don't get sexually transmitted diseases. This move contains harmful messages for kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disgusting Cult Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Rocky Horror Picture Show" is one of the most overrated cult films. I do not find this film interesting or "original" in any way. I think it's sick, twisted and demented. Too many people jump on the bandwagon when cult films come out, and are almost expected to like a movie just because it's overrated.I think this movie is trash, and it makes me take a whole new outlook on Tim Curry, who I found funny in "Clue".1/5 stars -John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bad, bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is arguably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I have no idea why people like it as much as they do. I will admit that I have only seen it once on TV so I have missed the audience interaction that is so much a part of the whole experience. However, a movie should stand by itself. I thought the music and the movie were both as boring as can be with no real artistic merit. Perhaps this is an example of the Emperor's New Clothes with no one (except me and perhaps a few others) seeing it for what it really is: a really bad movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is the big deal?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a cult hit, as people like to dress up as the characters and throw toast at the screen during their midnight screenings. However, for the most part, this film is awful to me. First off, it is a musical...and I hate musicals for the most part so me hating it could not be helped. Second, this movie has such an awful plot...what is the point of any of this? Third, the singing of Susan Surandon and Barry Bostwick is totally awful even if I did like musicals. The story has a couple that wants to get married getting stranded on their way to a friend's house. They seek shelter in a nearby castle full of dancing and singing people. Then Tim Curry makes this guy and that is about it other than some really dumb plot twists (What is up with the ending?). The only parts I can say anything good about are the time warp dance scene and the scene with Meatloaf mainly because they are very high energy. Also, Surandon and Bostwick aren't doing the singing so the songs aren't totally butchered. Another interesting point is Charles Gray recounting the story. It is nice to see a former Bond villain doing the role of the criminologist. All in all though if you like musicals you may want to check it out if you have time to kill, but for the most part this movie did not appeal to me at all. I also think it is pointless to scream at the movie or throw toast or water at the screen. Quite frankly, you can do that with any movie if you wanted to, there is nothing that really indicates that this movie was made to do stuff like that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish words existed hateful enough to describe just how much I hated this movie...I bought this movie for someone and watched it before I gladly gave it to them... and let me tell you sitting at work watching this terrible thing made me want to kill myself.(I was at work watching a movie for Christ sake and I almost turned it off and went back to work what does that tell you????????). This movie is SO bad! I really can't even begin to describe this skid mark of a movie. The simple fact that people actually love this movie so much that they dress up like the characters and run around town all day when some rag-a$$ theater plays it....makes me violently sick. This movie for some reason strikes a cord with the gay community, downtown when this god awful thing is playing is beyond un-bearable. I'm not gay bashing at all mind you I'm just shocked that gay's (Normally cultured) like this heap...I guess I'm shocked overall that ANYONE likes this colossal goat f*ck of a movie...If you like Tim Curry in drag running around singing dancing and banging whatever comes across his path by all means go nuts....If you have any sort of taste for film even in the slightest STAY AWAY!

		<shortDescription>this is IMDb, right?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the Internet movie database, right? So then can we talk about the film Rocky Horror Picture Show , as we would any other film? Good. This is one terrible film, the pacing and direction is amateurish, the acting with few exceptions (Tim Curry... who positively throws the film out of balance... perhaps because he CAN act) is poor, and personally... hold onto to your costumes... I think the score is almost as bad as Grease...perhaps the worse score ever for a hit musical (or was that Chicago). I first was "lucky" enough to see this film the way its fans claim it should be seen, at a midnight show... I was perplexed as to why the fans would not allow it to be seen as any other film is seen. When I love a film and want others to watch it I try to get them to see it under conditions that MAXIMIZE their ability to hear and understand the film, not vice versa. So a few years later I attempted watching the film without an audience and lo and behold... the fans were right after all. This is an unwatchable film. Don't believe me? Let's run a good cinematic test on it... what other good films did the director ever do? Hmmm? What other passable films did the director ever do? (Get my drift?) P.S. As for this being a "midnight type cult film", people who love midnight films are always looking for something different to see... something out of the mainstream...not to see the same film 300 times. When I go to the movies I always go to see the stars who GET PAID to be one the screen...not the "STARS" who have to pay to get in. Getting dressed up, going to the movies and "performing" and paying for the privilege of doing so does not conjure up the word "STAR" to me, I see a different word forming, a word that starts with an "L".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And this movie is a classic becauseeee......?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ALL MY REVIEWS CONTAIN SPOILERS. EVERY ONE OF THEM.No plot, boring characters, and crappy music make up the world's largest cult movie. Why the planet chose this as the movie to follow lets me know mankind is in trouble. Serious, cross dressing trouble. This movie wanders around aimlessly for 2 hours, with no pacing and no direction. An hour into it, I didn't even know what I was watching anymore. Sex, drugs, and violence I can understand. But when did homo eroticism, incest, and adultery with aliens become entertainment?The movie opens with some big ass lips singing a song during the opening credit sequence. Once that part ends, it's all downhill from there. We then see Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon playing Brad and Janet, two 30 year-old college kids. Brad proposes to Janet with the world's stupidest song and then they are off to God knows where and God knows why. During a dark and stormy night, (never trust a movie that takes place on a dark and stormy night) they get a flat tire and go into a haunted mansion filled with a bunch of gay Chorus Line rejects. Here's where the movie truly becomes idiotic, and Dr. Frank-N-furter is introduced as the owner of the mansion. Frank-N-furter is played by a very young Tim Curry, before he discovered the powers of the pastry section.After Frank-N-furter sings his "I'm here and queer!!!" song, he shows us the man he has created, in homage to Frankenstein. This is where the movie slows down to a screeching halt, and nothing happens for the duration of its running time. I repeat-- NOTHING. What you get is a 2 hour crap fest filled with wall to wall sh*t bombs and a bunch of men running around in fishnet stockings and high heeled pumps. Who does this appeal to? The queer! Ohhhh! No wonder I didn't like it. No man is straighter than me, so I guess this flick just aint my bag, baby. How dare this movie even have my name in the title.People actually line up every night to see this garbage. Lines that go around the corner. For a 30 year old movie that they know every line to! There are people who have seen this flick hundreds of times! Like it's D.C. Cab or something. Don't believe me? See for yourself. Every big city has a Weirdoville and I ask you, reader, to go visit yours at about 11:30 p.m. on any given night. You'll see a long line of people dressed like gay mimes, ready to do the same ritual they've been doing for the past 30 years. 30 years! Talk about not having a life! They say the "fun" of the movie is throwing toast at the screen. Well, I don't know about you people, but I eat my toast. And making food just to throw it at a screen is a sin worse than gluttony and for that, you toast tossers should all understandably burn in hell.And if I go to the movie theater and someone squirts water on me, be prepared for a fight. Correction: be prepared to LOSE a fight, because I win every quarrel I participate in. I'm just that good. I'm a Bear, for Christ's sake, I'll eat you alive! Who wants to get messy when they go out to a show? Why do you think Gallagher is in the unemployment line these days? Because people finally grew up! They got tired of that silly sh*t. Rocky Horror sucks. And for people who argue with me that I just "didn't get it," my reply to you is, "Thank God!" I would be worried about myself if I did.Going to a theater with a bunch of aging baby boomers trying to recapture the peak of their lives (70's drug explosion) is not my idea of a good time. I grew up in the 90's...the machine gun era, and I'll take violence in my theaters over singing any day.Zero stars out of 5.</fullReview>

The first time I saw it, I was unimpressed - it looked cheap and lame, the songs were like something you might hear at a sixth-form school play, and the overall feel was just nasty and degenerate. A couple of years later it turned up on late-night TV and I gave it another chance and quite frankly I disliked it even more.

		<shortDescription>My Least Favorite Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A cult flick with a huge following-hard to explain at first then easier to explain as one sees the following. I've never been a big fan of campy humor anyway but this one is too near the camp outhouse. It stinks. In the late 80's it came onto the scene as the rousing battle cry of sexual deviants and deviant wannabes as well. Once cult bound drones got caught up in the catchy hook filled musical selections even Dr Demento became obsolete for promotional fodder. Perhaps the biggest problem of this movie is the difficulty in avoiding it. However even nasty substances eventually rot and turn to compost. Any bad movie over time either gets easier to avoid or gets smothered with pungent doses of the affects of nostalgia. Just imagine this one without music. There would be no entertainment value at all. On the other hand the soundtrack without the movie would be somewhat a relief.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was nothing more than in-your-face transvestites posing and wiggling around under the guise of a hip musical. Tim Curry's wearing of black lace lingerie and heavily made up face is forced upon the viewer in nearly every scene. Soon, all the men in the film are wearing identical women's lingerie. What we have here is a concerted effort to confuse the sexuality of young teenage boys, who flock to see this cult film, which has become a rite of passage. It's insidious how the gay transvestite culture is heaped upon the senses throughout this 90 minute indoctrination film. Intense, unrelenting images of men's heavily made up faces and shaved thighs result in nothing more than a 90 minute sexual assault.</fullReview>

And yet even with how absolutely bad this movie is, every year at Halloween, it's in the theatres, on TV, and rented out everywhere. That's amazing. To say the fans are rabid is an understatement; to say this film has staying power is equally an understatement. Make no mistake: I hate this movie, absolutely; but I am also impressed with the number of folks who have taken up its mantle.Perhaps, in the end, it's just me. Maybe I don't "get it."

Yes,there are some scenes that show Dr. Frank-N-Furter defying the laws of physics and all but the movie was fun to watch. A few ideas from some international movies (Whose names i rather not mention) were "borrowed" in this movie. Some of the comedy scenes were a bit unrealistic but then you should remember that you are watching a movie and not a documentary. I got the true Indian experience (shouting, making a lot of noise,etc every time the hero comes up on stage or does something unbelievable or even when he does absolutely nothing but look at the camera.this was for those didn't know what the Indian experience is....) while watching this movie which made watching the movie a lot more fun. I say that if you want to really enjoy this movie, then it is better if you watch it with some fans..No story, pathetic screenplay and overacting crew, i'll suggest that you sit back home doing nothing rather than watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie in general sucks, as it has no story line and has terrible acting. The movie was then made into something that has potential, when people started coming up with the lines, to interject into the movie. These lines make it a lot funnier, and make it into a huge joke. The problem is, some people don't realize it is a joke and they go every other weekend to see it in a theater. That wouldn't be a problem by itself, but the problem exists when they are dressed like transvestites from the movie, and make it into a cult get-to-gether. These people have taken it way too far, and have made this movie, sick and wrong. I strongly recommend never seeing this movie, as watching it by yourself makes you a transvestite, as you watched it purely for the movie itself, and going to see it in the theater on the weekends, has become a cult meeting place.</fullReview>
