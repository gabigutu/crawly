		<shortDescription>Two immortal lovers reunite after years of separation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, Only Lovers Left Alive is another vampire movie. Yes, the characters are very pale and old and romantic. Yes, it is very much full of clichés and stereotypes. However, it is also wickedly smart, beautifully shot, filled to the brim with talent and full of cultural witticisms.Tom Hiddleston is Adam, Tilda Swinton is Eve and Jim Jarmusch is a genius. This is a director that tells us all we need to know without doubting our intelligence. He allows us to fall into the depths of the film without worrying about a perfectly neat beginning, middle and end. He even stops his characters from following tedious and predictable patterns, because after all, they're too old for that.This is a movie for film lovers and pop culture enthusiasts. It is a vampire film that takes advantage of its time span; cultural references dating back hundreds of years can be found at every corner. Only Lovers Left Alive does not focus on blood and gore, it is not a thriller nor a horror, it doesn't even truly focus on the world of vampires. Instead, Jarmusch studies the eternal, he explores the quiet, perhaps boring, every day life of a modern, intelligent and ancient being who has, quite literally, seen it all. - Sinann Fetherston.You can find a full review at MoviefiedNYC.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderful imagery. style and atmosphere in the extreme. great acting. Beauty in many forms: you get a lot for your eyes. Also, depending on your taste in music, there is also a lot for your ears.For your brain, sadly, not as much."Only lovers left alive" is filled with a lot of name-dropping, by word, picture and sometimes sound. Whether you find that fascinating or pretentious depends on your taste.But what this movie really lacks is a story. The characters are throughout and the dialogue may be scarce, but has some dry humour and snappy lines. That doesn't save it from going nowhere. Glaring plot holes may make you cringe at times. And the pacing looks like Jarmush tried to surpass Kaurismäki in terms of slowness. If so, he won.So perhaps this movie is best tasted in the state its protagonists enter after relishing an excellent glass of blood: dazed, blissful, and somewhat drugged.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rock n Roll Vampires</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One knows that a Jim Jarmusch movie about vampires is not going to be like any other vampire film. In fact it would be unkind to class this as a vampire movie. Only Lovers Left Alive is a highly stylized and atmospheric film bemoaning the passing of the great rock n roll and Hippy era. Here we have a vampire couple (Swinton &amp; Hiddleston - both excellent and perfectly cast) living an isolated life in an abandoned house in Detroit, USA. Hiddleston used to be a famous rock n roll artist who has become a recluse collecting old guitars and records. They survive by purchasing blood samples from a corrupt doctor. We also have one of their old vampire friends (John Hurt) living in Tangiers where the blood is specially pure. Things take an unexpected turn when Swinton's mischievous sister (Mia Wasikowska) visits them. Only Lovers Left Alive has cult film written all over it. The music is great too and blends perfectly with the atmosphere. Essential for Jarmusch fans and recommended to others too!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stunning love story between two undying souls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Jim at his utter best. The balance between emotive writing and gentle quiet spaces within the script are total perfection. The characters are well rounded and very easy to empathize with, which is surprising for a couple of centuries old vampires. There is none of the usual gaudy over the top vampiric crap that usually fills these types of movies. It's a love story at heart and one that does a fantastic job of balancing itself so that the intimacy shown on screen is divine taste of these interesting characters lives without falling over the top into some strangely perverse romcom. There is humor and and satire in abundance, though it is never cheapened or thrown into the mix to fill a gap. No this film in entirety is sweet and humbling. The sets are rich and perfectly put together, the performances are flawless from each and every member of the cast no matter how long their involvement. This movie is the type that causes you to want to crawl into it's story and settle down to live within it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Being immortal, like, sucks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just when you thought Twilight had lowered the already-exhausted vampire trope to the level of gum-cracking, teenage faux-ennui, along comes the insufferable Jim Jarmusch to kick it while it's down. In the process he creates this meaningless mess of self-absorbed Romantic pretension and contemporary decay-porn.Adam and Eve(really?)mope through the movie recalling, Forrest Gump-like, all the famous people they have met throughout history, name-dropping like two desperate party-crashers at a Billysburg hipster event. Their irrelevant sidekick, Christopher Marlowe, turns out to be the REAL Shakespeare, so John Hurt (who has become the white Samuel L.Jackson lately, popping up everywhere) gets to spend the film alternating between false humility and 400 year old bitterness. This silliness reaches its apex when Marlowe squats to lay the hammy observation that if only he had met Adam BEFORE he wrote Hamlet.....This is the dialogue of a first-year Arts student with a crush on his prof, trying to be iconoclastic and deep in case she likes him back.Adam and Eve are omnipresent and omniscient, on one hand spewing the most obscure scientific theories, having musical debates and history lessons (of course they both prefer old-school sound and instruments), yet somehow juvenile and myopic enough to label mortals "zombies", as if being alive for millennia has taught them nothing except how to act and speak like navel-gazing teenagers who are simultaneously above it all, yet offended by everything.Adam apparently sprung fully-formed from the head of Anne Rice's Lestat; a prodigious musician, beautiful, a walking romantic tragedy. Unlike Lestat's crotch-grabbing alpha-male God of Rock, however, Adam is pure Emo -- whiny, self-absorbed, condescending, and unintentionally funny in his shallow earnestness. Like all people of such ilk, the further he tries to distance himself from the great unwashed the more he becomes all too human. When you prick him he bleeds, when you tickle him he laughs, when you poison him, he dies, which turns out to be literal here as he and Eve are constantly on the hunt for clean blood. The zombies after all, are so stupid they have ruined their very blood with disease.His dependency on the zombies, both as the Other from whom he must rebel, as well as source of his nourishment, recalls every arrogant and ostentatious university student that has ever lived. His entire identity is invested in the society against which he must fight. There is nothing internal to fall back on, no sense of self. Like all whining hipsters, he is merely a vessel through which ephemera pass, slowly enough to deposit something trite and cool to brandish like a weapon against the herd, but too quickly to leave any lasting knowledge.Eve is basically Adam's babysitter, the uber-cool chick from the local record-store that every fanboy is crushing on deep, yet as usual ends up dating the tragic poser douchebag from the garage band next door. She arranges flights and evaluates his guitar collection by touch, but really does little else but walk around in a pseudo-Bowie attempt at sangfroid, which recalls another vampire story this film leans on heavily, The Hunger.In no way, however, are Adam and Eve reminiscent of Bowie's John or Deneuve's Miriam outside of silly hipster posturing. Perhaps this can best be seen in the film's setting. Whereas John and Miriam lived a life of elegance and class in New York City, all Yves Saint-Laurent and Chanel, Adam and Eve slum in Detroit, the disaster-porn capital for hipsters with vintage Leicas.Like clueless teenagers they sulk around decaying grandeur and the death of the all-American (zombie) dream, wallowing in the misery and loss, which is seen by them as the result of impersonal concepts like Greed and Contentment, not as personal tragedies for individual humans. Again, like all people of this ilk, they would no doubt claim to be a champion for the average man, while at the same time dehumanizing that average man, a feat made easy by their hothouse existence of fleeting hedonism and empty joy masquerading as the examined life. One can't help but recall Charles Péguy's brilliant observation: "It will never be known what acts of cowardice have been motivated by the fear of not looking sufficiently progressive." Like most inexperienced teenage posers, vacuous hipster airheads and self-absorbed romantic-types,the cowardice of Adam and Eve is displayed in every gesture and word. Their hothouse existence, where they are sheltered safely from the herd they despise and the reality they claim to be able to decipher at a level the zombies cannot even fathom, has made them delusional; they spend the film tilting at cerebral windmills they conceptualize as profound observation; worst of all they state, with all the hubris of eternal immaturity, that only they suffer at a level which the materialistic suburban zombies cannot understand, and would not tolerate.A reprehensible and fatuous film.Adam and Eve, you two are so grounded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artistic, Romantic Escapism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only Lovers Left Alive is one of the most breath-taking films I have ever seen. As a fan of the more artistically styled film I was captivated throughout. The entire film is quiet and dark with an eerie feeling of timelessness that matches the souls as old as time itself, Adam (Tom Hiddleston) and Eve (Tilda Swinton). The film centres around their eternal love, highlighting the modern world through the light, easy-going spirit of Eve and the tortured romantic Adam. Despite being set in the modern day it is completely unlike vampire films of recent times, presenting a visually beautiful story of true romance.Artistic is the epicentre of this film. It is entirely set at night so it has a sleepy, soft half-light, in the empty, mysterious streets of Detroit and Tangier. The script has a minimal feel, giving the impression that every word is important, and there are some great moments of dark comedy scattered throughout, mixed with cultural and literary references and philosophical observations. Everything about it is slow and measured and perfected, even down to the synchronised movements of Adam and Eve. The acting is stunning, with a particularly beautiful performance from Tom Hiddleston, who carries the role of the suicidal vampire who has grown tired of the disrepairs of the world with a darkly sexy air. Tilda Swinton provided a light to Hiddleston's dark, offering a rescue at the darkest of moments. There was yet more contrast with Eve's wild and unpredictable younger sister (Mia Wasikowska) and the wise, worldly Marlowe (John Hurt). The clash of characters adds to the charm of the story and the style. The film is slow-paced but contrary to other opinions I didn't feel that it dragged on in any way. It presents a lot of truths about current society which really made me think. Naturally, it remains true to some vampire film stereotypes: dark, sexy and romantic. If you're a Tom Hiddleston fan in particular I recommend this, his portrayal of such a flawed character is simply stunning. However even if you're impartial, I would highly recommend this film, everything about it is breath-taking and gorgeous. It achieves artistic without clouding the message of the film and draws you in to its perfect eternity and escapism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hip, smart and funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Jarmusch's delicious new comedy is a vampire movie unlike any other. It's set in the present but forget those "Twilight" sagas; these are vampires for the art-house crowd, smart, funny and yes, sexy creatures of the night, (the whole film takes place at night; there isn't a single shot in daylight), and I was crazy about them. Indeed Jarmusch has fashioned a masterpiece about a couple of lonely people whose only solace is each other, doomed if you like to be together for all eternity or until one of them gets a stake or a wooden bullet in the heart or drinks some 'bad blood'; (I loved the subtle AIDS metaphor; be careful who you bite). Adam, (tall, dark and sexy Tom Hiddleston), and Eve, (a mesmerizing Tilda Swinton), have been married to each other, several times it would appear, over the centuries but living separate lives, he in Detroit as a reclusive musician, she in Tangier where she has another old vampire for a friend. He is Christopher Marlowe, (yes that Christopher Marlowe), and he's played by John Hurt with a twinkle in his eye. It's when Eve visits Adam in Detroit, flying by night, (in a plane; what did you expect - bat-wings?), that all hell breaks loose in the shapely form of Eve's sexy sister, (a terrific Mia Wasikowska), who can't keep her fangs to herself. As you would expect from Jarmusch this is funny, intelligent and off-the-wall. Hiddleston proves to be a highly dapper comedian while Swinton is superb as Eve, getting all she can out of a life she knows is going to go on forever. Unmissable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the worst film I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I specifically registered with IMDb to write this review, as I don't want anyone else to have to sit through this film. I have absolutely no idea why it's being reviewed so favourably. It is truly, truly awful and I spent the majority it watching through my hands, because I just couldn't stand the overbearing mediocrity of the whole thing. There is absolutely nothing original about it, and as others have said, the dialogue is teeth-clenchingly risible.I was nervous from the very first conversation, when the Hiddleston's character loftily name- drops a historical figure he knew (because he's like, you know, really old? Get it?). His pal says 'what happened to him?' Hiddleston replies 'Ahh, he was casually shot by a parliamentarian', to which the response is 'Whoah man, that sucks.'. Alarm bells were a-ringing.If you were to ask the least-gifted film-maker on earth what he would do to try and liven up the dialogue of a two world-weary, wise old vampires, he would probably confidently reply 'They could talk about all the awesome people they've known throughout history! It would be amazing!'. And so we have it that time and again, a passage of dialogue exists only to demonstrate that one of them knew a celebrity from the last 400 years. For example, the Adam and Eve (sigh) are playing chess when Eve pipes up 'Did you play chess with Byron?' Adam says 'Ah, why do you always do this?', Eve says 'Oh come on, you know I love to hear about these kind of things' Adam replies 'He was a pompous ass.'. Eve guffaws. It's not over yet though. There's more blood to be beaten out of this stone. She continues with 'And what about Mary? Mary Wollstonecraft?' Adam replies with 'She was delicious.' REALLY? Are we actually doing this? Is this what I paid to see? It was like a scene from mid-90s TV movie Bernard and The Genie starring Lenny Henry and Alan Cumming, only that had the good sense not to take itself seriously. Then there is the relentless, exposition about every little thing, as if Jarmusch was so insanely chuffed with each derivative idea he came across that he wanted to make doubly sure you got it. So something's chucked out there (invariably a gag about having been alive for centuries), you roll your eyes, then it's explained why it was said. As a final hurrah from the Bernard and the Genie gag (and this is the spoiler), as their friend Christopher Marlowe (John Hurt) lies on his death bed, they look at his writing desk. Above it is a picture of Shakespeare. There is then (yet another) exposition conversation which reveals that Marlowe wrote all of Shakespeare's works. Of course he did. He says something along the lines of 'Talentless old hack. But we needed him to take all the credit because I was supposed to be dead.'. If that was the case, why would you have a picture of him above your desk? Is it just so that it could spark off that pointless little conversation for the benefit of the audience? At one point Eve is on the phone to the airline, booking her ticket to Detroit. It was like a conversation from 60s batman 'What's that commissioner, there's a bomb under the central bank? And we've only got 7 minutes before it goes off?' Eve's conversation went as follows: 'So I'm flying tomorrow night to Paris? Then I'm flying from Paris to Detroit?' The point of this purely being so that a) you get the point (which is repeated later in the film for the return flight) that they can only fly at night (because they're vampires, yeah?) and b) when you see her on a french airline in the next scene, you don't think 'why's she on a French airline?'. Another example: She finds a wooden bullet that Adam has had made. We know he had it made because there was a whole scene dedicated to him putting in the request for it. She looks closely at the bullet. In reality the emotional impact to her would come from the fact that he has a gun in his flat with a wooden bullet in it. But she is then made to say (bearing in mind she's on her own, and people don't come out with explanatory statements when they're on their own in real life) 'This has been recently made!'. We know it has! And we assume that you know it has because in the previous scene it was demonstrated that you can date things just by touching them! But just to eliminate any doubt, she talks you through it. The whole film feels like it was edited by Jarmusch's mum, who watched it and, after wiping away a proud tear, said 'I'm not going to change a thing my darling, it's wonderful just as it is.'. Although this does suggest that good editing would have saved this. it wouldn't. It's unwatchable down to its bones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right, where to begin? I was recently driven away from watching the final 40 minutes of this film at The Showroom in Sheffield by a complete lack of any story/plot and some of worst dialogue I have heard in a very long time. As another (unfavourable) reviewer commented previously, the dialogue is that of a 1st year Arts student trying to sound cool and interesting in front of their teacher who they are obsessed with- when in reality it sounds like a car-crash in the form of words. Just to provide some context, this is only the 2nd film I have ever left the cinema before the end for- the 1st being Gus Van Sant's 'Paranoid Park', another totally uninspiring, pointless film. And I don't want to give the wrong impression, I actually LIKE slow films when done well *See 'Once Upon A Time In Anatolia' by Nuri Bilge Ceylan or 'Stalker' by Andre Torkovsky- masters of that particular art form, they make this film look like it has been made by Usain Bolt in comparison. But where Ceylan and Tarkovsky succeed in intriguing the viewer with meaning and engaging characters, this is pretentious drivel of the highest order.There are not enough words in my vocabulary to express my absolute fury &amp; disgust at what I was made to endure, and when I said "made", that is purely my own insistence on seeing things to the end, in case the film comes up trumps. In this case, I doubt that anything so fantastical could have happened in those last 40 minutes to make me change my mind about this film.The only positives you can take from this are that the music is good and the scenes of Detroit and Tangier are pleasing on the eye. The acting is OK but they are made to spout the most pointless claptrap that you start to question just how good these actors are, which is definitely not fair on them. After deliberating on whether to leave the cinema before we did for a whole 20 minutes, the final straw for me came when Eve said Adam, "have you got a bit of old carpet?". I would rather have spent my afternoon disposing of my old carpet down the skip.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Highly Literate Vampire Love Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ONLY LOVERS LEFT ALIVE pulls no punches with its audience; it expects us to take note of the literary references peppering the script, to figures old and new, making us away of the transhistoricity of the love-affair between Adam (Tom Hiddleston) and Eve (Tilda Swinton). In a world becoming increasingly disheveled and uninhabitable - the shots of a desolate Detroit are especially affecting - their love remains the only constant. However director Jim Jarmusch suggests that they need an outside transfusion of perfect blood to keep their affair going, something that can only be provided through a few sources, notably through Christopher Marlowe (John Hurt), who lives in a dark, dingy café in Tangier (another place deliberately chosen by director Jarmusch as the symbol of a place where trade and/or exchange has historically always occurred). When the blood runs out, so Adam and Eve have to resort to more direct methods of sustaining themselves. The ambiances evoked through this film are memorable; the zombie culture populated by Adam and Ava (Mia Wasikowska), the labyrinthine streets of Tangier, where sellers on every corner offer "something special" - which is not special enough for Adam and Eve. Within this ambiance the love-story is strangely haunting: we care for the two protagonists and their future, even though we are aware that their affair has continues for centuries. The film doesn't necessarily offer an optimistic conclusion, but at least it suggests that Adam and Eve will continue stay alive, at whatever cost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stagnant mind bent on stealing ideas...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reviews had suggested that this latest offering from Jim Jarmusch was worth seeing - a retro-chic hippy vampire flick which gets its energy from the sulphurous chemistry between Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddleston(Peter Bradshaw- The Guardian, 20th February, 2014)-Just when it's time to call a moratorium on vampire movies, Jim Jarmusch has to go and make a good one.As unlikely as it sounds in the era of "Twilight" and its imitators, Jarmusch's "Only Lovers Left Alive" proves there are still new sights and sounds and meanings to be derived from the conceit of characters who rarely sleep, never die and feast on the blood of others(Ann Hornaday ? Washington Post, 17th April, 2014)You can see how I got the impression that this was a decent film.The film begins with a record spinning on a record player. That is, a piece of fashionably retro vinyl revolving on a retro turntable and then hey, why not guess what camera shot Jim Jarmusch uses to introduce the two protagonists from this point?Go on.Remember, the first shot is of a record going around and around what crazy thing might you do??You got it! Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddleston are segued into the shot r o t a t i n g. I know, A-mazing, never saw that coming:I think it's reminiscent of a Kula Shaker video from the 90&#x2032;s. Or something by The Beatles, The Stones, The Charlatans, or any vaguely rock/psychedelia band from the last half a century. Except done badly. And interminably.Adam (Tom Hiddleston) is dressed like Jim Morrison (before he got tubby). He's topless, wearing rock-y, possibly leather trousers, lying on a giant chaise longue with a lute on his chest. A lute. There's lots of old amps and bits of chintz about the place.Tick- visual shorthand done.Eve (Tilda Swinton) is wearing a caftan/dressing gown and is passed out at the foot of a bed with a psychedelic throw on it. Got it? She's a bit of a hippy.Tick- again.So, characters established. That's all we need to know. And actually, come to think of it, in terms of narrative, characterization, character development, crisis, resolution. Plot. Any of that stuff, you might as well stop here because this film doesn't trouble itself with any of it. It is entirely superficial. Any meaning you might hope to extract from the film can only be derived from the look of the piece, which is a haphazard construction of clichés. Some of the reviewers are well aware of this, and have seen to find it laudable. Stylish. Clearly, I'm not a fan. But I have gone through the painful process of watching some of the film again so as to make a more reasoned case.First of all, characterization. Take, for example, the character of Adam. Essentially, Adam is presented to us as a tortured musician. He expresses his immortal existentialism through his art. We see him appraise a rare electric guitar in an early scene by looking horizontally up the fretboard. Tom Hiddleston then further reveals his hilarious lack of axeman-ship when he takes about thirty seconds in which to construct a chord (D minor) and strum. Later, he mooches about his bijou studio demonstrating a further range of skills he fails to convince us of by:- robotically tapping cymbals - experimenting with sound by hitting guitar strings with a drumstick. This farcical scene was one of my favourites and brought back fond memories of The Fast Show's Jazz Club.Tilda Swinton's character, Eve, is largely conveyed through her face. Her already enigmatic and expressive features have been over-intensified through matt-white make-up and massive black contact lenses, so that she seems like inanimate clay.Then the script.When John Hurt scuffles into a Moroccan cafe to meet Eve, she says,"So, how is the fabulous Christopher Marlowe tonight?"Clunk. Character name explained.Jim Jarmusch wrote the screenplay. I'd like to say it's sh**, because it is. But mostly, it's just incredibly mundane. Good actors (Tilda Swinton and John Hurt are good actors) are made to look clumsy and laboured because the words they have to deliver are hackneyed and were construed in a stagnant mind bent on stealing ideas.I'm not going to go into more detail because, frankly, it's not worth it. I'm writing this because I felt that I should redress the imbalance of criticism. Having started it, and having forced myself to re-watch sections of the film, I have to admit defeat. It's too painful.If you'd like to watch the film, I recommend watching it in digital format and skipping through at least x5 speed. You'll pretty much get the gist of it and, this way, you get to save that extra hour and forty five minutes for other things, like living, being creative, or even just sleeping. Almost anything you could find to do with your time, including staring blankly into nothingness, would be way more meaningful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a shallow statement on passing time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Jim Jarmush has never made conventional genre films ? after the unbreakable samurai code of 'Ghost Dog' or the spiritual western journey of 'Dead Man' it is no surprise that his 2013 vampire film is not really about vampires, but a certain melancholic nostalgia towards past times. However, 'Only Lovers Left Alive' is a shallow statement on passing time, and doesn't have anything new to say about modern society, nor vampires themselves. Adam and Eve (Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton) have been in love and married for centuries and haven't killed for blood for a long time, now surviving on blood-bank supplies, leading a long distance relationship ? while she's in Tangier, keeping contact with fellow vampire and Elizabethan era poet Christopher Marlowe (John Hurt) (who, according to the film, wrote most of Shakespeare's plays), he lives in on the outskirts of Detroit. Adam, having influenced numerous musicians and scientists throughout history has become burnt out and depressed ? hiding and making music in an apartment filled with memories of the past, he even considers committing suicide, resulting in Eve visiting him. He is disappointed in the human race, or the 'zombies', as the he calls them ? all they do is attack their own scientists, destroy once beautiful buildings, fight over oil. 'Only Lovers Left Alive' is more of an insight into a few days of its characters than a film with an actual plot. While the vampires live in present day, they deny modern life and apart from using iPhones and Youtube they manage to be isolated from society. They hardly encounter other vampires ? the only one with different values is Eve's younger sister Ava (Mia Wasikowska) who still lives the irresponsible, murderous lifestyle of older times. During a visit Ava kills Adam's 'zombie' helper and friend Ian, forcing the couple to fly (by plane, as most mythical vampire qualities are excluded) to Tangier, where they witness Marlowe, the old vampire's death due to blood poisoning. The film ends when, weakened by blood-withdrawal, they are forced to kill a human couple. Jarmush bases his story on the idea that our present is corrupted, longing more for the 1960s than for the centuries before, making the film seem more of a hippie swan song than the summary of the timeless pain of the immortal. The old character's death is predictable even in this transcendent level of existence, Ava's rebellion is not important enough to support the concept. While more recent vampire love stories like 'Let the Right One In' or 'Thirst' add to the romantic, tragic quality of being immortal, 'Only Lovers Left Alive' focuses on its main point, name-dropping historical and cultural references and occasionally explaining the plot by characters talking to themselves. While the two main actors offer great performances and some of the scenes (such as the hospital sequences) are a great mixture of Gothic and modern elements, it is safe to say that Jarmush was not able to fill the screenplay's plot holes and hardly touches on points regarding its concept that would require a lot more screen time.</fullReview>

The visit from Ava will destroy the relation or they are to experienced to know that the actions of a selfish girl can't change their feelings for each other?7.6 ??? Seriously? For what? The first 45 minutes of the movie are painful to watch because there is nothing happening, then after one hour or so the story begins to reveal. Also it's too long, boring and slow. Nothing really happens for the whole film. It had every bad things in it to convince me not to like it or not to vote the movie with a greater grade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I had to name 10 most boring movies this one would be my first! There is nothing happening in the movie even when little sister arrives. We all can appreciate the effort that goes in to making a movie and this is the only reason that I won't give the lowest score possible. Is it romantic; yes OK but nothing special. Is it dark; yes OK it is but it can be done much better. And that is the most annoying thing about this movie. Everything is in the middle it is not a good romance it is not a very dark movie and it sure as hell isn't a horror movie, the drama part I can give to you.Also I am reading other reviews stating that the characters are well rounded and easy to connect with? I really didn't feel any connection to any character they are all unclear because they have to be unclear they are bored from life. This is probably the point to the movie. Acting is probably the best part but with all the boredom you have to endure it really doesn't show as much What people see in this kind of movie I will never understand? Also I probably won't understand what Jim Jarmusch wonted to say with this film but it was probably nothing in his mind also or he was bored!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eternal Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the abandoned Detroit, the depressed musician Adam (Tom Hiddleston) lives in an old house in the middle of derelict buildings with his musical instruments and books. Adam has been a vampire for centuries but is tired with the fate of the world taken by wrong decisions of mankind. He has a confidentiality agreement with Ian (Anton Yelchin) that provides rare instruments to him and does not ask questions to him. Adam poses of Dr. Faust and buys blood bags from Dr. Watson (Jeffrey Wright) in nearby hospital. His wife and lover Eve (Tilda Swinton) lives in Tangier, Morocco's, and is also a vampire. Her best friend is "Kit" Marlowe (John Hurt) that supplies blood for her that he buys from a French doctor. When Eve calls Adam from Tangier, she feels that he is down and she decides to fly to Detroit to meet him. She meets Kit to say good-bye to him and Kit tells Eve that he had a dream with her younger sister Ava (Mia Wasikowska). Eve and Adam reunite and spend the nights making love. Out of the blue, the wild and reckless Ava comes to Adam's house and turns their lives upside-down. "Only Lovers Left Alive" is a stylish and original vampire movie with a story of eternal love and music. The plot has no clichés and is developed in slow pace, with charismatic characters, great performances and entertaining dialogs. I dare to say that "Only Lovers Left Alive" is in 2014 what "The Hunger" was in 1983. Fans of gore or conventional vampire movies will probably not like this feature. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Amantes Eternos" ("Eternl Lovers")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really disappointing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's pretty easy to fancy this film as cool and arty and whatnot, but let's resist the hype and our hunger for coolness for a sec, and see it as it is, shall we? It is so incredibly empty and banal that it's almost shocking. Simply NOTHING happens in this film in any level. Yes, actors are cool and beautiful, images, too, music, well, I leave that to your taste (I felt like cutting my wrists after a while). But the point is that all these can't do much more than create a feeling, an atmosphere. Could have been a wonderful music video, for example, conveying this particular feeling, but to make it into a 120 mins film without apparent story, message, dynamics, moral/intellectual/character progression, was just a mistake. SPOILERS.So, there's Adam, depressed and suicidal throughout the film, no change in mood and facial expression whatever. He composes music but not clear to whom or for what since he truly despises humans and prefers complete anonymity. He doesn't even show his music to his fellow vampire, Eva, because "it's personal". At the same time, it's clearly not enough to cheer him up or give a purpose for his life. His only happy moments are when he takes his actual drug portion (blood in this case, but it's irrelevant). He lives separately from wife whom he adores and longs for, but that doesn't stop him from buying a wooden bullet in order to kill himself.There's Eve, the wife, whose life is equally without direction or purpose, but at least it doesn't disturb her. She's happy with her books and the company of some fellow superior being and, of course, her actual portion of drug. Her relationship with Adam presented in a totally empty, unsophisticated way, no details, no depth, no answers about how desire could last so long, how their feelings changed during all those centuries. It's empty, colourless, something like a teenage fantasy about "perfect love", which, of course, we all know by age 20, doesn't exists.And there's Eva, her sister, who is quite irritating and silly, but at least is able to LIVE, inquire, jump in the water and stay open. Of course, she is very quickly kicked out of their life, as she brings danger and questions and unexpected things, and it's just not what those two want. God knows what they want - seemingly nothing.Quite frankly, it's like an attempt from Jarmusch to pour his pessimism and misanthropy onto the world. Like a massive cry about how lost he feels in this world ruled by senselessness and stupidity and destructiveness. And you could argue that this is the exact purpose of film-making and art in general: paint a picture, hold a mirror to whatever, but to me it's just not good enough to present an "everything is crap" message and leave things to that. It's irritating as a matter of fact. If this is all you can say, go to a therapist and discuss it. If this is what you feel and think that you can offer some kind of solution or answer to it, make a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atmospheric but dreadfully slow vampire update with virtually no plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of most vampire flicks since the subject has not only been done to death (no pun intended) but also because the idea of a human vampire is strictly a fictional construct and hence not a character that one can take very seriously at all. Director Jim Jarmusch has decided to debunk the genre by updating and treating it somewhat as a black comedy. His protagonist is "Adam," a depressed vampire hipster, who enjoys listening to his own dirge-like rock compositions and is proud of his collection of vintage guitars, supplied by his human gofer, Ian, who is part of the local rock scene. Adam asks Ian to obtain a wooden bullet, which he may or may not use to eventually kill himself.Soon enough, his wife Eve (they've been married for centuries), has just left 400 year old playwright Christopher Marlowe (also a vampire) in Tangier and comes to Detroit hoping that she can cheer Adam up. Over half the film features little conflict between Adam and Eve and aside from engaging in some rather dull conversation, they occasionally leave Adam's home and drive around in a mostly deserted and abandoned Detroit.Finally something happens past the midpoint; Eve's sister, Ava, pays a visit to the couple from Los Angeles. She ends up killing Ian by biting his neck and drinking his blood. Adam and Eve are appalled by her behavior (since modern vampires don't do that sort of thing) and kick her out of the house. They then dispose of Ian's body and head to Tangier after a bunch of Adam's fans appear outside the house.When they discover that Marlowe is dying from contaminated blood, they realize they have no choice but to whip their fangs out and kill an unsuspecting couple they meet on the streets. That's basically it? virtually no plot, with a narrative that proceeds at a snail's pace. Score some points for atmosphere, but Jarmusch's tale is as bankrupt as Adam's blood supply. In short, proceed at your own peril!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Style and No Substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie really gives us nothing new conceptually about Vampires. The idea that they are fundamentally decadent over-emotional punk rock quasi Goths has pretty much been done to death. This is more of that same vein (get it?). The idea that they live so long they become rich and expert in many topics and have encountered historical celebrities has been bloody done before. And the idea that they have adopted new technology to become less overtly evil and move invisible, you're not sticking your neck out with that concept.A reclusive wealthy musical genius Vampire hides in the abandoned ruins of Detroit. He is old. He has a 'wife' who lives across the world and I guess they spend a lot of time apart. He is bored with his not life.Threads of plot appear to develop. His world is dark and moody. His wife is dark and moody. He takes a radical step to consider suicide. That plot device fizzles out. His wife appears, and they share a premonition. Her sister shows up. Something obvious happens. Then something else obvious happens. Then that plot device sizzles out. Then they have to feed to live. The story ends.What have we learned? Drinking blood is kind of like shooting up Heroin, you catch a buzz and crash. So basically, we have Mr. and Mrs. Smack come to life. (That's a song from the 80's..a good song...check it out on YouTube...it has more substance than this movies).The acting is good in this movie. The casting is great. Mia Wasikowska maybe hams it up too much, but not that bad. Anton Yelchin does a great job. Hiddleston and Tilda are pros.Jarmusch layers on the style, captures the setting of decaying Detroit and uses it well. There is simply no plot to this movie, and ultimately that drives a wooden stake through it's heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expected Better! 4/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: Although the concept wasn't bad, I did find myself waiting for something to happen through the movie. I also found the pace to be quite slow and the music was pretty depressing. I know that it's a vampire movie and that it's not supposed to be upbeat, but after the couple got together, nothing really happened. The scenes when the sister arrived didn't last that long so the whole movie was totally based around these 2 characters that just seemed depressed all of the time, except for when they had that little dance. Basically I struggled to stay interested in the movie, which is a shame because both actors played there roles extremely well and they were convincing vampires. The love story was sweet and the fact that they had been in love for so many years was promising, but the film really didn't go anywhere. Disappointing!Round-Up: After Tom Hiddleston's role in Thor, he has really shot to fame. He does have a unique style which makes him shine on screen which is why he was an excellent choice for this role. The chemistry between Hiddleston and Swinton was believable and quite emotional but it was the storyline and the script that let the film down. Tilda Swinton also put in a great performance. Throughout the movie, she actually did look like a real vampire due to her sharp jaw bone and her small figure. She also has a very unique screen presence which has worked in movies like Narnia, Julia and Burn After Reading and she has proved that she can hold her own next to some big stars. Anyway, judging by the movie takings, I'm not alone by thinking that this movie could have done with some action or a major twist.&nbsp;Budget: $7million Worldwide Gross: $7.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there vampire movies about 2 long lived vampires, Adam &amp; &nbsp;Eve, who drink blood to survive and live for each other. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Detroit vampires</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Humor is an important part of Jim Jarmush's work, yet this notion won't help you while watching Only Lovers Left Alive. Personally, i see this film as a sign that vampire movies finally reached virtually every corner of movie making. Similar, and equally unsuccessful, attempt has been Kiss of the Damned (2012). Besides, the motif of vampires getting poisoned by blood they ingest has been used in some B and C movies more than two decades ago.What Only Lovers Left Alive does well is depicting characters we've all met at a certain point while nightclubbing. Present at every "important" event, they are dressed after latest fashion, without specific occupation, yet always with enough funds to visit exotic destinations and mingle with important people. In this movie they are vampires, which gave them the opportunity to pursue this lifestyle for centuries.All actors were the right choice for their roles. Actually i can't think of anyone more suitable for the lead role than Tilda Swinton. An interesting detail is using decrepit corners of Detroit as scenery, but this harrowing experience remains mostly uneventful.All in all, this is a movie for Jim Jarmush fans...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adam, the main character, is a perfect example: A centuries old whiny, pretentious, moronic junkie who understands nothing, unless it's related to machines. He doesn't move, doesn't interact, doesn't do, share, teach or learn anything, and yet he calls us zombies. Does he have no mirrors, or no reflection, or what ? He complains that Man has poisoned even his own blood... Well newsflash, moron: There's a good chance that was achieved on purpose, to get rid of you.Alas, my title seems to apply to Jim Jarmush as well. I enjoyed his early work, loved Mystery Train, loved Dead Man, loved parts of Night on Earth, and other pieces, but recent works have displayed the signs of senility. OLLA is not as bad as the one with de Bankole carrying is matchbox around, but it's pretty close.Vampire movies have been a bore for decades, only to be surpassed in not-agaaaain! factor by zombie movies this century. Yet, once a year or two, someone creates something good out of these old pots, so I cannot ignore the genre completely. Such a good thing OLLA is certainly not. It's 2 hours of vacuum.One thing that disappoints me most is the lack of cleverness at any level, because apparently there were thoughts put into the story. For instance, who still wears the same clothes they wore 30 years ago ? In OLLA, they do it for 300 at least. Because that's how Hollywood identifies old immortal characters: they haven't changed, they won't evolve. And of course they have befriended all the famous people of the time at some point.I went all the empty way to the end of OLLA carried by the magnificent Tilda Swinton, despite her irritating idiosyncrasies such as being incapable of naming a life form by its vernacular. I won't do it again.This is the kind of film from which you can extract an endless list of stupid details, about pseudo-science, aging, psychology, geography, addiction, air travel... well I'm too lazy to do the endless part. To make it worse, it's the kind of film where nothing interesting ever happens. Sorry, where nothing period happens, if you'd allow me to put the period there. And to top it all, the music is painfully awful. At least most of it, when it is related to the whiny, pretentious, moronic, centuries-old failed composer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautifully understated take on the saturated Vampire subgenre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the moment I heard that Jim Jarmusch was working on a vampire film I was intrigued and was desperate to see what the result would be. It did not disappoint for a second. Enchantingly atmospheric, it centres around Adam and Eve, two age-old vampires whose marriage has endured centuries of humanity's slap-dash efforts at building worthwhile civilisations.It strikes a very unusual tone for a film in this genre, although fans of Jarmusch will be used to a certain amount of genre-straddling and refusal to make easily pigeon-holed films. Don't come into this expecting a plot driven film, or especially not a CGI gore-fest akin to a lot of the lazily produced horror/fantasy material that seems so abundant at the moment. The focus is much more on creating an authentic feel and intriguing characters. Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton are virtually infallible in convincingly playing world-weary characters who have lived through plagues, inquisitions and the development of a flawed modern society. Mia Wasikowska's arrival as Eve's volatile sister Ava is foreseen with a palpable sense of foreboding, providing an uneasy counterpart to Adam and Eve's relative level-headedness, and steps up the stakes for the final act.John Hurt also deserves a mention for his typically assured and accomplished performance, albeit in a relatively small part.Overall, an extremely adept piece of filmmaking, which has revitalised a genre which I, for one, was about ready to call time on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After Ghost Dog, Jarmous career took the expected dive. What I mean is that from first class directors you would expect either to continue their march to the top, or to stop and give way to youngsters to carry on. Unfortunately the movie at hands is yet another example of the opposite. Jarmous is just exploiting his name and fame having chain himself on the directors chair not wanting to admit that he just can't deliver any more. It's more than normal to run out of ideas after having create masterpieces such as the 'Dead', the 'Mystery Train', or 'Down by law', but from an artist of the caliber of Jarmous I would expect the self awareness that would prevent him from exposing himself with garbage like 'Broken Flowers', or 'The Limits of Control', or these ridiculous lovers that had been left alive. Actors have to act,not to pretend. That is what we see in this film, a bunch of lost souls (and I'm not referring to vampires) who pretend to be bad actors and do not even succeed on that! Of course, with this scenario at hands, they couldn't do much more, but I blame the director for this too. I understand the studio and the producers pressure on anyone who can sell a couple of hours of cheap entertainment, but I feel very sorry seeing Jarmous falling in this pit. The movie is so bad that I can't describe flaws and weak parts, it's a piece of junk altogether. It's such pieces of junk that gave art cinema the bad reputation it carries.</fullReview>

Yes, you can enjoy Tilda Swinton (I don't know how she signed for this), if you're interested in instruments and rock may be you find something interesting in here, there are a couple of nice filming locations, but it doesn't make it for the poor storyline.

		<fullReview>If you want to find the definition of a pretentious art house film then Jim Jarmusch's latest film Only Lovers Left Alive supplies that demand, a film that is full of itself, as it digs deeper into literature, science and philosophy.Adam (Tom Hiddleston) is a reclusive vampire musician in Detroit who spends his time collecting guitars and other antiques and has fallen into a suicidal melancholia. His only contacts are a underground dealer, Ian (Anton Yelchin) and a haematologist, Dr. Watson (Jeffrey Wright). On the other side of the world his wife, Eve (Tilda Swinton) has been living a comfortable live in Tangiers with other vampires when she decides to reunite with her husband and reignite their relationship in Motown.Only Lovers Left Alive is a very self-absorbed film, indulging in the main character's depression and working as a form of wish-fulfilment for Jarmusch. As he throws in a vampire who is really Christopher Marlowe, played by John Hurt and there are literary references to Lord Bryon and Marlowe's Dr. Faust.Only Lovers Left Alive is an art-house film that only a certain audience will look for every bit of meaning from every single scene and frame. Jarmusch uses Hiddleston as his surrogate to criticise the downfall of art and culture, using the decaying city of Detroit as the backdrop and symbol to illustrate this, including showing Detroit's major theatre which had been turned into a parking lot.Jarmusch and his team do get a great cast for their film and Hiddleston and Swinton do work well together, having chemistry and showing themselves as the thespians that they are. But it was Mia Wasikowska as Eve's sister, Ava, who had the best role, injecting some energy in the proceedings. She added conflict to the relationship as Adam and Eve have differing opinions about her as Ava is a character who has much more younger, child-like personality and being unable to control her thirst. Wasikowska should have been introduced into the film earlier to give Only Lovers Left Alive more of a dramatic drive. Jeffrey Wright too was underused, only appearing for two scenes.Jamusch makes a very slowly paced, drawn out film, using long montages of driving and conversation about the relationships and past. With the bland, dark cinematography and plodding approach led to Only Lovers Left Alive to be a very boring and bland film that is over-hyped due to the director's reputation.Only Lovers Left Alive does have the occasional witty line, usually courtesy of Swinton and is out its most visually engaging when a dead body has to be deposed. But it is a movie that has little of a narrative, more focused on being arty and philosophical, then telling an interesting vampire story.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first Jarmusch film I've seen, so did not know what to expect. The reviews have been fantastic, but I was leaving the cinema very disappointed. Jarmusch seems to be very fond of long and contemplative shots. Very quickly I learned that the key was simply to sit back and let the film wash over me, because generally speaking it moves very slowly. Despite being in love with each other, married couple Adam and Eve are living in different countries. Why? Adam has fashioned a nest for himself in a dilapidated Victorian house in present-day Detroit. Eve lives in the ancient and exotic town of Tangier. I enjoyed more the interior design of their homes than the movie itself. The long scene with the pretty Lebanese singer at the end feels completely unnecessary.</fullReview>

The characters are unsympathetic, the plot hackneyed and boring, the pace glacial. It's a love story about two vampires who care about the environment and human rights, or something. Even the soundtrack is terrible.This film manages to cram in every clich? from every bad vampire movie ever made. Adam and Eve (no, really) spend their immortal centuries whining about the environment and "zombies" (ie, humans), name dropping all the famous people they've met throughout history, and hanging out in undiscovered hipster paradises Detroit and Tangiers while scoffing hospital blood (because, among other things, fresh human blood is too "contaminated"). Oh, and they wear sunglasses at night and wear gloves all the time, no doubt 'cause they're so, like, sensitive and stuff.The action, like the plot is almost non-existent - if you took out all the self-indulgent, lingering shots of their dilapidated houses and cities and uninteresting conversations that go nowhere you would have perhaps 20 minutes of footage, at the most. A warning: It manages to look like it might become interesting if you give it ten more minutes for most of the film, and there is an almost interesting bit in the middle - but it's not worth it. This is two hours of your life that you will never, ever get back. I don't care who he is, Jarmusch should be ashamed of himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Study on vampire immortality that, even if you are the sort of person who understands all the references, will strike one as pretentious name-dropping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ONLY LOVERS LEFT ALIVE is a 2014 vampire film by Jim Jarmusch depicting how four of these immortal undead deal with the modern world. Adam (Tom Hiddleston) is a musician who has written songs for centuries through one new style after another. He now lives in seclusion in Detroit with an enormous collection of guitars and studio equipment, but he has sunk into depression and is considering killing himself with a custom-made wooden bullet. His wife Eve (Tilda Swinton), who lives separately from him in Tangier, visits and tries to cheer him up, as she has retained a sense of wonder in the world around her. Their vampire kin in supporting roles are Eve's sister Eva (Mia Wasikowska) and the elderly Christopher Marlowe (John Hurt).While it is an indie film shot on a relatively small budget and with the slow pacing common of "arthouse" efforts, this feels like Jarmusch's most Hollywood film in the use of slow motion shots and the way music is employed. (The only other film of his I could compare it to in this respect is GHOST DOG). The plot is minimal, and serves mainly to present the ennui that Adam feels after being alive for centuries, the abandonment of Detroit, and the very different environment of Tangier. In its style, the film also draws on the rock biopic and Jarmusch's formative years in 1970s New York, as the vampire's need for blood is modeled on heroin addiction: they are often strung out, waiting for their next fix, and Marlowe deteriorates due to some "bad stuff".For me, this film was fatally marred by its godawful dialogue. Jarmusch chose to communicate how old these vampires are through constant silted references to celebrities from past centuries, for example, "Did you play chess with Byron?", "You gave that string quartet to Schubert", and repeated claims that Marlowe actually wrote all of Shakespeare's plays. Now, I have a solid grounding in the humanities and recognize all the references. As someone with an intellectual bent, I would enjoy a film that draws on the vast musical and literary canon of the West, but all this strikes me as pretentious name dropping and a really predictable, unimaginative way to write dialogue for these characters. Also, all the references to Tesla mean that Jarmusch is either exploiting the recent fad around him (he wouldn't be the first artist to cynically cash in on Tesla's name), or he himself has fallen for all the hyperbole.Plus, there are plot threads that are never resolved. (Who spread Adam's music? Who was the vinyl collector in the club? What's with the gloves?) Some of these are explained in the supplementary footage, but not all, and besides, if Jarmusch couldn't tell a coherent story within the 2-hour running time of the final version, that testifies to sloppiness.The acting is strong, and watching Swinton and Hiddleston one recognizes a true gift, but it cannot make up for the poor script and editing. This strikes me as a serious misstep, and I say that as a Jarmusch fan who found his previous film, the critically panned THE LIMITS OF CONTROL, to be worthwhile. I can't recommend this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enervated View with a Vampire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wasn't planning on watching this, but so many films had it on the preview reel, that pushed me over the limit. As others have said, this doesn't add much to the vampire genre, indeed as compared to other films there doesn't seem to be much at risk.No one's being hunted or haunted, well aside from having a problem when an in-law comes to town that injects a little life into the film. There are luxurious scenes of blood as absinthe, orgy-in-a-glass drinking shots. There's some ham-fisted citing of the world's greatest artists (even a fake Shakespeare citing, which had gone into hiding for a while). And there's homage to vampire lore, notably the requisite of an invitation in.I guess this is a mediation on how love is all that there is to the world, but as John Hurt's Marlowe points out, why do they (Adam and Eve...ugh...) live apart? Well, great artists are important as well, but perhaps only as their art captured their passion.Overall the film felt less passion infused, and more a slow, distracted foreplay for an MTV debut of a single from the talented Yasmine Hamdam.That's a little unfair, but I walked away contemplating whether I'm a bit overmusch in my Jarmusch intoxication. Perhaps trace elements of the vampire ennui infected me? Certainly a film for fans of costume and props and to a degree locations. Warren Zevon, RIP, would have really loved to have met the tailors of these Nosferatu two.Please see "Ghost Dog" and at least listen to "Dead Man" first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a few years off the radar Jim Jarmusch, director of strange offbeat movies that are really hard to swallow after just one viewing, is back and this time it's with his dour vampire love story Only Lovers Left Alive. Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton play vampire lovers Adam and Eve, respectively. An obtuse reference for sure, but according to Jarmusch was a reference to Mark Twain's satirical work The Diaries of Adam and Eve, rather than the Bible. I don't know. Anyways, Adam is a reclusive underground rocker and Eve is a spirited world traveler. Adam also happens to be the creator of every famous piece of literature and music ever created. The two meet up in Detroit to enjoy each other's company and complain about how awful and unappreciative the world is, bitching about the pathetic and uninspired human population or "zombies" as they're referred to. Characters come in and out as the two lovers mope around Detroit by night, occasionally picking up healthy O-Negative blood from the hospital, and sleep during the day, effectively going nowhere, just like this movie.I could try to write out a more elaborate synopsis of this film's plot, but honestly there isn't much more to say. Only Lovers Left Alive is a film that goes nowhere because it doesn't want to. It's a slow and somber character piece carried by fine actors who are doing everything they can with what little substance they are given. Hiddleston and Swinton own their roles as these two melancholy vampires who seem to have nothing better to do than talk about how much better they are than the zombies. To put it lightly, Only Lovers Left Alive would have been a steaming pile of horse dung if not for these two strong leads.The movie starts out really strong. Like, really strong. The spinning overhead shots of Hiddleston and Swinton in their respective homes opens the film with captivating intrigue. I was immediately into the film when it got started. Getting to know these two characters is really fun at first because you see all of the potential of where they might go. Hiddleston is the complete embodiment of everything that is cool and hip. His suave melancholia should be obnoxious but Hiddleston nails it. Then, of course, Swinton is in peak form as always, playing the perfect yin to Hiddleston's yang.After the first twenty or so minutes I was ready to fall completely in love with Only Lovers Left Alive. I found the characters to be brilliant, the brooding industrial rock score drew me in, and there were some great sequences that made the first act of this film so unique and so compelling. The scene where the vampire characters, Hiddleston, Swinton, and also John Hurt in a great supporting role, indulge in a refreshing shot of human blood which sends them into heroin like ecstasy gave me goosebumps and prepared me for what I expected to be a great rest of the film.Unfortunately, the film keeps moving along, never straying from its slow glacial pace, and it never feels like we're getting anywhere. If we do get somewhere the result is so subtle and so minuscule that it might as well not even be there. I tried and tried to stay engaged by this movie but a little ways after the hour mark I had to admit that I was beginning to get bored with this film. The novelty of these cooler than cool characters wears off eventually, and by that point I was really ready for some actual storyline and substance. We get little tastes of it here and there, like when Mia Wasikowska comes in as Eve's troublemaking younger sister. This, however, is a consequence that evaporates almost as soon as it arrives. Then, by the end of the film we are left with pretty much nothing except for head scratching and shoulder shrugs.Now, having seen other Jarmusch films I don't doubt that this is the film he wanted to make. I'm not sure why he's turned to making such empty films, but perhaps they mean something more to this fascinating man. At any rate, Only Lovers Left Alive has a lot of good things going for it, but it doesn't deliver. Most of the time you're waiting for something exciting to finally happen and just when you think it will, it doesn't. It's not a bad movie, but you don't come away feeling much more than you did when you went in.</fullReview>

BOR-ing!And why is it that characters who've lived a very long time ALWAYS seem to have only known famous people in the past? Of course their best friend is Christopher Marlow! Right. Do you know any famous people? If you continued to live for a few hundred more years do you think you'd necessarily meet nothing but future famous people?

		<fullReview>Okay, I hate to be the one to knowingly disagree with the majority, but I didn't like this film. If you check out the other reviews of 'Only Lovers Left Alive' then you'll see it's getting some pretty high scores. Sadly, it just didn't do anything for me. Not that I'm saying it's all bad.It's about two immortal lovers (Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton) who are basically vampires (although the 'V-word' is conspicuously absent from all dialogue) who find each other after many years apart. And they sit around and chat.That's about it. They chat. Not much else really happens.Hence my comment about it being very slow. It's a talking film where two eternal souls debate about the pros and cons of living forever etc.If you're in the mood for something with no car chases or explosions then give it a go. Naturally, with two great leads like Hiddleston and Swinton you're going to get some interesting and layered performances. So, any fans of the pair of them will definitely get more out of it than most.It wasn't a bad film, just slow. I don't know what I was expecting, but I was hoping there would be something else to it than the deep, art-house kind of feel to the film-making. I'd have probably appreciated it a little more if there was less music. Yes, Hiddleston is a musician, but there's a lot of him playing and people dancing. Too much in my opinion.So, fans of the leads and generally those who are tired by watching buildings falling down should give it a go. Maybe when I'm more in the mood for something a little deeper I'll give it another go and appreciate it a little more than I did on my initial viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I did have some expectations for this movie. Well-known actors such as the oh-so handsome Tom Hiddleston, decent sounding plot, decent ratings and did I mention Tom Hiddleston? Although I was a little put off by the whole vampire side of thing, I was still more than looking forward to watching it but as I crossed the 1 hour mark I was thinking to myself "surely something has to happen soon, right?", but I couldn't have been more wrong. It felt like I was just watching them go about their daily lives. Nothing exciting happened, it was slow, and the only character worth watching was was Ian but then again, even his character wasn't necessary. I really wanted to like it but I just couldn't get into it...at all! Definitely not worth the 2 hours. But then again, everyone's different so don't let my review put you off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess this film attempted to show vampires in a different light; as reclusive intelligent intellectuals bored with life yet filled with knowledge.However, the script was awful and it came across as pompous and boring. For example, the main character orders a wooden bullet (in an attempt to show how tortured the character was, though we don't know why) and he says the names of the trees the wood is to be made from in Latin, quickly. If he was intelligent, he would know he could just state an easy to get hard wood, in English, and enable the man to write it down.The film seems to be written for Goths who would like a very slow painful story with no real direction or substance. It's like watching a film about two unhappy people (not even the excitement of real depression) just lazing around on a sofa.There are no redeeming features to this film; and yes, I love arty films and films without action. If you want a vampire film for intellectuals watch "Let the right one in" which is genius. Only lovers left alive would have been a poor school project. Pompous, shallow and dull with no real story. I watched 3/4 of the film and flicked through the rest on fast forward as I felt I had wasted my time. If you like action films with vampires don't watch this. If you like intellectual films with vampires, don't watch this. If you like films without vampires, don't watch this... get my point?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie of mood and metaphor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a beautiful and artistic movie on many counts: mesmerising soundtrack, atmospheric sets and settings, dreamy camera-work and scene-play, methodically under-stated acting, and slow but sure character development. We get to know the four vampires, especially Adam (played brilliantly by Tom Hiddleston) and Eve (played by the versatile Tilda Swinton), from a series of contrasts and paradoxes as their motives, moods and lives change. They seem both ancient and modern,languorous yet focused, familiar but alien. As the slim story-line and minimal back-story unfold, the movie focuses on triggering our empathy for creatures who have survived for several centuries, facing many challenges, the most constant of which is the threat of boredom and existential alienation. Apart from blood - as food and drug - their main motives for survival are human knowledge and culture: art, science, literature, music. Living on 'back-door' blood samples from hospitals, these 21st century vampires now avoid feeding on humans because of the growing chances of detection by modern police agencies.Things had been going fairly smoothly for Adam, a retired rock star hiding away in an old house in Detroit, until his old 'lover' Eve returns from Tangiers, soon followed by her troublesome 'sister' Ava from LA. Ava brings heat to the door, and Adam's quiet life changes. But, as noted, the story is not the main thrust of this movie, nor is vampire mythology (it's not a standard horror flick). My feeling was that the director (Jim Jarmusch) wanted to take a fresh approach to the old narrative theme of empathizing with the experience of being immortal, as well as exploring the metaphor of living with a serious drug habit. He does well on both counts. A classy, moody movie, which you should definitely watch before making any decisions about becoming a vampire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this delightful review, you will read about the film "Only Lovers Left Alive". You will be given examples, analogies, anecdotes, symbolism, metaphor, and even a Haiku poem I composed which this lovely film inspired. May you enjoy reading it, as much as I enjoyed writing it. But hopefully without the diarrhea I experienced during the final stages of this review, due to the Middle Eastern dish I had, which was actually a combination of Middle Eastern, Mexican, and Swedish. Don't mix your food genre's. Your bowels won't appreciate it.Let's begin, shall we?I had high(ish) hopes. Some of the review titles here on IMDb were:"Artistic, Romantic Escapism""Fascinatingly beautiful""A magnificent piece of cinema and symbolism""Hip, smart and funny""Wow. Sexy, intelligent and powerful.""I swooned!" (from a guy, no less!)"Stylish Masterpiece""A Highly Literate Vampire Love Story"And my favorite:"bleeds new life in the vampire genre with an eye on modern decadence"WOW! (Right?)I mean cmon, Jim Jarmusch wouldn't attempt the tired and silly genre of a vampire film lightly, right? Plus, Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddleston are certainly not what you'd call mediocre actors, right? Jim is certainly going to spin and twist this story in way which no one has ever seen before, right?WRONG!There's a new contender for the worst film I have ever seen.I mean, it had lots going for it. It was the perfect time for a vampire film which loudly screams: "Screw you, Twilight! This is how the big boys do it". Or even: "This ain't your fat soccer-mom neighbor's Vampire film!"I expected this to be very decent, or perhaps even great. And why wouldn't you?But, not only isn't it great, it's perhaps one of the top 50 worst films I have seen. Especially when you factor in who directed and wrote it, and the talent he was working with. Sure, there are worse films out there, but not at this level. There are literally super-low-budget vampire films I've seen which look like works of bleeding art compared to this arse-gravy. Like Kiss of the Damned, by the way. I didn't think Kiss of the Damned was very good at all. But after this dreadful Jarmusch film, I must re-think that opinion. It had WAY more going for it in terms of story/complication/resolution. It had a much more difficult story to tell too, with a much larger cast, and more to keep in line.Jim, you suck, your new movie sucks, and even your mom sucks. I am going to call her, then I am going to impress her, seduce her, make her fall in love with me, marry her, and then break her heart by allowing her to catch me in bed with the pool boy, and I'm not even gay...just to punish Jim for this offensive film. I might even contract a "social disease" first. And I'll certainly be keeping the pets after the divorce. Bad things come in 3's.I don't know what the very high 7.6 IMDb rating tells us. Does it mean that people are just that simple? Or, does it mean that semi-clueless dullards are so completely sick and tired of typical watered-down and mass-appeal films in this genre that any new film which slightly detoured from the current norm was bound to be applauded? Who knows?Nothing even remotely interesting happens in this foul film. No action. No intrigue. No memorable drama. No excitement. No good/bad attempt at any weird or uncommon stylization of any kind. It might as well have been titled: "Several days in the lives of modern vampires in which nothing really extraordinary happens, shot in a rather boring way".Remember when we ridiculed films like Twilight, and wished someone would come along and make a vampire film without filling it chock full of over-fed-mom and unattractive-yet-hopelessly-romantic teen appeal?Well, now you got it! Be careful what you wish for.And like many of the other reviews said, the dialog is horrible. If it doesn't make you cringe, then clearly you are not someone who can be made to cringe, and you might presumably enjoy pretty much anything you see or hear. You are one of the lucky ones, actually. I envy you. Greatly. The benefits of being a partial (or even full-blown) mouth-breather are numerous. It's like a very effective flavor-enhancer of the most efficient sort. Everything is just so delicious!Anyway, read some of the other reviews. They go into great detail about the brutally insulting dialog, the comically childish (and predictable) "name-dropping vampires" shtick which will have you both rolling your eyes and looking at your watch, and the overall vile stink this film has all over it which won't wash off in a bath of the strongest tomato juice.Reading those same review titles after watching this film, makes me assume some of them went full-retard. And you all know the rule on that matter.In conclusion, see this film! You'll appreciate other films significantly more.(I'm even going to take his mom's last name, and then keep it after the divorce!)And now, a poem, in honor of this great film:Jim's new film, LoversDistressed audience angeredViewers grimacing---------------------P.S. A new review was just posted, and the title made my bowels hurt. I simply had to add it:"A great film that offers artsy scenes and a stable relaxed mood"LOLOLOL?!A short-bus rider, perhaps?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am all vampired out. Hate to admit it, but it's true. And I have been all vampired out for quite some time. The fascination with the fanged undead started to peter out in the 90's after From Dusk Till Dawn and Interview with a Vampire. Since then, we have been vampired to death at the theatre and on television with countless vampire movies/series just in the past 20 years. Vampires that sparkle (Twilight), vampires in comedies (Dark Shadows), television vampires (True Blood), vampires fighting Presidents (Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter and even animated vampires (Hotel Transylvania). The only thing vampires have stuck their teeth into more in my lifetime is my wallet which pays to watch these mythical beings suck their way to the end credits.Because of the over-saturation of titles, I have grown increasingly numb to the whole mythology. Worse still, there hasn't been more than a handful of vampire films that have offered its audience anything new or radically different to the folkloric tale. In recent years, more established directors have tried plied their trade to the genre including Neil Jordan (Byzantium) and Amy Heckerling (Vamp) have attempted to put a unique spin on the tale only to leave audiences rather uninterested in the quest.Now comes a new vampire film from writer/director Jim Jarmusch (who looks like a vampire himself) who is known for art/independent films such as Coffee &amp; Cigarettes and Ghost Dog. Only Lovers Left Alive revolves around vampires Adam and Even (Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton). Adam is a vampire residing in Detroit and is in a depression bordering on suicidal tendencies. Adam's love, Eve, is a vampire living in India who flies to Detroit when Adam's melancholy becomes apparent. When Eve arrive in Michigan she finds Adam in familiar surroundings. Adam has found a home in the abandoned outskirts of the city where he spends his nights recording music played on instruments provided to him by human friend Ian (Anton Yelchin). When Adam and Eve are reunited it is a muted reunion. There are no mass killing sprees (they get their blood supply from a doctor played by the always veritable Jeffrey Wright), no wonderous sex or conflicts or any kind. Instead audiences are treated to tours of a ruined city and monotone conversations between the two undeads.The film meanders along until the wonderfully vibrant Ana (Mia Wasikowska) appears. Introduced earlier as a sister to Eve, Ava is a young, reckless vampire that yearns for the drug-like euphoria of human blood and the adrenaline of a city's nightlife. Her appearance in Detroit infuses the film with much needed air and turns the story from being a full-out bore love story to an interesting family dynamic with a loose cannon (a deadly one at that) on the couch.Sadly, Ana's induction does not last long enough nor does it elevate this flat lined movie into anything more than just an interesting character study. Vampire movies with a body count less than the number of noses I have on my face are far less interesting than a rollicking Blade or Underworld. Jarmusch's script is apt and there is some good dialogue between the two goth-looking leads (both of which perform admirably), but there wasn't enough meat on the bread to make a lunch sandwich.Only Masikowska's performance elevates Only Lovers Left Alive into a 2.5 out of 5 rating. And although I am glad that the vampires in this tale did not sparkle, I am disappointed that they didn't really do much of anything.www.killerreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not a masterpiece but interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is slow, ambiental, and the moral of it is missed by other comments, at least so far, so this is my take on it, before someone else does it better - my first review. I must agree with some of the other comments about the unmotivated name-dropping throughout the movie (listing historical figures main characters interacted with, inspired, or have been inspired by). That could have been done more casual, since Jim Jamrusch audience doesn't need to be baby fed. I didn't have a problem with the fact that the movie develops slowly, perhaps it suited me fine on a rainy Sunday evening I went to see it. Anyhow the cast for this is great, I expected nothing less from Tilda in this role, however Tom Hiddlestom, whom I see for the first time was also great, but I could not decide if the fact he reminds me to Adrien Brody in this role is good or not. Picking Detroit for the shooting site of better part of the film is also a great idea. As for the chemistry between the two lovers, I didn't really buy into it, even though it wasn't completely unconvincing, maybe that's just me, or maybe that wasn't the main idea despite the title. And finally the end of the movie brings a change in pace, where we see that once they run out of blood supply all the morality, tranquility, and intellect are stripped off the main characters (much like the human behavior they criticize more than once), and they become what they are hungry vampires (humans).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a story how sid &amp; nancy wanted to be vampires? or is it the other way round, every male vampire wants to be a rock star - and every female one longs to be an eternal groupie? At least Jim Jarmusch knew what he wanted: money for a film with two contemporary cool film stars, Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddleston. The magic word for film industry is still "vampire", so Jarmuch wrote a story where there are two lovers who "just happen to be vampires" (as Jarmusch has told in interviews).Except that there's isn't really any story, any plot, any romance - and definitely no vampires. The characters of Swinton &amp; Hiddleston are based on rock mythology rather than on vampire mythos. They do drink blood, but it's only a cheap metaphor and easy excuse to show drug-addiction with romantic allusions to the history of artistic use of opium. Only cool thing with this film is the title: ONLY LOVERS LEFT ALIVE.Most of the time S &amp; H just recline lazily in different positions and occasionally talk about the beauty of instruments. They are multilingual, multitalented artists themselves, but there is nothing in their discourse to prove how wise or gifted they are. The references to the mutual history of vampire life are so stupid that the script sounds like it's written by a 12-year-old who thinks he (= JJ) has invented the concept of vamp film.The stills of this movie may give an impression of a serious vampire movie. Camera-work is beautiful indeed, and T &amp; S try to be seriously anaemic in their characters. But when the little sister vamp (Mia Wasikowska) jumps into story and acts like little sisters do, you finally realise how playfully boring this film about eternal boredom really is.Yes, such a waste of time and talents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Melancholy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even before Bram Stoker's seminal novel Dracula was published, the vampire was becoming a staple of the horror genre. Stoker's novel solidified that, even more so in the various stage and of course film versions of it that have followed over nearly 120 years. Yet there have also been some fascinating explorations of the notion of vampires outside of the horror genre. One of the most interesting of recent years is Only Lovers Left Alive from writer/director Jim Jarmusch and it is anything but your typical vampire flick.Part of what makes that point clear is the casting. Tom Hiddleston, perhaps best known as Loki is the ever expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe, and Tilda Swinton are the lovers of the title named Adam and Eve. Neither of them fit the typical description of the vampire with Dracula on one side and the bad boy Edward Cullen on the other. Adam and Eve are quiet, cultured and intelligent who don't spend their nights on the proverbial prowl or stalking teenage girls. Adam has become withdrawn, melancholic and potentially suicidal, sitting in a large and falling apart Victorian house in Detroit composing music with outmoded technology and vintage instruments that no one will ever hear. Eve meanwhile seems much happier living halfway across the world in Tangiers but whom travels to Detroit to be with her lover. Hiddleston brilliantly portrays the melancholic and withdrawn nature of Adam while Swinton seems ever alive and vibrant as Eve. The two of them make a mesmerizing couple both apart and together, becoming the heart of the film in the process.While Hiddleston and Swinton are the heart of the film, they are surrounded by a sparse but effective supporting cast. The supporting cast includes John Hurt as Marlowe, another aged vampire whose identity will be a delight to more knowledgeable viewers of the film, and Hurt is a delight to watch in his few scenes. On the opposite end of the spectrum from Adam, Eve and Marlowe is Ava played by Mia Wasikowska who plays her exactly like what she is: a spoiled teenager eager for the next high and whose recklessness is both frequent and destructive. Rounding off the supporting cast in human roles are Anton Yelchin as younger rock and roller Ian, Jeffrey Wright as Doctor Watson and Slimane Dazi as Tangiers café owner Bilal.It's in the production values that some of the film's best elements can be found. The cinematography of Yorick Le Saux is outstanding and a visual feast from the shots that open the film to how it brings to life Jarmusch's characteristic sequences of cities at night. The combination of cinematography and direction bring to life and contrast the largely abandoned post- industrial landscape of Detroit and Tangiers which seems to have one foot in the past and the other in the present. The cinematography also plays up the differences between the two with warm colors pervading through the scenes set in Tangiers while there's a cold and lifeless quality to the scenes in Detroit. Then there's the score which is an unlikely combination of styles and works including rock band SQÜRL, lute composer Jozef van Wissem and Lebanese vocalist Yasmine Hamdan. Yet the score brings to musical life the melancholy that lies in the film's soul. Put together, the combination of production values bring the world surrounding the performances to life in a most excellent fashion. Yet there would be nothing if not for the script from Jarmusch and Marion Bessay. To say that they wrote a vampire film is a disservice both to them and to the film itself. It merely uses the basics of the vampire myth as a basis to work from and the results will likely not be for everyone, especially those expecting either a horror film or a variation on Twilight. Instead the love story here is more mature, more subtle and is instead reflective of a couple who have been together so long and with one of them experiencing something of a mid-life crisis. Yet the film portrays vampires as being akin to that of a drug addict and for all the culture and sophistication that Adam and especially Eve have, they are still driven by baser instincts that could ultimately destroy them. In the end, the script inverts much of the clichés of the vampire film and uses the genre instead to present a meditation on the fine line between our base instincts and what we consider culture. Only Lovers Left Alive has much to recommend it for. From fantastic performances to beautiful cinematography and an atmosphere of melancholy that pervades throughout, it is a work that those who enjoy film will find both thought provoking and gorgeous to behold. Yet I suspect it's something that anyone who is at all creatively bent will recognize something in for rarely has melancholy been so beautifully and so well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melancholic and yet loving beauty and art and life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only Lovers Left Alive has a vibe that is laid back and moody: melancholic and yet loving beauty and art and life; the love and melancholy seem to feed off each other. Whether or not you can feel such a vibe or can enjoy style simply as the outflow of artistic feeling (like with Godard films) will determine whether you can like this movie. The film is not so much driven by plot; it is like music that is more about mood than melody; it is more about what keeps vampires going in their esoteric dystopia where the blood of life is stagnant and contaminated. Personally, I enjoyed it quite a bit, as I have most Jarmusch films. They have an authenticity and sincerity to them, and one gets a feeling of love for music and creation. Various aspects are easy to critique, but I do not see the point. In the film world, execution and polish (if it is right to call CG that) are common, while spirit is rare, and so I rate this one right up.</fullReview>

It sounds more interesting than it is. There's a few things that happen but it doesn't really come to any kind of real climax or anything.

		<fullReview>This is the worst vampire movie I have ever seen. The screen writing was abysmal. Any sense of plot and story layering is thin, and what should really be the inciting incident doesn't come until 2/3rds through the movie. This felt like a short film that someone tried to drag out into a full-length movie, disastrously so. Watching this was excruciating. I don't understand the hype, unless what people are excited about is just the actors in their roles, which was well-done. However, so many of the visual elements others are praising were put in for no reason and felt "precious." Based on the sophomoric writing alone, don't waste your time with this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vampires again? Please tell me no. Zombies, werewolves and vampires ? how can they keep making the same old movies over and over and over again? That's exactly what I thought when I read up on this. So, why did I watch it? Why bother ? Tilda Swinton is why. She's such a captivating presence on screen that I figured I'd just check it out for a few minutes. Much to my surprise, there were some elements that made this movie interesting ? but just not enough of them to keep me hooked.The good: The Supra, the Hagstrom and the Silvertone. Quirky references for sure and for me, this was the best scene in the movie. I would think that for most people though, the sight of these guitars means little to nothing which only makes it more surprising to see them take center stage for a few moments. Then there's the "just the adagio" comment also very nice and then Shakespeare , Byron . . . very, very cool, subtle and unexpected. I wish the movie had much more of that odd-ball way of presenting things because without them, there was little else to hold my interest. I know all the name dropping and literary references can seem a bit pretentious but I thought of it as a bit of a trivial pursuit game mixed into the plot. I enjoyed it. The bad : Burnt-out, weary immortals drudging through their never ending day to day routines. Their lack of passion, regardless of why, is basically a bore. If the central characters are just doing a "walk through" then how can the viewer get excited about them in any way? Actors playing "bored people" really well, come across as "bored people" ? if I want to see boring people I can walk over to the mirror. The wild little sister appears ? sure she's cute but still ? such a spunky little vampire, but her character didn't do much but annoy me. Good acting, visually appealing performers but I didn't like any of the characters and as a result, it didn't care what happened with any of them. The locations and sets were interesting but extremely bleak, dark and depressing ? there was no joy to be found. Yes, it's a vampire movie so why should I be surprised? Well, I shouldn't be, but I would have enjoyed seeing "the lovers" speeding up the Pacific Coast Highway at midnight in a top-down Porsche, blasting Nessun Dorma (and they can discuss how Jeff Beck does such a nice version), pulling off the road to stare at the ocean before disappearing into the tree tunnels outside of Half Moon Bay. In the end we have bored vampires living out the centuries with zero Joie de Vivre. A few good moments but not enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's depressing how little I connect to Jim Jarmusch movies outside of Dead Man. The latter is in my top 10 of all-time, but he hasn't made a film I like since. Only Lovers Left Alive is receiving inexplicable acclaim, though I'm curious how it would fare under a different director's moniker. The concept has potential, the idea of eternal beings having such an admiration and immersion in culture, but it doesn't make it work, these things just feel too trivial when the characters are centuries years old. I don't buy that they would have such fascination in visiting Jack White's house. It feels like Jarmusch is just writing what he knows. The film is just too stilted and flat in tone, suffering under the way it's been shot. There's enough neutrality in the film to not descend into mediocrity, it's just a missed opportunity.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I made it through the whole movie (with only a few short fast- forwards) but it just left me feeling like there was literally no plot whatsoever. Just this eternal couple hanging out together, ruminating about music and plants and the pitiful state of modern society. Hey, i can get get behind a slow understated love story, (Linklater's "Before" trilogy is a personal favorite of mine but in those films the dialogue was sparkling, the chemistry was palpable, the scenery was gorgeous, and although the films had no real plot there is clear progression in the relationship and in their lives) but this film is like a slow meandering haze of boredom. With only sporadic conversations to keep the audience awake and we see no character progression. Which I suppose is fitting considering the age of these vampires and how set in their ways they would become over time- its just not something that makes for entertaining or thought provoking viewing. 6/10 stars just for the moody vibe and the always watchable Hiddleston &amp; Swinton who's talents were wasted here. I cant help but think they must've been as bored making the film as I was watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's really nothing new anyone can say about vampires, not even Jim Jarmusch, but this is still a fairly entertaining movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has been heralded as a return to form for Jarmusch but, frankly, I liked his last two films a lot better. The big problem here is that there is absolutely nothing left to say about Vampires. Jarmusch just uses the genre to create a gorgeous mood piece, but it's hard to deny the fact that we've seen it all before. Really, the plot here is almost identical to Xan Cassavetes' 2012 film Kiss of the Damned. Much like that film, Only Lovers Left Alive tries to spice of the genre with artiness, and it succeeds (as did Kiss of the Damned) up to a point. Really, Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddleston are so engaging the film comes off pretty good. Swinton's awesome hairdo alone makes the film worth watching. I am a little perturbed that Jarmusch glamorizes heroin chic in this film - the vampires are very rock-star like and, when they drink blood, it's depicted very much like heroin use. And it's depicted quite romantically. Tom Hiddleston's music even sounds like The Velvet Underground (I found it hilarious when characters tell him how brilliant his work is). The film co-stars John Hurt, Anton Yelchin, Mia Wasikowska and Jeffrey Wright. Wright's scenes with Hiddleston are by far the highlight of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoy the Psychedelic Ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The underlying premise of any vampire movie is "what if your friendly nice neighbor is a scary vampire?" Jim Jarmusch reverses the question and wonders "what if the scary vampire is actually a friendly nice neighbor?" With regard to Gothic aesthetics and narration, Only Lovers Left Alive (2013) pumps new blood into the vampire genre (pun intended) and explores the soft and vulnerable ? almost mundane ? side of the bloodthirsty creatures.Thanks to the out-of-this-world, dreamy ambiance Jarmusch intricately creates, watching the film feels like being under drug effect; you are enjoying the mesmerizing images and music while contemplating the main characters' unfolding relations and existential ordeals. The mix of Western and Oriental music to a great effect shadows the compelling mise-en-scene designed to bring oddities and opposite elements together in visually harmonious frames. Take a look at the color palette and the construction of the film's frames, each is deserving of making its way to your Tumblr wall as such. The one in which Adam lies naked in bed with Eve strikes me as extremely symmetrical; the two bodies (female and male) are facing each other, not as a mirror's reflection, but as two complementary opposites ? a dovetail. The hair colors are white and black ? two ends of a spectrum ? but together they form the color scheme of the whole image including the lovers' slumbering bodies. Not to mention the intermingling of actors' arms and legs that evokes the image of a tree.As a literature student, I love all the literary allusions the film is abundant with. Even Adam and Eve's (Hiddleston and Swinton) relationship feels like it came straight out of one of the imaginary worlds created by Poe or Byron. One cannot also ignore the sly Christopher Marlowe twist.Tom Hiddleston is good but the one who really stands out in all her exquisite beauty, grace and talent is Tilda Swinton as the ultimate motherly female figure/vampire. Swinton was perfect for the unconventional role that somehow subverts the male/female dynamics in any vampire tale. The myth goes that Count Dracula was the father of all vampires and, thus, in most vampire movies (save for a few exceptions, Queen of the Damned is one) prominence and power are given to male vampires. In Only Lovers Left Alive, Eve not only represents a loving wife, but also an all-wise, all-knowing matriarch that bestows her all-encompassing affection on everyone around her including her husband who exhibits an unmistakable immature demeanor. That is definitely an interesting twist to the story of creation.. don't you think?The film does not require you to dig deeper than that. Just lie back and enjoy the psychedelic ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I understand that Jim Jarmusch focuses more on characters than plot, but the characters in this one leave a lot to be desired. The music, costumes, scenery and the photography are really nice, but the story is lacking. Jim Jarmusch doesn't often have good stories, so you're left with funny dialogues and interesting characters which I usually love, but in this one the dialogues were dry and the characters were predictable. The acting is not bad, but with little of interest to talk about and no story there's nothing really to act about. (slight spoiler alert) And it wouldn't stand up to the Bechdel test at all. The main woman character has little personality and no story beyond the fact that she's a vampire and she's married to and friends with the other two male characters respectively. They are creative geniuses themselves, but she simply complements them. Her only task in the movie is to acquire blood, or travel to her depressed musician husband. Her sister's main role in the story is an annoyance to her husband. In other words, the women are simply accessories in this film. If anything the movie is worth it for the wonderful soundtrack and the scenery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A vampire living in Detroit. A vampire living in Tangier. Because of the depression and hopelessness that he lives in due to the fate of humanity, they decide to meet after many years. In addition to addressing the small difficulties of daily vampire life, they receive an unexpected visit from her sister (also a vampire, of course). Jarmusch gives us (again) a story without beginning or end. Some very funny dialogue, especially considering they are vampires. But it has many holes, and does not come to be perceived as a finished work. Great performances from Swinton and Hiddleston. They convey very well the mixture of vampiric coldness while still letting clearly see the love between them. This film is another reinterpretation of vampire stories. And quite an original one. But unfortunately, I must say that capsizes. The tedium and the slow pace of Jarmusch appear again. Interesting characters construction with very human suffering and discomfort, with a day-to-day imprint, in an unreal context, but without drawing on fantastic events. I liked how he achieves a bleak, depressing, gloomy atmosphere, both indoors (clusters of jumbled things, low light, old TV) and external (Detroit car rides). Ava's character (the sister) is unexploited. Definitely, Jarmsuch is boring. Level of entertainment: if you are tired, as soporific does a good job.</fullReview>

The main protagonists are opposites in many ways, and the film explores the two very different ways of dealing with living for centuries. One explores art and literature, seeing only the positives. The other is depressed at the way humanity lives in modern times. The music throughout the film is beautiful and creates the slow-paced yet rich atmosphere. The acting is superb. I have given this a 5 as it is a middle of the road film: at some points wonderful; at others too pretentious. Although I enjoyed it, I feel that the characters could have been developed further, exploring more of their experiences over the centuries. At points, the characters become stereotypical which is a pity. It's a decent film with wonderful actors. But it could have been a great film...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of the more annoying things in this movie have already been mentioned. Nevertheless, I think it is worth watching because of it's dense atmosphere, it's beautifully morbid settings and the overall, albeit slow rhythm. This should not come as a surprise, since all films by Jarmusch I have seen so far were rather slow, with long pauses of characters staring at nothing.The opening sequence alone with the spinning record made me feel interested in the main characters, something that other movies do not achieve in 90 minutes or more.I really didn't like the name-dropping, which was not interwoven with the dialogue or the "plot" at all, just two people talking about things that you think they would have told each other centuries ago. I think the dialog might be the weakest part of the film.Another thing that made me cringe a little bit was the sequence towards the end with the Lebanese singer. Someone must have really liked her music, which sounded like Kitsch to me, and the sequence felt like a promotion.This film seems to depend heavily on whether you like Adam or not, because his world view dominates throughout. If you find him self-absorbed and pretentious, then it must be a real pain to watch. However, I think you should not necessarily judge an artist (which he is) by bourgeois moral standards. Looking at the world, I can somewhat understand his depression, which made the picture immersive for me in the end.</fullReview>

This does _not_ mean they'll start sprouting a lot of awe-inspiring Shakespearian words, and their history is surprisingly left to its own devices, i.e. letting the viewer think rather than have everything served on a platter.You get to do a lot of thinking on your own in this film.

There is a lot of wit, and a measure of wisdom, in the film, which unfolds in the moodier redoubts of both Detroit and Morocco.Vampires in the 21st century, of whom we meet four, dig cellphones and other modern devices and no longer feed directly on human beings, there being available a supply of voluntarily extracted hemoglobin, albeit through legally questionable channels. Occasionally a reckless young vampire, such as the one played by Mia Wasikowska, succumbs to her hormones and has a meal in the old way, but at the risk of banishment by her elders, such as those played by Tilda Swinton (a casting director's dream to play a female vampire) and Tom Hiddleston (brooding and bohemian). I say "young" and "elder" but of course those are tricky designations if you are a vampire. Read more at http://osburnt.com/only-lovers-left-alive/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget of course about vampires. Keep just a Rumi poem on transience and transcendent love, on just this night between lovers.We enter it via Jarmusch himself, this is his own room of solitary musing. The gloomy protagonist paces up and down in his apartment, vintage guitars are uncased, quotes are offered, a life of aloof creativity that thinks of itself as genuine; this can be how he perceives himself inside the art, a man content to fiddle around with his things. But of course he makes them to share so let's see about that.This obsession with things, naming and knowing them, being hip to them, you'll see it again in the character of Eve who won't stop pointing out, how old is this or that trinket or where from, it's his own habit of wearing things he likes as tshirts. I can relax in all this but only for so long, I want him to urge me on, there must be actual life ahead, worldview.Another side of him is dear to me though, it's that side of him that wants to swim out to the distance where things are woven in a more fundamental way, wonder what is it about people, places, love, that time shuffles. Tarkovsky to his Tarantino, he has both.So we have marvelous night drives around Detroit to get out, Detroit standing for a world that dissipates and comes to pass. We stop to see an old dilapidated movie palace, a Packard factory going to waste; a bit coy, these would be places of crass commerce when new, but it shows a desire to contemplate things coming out of the night and vanishing back. We swim further out, Tangiers, more lovely moods with the muezzin calling out the time for prayer. The guitars, mixers, books, all the things used to house a self are left behind in Detroit, the music is stolen away. Jarmusch shows the man reluctant to let go but takes him out just the same, seeing the spiritual need for it or acquiescing to necessary order you'll judge.Having been attached to externals to define himself for so long however, what's out there? Therein is the distance, it's that none of the things can be carried, only lovers are left to go out. The innate craving persists, vampire lust as ego that expects to be satisfied. Hopefully however there is this in the end, two people aware in each other's presence, this as love that transcends all the other stuff.Buddhists speak of three marks of existence, two of the three are here. That things are transient, entangled with suffering and the third is, empty of self, this one being the most difficult to grasp and the one that escapes Jarmusch every time. The whole mood echoes the Buddhist Diamond sutra when it says, 'thus shall you think of this fleeting world; a star at dawn, a bubble in a stream, a flickering lamp, a phantom, and a dream'.It's about love above all, and I like how it's not just any spark of passion but, a matter of deep entanglement between souls; one of the most profound affairs in film. It's a flickering world indeed that I urge you to think of as nothing more than a playground for profound commitment of this kind, presence. I only miss the entanglement made visual, cinematic. What Tarkovsky wove from air. Swinton almost creates it alone in the way she surrounds her man, this is how attuned she is. But made visual - in my thinking it would have to rest on emptiness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Music and scenery create the mood of this excellent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a special film. Wouldn't suit everyone, which is assumable for independent cinema. You fully know that when you start watching it, and you're warned. I read in Trivia that it contained some action scenes at first, but then Jim Jarmusch was asked to add more, so instead, he removed them completely. I find that a surprisingly great move. Contrary to a comment I read here, the film still has a lot of action/happenings in it, it's just that the lack of typical, clichéd fight scenes is really helping represent the mood and lets you sink in the film. You have to understand, this is not a movie for the mass public. If it was, sure, Jarmusch would add the fight scenes, show some actions, show what fight moves the main characters are obviously capable of. But 'Only Lovers Left Alive' is something else. The mood is half of the film's main point, we're experiencing the feelings of people who are in a very interesting state of boredom: they are very, very bored, and very, very excited and passionate at the same time. Eve would collect hundreds of old books and read them with joy over and over again, Adam would buy expensive vintage instruments and passionately store them. But when Ava breaks a famous, special guitar, and half of the room filled with equally important instruments, he'd just react apathetically and move on. Ava destroys not only that, she ruins a lot more important to him; Adam is still reacting almost as if he's indifferent. Viewers of this film are offered the chance to experience this extreme apathy and boredom, mixed with passion about knowledge - science, invention, language, music - everything important humanity has created over time. The main characters don't have a lot of things that actually, visibly move them, given their experience - you can probably name only one. This is why it was best for the movie to develop slowly, without any action, than artificially try to put fight scenes in it. Music. This is the core of this movie. Jim Jarmusch and his band Sqürl are responsible for most of the sound in it ("Other contributors to the soundtrack are Zola Jesus, Yasmine Hamdan, Dutch lute player Jozef van Wissem"), and according to Van Wissem, Jim "makes his films (...) kind of like a musician. He has music in his head when he's writing a script so it's more informed by a tonal thing than it is by anything else". The soundtrack creates a unique mood, and you'll find out the more you listen to it, the more the film explains itself. Soundtrack combines with the look of all the characters and you're suddenly in love with the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stylistic approach to the eternal realm of vampires</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only lovers left alive is an unconventional vampire movie which is neither a romance nor a thriller as it might seemingly appear so. The story still revolves around the usual conceptions of how vampires avoid going out at broad daylight, devouring blood to fulfil their ravenous hunger and having hyper fast reflexes. Yet, the movie doesn't focus any of those clichés and stereotypical vampire aspects and it is a story about love, immortality and existentialism. The main character Adam played by Tom Hiddleston and Eve played by Tilda Swinton lived separately and Eve decided to reunite with her spouse flying all the way from Tangier to Detroit where Adam lived a reclusive lifestyle, producing anonymous Indie music. The two are entangled in the modern world which they had literally seen it all and it seemed that there is nothing enthralling in this world where they just fell into the usual patterns of everyday life. Jim Jarmusch brings us the whimsical spectrum of the lives of immortality, living a boring, mundane life and life itself becomes torturous to bear. This is more evident with Adam, described by Marlowe (played by John Hunt) as suicidal romantic scoundrel, the world in his eyes is blasphemous and chaotic and the best he could do is to keep his distance from this perpetual turmoil.It is blatant that the only thing that is meaningful to Adam's haunted immortal life is Eve. They had been in love for centuries and had experienced every sensation that's worth live for. Nevertheless, it is hard even for the two to reconcile with Eve's troublesome sister Ava (played by Mia Wasikowska) who visited them abruptly. The main characters are intriguing to watch, Adam, the music producer had a strong attitude towards the contemporary society. For instance, towards the end of the film, Adam was encapsulated by the singing of a Lebanese singer and it was informed by Eve that she could become famous one day. Yet, Adam seemed antagonized of fame and vanity life it might bring when he said he hoped that the singer wouldn't fall into the path of pursuing stardom.The film is exquisitely shot in the desolate townscape of Detroit and Tangier where you feel lifeless and living in a world at the solitary state. It is stylized with Hippie music and linking with historical and cultural references throughout the entire film. I would say Only Lovers Left Alive is a profound study of humankind and the contemporary phenomenon, the existence of beings when it is timeless, when finding purpose during the everlasting life span is no longer essential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Contemplative Drama about Existence, Love and Immortality.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Jarmusch's film 'Only Lovers Left Alive' is contemplative drama about existence, love and immortality; one of the better English vampire-dramas in the 21st Century; most of the good ones I've seen recently have been in other languages ('Let The Right One In', 'Thirst', etc). It's the story about survival and the search for a purpose of existence; it's the story of two lovers, Adam and Eve, who have lived and loved for centuries. Everything is okay until Eve's spoilt younger sister Ava (Mia) comes to visit them after 87 years.Adam and Eve are such interesting characters; they're wise, mature and peaceful, and have imbibed so much knowledge from around the world, in so many varied fields. The conversations they share are intriguing and passionate. Sometimes, when one has lived so long, they tend to lose meaning and purpose in life... like one of the characters does, for a while. As long as we have a person to share our existence with, everything makes sense; that's what happens when Adam and Eve reunite after years.The gorgeously talented Tilda Swinton and the wickedly seductive Tom Hiddleston beautifully capture the essence of vampire lovers, Eve and Adam. Mia Wasikowska and Anton Yelchin's brief roles add delightful charm to the scenario. John Hurt is interesting in his cameo as the historic dramatist Christopher Marlowe as a vampire.The background score by Carter Logan and Jozef van Wissem is really entrancing, and gives the movie a uniquely gloomy ambiance. Yorick Le Saux's cinematography is quite beautiful as well; you see places like Tangier and Detroit in the glorious light of the moon. The Arabic song performance towards the end is quite mesmerizing.It might take a while to get used to the mood of the film, but give it some time, you won't regret it. Leave other reasons behind, and watch it for Tilda; it's a role she dons with sensuous ease.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>interesting take on vampires</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a world of vampires, Adam (Tom Hiddleston) is a reclusive musician with a helper Ian (Anton Yelchin). Eve (Tilda Swinton) finds old friend Christopher Marlowe (John Hurt). Eve reconnects with Adam. They are both evolved beyond their bloodlust. They roam the deserted streets of Detroit. However they are interrupted by her wild little sister Ava (Mia Wasikowska).It's an interesting take on the vampires. It's certainly a nice break from all the young adult vampire fares. It's got Jim Jarmusch's style of a slow deliberate indie. Tilda makes a great vampire. Tom Hiddleston fits quite nicely with Tilda. This is not a big studio churning out another vampire movie. It's moody. It has a few funny touches. It's outside the box. Mia doesn't come in until after halfway through the movie. The first half has this dreamy ethereal quality about it. I'm not sure Mia is good at playing the wild child. She is very much playing a spoiled child but she needs to be more dangerous. The movie needs to see her violence. Maybe Jarmusch thinks that actual violence would conflict with the tone of the movie. I just felt that could have been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Style over substance or the curse of immortality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OLLA (don't you just love that!) opens with a close-up of a spinning vinyl record to the background of period music, followed by crane shots of two separate scenes each with a protagonist lying in languid comfort, also spinning round and round. These two locations are then revealed as Tangier and Detroit. Tracing the nocturnal outdoor activities, the camera for the former meanders along exotic streets and alleyways and finally follows Eve (Tilda Swinton) into a small café where she hangs out with Christopher Marlow (John Hurt), now 450 years old (if my Googling is accurate), and eventually receives from him a grocery bag with some containers in it. In the latter city, half-way around the globe, we see Adam (Tom Hiddleston) disguised as a "Dr. Faust" (complete with surgical cap and mask so that only his eyes are showing) conducting a transaction of receiving from a Dr. Watson (Jeffrey Wright, criminally underused) drink-size cylinders which were immediately put into a super-secured looking bag. The conclusion of this series of scenes comprises alternating montages of Adam, Eve and Marlow, all comfortably in the security of their homes, sipping from elegant glasses the way a connoisseur would enjoy a vintage wine. Then, each tilts back, allowing the camera to focus on their gradually protruding canine teeth. Mission accomplished for these exceedingly stylish establishing scenes: these three are vampires, high-class vampires that don't condescend to biting any Tom, Dick or Harry, but instead purchase pure, uncontaminated, quality blood from reliable sources.By this time, it becomes quite evident that OLLA is very much an exercise in style, reflected in the first half of my summary line. The second half is a theme that you would find readily in works of George Bernard Shaw or J.R.R. Tolkien. While you may argue that vampires are not totally immortal (indeed, Adam had contemplated killing himself with a special made-to-order wooden bullet) you can sense the wearing boredom, even when they still deeply love each other, as the title of the movie suggests. The initial scene in fact has a measure of hilarity showing how the two lovers communicate between Detroit and Tangier using state-of-the-art video equipment of i-phone and TV hooked up to video camera. If the dialogue has reviewed how long it was since they were physically together, I missed it. Anyway, Eve with some difficulty overcomes her inertia and flies to Detroit (departure and arrival carefully scheduled to be at night time). They each have things to occupy themselves when they are apart, things artistic and cultural. Adam composes modern music while Eve reads in just about every known language, not to mention hobnob with Marlow. When they are together, other than sex (which is only implied and never explicitly shown), they talk about things artistic and cultural, over the last four or five hundred years. Yet, the sense of boredom is palpable. There isn't very much by way of story but there is a trajectory towards a sort of crisis: source the elite, pure blood that sustains them is running out.The cast is top-notch. Those who have seen the vast variety of roles Swinton has played will understand that she is a whole acting universe all by herself. Launching through Loki, Hiddleston has become an icon that is synonymous with "cool". Hurt is another perfect choice. Two younger actors complement well this exceptional cast. Anton Yelchin (Chekov in the successful reboot of "Star Treks", with the funny Russian accent, if you need a reminder) plays Ian the gofer who supplies Adam with everything from vintage electric guitars to the aforementioned wooden bullet. Mia Wasikowska ("Alice in Wonderland" followed by a streak of character movies) is Ava, Eva's younger sister that one critic describes as "wild" but actually more normal as a vampire, one that does not make an agonizing effort to shun a human neck (guess whose it is in this movie?) Auteur Jim Jarmusch is not exactly prolific in terms of main stream (albeit still artsy) movies and the only movie I've seen of him is "Broken flowers" (2005) which won Cannes Grand Prize of the Jury (sort of silver medal) but that one well defines him and his work. By the way, it has Swinton too although you'll be hard pressed to recognize her.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to be honest: I watched it because of Tom Hiddleston. After seeing him in the Avengers and the Thor movies I wanted to see him in a different "movie environment". I was rather surprised about the movie - it was so different than what I expected from the plot summary. The music / soundtrack is gorgeous, nearly mind blowing and the way the characters were pictured is amazing. I am used to fast changing pictures in movies but here? You get long shots of scenes just to get the feeling of the situation.The all over feeling I got from the movie was melancholy and somehow a slight depression. Though the sadness it had something amazingly beautiful in it.The plot is rather simple and nothing new. Two "vampires" (yet they never use the word - thanks for that!) who are in love struggle with normal problems and humans. As someone who admires great and deep plots, this was something that disappointed me. Not really much happening in this movie - especially no real plot twists. And Eve's sister just annoyed the crap out of me. But as there is not much of the plot, the problems with the plot are also small. It's not badly written it just could have been a bit more. Overall I think it was definitely worth watching, I even might be watching it again. It's neither an action nor a deep plot movie, yet it's a beautiful scenery with great actors, fantastic music and some magic that gets your mind blown away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only Lovers Left Alive is quite an interesting, but not perfect film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For better or for worse, Only Lovers Left Alive ended up being exactly what I expected... a vampire film directed by Jim Jarmusch. I have been a fan of this filmmaker's for a long time, and even though he has had a few missteps in his filmography, I generally enjoy his parsimonious narrative style, which sacrifices story in favor of atmosphere and richness of character. And even though I wouldn't place Only Lovers Left Alive, his most recent film, among his best ones, I liked it pretty much. Regarding the screenplay and atmosphere, Only Lovers Left Alive properly combines the traditional mystical of the tragic vampire (delineated by author Anne Rice) with the contemporary attitude from writers such as Laurell K. Hamilton and Poppy Z. Brite, adding a pinch of the pompous affectation from director Jean Rollin's vampire cinema. In other words, a vision with the best attributes from the genre combined with Jarmusch's undeniable style in order to add emotion and gravity. However, I can't deny the fact that I felt Only Lovers Left Alive a bit superficial; an interesting exercise of shape and style which couldn't find the necessary intellectual background in order to become something excellent. Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddleston bring perfect performances as two immortal beings whose considerable accumulation of knowledges and experience has left them a passive and philosophical perspective of life. Adam took the road of a "tormented artist", creating amazing music with retro instruments which has become a cult object, even though the artist refuses to publish it. On the other hand, Eve has a more bohemian life, enjoying the long and aesthetic experience from her long life. The film portrays them as two rock stars living a beautiful decadence, something which is undeniably "cool"... but there aren't authentic narrative foundations holding the attractive facade. Anyway, I enjoyed Only Lovers Left Alive pretty much, thanks to its elegant visual style, perfectly achieved atmosphere, good performances and extraordinary soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Postmodern and Apocalyptic Tale of Adam and Eve</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In recent years a lot of nostalgic and apocalyptic films about the world and cinema have emerged from a great number of different artists. Films such as "Melancholia" (2011), "The Turin Horse" (2011), "Holy Motors" (2012), "Tabu" (2012), "Cosmopolis" (2012), "Goodbye, Language" (2014), and on a more mainstream note "Hugo" (2011) and "The Artist" (2011), seem to capture a deep yearning for something that has passed on to oblivion, and this yearning might contain an emotion of the death of cinema. The films' more or less apocalyptic visions might consider the western society, the world, a personal style or the history of an art form. Given this, it shouldn't appear as anything startling that Jim Jarmusch -- the pioneer of not only independent American cinema but also a cinema which wishes to show another aspect of America -- has joined this group. His latest film, "Only Lovers Left Alive" (2013) is a truly romantic film in the most actual meaning of the word; that is to say, it is romantic for its whole world view, its attitude towards man and his environment. It has been four years since Jim Jarmusch's last feature film, "The Limits of Control" (2009) whose reception was negative and unfair to say the least. The film was Antonionian, understated and, above all, different. Many fans were disappointed. They didn't see what they loved about "Broken Flowers" (2005) and "Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai" (1999), let alone "Stranger Than Paradise" (1984) or "Down by Law" (1987). However, I think that many people will agree with me that the right way to approach a work is not to go searching for something to satisfy one's own needs. It's more about a personal dialogue with the artist, seeing where he or she has ended up this time, what stylistic developments have occurred. I believe it was the French writer Guy Maupassant who once said that the only right criterion one can set for art is that an artist must create something beautiful in the frames of the artist's private form language. Of course you are free to disagree, but to me, personally, and I hope that to someone else as well, this will do -- for now at least.Although today's film criticism demands brief synopses and plot summaries, I think we ought to accept that "Only Lovers Left Alive" is an aimless story and a good one as such. It's a story about two lovers, who "happen to be vampires," one of whom is depressed while the other is more keen on life. They share a love that has lasted for centuries; a love which reminds us of age-old romantic literature. The first thing one notices about "Only Lovers Left Alive" is that it is very aware of its genre. The film is full of clichés and conventions of the vampire genre, which has experienced a wide resurrection in recent years. Some might even feel that there was no need for another one. Yet, somehow, Jarmusch's postmodern take on vampire mythology seems to carry an eccentric uniqueness to it. Film critic Jonathan Romney has aptly observed that the film "is constantly surprising even when it seems to be ploughing old furrows." Romney has added that all this seems to bear "a melancholy harping on mortality and humanity's capacity to mess the globe up." As a matter of fact, rarely does one find a film with such romantic awareness about the world coming to an end. Even the title, "Only Lovers Left Alive", inclines this. It is as if the film knew it was the last love film on Earth. Already the very beginning -- the shift from stars and space to a spinning LP -- exhales eternity and nostalgia right in our face. Vinyl records, old guitars, melancholic rock n' roll, and the talk of non-vampires as zombies bring us closer to a world on the verge of destruction. When the end approaches, it is natural to return to the beginning, to the essential, which in this case is love. In terms of the return to the beginning, it is suiting that the main lovers of the film are named Adam and Eve. Overall, "Only Lovers Left Alive" is new, romantic, poetic and eccentric. Its spinning motion and slow rhythm put the viewer on a trance-like trip like no other, which might give the film a possible cult status in the future. It has a very original atmosphere which is definitely fresh and will most likely continue to arouse our interest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If all the Emo and Hipster kids got together and made a vampire film, it would probably play out a bit like 'Only Lovers Left Alive', which has an excellent soundtrack, moody vampires who hate everything but new underground music, and talk about how much they hate everything. It gets old very fast. But instead of the Emo and Hipster kids, we got famed director Jim Jarmusch who directed 'Down By Law',' Ghost Dog: Way of The Samurai', 'Coffee and Cigarettes', and ' Dead Man', and 'Broken Flowers' to name a few - not exactly a light-weight. Jarmusch is an acquired taste like a fine 40-year old scotch, where not all people have developed a taste for the director, but those with exquisite taste love his work. I consider myself the latter. But once in a while, some of our favorite directors make a movie that is ultimately forgettable and doesn't live up to the filmmaker's past work. And that is where I stand with Jarmusch's vampire film 'Only Lovers Left Alive'.Jarmusch has wanted to make this for several years. My guess is since the vampire craze hit several years ago, Jarmusch wanted to jump on that. The film stars Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddleston as two long distance lovers who happen to be vampires that have been together for thousands and thousands of years. Before production finally started on this film, Jarmusch had Michael Fassbender cast in the lead role, but due to scheduling conflicts and delays, Fassbender had to pass and the role went to Hiddleston (Loki in the Marvel movies). Hiddleston plays Adam while Swinton plays Eve, who are two vampires living in present day.Adam lives in Detroit while Even lives overseas in Morocco, but they video chat almost every night to keep their relationship alive. Adam is a very reclusive musical artist who is very successful, although nobody knows who he actually is, with the exception of his only human friend Ian (Anton Yelchin) who brings him recording equipment, vintage guitars, amongst other things. One night Ian brings over a special revolver for Adam, which he requested. This firearm is supposed to be the weapon for Adam's suicide, but before he can pull the trigger, Eve phones in and basically talks him out of it. Adam looks like he hates everything about the world and refers to his human friend and the rest of the human race as zombies.I guess you could say he has become bored with life as he seems to have been around since the beginning of time. And most of the movie is basically Eve, the fun going and light hearted vampire, trying to get her lover out of this moody and depressive funk he's been in for a few years. Adam's world is turned upside down when one Eve's younger sister Ava (Mia Wachowskia) shows up in town and is the antithesis of what a hipster hates. Basically she is a main-stream pop princess who doesn't mind taking a human victim anytime she wants to and causes huge problems for Adam.And the film runs along, or shall I say slowly walks along as Eve tries to get her lover Adam out of his current monotone state and head back to Morocco to see a dying friend and to feed on a special vile of blood that will keep them healthy for a while. You won't find any blood in this movie or any real vampire kills either. You might see a couple of seconds of vampire fangs, but nothing much else besides a vampire with angst and moodiness so thick that you can pour it over one-hundred pancakes and still have some left over. There were a few cool things that I noticed new to the vampire world of movies that were shown in 'Only Lovers Left Alive'.I enjoyed that Adam had a bunch of framed photos hanging on the wall of famous people he had met throughout the hundreds of years he was alive, as well as some cool artifacts lying around. It was cool to see that history of their existence. And it was nice to see that these vampires weren't solely out to feed, but to just lead a fun and simple life like the rest of us humans. But that can only go so far. There is a funny moment where Adam takes Eve to see Jack White's old house, but other than that, this movie is not Jarmusch's best work. Swinton is amazing in this role and you truly believe she is a vampire throughout. However, Hiddleston is just too damn moody for my taste here. If you like you vampire movies overly long, moody, and with no action, blood, or comedy, then this is definitely a movie you will enjoy. Other than that, I think the only thing i can take away from this film is its kick-ass soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was told it is a movie about love. So, I was sitting expecting to see some love, but did not see any. Usually, Jarmusch does not communicate much to me: usually, nothing at all. On this movie, Jarmusch communicate stupidity. It is one of the most stupid movie I have ever seen. It is just a silly vampire movie, with ridiculous dialogs - Buffy, the Vampire Slander, is deeper. The story is very stupid: it is better when Jarmusch does not write any story at all; and now I know why his movies are usually story less: because when he invent a story it is the silliest and must stupid of the stories. The scientific quotations are risibles, it seems Jarmusch is quite fond for Tesla, quoted also in Coffe &amp; Cigarettes: poor Tesla, he was mistreated in life, he does not deserve that a Jarmusch takes care of him. The only good thing I have seen is, on spots, some good photography, especially on human bodies: reminding me the usage of light by Caravaggio (but a movie director whose knowledge of Italy makes him think that the Italians are so horny to have sex with pumpkins, sheep, and in the street - see Night on Earth - I suppose has no idea of Caravaggio). Probably girls in the age range 12-15 could like this thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A morbid yet strangely enlivening rendition of the blood sucking immortals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been much a fan when it came to the vampire/werewolf on-screen sub-genre. Per chance I landed up with Only Lovers Left Alive, without really knowing what it was about. To be honest I would have probably left it for another lifetime if I knew it to be in fact a blood-sucking rendition of the immortal earth-dwellers. The movie had me caught in its sinister gaze from the start. Although slow progressing, it is alive with the morbid itch that can only be described as the depressed yet inspiring ability to outlive centuries of human life on planet earth.The film is carried along a theme of morbid-yet-eternally-alive by the musical mastery that drags you along but has you mouth-dryingly awaiting your next shot of pure human blood. I was carried away into a reality where I could feel the emotion, even lack of emotion, to have seen, heard, experienced all that has ever been experienced within human civilisation. Along with the loneliness and sadness one might experience in such a never ending reality, weaved in is this beautiful relationship between two lovers that have endured what can only be described as every emotion there is to experience in the world. Their seeming lack of love for each other makes way for a internal love that cannot be broken.Definitely my only and favourite Vampire film.</fullReview>

Other Hollywood films might get the main characters into bed but they end up in the same place, two actors pretending to be in love because that's what they are being paid to do.Then along comes Only Lovers Left Alive, a new film by Jim Jarmusch. To get this out of the way, I love his films, and the way they ask me to think and experience what I see on the screen. What Lovers also conveys through its two main characters is what an intimate relationship between two loving, sexual adults looks like. Watching the film I believed these two characters love each other.I don't often see this in films, partly I suspect because there aren't many actresses of the caliber of Tilda Swinton. The last time I recall seeing kind of intimacy was in the Jason Bourne films with Matt Damon and Franka Potente. As the two characters became close and fell in love, I could see why he would go through hell to avenge her death.It does take time to create this kind of relationship, and good acting, and Jarmusch takes the time with two wonderful actors.As a story, Only Lovers Left Alive is about managing the mundane in an immortal life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow. Sexy, intelligent and powerful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I want to compliment Jim Jarmusch on how he was able to create and sustain such a dark but very delicate tone in the duration of this movie; of course, compliments to Jozef van Weissem and SQÜRL for the amazing music that helped keep the edgy vibe going. Seriously, the music is top notch. It has that very hypnotic and charming Gothic rock tune to it but there's also this indescribable distorted metallic undertone that helps keep the feeling gritty, humble, melancholic and somewhat industrial. I don't know, maybe I'm just rambling but the classy haunting mood expressed in the chords was probably the one thing that, personally, had the biggest impact on me.But that's not to say that there isn't anything else to talk about. There was a very well sustained amount of dry humour in the script and, honestly, the movie made me laugh quite hard several times despite the repetitive waves of bleakness and hopelessness that I could feel being emitted by Adam. It could be argued that this movie was awful since it lacked the conventional amount of substance and action but I found it quite lively in an odd, living-dead, muted sort of way. The movie was fun in my opinion. Even though only a few things happen in this movie, the sheer class, quality and style expressed by the director and the performances by the actors were enough to satisfy me. The movie looks much deeper into love, human condition and life than is normally seen in a romance movie. The focus was more focused on a very healthy, mutual and endearing relationship between two lovers -- thrice-married, I think -- and I guess we just learn at the end of it that they'll continue to endure their immortal existence with each other by their side, despite their differences.I wouldn't classify this as a horrific vampire movie because I believe that Jarmusch only added the entire vampire concept to capture the timelessness and the everlasting themes of nostalgia and loss that are expressed through the characters. I love this couple to bits. Sure they come across as snobs but they're both extremely intelligent, civil and compassionate -- well, we don't see really see much of that last thing in Adam much, more like a rigid command of tolerance. Also, the settings and visuals are stunning. Detroit: the isolation, the decay, the ruin and the slow deterioration of all things considered good in life and the declining state of morality and purity in humankind -- contamination comes into mind -- which pretty much reflects the thoughts of Adam and Eve. They pretty much, overall, despise us zombies -- or perhaps I've gone a bit too far in my interpretation? The truth of the matter lies that this movie has a lot of thought put into it and it is so rich and vivid with it that people like me are literally drooling over the movie's awesomeness. The movie suggests that no matter how many times society may crumble around the pair, they will both survive through the ordeals together, and no matter now much they might change after every century or so, Adam and Eve will continue to love, support and look out for each other. These two understand each other deeply and know each other so very well that I guess it is their intimacy and passion that fuels the mood and tone of the movie that I had mentioned previously. So to conclude: this is why the movie is called Only Lovers Left Alive and this is why you should watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ethereal Moroccan music, lingering and beautiful kisses, eerie yelps of coyotes, abandoned factories and theaters in Detroit, and vampires mix in this lush, absorbing, and atmospheric meditation on love and living. From the opposite ends of the earth two lovers come together, amid darkness and despair, to try to find some encouragement. With rich textures of sound, imagery, and thought, and little horror or violence, it is unlike any other film with vampires. Scenes are rich with ambient music, kisses, longing, isolation, savored drafts of blood, and dark as well as beautiful possibilities. Being from the Detroit area, I appreciated the apt, revealing, and stimulating, though saddening, references to the forlorn and desolate city. The mysterious and beautiful scenery of the film mirrors the feelings of the characters so well. I only wished that some of the scenes were more thoroughly explored. Tilda Swinton, Tom Hiddleston, and the lovely Mia Wasikowska are adept in their performances. The film is rich with resplendent imagery, surreal and enthralling music, and curious ideas that kept me, happily, pondering over them long after the film ended. Seen at the 2014 Miami International Film Festival.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first, I thought I'd be looking at yet another clichéd goth vampire movie, but it slowly, steadily won me over. I respect the intelligent dialog, of course; however, I think what really intrigued me most was the mood- the darkness, the loneliness, the silence. There's absolutely a middle-of-the-night feel to "Only Lovers Left Alive" that really worked, and it set the exactly proper stage for the characters and the action. Like all movies, I went in having avoided any and all information about the film (story, actors, director, etc) so the journey from 5 to 9 out of 10 was really satisfying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Because I liked both DEAD MAN and GHOST DOG: WAY OF THE SAMURAI, I gave ONLY LOVERS LEFT ALIVE a chance- but, after innumerable three-hundred and sixty-degree overhead shots of people lounging around going on about nothing in particular and excruciatingly slow scenes between characters not the least bit interesting, I have to confess that ONLY LOVERS LEFT ALIVE isn't the kind of movie I can recommend to anyone. It's DOWN BY LAW, with vampires: a self-indulgent motionless picture that in the end offers the viewer very little (if ANYthing). Granted, no filmmaker is flawless, but this kind of self-indulgent tripe gives low budget, independent filmmaking a bad name. (And the line about how Detroit "will always have water" is particularly ironic in view of recent developments...)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a vampire movie. A movie with vampires in it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been waiting for the longest time until I got to see this one. Ever since it was first announced with an absolutely amazing cast, all I wanted was to get my hands on it. I have to say it was absolutely worth the wait. For one thing, it is not a vampire movie per say. Sure, all the main characters are vampires, and a huge chunk of the plot revolves around their blood supply, but in all honesty, I don't think anyone expected this to play the genre straight. The metaphors on the decay of humanity (when not outright said)worked really well, and the film was filled with references to music, literature, and science that kept the tone.For another, the character and world-building were nicely done. Tom Hiddleston's Adam is so self-involved in his own despair, that it's no wonder he's compared to Hamlet mid-movie. It's such a stereotypical character for a vampire flick post Anne Rice that you can't help but ironically love him. Tilda Swinton looks out of this world whenever you look at her, but here Eve was almost translucent, and I really enjoyed her scolding her husband whenever he was growing to become too petulant. I also found John Hurt and Anton Yelchin great,whereas Mia's Ava was so gratingly annoying, you could only applaud her for a job well-done. Lastly, the soundtrack was amazing and I have to get my hands on it.</fullReview>

At first you get really confused about what the point is, but if you just relax and enjoy the details, it's nice, calm and something an artist could appreciate. It /does/ feel more like a prequel though than an actual movie, like it's giving you background for another more involved movie to come, but sadly, I doubt that they'll have a second. It really made me want to stop and look around at some to the little things I take for granted too, sit back and enjoy the things around me like nature, science, and music and just really appreciate them. It also made me want to be creative for creativity's sake. All in all, it's a strangely inspiring movie and very wonderful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where can I start on my praise for this film. I have always been strongly drawn to the work of the work of Jim Jarmusch's due to my dad getting me into his films. I have always loved his atmospheric style seen in Down by Law, and this film does not disappoint. Tilda Swindon and Tom Hiddleston are fantastic as the films main protagonists and all the other characters are also fantastic. I do feel that some characters where underused such as John Hurts character and Jeffery Rushes characters. Clearly one of the most out standing parts of the film is the look which is superb. The whole film is shot at night making the whole film more or less very dimly lit. This is done very well, in fact the cinematography in general is gorgeous. The film portrays a perfectly what it may be like to be a vampire living for centuries. Deep down the film is actually a love story and a very interesting one, it makes all the puny teen vampire love films that are ruining the vampire genre simply pathetic. Overall it is an extremely elegant and stylish masterpiece that should be considered to be one of Jarmusch's greats.</fullReview>

I wander if I am the only one seeing the absurd of a vampire movie where the vampires don't bite people but buy their blood from a freaking dealer, I mean come on? From all the unused myths and legends about vampires, one writer came up with a disgusting idea about hipster vampires. What's next, warm blooded zombies? Oh, wait, there is a movie about that! Please stop moving the standards of the vampire myth lower, every freaking year with something new and stupid, vampire faeries (Twilight), slimy shows about becoming a vampire (Vampire diaries) and now this, hipster vampires? People, start reading some stories about the true meaning of this being from the source - Slavic literature for example, I am sick of this commercial crap Hollywood keeps feeding the rest of the world. I don't get the message from this movie, even though I tried, for the sake of the cast members I like, but no matter how hard I try, a depressed, in love, hipster vampire just turns my stomachAnd one last thing, a request to the writers: MAKE MOVIES FOR THE PUBLIC! I don't care if some arrogant board of professors/judges likes your movie, IF I CAN'T GET THE MESSAGE! Your prizes may prove your success, but not everyone is able to professionally estimate the plot and get inside your head, hence realizing your point.Thank you</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Within minutes of this film starting, the bold red writing against a backdrop of a starry sky, SQURLS "The Taste of Blood" adding to the haunting atmosphere, this film draws you in. All throughout the film there is a languorous sense of isolation, living on the outskirts of everything going on in the world. People have complained that there is not really much to drive the plot, but I believe it's supposed to put across how droll being immortal must become, and the acting from both Hiddleston and Swinton was languid and yet charismatic.A few unnecessary pop culture and historical references have been shoehorned into the film, and it can be construed as pretentious at times (not by me I hasten to add, the languid pace and isolated backdrop drew me right in, I didn't want to leave), but apart from that, it has been very well put together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>French Philosophers Invade Needle Park</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is supposed to be about vampires but I think is a vampire because I felt it draining my soul away as I watched! You might think you're screening a sequel to, "Panic in Needle Park" instead of a vampire movie by the gaunt emaciated appearance of the central protagonists and their lethargic natures. They behave more like Heroin addicts then creatures of the night and even their reaction to a blood meal is how one might expect a junkie to enjoy a fix. Also much like addicts their creature comforts are of little interest to them. They wear filthy clothing and abode in abject poverty with Detroit paying host to most of the film. The only thing managing to keep you from falling into a deep depressive state after exposure to their lifestyle is their intolerable smugness and utter contempt for humanity. If you have any self-respect whatsoever the characters should stimulate a certain level of indignation in you.Throughout the film they suggest that every artistic achievement of mankind was actually theirs or of those like them and that humans are nothing more then dimwitted idiots. In fact they refer to us, "zombies".If you're a devotee to leftist memes you'll particularly love this movie because just about all of them are represented here. The characters lament constantly about pollution and how humanity is destroying the planet while making use of every modern convenience possible. They drive cars, fly commercial airlines and even talk on cell phones without a single regard for their hypocrisy.At one point one of the characters rants about the shabby way scientists have been treated. He shouts, "they threw Galileo in jail!" Yes they did for violating the scientific method. He published a book that presented his theories as facts and they took those things very seriously back in those days. If only we did today everyone would a lot better off. Then he growls, "they're still b*t*hing about Darwin". Sure we are because after over 150 years his theories remain unproven. Theories are not facts and science is not faith. Science is observation but today you really need a lot of faith to believe in Darwin because there is nothing to observe.Oh how I longed for Professor Van Helsing to appear with stakes in hand to free me from my torment but alas he did not.</fullReview>

Some movies please with their plot, others with their atmosphere. Only Lovers Left Alive is of the second type. Its photography is immensely rich, all the movie is shot at night, everything is so dark and calm. The soundtrack is unique, the guitar instrumentals adds to the slow pace of the movie, while bringing to the atmosphere. I personally like Jarmusch's slow poetic scenes.

		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to see this last year at the BFI screening in London, and last night was able to see it again with an intro by the director himself.I'm not a fan of art house, pretentious movies. I find them dull and pointless, and I feel that this film has been presented by some media as a film of this type. That couldn't be more wrong. This film is a celebration of life, beauty, love, humanity and so many other things.It is also hilarious! The dark posters and promo materials make this look like it will be a dull bore fest, but it truly is utterly wonderful in its humour, it's sweetness and light along with darker moments.Tilda Swinton is the vamp we all want in our lives; humble, curious and so very optimistic, she is a joy.My beloved Mr. Hiddleston is wonderful on so many levels. His Adam is both bleak and funny, his love for Eve redeeming him from being an 'angsty teen' character.Go watch this beautiful movie. Enjoy the soundtrack (which is AMAZING!), the humour, the joy and curiosity, the excitement of just being alive.Go watch it! Go now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Surprisingly Clever Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Too often are vampires stereotyped and ridiculed in the modern media. Jim Jarmusch's work may stereotype, but it doesn't ridicule. In fact Only Lovers Left Alive captures the darkness of such individuals, without concentrating too much on the fact that they are vampires. Instead it concentrates on the message that 'love is eternal' through beautifully dark visuals and music. Even with the distinct lack of gore and violence that usually befits these sorts of films, there's no denying the dark atmosphere, with a hint of a somewhat twisted sense of humour. Hiddleston and Swinton are perfect for these roles, really believable as the 'long-term' lovers. There's a real sense of a languid pace about this film, something that the choice of music reflects in abundance. Yes, the story does seem to lack any direction or purpose, other than to convey the message and to portray this dark and twisted beauty, but this lack of story seems to add some further mystery to these characters and their world. Overall, this is an interesting and surprising take on these creatures of lore, and a really beautifully dark one at that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tilda and Tom are vampire-lovers on the mean streets of Detroit and in the casbah of old Tangiers?and that's pretty much it. I've enjoyed most of Jarmusch's work, but this one seems more like a very long video for his drone-and-feedback band, Sqürl, than a coherent feature film. By that I mean that he seems to be focused almost entirely on arranging his handsome cast and a collection of cultural props into an interesting sequence of sounds and images, like a video. That's fine as far as it goes; the problem is that the rudimentary storyline and the silly, pandering dialogue (these two are supposed to be undead, not braindead...) make "Only Lovers..." a bit of a chore to sit through. The plot loses its last shreds of coherence when Mia Wasikowska turns up as Tilda's younger sister; didn't they know what would happen if she was left alone with a nice juicy mortal like Anton Yelchin? Gorgeous cinematography, great music; ten stars for guest vocalist Yasmine Hamdan and 70s soul sister Denise LaSalle (the scene where T and T dance to one of her old 45s is by far the best one in the movie) and to the production designer and whoever scrounged up the vintage electronics in Tom's Detroit hideout. Let's hope that JJ gets his mojo working again, but in the meantime better leave this one to the cinéastes and hipsters and the kind of people who chuckle knowingly when they see a photo of Kafka.... We had great hopes for Jemaine ("Flight of the Conchords") Clement's vampire movie too; maybe vampropriation's just not a thing anymore?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only the future</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fact that they are vampires shows that people nowadays are perhaps dead, even in the modern city of Detroit, its very bankruptcy means that people, and not just vampires, are out for the moment without any thought for the future. Detroit, being both literally, and figuratively, bankrupt is used up, and is as full of "used to" and "past" as the vampires themselves. Indeed, this "modern" city is a shell of what it once was and what it could be, still eking out an existence based on a glorious past, rather than a potential future, or a future full of potential. This bankrupt modernity is in stark contrast to the life and deliberate life of Algiers. Even though this city is ancient and a place of ghosts, the city is portrayed as having layers of present placed upon it. it is not basking in its past and surviving on its history, but rather living for the future. The creation of new music and the fact that shops and services are functioning tells of a thriving city, in stark contrast to the portrayal of an altogether languid Detroit. This eternal present of Algiers is therefore perfect for the vampires, who, as undead have no future, but rely on their past to exist. Even the "new" music of the Adam character is rehashed from centuries ago, and is more of a memory rediscovered than a vivid and alive creation. Towards the end of the film the singer in the bar in Algiers is the only person with a future. So the vampires walk away and leave the future to its own devices, while the vampires are content to remain in their eternal present, which could be construed as a never-ending retelling of their past. The message of the film is then that vampires cannot love because they have no future and their past is redundant because it is not building on a past towards a future. So only lovers left alive is that those with love are future-oriented, while those who are merely surviving are not really existing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An original vampire drama. A sort of "days in the lives of" two lovers, who happen to be vampires. No big issues explored, just the sort of domestic and relationship things that come up when you're a vampire couple.The novelty wears off though. Ambles and meanders along, with just enough pace to keep you interested. All along there's an undercurrent of doom and foreboding (largely due to the great soundtrack).After a while, however, you want there to be a point to it all, and ultimately, there isn't. It really is about the journey and not the destination, and the journey isn't always that that interesting.The listlessness of the plot is saved by some great performances from Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton in the lead roles. Mia Wasikowska shakes off her Jane Austin / period piece / nice innocent girl stereotype and does a good job as a rather free-spirited, anarchic and selfish vampire.Worth a watch, but don't overestimate its profundity.</fullReview>

Once I became attached to them I wanted to know their entire history. I wanted more than what the film presented. I am glad it didn't feel like a horror film.

		<fullReview>'How can you've live for so long and still not get it? This self obsession is a waste of living.' Jim Jarmusch (Ghost Dog, Broken Flowers, Dead Man, Coffee and Cigarettes, etc) enters the bloody vampire realm in this very long and tedious film he both wrote and directs. He did assemble a respectable cast and relies heavily on dark atmosphere and bad hair but despite all the clever historic references this is a film that appeals to a certain audience ? a VERY big certain audience who can't seem to reach satiety for blood consumption.The ONLY TOW LOVERS LEFT ALIVE are the centuries old Adam and Eve. Adam (Tom Hiddleston) is a musician and electric guitar collector (his source is another vampire Ian - Anton Yelchin) and Adam has grown weary with the world, having lived in it for too long and is disenchanted with the manner in which his current station in Detroit is moving: he request Ian to create a bullet with a hard wooden nose that he plans to use as a suicide tool. Eve (Tilda Swinton, always excellent) lives in Tangiers, friends with Marlowe (John Hurt), and is concerned about Adam's countenance as viewed on Skype. She flies to Detroit to comfort her long lasting lover offering O Negative blood Popsicles and other tidbits to brighten his life. Adam and Eve no longer gain their life source from living individuals but from blood taken form the blood bank in the hospital ? with the kind assistance of Dr. Watson (Jeffrey Wright). All seems to be progressing smoothly until Eve's sister Ava (Miz Wasikowska) moves in and all hell breaks loose.This is a genre film and will likely satisfy vampire story fans. The film is well photographed and maintains its creepy premise to the end. There is some witty writing about art, science, and love and were it not for the presence of this specific cast the chief complaint would be ennui.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film made by it's great performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just when you think the Vampire genre of films is about to take a well-deserved (or perhaps not so well-deserved in the case of Twilight) break out comes another vampire tale in the form of Only Lovers Left Alive but thankfully this little oddity is highly unlike any other vampire tale you've likely scene thanks to its sombre and macabre tone and some downplayed yet very watchable lead performances from everyone's favourite superhero nasty Tom Hiddleston and the ever ghostly white Tilda Swinton.Much of the films unique tone can be attributed to the fact that indie weirdo and polarising director Jim Jarmusch is at the helm which virtually signposts this film as a warning to anyone who does not attest to his non-conforming style of direction and narrative. Lovers is for all intents and purposes is just as strange as Jarmusch's other films and the tone of the piece is one that refuses to really move anywhere in any form of fast manner but that is part of its gentle charms. When one has been alive for thousands of years, it would be safe to assume that you feel no need to really do much or do it in good time and that's exactly what Jarmusch seems to be aiming for here with his immortal protagonists Adam and Eve.Creating one of the years more memorable and unique couples, Hiddleston shines most as depressed music loving vamp Adam whose long term wife Eve played by Swinton comes to cheer him up in the dour surrounds of the no longer bustling Detroit cityscape. Interplay between Adam and Eve can at times be downright funny, other times downright depressing but it's unquestionable that their long going relationship is believable and likable above all else and the presence of supports in the form of Mia Wasikowska as Eve's over joyous sister Ava and Anton Yelchin as Adam's help/friend Ian provide the film with much needed energy when things become a little to bloodless for its own good.A slight film and a film that seems unconcerned with amounting to a whole lot, Only Lovers Left Alive is made recommendable thanks to its leads, it's supports and it's at times insightful look into the frequently explored world of vampires. Absolutely not for everybody, this is a film that many will mark down as one of their yearly favourites while others mark it down as one of the years hardest watches, for everyone else they will be solely on the fence not accepting an invite to either threshold.3 blood popsicles out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a thinking movie, not a sit-back-relax-eat-popcorn date movie.Look for the images and themes of black and white, light and dark. Hint: note Ava's clothing.You are lead to think about things, and smacked in the face by declarations such as the usual 'I'm ancient and tired of life' or 'only music holds new joys for me'.Detroit's decadent - in both senses of the word - structures play a significant role. Very thrilling for those of us who live in the decaying "Rust Belt".Loved Tilda's line of 'Well, THAT was visual'.This is a quiet and dark movie. No horror like vomiting blood, just the quiet of horror of "You. Drank. (character's name)." and you know what this means for all the people still in that room.You wonder to yourself things like "Why is she living here, and not there?" and "Why do they wear gloves" and you are not handed the answers. You discover them for yourself.Loved the yin and the yang of Tilda and Tom curled together in bed. Their positioning in all bed scenes is very evocative of the plot.And there's no overt sex scenes, but boy, did it get my motor running, especially when the two leads danced together.Tilda's hair alone is worthy of mention. Sometimes it's like she's a lioness. Sometimes it's like she's got the hair of a kabuki doll, sometimes she looks like a Victorian bisque porcelain doll. And sometimes she looks like a fried mummy. All the basic hair and makeup, just subtly tweaked.And the subtle changes to both of their faces when they're hungry. LOVED it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A beautifully crafted film but I did at times find the leads a tad irritating. Their portrayal as artistic immortals could also be summarised as two strung out hipster English Lit undergrads go searching for a good fix. Wacky younger sister turns up, hardly anything happens as a result.After a while they just came across as pretentious. I enjoyed it all the same however due to the excellent cinematography and soundtrack.Excellent performances all round I just thought that a film concerned with the emotional effects of immortality was overall lacking in maturity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different kind of vampire film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With this film I have officially popped my Jim Jarmusch cherry, to use a slightly vulgar euphemism. Other than my general awareness of Jarmusch as a luminary in the indie film world, I wasn't sure what to expect. Now having seen this, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. While not as fast-paced and narrative-driven as most of the movies that I'm usually drawn to, it had a laconic and meandering quality that allowed me to immerse myself in the world it created. It was laconic, meandering, esoteric, sensual and a whole other host of adjectives I could use. The cinematography was beautiful; the music was ethereal and trance-like; the dialogue was deep, erudite and offered insight on a variety of subjects.At this point, I suppose I could describe the a plot a little, but it wouldn't really do the film any justice since it was a lot more than a mere story. The two central characters, Adam and Eve (Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton), are two vampires who have been around for centuries. Eve lives a simple life in Tangiers with her friend Marlowe (John Hurt), while Adam is living the life of a hermit in Detroit and does his best to stay away from the "zombies" (what he calls regular people). He also composes music and collects rare instruments, which he obtains with the help of Ian (Anton Yelchin). The basic portrayal of vampires in this film is not unlike what most people would consider a "hipster." In particular, Adam has a preference for older, finer things rather than newfangled technology, an analog person in an increasingly digital world. In a way, despite being a vampire he is probably more in touch with humanity than we are, and since he's essentially ageless he has a perspective that humans will never have. This, in my opinion, is the most important and worthy observation in the entire film, that we as a species should take the time to slow down and enjoy the finer things in life instead of being "go, go, go" all the time. In her small but important role as Eve's sister Ava, Mia Wasikowska gives an embodiment of this tendency. In general, the characters were well-developed and the acting was excellentStill, the film is not without flaws. For one, despite all the interesting observations, a lot of them felt overcooked and obvious, especially when coming from the mouths of beings that were centuries old. I also wasn't too enamored of the glacial pacing. Granted, the long takes did allow me to fully take in the beautiful sounds and sights, but it still could have been a little slimmer. Also, while not necessarily a negative, the opening sequence made me really dizzy and I didn't exactly recover from it during the course of the film. Overall, I did enjoy the film, if more so on an aesthetic level than any social or cultural commentary. This film is definitely not for everyone. People who like their movies to have more punch or pizazz, or be more narrative-driven, might find this to be a little boring. But for what it's worth, I feel like this was time and money well-spent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting spin on the vampire genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I just feel like all the sand is at the bottom of the hour glass or something."Jim Jarmusch brings a fresh spin to the very familiar vampire tale and delivers a solid and unique film that is unlike any other from the genre. Only Lovers Left Alive will stand alone considering it lacks the horror and action elements that the classic vampire films always introduce, and it also avoids the romantic clichés as well. It is an existential vampire film where you have two very distinct characters. On the one hand there is Tom Hiddleston's character who has been around for centuries and is living in Detroit along with his growing music collection. He has grown weary with the way humans (or as he calls them: zombies) are living and has this nostalgic sense of the past, which explains why he collects several instruments from the early 1900's. He seems to be depressed and simply disillusioned towards the modern world. On the other hand, his wife played by Tilda Swinton is living in Tangier, and she continues to enjoy the basic things in life. She loves to read and seems to have adapted well to the new world. When she realizes that her husband is getting depressed she decides to travel to Detroit to see if she can cheer him up. Most of the film focuses on Hiddleston's existential crisis and serves as an excuse for Jarmusch to talk about art and culture. Many people might find this pretentious, but it works because you are reminded that these characters have been living for centuries and have actually met some of these artists and scientists they are referring to. The way in which Jarmusch builds these characters is also fascinating. The idea of the vampires having this sort of rockstar look to them is great and the way they seem to get high when they drink blood was also a very clever touch. There is no action here because these vampires aren't feeding off people, they simply have their resources for buying blood. It's the small moments that work extremely well in the film and the performances are fantastic. Hiddleston and Swinton are perfectly cast for their roles and both share an incredible chemistry on screen. They've been together for centuries so there is no tension in the relationship and they read each other perfectly. However when Swinton's smaller sister (Played by Mia Wasikowska) shows up things begin to get interesting. Wasikowska is also great in this film and she does a convincing job playing this immature and pain in the neck little sister. There are also some strong supporting performances from John Hurt and Anton Yelchin. The cast is excellent in the film and with the strong script they all shine in this unique indie movie. I went into it knowing almost nothing about the film and I think it is the best way to approach it because the world created by Jarmusch is quite interesting. I had heard a lot about the director, but this was the first time I actually saw a film of his and I'm surprised I enjoyed it so much because I don't consider myself a fan of the genre and I do tend to find existential films pretentious at times, but here it works. It is very elegant, cool, and stylish.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A love story for the ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adam &amp; Eve are vampires. They have been lovers for centuries. They have been apart for awhile but have reunited in Detroit(!) for some romance. Because vampires don't like the day light this is a good excuse for some superb night time photography - first in Tangiers where Eve has been hanging out with Christopher Marlowe played by John Hurt. There is also some beautiful night time photography of Madrid later but the bulk of the movie takes place in Detroit. Much needed comic relief is provided by Mia Wasikowska as Eve's kid sister who shows up uninvited. Correct me if I'm wrong but I don't remember Mia Wasikowska doing comedy before. But she practically steals the movie from Tilda Swinton &amp; Tom Hiddleston. For a vampire movie there is not much violence or horror. Instead it is a tender love story of two people who happen to be different from the rest of us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Only Lovers Left Alive" is kind of an anti-vampire movie. It embraces aspects of the vampire genre like how vampires can't go out in sunlight, have super fast reflexes, and live forever. However, it moves away from some of the silly aspects. Jim Jarmusch does a good job of setting up how a vampire could survive in the world. He takes his time and shows us instead of tells us.Jarmusch's "Only Lovers Left Alive" takes its characters seriously and has great performances from Tom Hiddleston as Adam and Tilda Swinton as Eve. Their names are obvious Biblical references, but the film doesn't really build on it. Hiddleston and Swinton embrace their characters and get under their skin. They know how these characters think and move. They feel old even though they look young and you feel their love for each other. What's nice about this film is that it plays with the vampire genre. The film debunks vampire myths and focuses more on what it is like to be a vampire than all the violence, romance, and gore so many vampire films get caught up in. We see a cheesy French Dracula film and the characters laugh at humans (or what they call zombies). There are many jokes about historical figures from Shakespeare to Schubert. It's a nice blend of these humorous elements and serious characters.Jarmusch gives the film a minimalist, vintage, and indie style. The film benefits from Carter Logan and Jozef van Wissem's Gothic score. Jarmusch knows how to blend film and music so well. You can see this within the first 15 minutes of the film as the camera spins and fades between stars, a record player, Eve, and Adam. Music unites these characters. Adam and Eve's love and their music has endured time and has withstood it. Maybe the opening is trying to show how music is a way to the stars or eternity. Maybe it is trying to show how Adam and Eve are star crossed lovers and how much they have endured. Maybe both. The first half of the film is like a week in the life of these vampires and what they do. The second half tries to spice the story up, but it doesn't always seem necessary. Affonso Gonclaves' editing and Jarmusch's style keeps us engaged as we follow Adam and Eve. The story has plot holes and needs more explaining (like how Adam has so much money and why Adam and Eve are separated at the beginning). The film would have benefited from a closer attention to the story, but the film makes up for it with its style and strong performances from Hiddleston and Swinton.Jim Jarmusch's "Only Lovers Left Alive" is a unique addition to the vampire genre that deserves more attention than other vampire films. It's a nice blend of Jarmusch's minimalist style with Gothic music that both embraces and plays with the vampire genre. Although it doesn't have a strong story, it has a hypnotic spell that kept me engaged and invested in the characters.</fullReview>

The movie is not about amazing and powerful creatures of the night, but explores what happens when you have lived for centuries: it shows just a short period in this couple's live and you get the feeling that it doesn't really matter what happens now because many things have happened before and will happen afterwards. Time is slow and meaningless for vampires.It's beautifully shot and performed, the characters really act like they've been married for a long time, not like madly in love teenagers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim Jarmusch is back with an extremely enjoyable film about a centuries old relationship between a pair of vampires. It's not your typical done-to-death gory, bloodsucking vampire flick but it does remain true to the stereotypical vampire films with its dark, sexy and romantic tone. Wonderful performances from the entire cast Tilda Swinton, Tom Hiddleston, Mia Wasikowska, John Hurt and Anton Yelchin. Particularly the chemistry between Tilda and Tom and the clash of characters between Tom and Mia. The film contains brilliant imagery and rich photography, also it is set entirely at night leaving a mysterious, dark and calm tone. The film has a very slow pace but I believe it didn't drag on at all contrary to what most reviewers believe, I think the pace was inherent to the film. Hilarious dry humour and snappy retorts make up for the lack of dialogue. I highly recommend this treat of a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this movie starts off really well, drawing you into the character of a depressed musical vampire, (boo hoo) and his fast-reading girlfriend who lives on the other side of the planet. I was just waiting for this to turn into a blood-fest, or, well anything to happen really. But it didn't. The first hour seemed to be building up to something... Then the second hour drags on and the film ends. An interesting view of the long, boring life of a vampire, it certainly doesn't make being an undead blood-lover look appealing, they are more like junkies than the exciting, romantic view of vampires seen (almost) everywhere else. It certainly doesn't make a second viewing appealing either. If you like slow films which are basically all about the characters with no real events then this is for you! Pretty dull.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not like the other Vampire films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everybody already made a vampire movie, so why not me Jim Jarmusch must have thought. Of course these are more Rock&amp;Roll/Hipster vampires. They never use the word vampire in the entire film, but they do call the humans 'Zombies'. The vampires here conduct themselves more realistically then most movie vamps: they don't kill humans but just get hospital blood on the black market and avoid social contact (people would notice they don't get older) as much as possible. They come of a bit bourgeoisie as they complain about the state of humanity and obviously think themselves better although they too were once humans. They fill their days making art (=psychedelic music) or consuming it (=reading books) and collecting stuff (like vintage Guitars). Maybe this all doesn't sound too interesting but thanks to the excellent performances of Swinton &amp; Hiddleston combined with beautiful cinematography and set design it does provide solid entertainment. So recommended but don't expect it to be like the other vampire films (in this case that's a good thing).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film that offers artsy scenes and a stable relaxed mood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie brings us to focus on the romance between the hominis nocturna Adam and Eve, which has span for centuries. At the start of the movie they are living separately due to a past incident. Adam lives in Detroit while Eve resides in Tangiers, Morocco. Eve then comes to reunite with Adam, despite their friend Kit advising her about a strange dream about her sister Eva. Eve tells Adam about her also having a dream about Eva and a few days later Eva crashes in uninvited. Being sloppy in her lifestyle, Eva soon makes a mistake of sucking dry Ian, Adam's human "friend" and supplier of rare and odd requirements. The two then kicks Eva out and soon after are flying back to Tangiers.The base of the story is just common fantasy on vampires mixed with common romance. But then the mixture provides a truly different result from the already popular vampire flicks like Twilight. This movie expose the consequences of such actions if vampires choose to remain anonymous, and if there's a mishap in that lifestyle. The Eva episode is just a great addition to the whole story that serves as a great change driver. There are many nice depictions of myth-related things about vampires here. Some are reinvention of the old ones such as wooden stakes, while some are nice depictions of the established attributes such as blood drinking.The great thing about this movie is that the mood can be maintained stable all through. It's quite a slowed down and relaxed mood that keeps you not at all tense or horrified. It's a bit ironic considering the main characters are vampires with the basic need of human blood. The great mood is preserved so well by having all scenes shot at night time on deserted times with few people about. This is still felt even on the Tangiers scenes and the club scenes where there more people.The use of the props is a great job, especially on the earlier guitar scene. The scene is great in showcasing great guitars and some story they have. References about music and literary is also a great work in making the movie more artsy. The depiction of Adam's room as full string instruments and recording gears, and also Eve's room as full of books and literatures, all being as depicted as rather dim, messy but very artsy rooms is a great magnet to attract the eyes of keen art enthusiasts.The acting is just great. Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton did a great job in cooling down for their characters, compared to their recent roles as Loki in Thor: The Dark World (2013) and Mason in Snowpiercer (2013) which are highly sanguine characters. Anton Telchin did a great job in depicting a rock'n roll guy, especially had a great help by having a heavy yet funny voice as his. Mia Wasikowska is also good with her rather short role. So was John Hurt and Jeffrey Wright.The final verdict from me is a solid 8 out of 10 score from me and a definite yes for a recommendation to go and see it in the movies. It won't be a waste of your time and money. Though be warned, this isn't an action or horror movie, LOL.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Though not the best vampire film out there, remember the sub-genre still is in recovery thanks to all the young adult novel adaptations.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing Tom Hiddleston in Thor: The Dark World, I decided to consider myself a fan of his and track his career. Making this the first movie I sought out just because he was in it, though the addition of Mia Wasikowska, Anton Yelchin, and Jeffrey Wright surely didn't hurt. And what I found after watching this film was a very odd sort of film in which the vampires hardly took themselves seriously, and in doing so presented a film which overall seemed, just OK.Characters &amp; StoryAdam (Tom Hiddleston), upon first meeting, seems like a drearier version of Lestat from the Queen of the Damned movie. He is a man highly interested in music, primarily those of the string variety, and lives in an abandoned area of Detroit in which it seems, at first, his only contact with the outside world is this "Zombie," what he calls humans, named Ian (Anton Yelchin). But, as we soon discover, despite this lonesome life he seemingly lives, in which suicide is tempting, he does have a wife in Eve (Tilda Swinton) and a sort-of sister in law named Ava (Mia Wasikowska).As for the story, its sole focus is the romance of Adam and Eve, of which Eve is the older of the set and seemingly she is almost as much a doting mother as Adam's lover. She is the one who talks him out of suicide, reminds him of the vivaciousness life can have, and tries to be as supporting as a woman can be. However, Ava's return in their life shakes things up, and forces them to leave Detroit for Morocco. A place which, unfortunately for them, holds some very somber news waiting for them.PraiseSomething I really admired about the film is that it poked fun at the idea of someone living for centuries, much less a vampire, without becoming campy in the process. For example, there are running jokes throughout the film on how between Adam and Marlowe (John Hurt), a friend of Eve's, that they have both contributed to some of the greatest creative works in history. Be it the work of Schubert, of which Adam gave music to, or Marlowe saying he vicariously used Shakespeare to get his work out there, there are a lot of silly moments which got the audience I watched the film with to chuckle.Also, add on that Swinton, despite the gloomy performance of Hiddleston, brought quite a bit of life to the movie. She, without a doubt, is an excellent character actress and as much as Hiddleston, at first, had a Lestat appeal, Swinton's Eve seems like something Anne Rice would wish she created. She is amusing, lovable, and yet has a taste of fearsomeness when it is called for. And with Hiddleston as a lover, the two make for quite a cute couple and, though their romance isn't that physical, you can tell it is because it has evolved from that point to where they are to each other what lessens the burden of eternity.CriticismHowever, let me say that sometimes this film did feel like it went on far too long. For one, there is really no conflict in the film what so ever. It feels almost like a reality show in which we watch Adam lounge around, go out to a local hospital and give Dr. Watson (Jeffrey Wright) a quick fright before he gets his blood in exchange for money, and other really mundane tasks. Then, even when him and Eve are united, while there is some interesting scenes between the two, things lack excitement. Which seemingly was to be corrected by Ava showing up, but almost as soon as she arrives she is gone, and we are left with this boring old couple once more. Making this 2 hour movie a real pain in the tail bone.Overall: TV ViewingDespite it being a tad boring, especially toward the end, I don't think this is at all a bad movie. The main issue here is that this film lacks any type of conflict, outside of Ava's arrival. Then, even with that, the situation is handled without any issue to the point it feels like this film has nothing to really offer you. Yes, the dialog is comical, and Swinton and Hiddleston make for a nice couple, but I find it hard to justify paying for a movie which doesn't have any type of oomph to make it stand out, outside of the fact it is a vampire film which doesn't seem written for teen-aged girls. And really, if that is one of the highlights, then it is hard to say this is something you can't just wait to see on DVD or when it comes on one of the various cable, subscriber, or online stations.</fullReview>

I wanted more. It was refreshing to watch a story without the usual vampire rubbish. The most interesting aspect was the overwatch of our cultural and scientific development by these people. Haven't we wondered just how ideas come into being. How some individuals inject new concepts that change the course of history while the rest just wander like 'zombies'. Perhaps there are immortals who try to inspire and guide us but they would need ultimate patience because the 'zombies' just keep on repeating the same mistakes.</fullReview>

Baudrillard Jim Jarmusch's "Only Lovers Left Alive" opens with shots of rotating vinyl records. We're then introduced to group of dejected vampires, all of whom are hiding from a contemporary world deemed to be uncultured, corrupt, primitive and base. Unsurprisingly, these vampires refer to the humans who populate this world as "zombies"; brainless consumers who lack taste, self-reflexivity, any capacity for discernment, and who seem to exist only to gorge on whatever is put before them. The vampires, meanwhile, feast on high art, fine literature and the finest of finery. They have style.Jarmusch's chief vampires are Adam and Eve, played by Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton. Perhaps like Jarmusch himself, they're a pair of hipsters, emblematic of an artistic underground which turns its nose up to cities and civilisations which once held promise but now wallow in "bad taste". When Adam and Eve are not salivating over vintage guitars and fine records, they're suckling on flavoursome human blood. But this blood is becoming contaminated, a contamination which Jarmusch aligns to everything from grubby record producers, to pollution, to the dead-ends and deadlocks of Western capitalism. Ironic for a vampire, Adam thinks everyone and everything else sucks.And so Adam and Eve spend most of Jarmusch's film moaning about the state of the arts, the death of creativity and reminiscing about the many fine philosophers, artists and personalities (though they admit Lord Byron was a "pretentious old bore") they met over the course of their lengthy lives. Meanwhile, new stuff is dismissed. "We've seen all this before," Eve grumbles, encapsulating the film's big joke: vampires as the ultimate world-weary hipsters, old-school connoisseurs whose immortality has granted them the ability to have literally "already seen everything long before you did". Significantly, Adam avoids modern technology, but Eve and her sister Ava (Mia Wasikowska) are hooked on Youtube, web-cams and internet downloads, technology which rubs up against the vampires' retrogressive, archival, hipster attitudes. Ava in particular is hooked on the new. Part of the blip-time generation, and not possessing the restraint and patience of her elders, she's essentially suckered by the pull of contemporary junk food. She dies feasting on tainted human blood.Adam lives in Detroit, recently rendered a wasteland by a global capitalism which turns history into an endless present and which bulldozes all values (and the generational clashes which oft fuelled art) in favour for production and profit. Like Jarmuschs's opening shot of spinning records, what the zombies consume is never "new", just the same old recycled tropes and trends. As the spinning record implies, Jarmusch's film is obsessed with the immobility, stagnation and repetition which exists behind illusions of motion. Things go round and around, but only the same destinations are repeatedly revisited. To the vampires, romantic, amorous and in search of "authenticity", this existence is unbearable. Ironically for a film about the allure of "new art", Jarmusch notoriously plagiarised the script to "Dead Man" from Rudy Wurlitzer and was also sued for plagiarising "Broken Flowers". Early in "Only Lovers Left Alive", Adam listens to "Funnel of Love", a song about being sucked into a spinning, romantic abyss. Adam clings to the past, hiding from the sterility of a white/Anglo/ubiquitous culture which closes in on him like daylight suffocates and kills the vampire. Like the bored depressives of Jarmusch's "Broken Flowers" and "Stranger Than Paradise", Adam resists by barricading himself in private fortresses. But isolation takes its toll; Adam contemplates suicide. He wants out. He wants death! Eva encourages Adam to visit underground clubs and basement rock bands, Gothic places in the middle-of-nowhere where "genuine" art searches for notice like struggling weeds.Like George Romero's early films, "Only Lovers Left Alive" pits the last humans (the lovers, the vampires) against homo-economicus. Unlike Romero, Jarmusch ends on a note of optimism. The West may be dead, but hope exists in the East, in Morocco, Tangiers, where the Third World's efforts at emancipation produce cocktails, arts, movements and moments which temporarily pique Adam's interests. And so like a spooky good-taste machine, or Hollywood talent scout, Adam navigates the shadows of Tangiers, until one song in particular (Hal, by Yasmine Hamdan, a song about the intertwining nature of love, nostalgia and loss) kisses his ears. He moves towards it, like a moth to a flame, and then feasts, devouring it whole. Ironically, it's this drive for consumption which fuels Adam's disenchantment; the vampires, in continually experiencing and so killing the new, propel their own suffering. Everything is eventually co-opted."Only Lovers Left Alive" features fine performances by Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton. They're stylish, well-coiffed and move about like fashion mannequins. Elsewhere Jarmusch tries for a very specific atmosphere ? ethereal, hallucinogenic, lush - but he's not enough of a Sensualist to pull things off. Though his film has been praised for its "mood", this is all second-rate "atmosphere". The film is sharp, stiff, mannered and well composed, where it should perhaps be loose and fleeting, like the shadowy bars and dripping spaces of a Lynch, Wenders, Mann or even someone like late-career Neil Jordan or Michael Curtiz. Resolutely postmodern (and shot like a comic-book or Coen Brothers flick), "Lovers'" form is exactly what its vampires denounce.8/10 - See "A Prairie Home Companion".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's so many film makers and film this days that are overrated by the masses that never heard of Kieslowski, Kusturika or Rohmer. The wide array of shallow films makes a simple love story with the slow melancholic narrative of Jaramusch, looks like a gem.If you found movies like "The tree of life" to fit the category of Art Cinema you'd be probably at home and safe with Jaramusch dark and well produced -and flawlessly performed- Only Lovers Left Alive.Vampires are humanized and warmly understood to the cadence of 70's guitar strolls -as usually the case with this director-. Personally i'd recommend this film for a rainy afternoon in good company and coffee to keep you awake.It's definitely an achievement to make cinema that does not goes straight into the masses with sex, violence or cheap tricks; sadly, that's not enough to take things to the next level and this film, as others i've seen from this director, drags for ever lacking of a better story and a new language for cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not your typical vampire film whatsoever as there's no action or horror. It simply deals with the malaise and eccentricities that manifest in the personalities of those that live forever. The sets are terrificly authentic, I'm sure an immortal really would live among decades of clutter and odd collections.The things the filmmaker chose to focus on and the atmosphere were all a bit skewed as if it were filmed by some world weary old vampire that finds interest in odd things that we mortals would overlook.Quite worth your time if you're looking for something different, atmospherically compares to Let the Right One In.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vampire lovers embody death of human purity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two readings In Jim Jarmush's title. (i) Only lovers are still alive. To the centuries-old passionate vampire couple everyone else is a zombie. Or "an illiterate philistine zombie" like Shakespeare, according to vampire Christopher Marlowe (John Hurt), the true author of the canon and the first immortal we see die. Not to be able to love is a form of death. (ii) Our vampire couple are the only lovers left alive. The creeping impurity of blood gives even their immortality a shelf life. Adam (Tom Hiddleston) and Eve (Tilda Swinton) evoke the first humans but embody the last. Their last drink, that closes the film, is only a temporary respite, before the contamination dooms them as it did Marlowe.The pallid palette and the ruined ghastly Detroit and crumbling Tangiers cityscapes suggest this film is an elegy to a dying ? if not already dead ? humanity. To cite two of Eve's books, our vampire couple are the Quixoitic dreamers struggling against civilization's Endgame. As Adam observes, we're so obsessed with our dwindling and contaminating oil that we're unaware of the greater imminent lack of our most pervasive element, water. There the human and the global merge. This is the first vampire film coloured green.Eve's equally palindromic sister Ava (Mia Wasikowska) personifies another kind of contamination, an unthinking, destructive selfishness that places everything around her as well as herself at mortal risk. She casually destroys the Gibson guitar that Adam prizes with religious as well as antiquarian and artistic devotion. He values so much, she nothing. Adam and Eve appear to have lived so long they have learned everything, to wit, their Latinate flora and fauna. Lacking their dedication to their world, Ava lives only to indulge her moment. She can't love her Ian, only mortally drink him. A palindrome can be either complete self- absorption (Ava) or a continuous loop (Eve).Adam's purity extends to refusing to publish his music. But somehow it slips out against his wishes, against his protectiveness. That prefigures the futility of the lovers' attempts to survive, the last purity in a growingly contaminated world. Adam too "is too good to be famous." But as the corruption in science and humanity spreads Adam finds his summary metaphor in a technology even older than his antique stethoscope: "I just feel like all the sand is at the bottom of the hour glass or something." The lovers' longevity as well as their love makes their passing all the more tragic ? and symptomatic. For more see www.yacowar.blogspot.com.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An artistic take on vampirism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this is yet another story about vampires, you will not find it generic nor mediocre. It is a film that redeems the genre with its seriousness as it touches existential issues and interweaves them with popular culture - two vampires being in love across centuries, one of them a romantic role model, idealistic poet, musician, artist, who keeps art underground, away from mass of zombies, what he uses to call people, and resides in abandoned Detroit - a perfect spot for a loner like this. The other is this alien-like woman, knowledgeable, well-read, and intriguing, who spends her life in Tanger in Morocco, indulging in exotic culture and mystical atmosphere of this place. Their relationship reflects the particle entanglement theory; they witness the progress and deterioration of civilisations and peacefully coexist with people living off blood obtained from shady sources until the moment comes when they run out of other possibilities than hunt. The film is a beautifully crafted romance, with outstanding performance by Tilda Swinton, brilliant music and cinematography that leaves you with some strange feeling of longing and makes you think about all these little details, metaphors, and references throughout it. 8 out of 10, very recommended for a night with a bottle of wine.</fullReview>

Filmmaker Jim Jarmusch's dourly droll look at modern-day vampirism finds its way into the uniquely hip relationship in the undead coupling of Adam and Eve (Hiddleston and Swinton perfectly matched in angst and anomie) who find themselves facing mortality (and the lack of inspiration) as a rock musician and his muse. Wonderfully off-beat and clever new turns of the mythology (referring to the living as 'zombies' too wit). Hurt is a hoot as Christopher Marlowe (!) One of the year's gems.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only Lovers bleeds new life in the vampire genre with an eye on modern decadence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only Lovers Left Alive, a film by Jim Jarmusch. Review by Frank AntonioVigOnly Lovers follows the vampires Adam, a reclusive brooding rock star donned by Tom Hiddleston, and Eve, a lovable hippie, starred by Tilda Swinton. It's poetic plot, candid wit, intellectual depth, and subtext begs the questions, can love exist and endure in a modern world, is pop culture leading to a decay of the human existence, is mediocrity replacing genius and enlightenment, and does it all really matter? Our vampires live worlds apart but clearly in love and in need for one another. As two timeless bohemians, they wallow through the changing times and are at odds with the zombies - humans easily led into the decay of pop culture. Director Jim Jarmusch teaming with cinematographer Yorick Le Saux uses the moving camera to invite us into a world of modern decadence and moral ambivalence. The gorgeous set, soft romantic lighting, hypnotic soundtrack, and the use of subtle intellectual wit, all contribute to this piece of art. From the opening shot of what could be a starry night sky, the screen circles endlessly, fading into a 45-vinyl record, then fades into the two lovers lying, spinning, yet, still miles apart, signaling their desperate endless connection. The pulsating music ranges from rockabilly Wanda Jackson to deep soul jams, Gothic rock, Middle Eastern reflections, and straight up rock and roll that all harks back to the birth of tribes and civilization with Moroccan overtones. (The directors band Squrl largely contributed to the soundtrack)The streets of Detroit are in decay. Tangier is exotic but dangerous. But it is the teasers, subtext, in variable strains, that set fuses and are on the verge of imploding; the sister, Ava, a careless vampire, played by Mia Wasikowska, who comes and disrupts their lives, the helpful Ian that appears to be black marketing Adam's music, the gorgeous singing beauty who seems to have the makings to steal Adam's heart from Eve, the alter ego Alpha-male partaking in the same antiquity buying threatens Adam. All these events are given just the right amount of tension to ignite our own recognition - relating easily to there familiar tugs - without bogging us down and keeping us from the main plot. It is done in subtle interaction using the familiar moments to jettison within our psyche. The Mise en scene is aflame with rare books, priceless art, collectible instruments, ancient gadgets, and still other earthly relics, as our vampires lay around during the days as supreme beings, wise above the crass of humans. Caveats of Jarmusch interest in science, guitars, Motown, fungus, vintage, and art play omens and philosophical anchors throughout. John Hurt's plays Christopher Marlowe, a vampire friend of Eve's. Marlowe was the Elizabethan tragedian who some believed penned most of Shakespeare's work. (As well a Jarmusch belief) His death marks the turn in which our two protagonist lose there clean supply of blood and face their own demise.In the end the wit, the humor, the horror - all well intended and revealed - is turned on its head. The two sophisticated lovers above the grid, wrestle with tripping into decay as well, having to kill for food. Witness an artist in control of his craft as Jim Jarmusch takes another step in the world of artistic filmmaking and can be seen using a buffet of instruments from his arsenal with precision. This is a great thoughtful film that happens to use the vampire genre to raise the questions of love and culture in the modern world. Borrowing from a line in this film that you will find quite humorous, 'Go drink some Jarmusch.' That's my take, Frank Antonia Vig Hope you like it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is artistic in every dimension. The score is almost hypnotic, and matches the extraordinarily detailed costume and sets used in the film. Because of the brilliance of the script, and the outstanding acting from Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddleston, the film becomes the real world and as you come out of the theatre, you feel cheated almost because you had been made to feel like you lived in this perfect reality when you certainly do not. You stand there waiting for Adam's music to play, and when it doesn't, you have to kick yourself back into ordinary-life mode which contrasts so entirely with the world you had just been in that the transition is painful.</fullReview>

I was swept of my feet...The melancholy mood of the beginning took me back to the Film Noir genre and the hippie era.The movie floats on air, the chemistry of Adam and Eve, their history, the age in their eyes and words, while acting and dancing like young lovers..The mood changes for a while, when Eve's sister show up.. she is like a teenager without a clue.The score helps with the feeling of detached bliss with a sad afterthought.If you think this review is too trippy, don't watch the movie..

I was totally surprised, actually I have seen other works by Jarmusch, liked some but really loved this one.The acting is great, Tilda and Tom seems to be the perfect couple for old fashioned lovers Eve and Adam. Ava, played by Mia is no different than a regular teenager these days. John is so good acting Marlowe the lonely.What makes this movie better is its story. If you can read the subtext, this is a very entertaining, dark but funny (in a sarcastic way) yet a critical film.Finally, the music totally fits the movie even completes it.So if you want to spend a lazy day and just relax without thinking much, this is not your movie as it is not very clear and easy to understand instead it makes you feel like solving a puzzle.</fullReview>

I cannot recall having seen a movie the with such an emerging force - the music is hypnotizing and the photography rich and dark. I literally fell in - only 10 min into the movie - and re-emerged 100 min later a different person. Seeing Tild Windown and Mia Wasikowska side by side is a quite a treat! The music is magic - there is so much to hear (Lute play, Gnawa, minimalist rock, ...) and is supports the movie all along those 123 minutes.Great movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The flatness of modern commodification</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Only Lovers Left Alive" Jarmusch puts John Hurt in the role of Christopher Marlowe, nowadays a reclusive writer living in Tangier. Seems Chris was the real writer of HAMLET and other works attributed to William Shakespeare. The script goes differently, according to Jarmusch in his latest flick. Jim is both the script writer and director. As we learn inn "Only Lovers Left Alive", Marlowe faked his reported early bar room fight to the death to conceal his real being as vampire and, the literary genius feeding Shakespeare his plays. This is an old theory,not the vampire part, surrounding the true authorship of the great Shake's plays and poems. To be sure, there are other theories in with regard to the authorship of RICHARD III along with the others; but this is Jim playing with that notion.According to Jim Jarmusch, it is now 500 or so years on and Marlowe is still alive in Tangier. He is still writing, still in a kind of self- imposed exile, much like Paul Bowles was in the Tangier of his time. And like Bowles, Marlowe the vamp has mentored a local Moroccan writer trying to make his way up into the world of recognised writers."Nothing is original. Steal from anywhere that resonates with inspiration or fuels your imagination. Devour old films, new films, music, books, paintings, photographs, poems, dreams, random conversations, architecture, bridges, street signs, trees, clouds, bodies of water, light and shadows. Select only things to steal from that speak directly to your soul. If you do this, your work (and theft) will be authentic. Authenticity is invaluable; originality is non- existent. And don't bother concealing your thievery - celebrate it if you feel like it. In any case, always remember what Jean-Luc Godard said: "It's not where you take things from - it's where you take them to."MovieMaker Magazine #53 - Winter, January 22, 2004 " &#x2015; Jim JarmuschAnd then we have the two main protagonists: the lovers left alive after centuries have rolled by. And, spending their time amongst the most imaginative, creative minds of whatever era they happened to have lived through. Of course, their names are Adam (played by Tom Hiddleston) and Eve (Tilda Swinton). Oh yes, Adam and Eve expelled from the Garden due to their tasting of God's forbidden fruit from the Tree of Knowledge. No, not quite that pair, but what a pair! These two have been married since the mid 19th century. They are vampires and both know Marlowe. Eve lives in Tangier and regularly commiserates with Marlowe. Adam's digs are in Detroit. He lives the lone life of the brooding artist. When Adam gets suicidal enough to purchase a special hard wooden bullet he can shoot into his heart, Eve, who does not know about his bullet purchase, senses it after a video phone call. Eve is not only sensuous, she's a master sensor when it comes to almost anything, including inanimate objects. Just a touch of say a violin will bring out its history. After a super sonic re-reading of her personal library,she gathers enough books to fit into her two suitcases and takes the first night flight (mai oui) out of Tangier to Paris and from there by red-eye to Detroit. The film is sprinkled with wise asides and humour; but at the centre of all the dialogue is the notion that something is awry on the planet. What's rotten in Denmark and across the globe is, to our dear vampires eyes, the utter lack of appreciation amongst the 'zombies' for their own creative geniuses in the arts and sciences. But this is an old problem, Eve observes as she tries to quiet the suicidal impulses of Adam. It's just that Adam sees and attempts to demonstrate to Eve, through the empty architecture of Detroit, a metaphor for where the human race is taking the planet now that it has industrialised nature. In a way, Adam senses the commodification, the cheapening emptiness of all that surrounds him as humankind takes itself down the road to environmental collapse. But Eve won't have it. She sees the decay, but points to nature's irrepressible life force. Detroit will come back, she says. It has water and where there's water life will reappear. Adam and Eve are intellectuals. They observe and create as their very good friends amongst the human community have done: Newton, Galileo, Shelley, Wollstonescraft, Schubert, Byron (although he was a pompous ass, according to Adam). Their portraits adorn Adam's wall. According to Adam, imagination is dying in the modern age and he and Eve and one assumes Marlowe are surrounded by 'zombies', meaning most of humanity. But, in case you thought all vampires are creative, sensitive geniuses, Jarmusch throws in a visit by Eve's little sister, Ava (Mia Wasikowska), a vamp from LA--zombie central, according to Adam. Ava may be hundreds of years old; but she acts very much like a spoiled, contemporary teen consumer. As soon as she arrives in Detroit, she begins appropriating everything which she takes a fancy to: Adam's precious music collection; his stash of disease free O negative blood and even his supplier friend Ian (Anton Yelchin), the one who gets him musical instruments and as mentioned, his customised wooden bullet.It might be worth having a toke before seeing "Only Lovers Left Alive". The music in this movie is fantastic and what the heck, Adam, Eve, Ava and Christopher are all indulging in O negative.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A magnificent piece of cinema and symbolism" - Only Lovers Left Alive (2013)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Jim Jarmusch's new motion picture, Only Lovers Left Alive, are Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddleston two vampires, who share a love that has lasted thousands of years, but with the arrival of her uncontrollable sister, their relationship is disrupted. At the beginning of the film, the two eternal lovers are living apart from each other. Swinton's Eve lives in Tangiers, where she walks the city at night to meet up with another vampire for bleed and Facetimes with Hiddleston's Adam in Detroit, who is an underground musician and depressed - again. He has grown tired of mankind and how they destroy the world they live in, and does not see a light at the end of the tunnel anymore. Eve decides she has to pull her vampire-husband out his downwards spiral and travels back to him. They continue their relationship as if they have never been apart, playing chess, enjoying some frozen blood on a stick and talking about music, the Latin names of plants and animals and very dead scientists. Unfortunately, Eve's uncontrollable little sister Ava, deliciously portrayed by Mia Wasikowska, pays them a visit and disrupts the fun. Only Lovers Left Alive is about vampires, but in a good way. Eve and Adam are the most human vampires I have ever soon on screen. They breathe, their hearts beat, they do not sparkle in the sun (thank the Lord) and they have real personalities. Eve is the most outgoing of the two, showing initiative, taking care of everything and encouraging Adam to pursue his purpose in his very, very long life: music. Swinton gives Eve an otherworldly beauty, with softly but confidently spoken words and a silent intelligence. She is the yang to Adam's yin. Hiddleston portrays the melancholic, depressed, poetic and surprisingly funny vampire Adam fantastically. There is a certain emptiness in his dark view of the world when he is alone in Detroit, but when Eve comes back to him, Adam becomes whole again and that transformation is beautiful to watch. What I really loved about Only Lovers Left Alive is the symbolism. In the entire film, the shape of a circle is integrated in the set or the costumes or the background. Whether it is the spinning vinyl on Adam's turntable in the opening scene, of the logo of a cab company in Tangiers, or the cut- outs in Adam's leather gloves or the full moon in Detroit's night sky: there are circles everywhere. Very subtly, they represent the idea of infinite lovers. Eve and Adam are continuously circling around each other, never breaking their path - and the entire film represents this idea. The costumes also play a great part in representing the idea of the eternal love of Eve and Adam. I love how Eve's clothing is a representation of Adam's and the other way around, only hers are white and his are black. This contrast, but also compatibility, is made even more clear by the fact that Eve has long, silvery blond hair and Adam's manes are dark. They make a great vampire yin and yang, belonging together forever. It is just the two of them and when Eve's sister Ava arrives at their idyllic love nest, she clearly is the third wheel. Eve's and Adam's clothing is uniform, while Ava is a strange mix of colors, patterns, funny stockings and vintage heels - which sets her very much apart from the two lovers. Mia Wasikowska is funny, yet adorable, as the wild Ava, being both childlike and a thousand years old. Jarmusch has succeeded in creating a strangely funny, sexy and artistic film about two eternal lovers, who happen to be vampires. He has a very original take on the vampire-love-genre, with two main characters who are as compatible as yin and yang. Only Lovers Left Alive is a magnificent piece of cinema and symbolism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In its fiction is utterly genuine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And here lies a vampire world so much different than the one we are used to. Two lonely creatures, drifting through the years, through the centuries. They share a deep love for each other and a deep respect for the world they live in. Their names? Adam and Eve, in an ironic reference in religion, one of the few that follow. They are in this world for centuries, they have met historic personalities, they have influenced some of them, they are no random souls. They are maybe the last - or the first - of their kind, lost and drifted in a world where everywhere is constant danger. Through many references in literature, science, history, music and film those creatures make a meaning out of themselves. It is such a poetically beautiful movie. The harmony that flows within, the deep and unspoken love it vibrates. Those melancholic creatures face the same - almost - problems with any other human being. She is a unique optimist with features 'out of this world'(how beautiful Tilda is) and He is a talented creature, tired of his own self and solitude and blessed with a deep view for the world of music. You will not see many characters in this story. Adam and Eve meet with one of their mentors, Marlowe, an old figure (based on the true Christopher Marlowe who is considered to have written some of Shakespeare works according to historian James S. Shapiro) who eventually will drift away. Eve's younger sister, Ava, will disturb their peace by invading in their world, something that is obvious she does once in a century (which is often). Their relationship will be tested as Adam in not a big fan of Ava, while Eve loves and appreciates her little sister, even if she is over the top. The truth is that this story doesn't have a beginning or an end. It catches a part of those creatures' lives into this world. They are both a bit retired from life and don't have so much contact with humans as they used to. Adam has given up hope on the human race and his suicidal attitude worries Eve deeply. Written and directed by Jim Jarmusch, the talented independent American filmmaker who has a devoted cinephile audience whatever he does, "Only Lovers Left Alive" is a poetic story of two vampires. The melodic, psychedelic music in the scenes and the slow sequences reveal an auteur with artistic depth and a will to create everything ritually. From how they drink blood (never violently taken anymore), how they make love, how they walk and behave, how they see the world. The time he gives to its characters to evolve, to express their true feelings, works soothingly in the course of the story. "Only Lovers Left Alive" is a genuine art film that shows us where the true meaning of life is, even if you are immortal. This movie has created a constant discussion about the melancholic nature of every human walking in this world, having already a truthful attitude towards everything it deals with. In its fiction is utterly genuine.For more movie critiques check http://mycinematographies.blogspot.nl/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Gothic vampire story by Jarmusch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just wished they went back to this kind of vampire movie making. It is indeed a little bit too cheesy with all the literary information and has a somewhat loose narrative, as others have already remarked. In fact, it seemed to me the story-line remained underdeveloped - lots of loose ends, lots of things that probably were designed to add something to the lore, but eventually remained unexplained. Probably this had something to do with the low budget and the difficulty the director had with getting funding for his project. That being said, it is highly poetic and beautifully shot, as already expected form Jarmusch. Both costume design and make up are perfect, specially the fangs, not overgrown, unnatural or vulgar, as in many modern movies, but discrete and in the 'right' size. Vampires are, after all, supposed to be very discrete beings as any other skilled predator. Sound track is amazing and fits perfectly to the mood the film is trying to set. Finally, Tilda is amazing in her role and one cannot help associating her looks with the vampire in Edward Munch's homonyms painting. Also, I think Adam should most certainly taken to be John Polidori, Byron and Shelley's friend, a doctor as Adam and the writer of one of the most famous vampire stories ever written.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ONLY LOVERS LEFT ALIVE made me swoon. I really don't like Jarmusch's films, in fact, I pretty much detest them. But this film works on every level. So slight but it knows it. So cool but it doesn't seem to be trying. Looks great, sounds great, and smells great. YES! I could smell this film. Tilda Swinton is the heart and soul of the picture. Without her it would not be what it is. She's so jaded, lovely, and optimistic all at once. Overall, ONLY LOVERS LEFT ALIVE is a lovely meditation on the history of consciousness, deep love, real love, and the inability of mankind to appreciate it all. I guess you really do have to live forever to get it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Only Lovers Left Alive" is a film that's both poetic and ironic - it's underground, languid and cool. If you're not on it's wavelength it may just seem slow, but if you relax and give yourself over to its we've-got-all-the-time-in-the-world pacing, you begin to enter its hypnotic stream, and then what a pleasure it becomes. The film deals with love and mortality - the passage of time, what's of value and lasts, and what is just of the moment. There also is a generational theme, embodied in the four vampire characters (relative to vampire years): childhood, adolescence, mature adult, and old age. Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddelston, as Adam and Eve, make a lovely and deeply romantic vampire couple - one for whom endless time has not been wasted - they're philosophical, sophisticated and so much in love. Tilda and Tom are perfection in these roles, their chemistry really holds the film together. John Hurt is the elder vampire mentor, Kit Marlowe, who has seen it all and has described it profoundly in the writings attributed to Shakespeare (a humorous dig at the old bard). After a while, Ava, Eve's impulsive little vampire-sprite of a sister, enters the film like a whirlwind out of L.A. ("Zombie Central") and proceeds to upend Adam and Eve's gentle world. Mia Wasikowska has a hell of a good time playing Ava as a wild, touchy-feely little jungle cat, always hungry, looking for diversion and a means to quench her endless thirst. Where Adam and Eve contemplate eternity, art and science, and a loving connection, Ava demands to be fed and wants to party. Finally, Ava's dangerous urges create a crisis that forces the vampire couple to set on another whole course. "Only Lovers Left Alive" is sensual and delicate with beautiful cinematography and a wonderfully evocative soundtrack. The film is refreshing and unique - it's both contemplative and funny, a welcomed antidote to our ADHD society and all it's endless noise, "full of sound and fury. Signifying nothing".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is quite the brooding, atmospheric, and quite original take on a vampire love story. Twilight compared to this? Please. I wish I'd liked it more, but I feel like I missed a lot of it in a way. It's definitely the ideal film that needs a rewatch. The two leads are great, but Swinton continues to prove why she's the best actress working in the industry at the moment. She's extremely natural, nothing comes off half-baked with her, and even in a similar role she manages to basically act circles around Hiddelston. Regardless, he's pretty good too. Wasikowska is a blast in her short screen time, and the humor is pretty well done. Beware, this is quite the slow-paced film and no doubt many will hate it.</fullReview>

Like who can fly from Tangiers to Detroit like they did in the film, or is Tangiers as romantic as portrayed in the film? Well, never mind, for a horror-romantic plot is not supposed to be realistic anyways, so I will not take that as a minus to this film. I will just ignore it.Otherwise, everything was so cool about this film. Acting, music, cinematography. I really recommend this film. It is different and fresh. Something new on the block.

		<shortDescription>Vampire contemplation of life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Jarmusch achieves excellence in Only Lovers Left Alive. This is the most romantic movie made in decades; Jarmusch truly understands how love is expressed in its most pure form. Adam and Eve are two vampire lover, who live apart, they both understand the world in a different way, but this means that they complete each other; there cannot exist one without another, but this has nothing to do with being physically together, it is more about what do they talk and how much they need to communicate. Jarmusch's cinematography is about contemplation, about creating a world where the most beautiful things are there for you to find them in details. The music composed by SQÜRL band where Jarmusch's band is sublime, it rounds up the whole underground-intellectual vibe of the movie. Finally Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddelston understood exactly what Jarmusch was creating and took acting to another level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Being Immortal Isn't All It's Cracked Up to Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I pretty much adored the premise of "Only Lovers Left Alive," Jim Jarmusch's laconic riff on world-weary vampires.Tom Hiddleston is a brooding musician, dark, gloomy and depressed, a caricature of every brooding musician ever put on screen. The joke is that he's depressed mostly because he's been alive for centuries and has seen mankind's gradual decline into what he perceives to be a now irreversible quagmire. He's like the old grandpa who talks about how much better things were in the good ol' days and laments the youth of today. The fact that he's a vampire is almost beside the point.Tilda Swinton plays his significantly sunnier lover, who lives in Tangiers with best friend Christopher Marlowe (who did write all of Shakespeare's plays after all, by the way) when she's not visiting him in burnt-out Detroit. Most of the film revolves around her trying to cheer him up, something that becomes much more difficult when her reckless vampire sister shows up and proceeds to drive him crazy."Only Lovers Left Alive" moves smoothly along with an uber-cool vibe and the strength of its subtle but always funny premise. In this film, vampires aren't amassed in secret armies plotting to take over mankind. They're instead trying as hard as they can to avoid other humans because they've been around so long they're tired of them. In the vampire world created by Jarmusch, being immortal isn't all it's cracked up to be.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is it like to live forever, but not be able to be in sunshine, and not have a job, and have to rely on mortal humans for things, and always worry about where to get your blood you need to "live" without drawing suspicion to yourself? I loved this movie because it deals with what being a vampire in the modern day would be like. The long, boring, tedious nights. Trying to arrange night-travel to different countries without being caught in the daylight. Seeing a world you once saw as pure and clean become contaminated and dirty.This movie is very well acted and shot, the music is awesome, the dialogue great. However, if you are looking for action and drama and sex, then it isn't for you.The whole story is simple: two vampires, married for centuries but living apart, get back together because the husband is feeling depressed and lonely. The wife travels to a dark and depressed Detroit to console and cheer-up her husband and eventually, her out-of-control sister shows up and causes problems requiring changes. This is the first movie I've seen, however, showing the tedious day-to-day (night-to-night) existence of living forever, but having to hide and not go out into daylight. I dug the movie so much, I watched it again the next night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captivating romanticism of an eternal life robust with cultural references</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Immortal lovers across the millennia reunite in Detroit when one expresses romanticized suicidal intent in Only Lovers Left Alive.Only Lovers Left Alive, written and directed by Jim Jarmusch, is a film for artists, intellectuals and lovers of quiet but creative atmospheric cinema experiences.Adam, Tom Hiddleston, is a troubled suicidally romantic scoundrel and an artist, he is also a vampire. Separated from his lover and soul mate Eve, played by Tilda Swinton, Adam is growing weary of the immortal life as he watched the zombies, mortals, destroying the world and themselves. Adam reaches out to his mate, and noticing his depressive tone, she quickly leaves Tangiers to be at his side in Detroit. Together under the shroud of night, they wax poetic about their many centuries together thanks to their eternal lives, referencing famed and often blasphemous scientists and literary academics who are long gone but were also their friends.Not enough marvelous things can be said of Only Lovers Left Alive. From start to finish, and in every aspect, it is a beautiful, ominous, powerful and haunting film that looks at the real life implications on two souls burdened and liberated by immortality. Jim Jarmusch wonderfully cultivates a film full of depth with constant cultural references, tactile production and stylization, and a complementary escapist soundtrack for a strong and robust cinematic experience. And all of this is thanks in part to the stellar casting of Hiddleston and Swinton as Adam and Eve.There is a quiet to Hiddleston and Swinton in their performances as otherworldly, romantic and knowing creatures. The inherent connection between the two as soul mates Adam and Eve is radiantly transcendent and causes the audience to long for inclusion. The couple draws the audience in with their observational insight to the repetitive happenings of the world and humanity. They act as a portrait of the potentially realistic complexities to eternal life.Only Lovers Left Alive is not a film for everyone and it is very likely that these individuals will loathe this film. This is far superior to and not the vampire film of recent modern days, and Jarmusch makes a deliberate departure from the garbage of Rice and Meyer by regressing the vampire narrative back to its cultural origins. Very little "action" occurs in the film and most of the plot and narrative of the film resides in the dialogue between and character of the main characters. For those appreciators of art, literature and intelligence, Only Lovers Left Alive is for you.Please check out our WEBSITE for all the REVIEWS of recent releases.</fullReview>

Oh, no!Film not as self-indulgent or pretentious as feared.Story of two intellectual vampires, enduring the centuries. Dreamy, drowsy, slow paced, filmed in nighttime Tangier and Detroit. Film raises several points, one being the dire consequences of tainted blood. Dark irony of the food supply being so self destructive. Terrific use of brooding music, conversations delivered in monotone, and the feeblest of lighting to cast an aura of weariness. Definitely worth chasing down, but it is lethargic and demands patience and concentration.Note: for other non-Jarmusch fans (such as myself) this was a nice one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vampires have never really been my "thing." I'll always give stories with them a shot (yes, even when they sparkle, I will at least give them a fair chance) but, usually, they fall short and fail to really grab my interest. However, I really liked the idea of Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton being vampires. They looked?unnaturally right for the parts.While "Only Lovers Left Alive" might not have proved to be my favorite outing for the undead bloodsucker genre, the film is terrifically put together. The cinematography, the editing, the music?they all combine to make a film that is very visually appealing. Even the performances from Hiddleston and Swinton were exceptionally good?but that's not really a surprise from those two. The only thing I really didn't care for with this film was the story. While I wasn't expecting something fast-pace or flashy the film ends up dragging too often and ends up feeling incomplete and in need of a little more development. While it does have a specific direction it is traveling in, it just felt like it wasn't completely focused on that path and it ended up making the film a pretty average affair for me. Besides that, however, the film is pretty good.Hello, neighbor! My name is Rev.

		<shortDescription>Tom and Tilda were perfect, but not enough to carry the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton play vampire lovers Adam and Eve in this film written and directed by Jim Jarmusch.Adam is a musician living in anonymity in Detroit. His long years of living among humans, or "zombies" as he puts it, has left him so jaded, he actually contemplates taking his own life. Eve, his wife, flies all the way from Tangier, where she lives, to lift Adam's spirits. What follows is a few days in the lives of the lovers, and from their casual conversations we glean a sense of what it's like to see the world through immortal eyes.I wanted to like this film, but there really wasn't much to like. Tom and Tilda fit their roles perfectly and their performances were enjoyable, but not enough to carry the entire thing. The story does not go anywhere, and probably the reason why I didn't enjoy it so much was that I was looking for a plot that wasn't there. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against plot less films. They can be great when done right. This one just didn't work for me. Basically, it was two hours of Adam and Eve talking, being cool, drinking blood, Adam sulking, Eve trying to make him feel better. At one point, Eve's mischievous sister, Ava, played by Mia Wasikowska, comes in to stir things up a bit. Adam and Eve's conversations about music, literature, etc. were interesting up to a point, but by the time the film ended I was as jaded as Adam had been in the beginning of the film.It's not a bad film, and I can honestly see how some people would like it. Give this a try if you want to see a different kind of vampire movie. Stay away if you particularly dislike plot less films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jim Jarmusch and vampires</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Jarmusch, an icon of "indie" movies, is back and with a vampire film. However, this is not a horror movie, nor a bloody story, not even a vampire movie for that matter. Adam and Eve are a couple of vampires, though their names is the only thing related to "those" Adam and Eve of the bible. Despite centuries of living, both have quite a different vision of life. Adam is jaded by mankind and modern life, vulgar and with no purpose. Eve, on the other hand, is a romantic that enjoys every experience she can have. When her sister Eva (Mia Wasikowska, "Stoker" Chan-Wook Park, 2013) shows up in their place, she will tear everything apart. Jarmusch has directed some truly cult movies, such as "Ghost Dog" (1999), "Dead Man" (1995) o "Broken Flowers" (2005), and a vampire movie directed by him kept me excited. His is a thoughtful, reflective filmmaking, something I really appreciate. It's interesting to see the intellectual side of an immortal being, and how he reacts to modern life, grotesque and less honorable, so to speak. Rich images and words fill the screen, words that might have truly been spoken by an immortal, so beautiful and poetic they are; that of course, is easier when you have Tom Hiddlestone, "The Avengers"( Joss Whedon 2012) and Tilda Swinton, "The Grand Budapest Hotel " (Wes Anderson, 2014) for such a task. They make their roles absolutely hypnotic. Unfortunately, that's the end of the good news, since Jarmusch abuses of that contemplative pace, and in a given moment, we can anticipate what is going to happen next and are not compelled to keep watching. In order to portray a life eternal and composed, Jarmusch applied those characteristics to the storytelling, which in this case outshines the rest of the product. We do not really care about the main characters and their fate. In addition, this movie sounds familiar. "Kiss of the Damned" (Xan Cassavetes, 2012), deals with quite a similar topic, troublesome sister included. That is a less aesthetic and layered movie than this, but it is way more fluid and compelling, and I enjoyed it much more than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jarmusch's decision to cast Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddleston as cultured star-crossed lovers married for centuries was on point ? I could not imagine anyone else carrying such performances otherwise. The exquisite detail in which we witness the immortal passion and passing frustrations of suave, retro-rock lovers Adam and Eve gives Jarmusch ample chances to weave his signature cinematic style. Everything from the stylish soundtrack, to the surreal photography, to hip-heroin-chic-like performances that mirror the love and longing felt by these two lovers left me wanting more. This is both a cinephile and Swinton or Hiddleston fan treat where every sidelong glance carries a meaning and every drop of blood is given its own unique trail.cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Setting and characters make this one worth a watch for fans of the genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Jarmusch is no longer as prolific as he's been in the past with "Only Lovers Left Alive" being his first movie since 2009. Here he wrote and directed the vampire story of Adam and Eve (gotta admit I cringed a bit with these names) played by Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton. Supporting performances are included by Mia Wasikowska and John Hurt. The former brings some sex appeal and comic relief as a troubled teenager vampire and Hurt plays a father figure and mentor to Swinton's character. A smaller part is played by Anton Yelchin whose death just like the one of Hurt's character add a sad note to the movie as both were crucial figures in the lives of the two protagonists and may have contributed to their overall misery and final decision and shot of the film.The age difference between Hiddleston and Swinton is not really a problem and decent makeup work and Swinton's mysterious aura that's perfect for the role of a vampire create two credible characters and an interesting love story. Also it adds a touch of mystery as Swinton's character's age is probably even harder to guess than her real number of annual rings. Another thing I liked a lot was the overall tone of the film, in particular the idea of vampires dying from contaminated blood bottles. Apart from that we get the usual stuff, like sunrise is the time to go to bed after drunk party nights. Another thing I noticed is how the film actually feels like a good basis for a possible prequel. It could center for example about what happened with Wasikowska's character in Paris 80 years ago. With vampires not aging, they could even look exactly the same like in this movie.One part that I did not like as much and that could have been left out was the central character's career as a musician and how his music was played everywhere. However, that is just a minor criticism. One of my favorite scenes was the one with the wooden bullet, which brought the whole suicide theme to the film, an air of desperation which is really much more about possibly leaving the other completely on their own in this world of strangers.All in all, it's a solid movie, not really a must-see (except for vampire movie fanatics) and there's a bit of a revolutionary element missing which only very few films have. Personally I would rather recommend a watch of Twilight (simply because of its massive influence in pop culture) or the Swedish little gem "Let the Right One In".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Only Lovers Left Alive' is a true-blooded vampire film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, I'm about sick to death of vampire films and all the baggage they bring. Mainly because, no one in this day and age seems to know what vampires are anymore, and make them your boyfriend instead of the monster scratching at your bedroom window. So, I can't say that I went in with high hopes to see Only Lovers Left Alive, simply off of principle. And, I'll be the first person to admit that I was wrong in judging it. Nowadays, big moviegoers like myself, are preconditioned at this point to just deal with whatever crappy vampire movie is out there at the time. There's some like me, who still keep their eyes open waiting to be surprised.The cast drew me into this one more than anything else. I'm a fan of Tom Hiddleston (Thor) and of Anton Yelchin (Odd Thomas) as actors, and I was interested to see what they brought to the table. Especially since I've heard such glowing reviews for it. What you have to understand going into Only Lovers Left Alive is, this is a very realistic and romantic story. When I say "romantic" I mean it in the Gothic way, like how some say that death is sexual or sensual.These aren't your sparkling vampires, but they're also not your transforming vampires either. They are tired and look totally normal, but they do sprout fangs and like drinking blood. Adam (Hiddleston) is very depressed and fatigued of life. He refers to humans as "zombies" and is sick of how the human race as perverted and destroyed the world. He even has a wooden bullet made, with intentions of shooting himself and committing suicide. When he's not moping about, he's playing and recording music.His lover Eve (Swinton) is the positive charge to his negative battery. She's always looking up to the bright side of things and trying to get Adam to relax and enjoy his miserable life. While he's never cheery, Adam finds comfort and resolve in the arms of his woman. He and she were estranged for a bit, but come back together. Doing so literally saves Adam's life because, he never shoots himself due to her company.It starts off with a slow and steady pace, and never really picks up. It's not an over-the-top picture with lots of Michael Bay explosions and visuals. It's a character driven story about what it's like in today's society to be a vampire hiding in plain sight. The realism is the golden ticket here, they go into detail about not drinking blood like in the old days due to all of the different kinds of diseases going around today. Mentions of details like this are what make this such a well- rounded feature. Add to that the acting is great, and the characters are totally likable.Ian (Yelchin) is Adam's friend and associate who, for money, brings Adam various things that are requested. Like a wooden bullet. Ian is about the only human being Adam can stand, and you can tell that while always appearing reserved, Adam enjoys Ian's comradery. After introducing Ian and Eve, all seems well until Eve's younger sister, Ava (Wasikowska) shows up and not only drinks what's left of their precious food (blood) supply, but she drinks/kills Ian. Sending her off into the street in the middle of the night, Adam and Eve are yet again all alone.After disposing of Ian's body, the couple seek out Marlowe (John Hurt). Marlowe is a vampire who was keeping Eve in supply of good quality blood before she left to be with Adam again. Unfortunately, this get-together doesn't end well as they discover that Marlowe has drank a bad batch of blood and is dying. After his passing, the couple go off into the night, again defeated and disappointed with life.They're hungry and unable to afford more quality blood like what Ava finished. So, they realize they have to go about drinking blood the good old fashioned way, and target a romantic couple being cute with one another. The look on Adam and Eve's faces lets you know that feeding is about all that they can do to stay positive and enjoy their eternal lives.Aside from being a bit too slow at times, I've seriously got no complaints for this one. It's got a good story, quality acting, it's sexy, etc. I'm a fan, for sure. The Blu-ray will be hitting shelves August 19th, and if you want to see a movie that'll take you back to when vampire movies were good, you'll check this one out. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes movies about blood suckers, or who just enjoys good motion pictures in general.</fullReview>

That aside, ONLY LOVERS LEFT ALIVE is the MOST BORING vampire flick ever made. It serves better as a documentary about today's bankrupt Detroit, where 90% of the street lights don't work (having been stripped for copper wire by the city's ubiquitous "scrappers," who comprise the half of the male population not dealing drugs). Detroit is depicted by ONLY LOVERS as a place where acidic flooded elevator shafts in abandoned high rises make bodies disappear in minutes (think Jimmy Hoffa); a place where 4,000-seat theaters from entertainment's Golden Age now serve as gutted parking ramps; a place where the factory which churned out the world's most expensive 1930s automobiles now is the world's most expansive industrial ruin; and a place where many residential neighborhoods are down to their last house standing.

		<shortDescription>One of the most intentionally funny vampire films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film premiered long ago so I'll try not to rehash all that's been said already; just know that, if you aren't already a Jarmusch fan, it isn't likely that his reinvention as a genre filmmaker will convert you. Fortunately, I am a fan and this musing on what keeps life fresh and worth enduring through the allegory of the immortal just further endeared him to me. Two ancient vampires (Tilda Swinton &amp; Tom Hiddleston) reunite in an effort to re-spark the will to live, clinging to the arts and sciences for their inspiration. Once again, this is a Jarmusch film so don't expect anything of the traditional plotting; this is a film about love and, surprisingly, it's one of the most intentionally funny vampire films I've seen. The cast (including John Hurt, Anton Yelchin, Mia Wasikowska, and Jeffrey Wright) are all excellent and, with a Q&amp;A from Tilda Swinton afterwards, this will definitely be a SXSW highpoint for me this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'ONLY LOVERS LEFT ALIVE': Four Stars (Out of Five) An indie vampire romance flick written and directed by Jim Jarmusch! It stars Tom Hiddleston (who's most well known as Loki from the 'AVENGERS' movies) and Tilda Swinton as a vampire couple, who's been together for centuries, that reunites when the male vampire becomes depressed and disillusioned by society. It features Mia Wasikowska, Anton Yelchin, John Hurt and Jeffrey Wright in supporting roles and was made on a budget of just $7 million; which was trouble enough for Jarmusch to come up with, due to the unconventionalism of the story. I found it interesting and quirky enough to keep me entertained but it's nothing too spectacular.Hiddleston plays Adam, a centuries old vampire who is also a very talented musician and intelligent scientist. He uses really old studio equipment to record his music and has fans who are constantly wondering who and where he is. He's also been able to keep his entire house (and car) running on technology created by Nikola Tesla. He pays a resourceful young man, named Ian (Yelchin), to bring him things he needs and gets his blood supply from a doctor (Wright), who he also pays not to ask any questions. He's recently become so depressed with humankind (who he calls zombies), and the direction they've taken the world, that he's been contemplating suicide. His lover, Eve (Swinton), who he's been married to for centuries, decides to come visit him after sensing that something's seriously wrong (through a video phone call). The two are happy once again until Eve's wild and reckless younger sister, Ava (Wasikowska), shows up.The film has some great character development and is sort of a unique and new take on the vampire love story but it also has little to no action in it. We get to know these odd and well educated vampires but nothing else really happens (almost the entire movie). It's definitely not scary or gruesome (if you're a horror fan) but it's still a pretty cool vampire/romance flick, with some good dark humor. I like Jarmusch's directing style and Hiddleston and Swinton are fantastic in the leads. It is well made it just seems like there was potential for a much better movie; kind of a missed opportunity in my opinion.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOeCrFS1E-g</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jarmusch is for lovers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a vampirophile at all. I've never even read Bram Stoker's Dracula. But I am a Jarmuschophile going back to "Stranger than Paradise". So I had to give Jarmusch a chance, and Tilda Swinton was definitely a drawing card. It knew it would be risky. I might be murdered in the cineplex...by the exorbitant prices and scores of loud, obnoxious movie trailers. The individual scenes are well staged. The cinematography is great. The music is great. Detroit IS the perfect place for the undead to reside. So is Tangier?I've been there. I even met an Englishman on the train from Fez to Tangier who told me a story about meeting Satan in Morocco. I don't believe in the Devil. But his tale was pretty creep nonetheless.The problems I had with "Only Lovers Left Alive" are the same problems I would have had had the two main characters NOT been vampires. E.g., why do the lovers live apart? Why is the Detroit guy so grim while the Tangier-residing female is so upbeat? The guy "lives" in Detroit with Emimem and Ted Nugent. Why does Tilda Swinton's character decide to relocate right to Detroit when she does? E.g., what is the trigger for their existential crisis? Why does Tilda's sister show up when she shows up? And are modern-day vampires really so afraid of "bad" blood that they only buy their blood from corrupt physicians? If true, that's pathetic! Finally, what's with the special bullet? The waste of a perfectly good plot device!I hope I never become a vampire. It seems worse than being a crack head or a crystal meth junkie. Sure, a junkie's teeth fall out. But what's with that crazy vampire hair? And at the end when I saw the aged, bearded John Hurt I thought, why couldn't Jarmusch have put Jesus in his movie as just another famous vampire who has lived way past His prime? Probably because the movie would have received an NC-17 rating for such a blasphemous portrayal. "Only Lovers Left Alive" is not Jarmusch's best by a long shot, but it's still better than anything coming from the non-indie directors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie mostly for Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddleston never having seen a movie by Jim Jarmusch. Both actors are perfectly suited to the characters they portray and each other as well.I have to be honest, the review that I had read did mention that the movie was slow and languid and it didn't lie... it's very slow and very languid so be forewarned that this is not your typical vampire movie. This probably how most vampires would live after centuries. Drifting through life... like an old married couple that still love each other very much.Now that I've seen the movie, and had the time to think back on it, I will certainly get the DVD once it comes out so that I can have the pleasure of watching it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only Lovers Left Alive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best things about a Jim Jarmusch film is the distinct attention to the auditory experience, and in Only Lovers Left Alive the soundtrack (written and performed by Jim Jarmusch's own SQURL in collaboration with Jozef Van Wissem) is presented with as much consideration as any slow pan or close-up shot. Just as Forest Whitaker is escorted by the chill beats of RZA in Ghost Dog, the Adam (Tom Hiddleston) and Eve (Tilda Swinton) of Only Lovers Left Alive are brought to life (as much as they can be) by distinct sounds. The act of viewing and listening in scenes like the opening sequence emit such a power that seems effortless, and moreso, even timeless. As if we as viewers are just arriving after all the main action, the effects of which linger on in the resonance of high octave percussion in Tangier with Eve and in the loud, melancholy reverb of guitars behind Adam. Adam and Eve have been around for a very long time. They've seen the rise and fall of man so many times and in so many ways that it's become old hat, but there is a difference in how each of them has been able to handle it. Adam is caught in a cycle of depression at how man seems to continue spiraling downward, taking the purity of the earth down with it. Eve: "How can you have lived for so long, and still not get it?" What Eve "gets" sets her firmly within the realm of the upper chakras, an understanding of life and a wisdom which she has cultivated for centuries. She lives life in the moment making the horror of eternal life all but disappear. She is forever in all time and has found comfort in omnipresence. Some comic relief is offered in the form of Mia Wasikowska's character Ava and her interaction with Adam's good "zombie" (non-vampire) friend Ian (Anton Yelchin). I love that Adam calls people zombies, illustrating his perspective of humans being the real monsters. But it also highlights the fact that vampires have been able to exist for millennia without being found, their existence kept strictly to folklore. The last time I saw Mia was in a wonderfully creepy film called Stoker (2013) in which she played a very drab, sullen young girl who slowly discovers herself in very dark ways. It was quite a delightful surprise when I saw her bouncing into Adam's apartment onto the couch as Eve's promiscuous, bored and daring younger sister. We are let in on the fact that Ava has found trouble before, and perhaps it is time to mix it up again with some more mischief. The last two things I'd like to comment on is the effect of the two main locations chosen for the film, Detroit and Tangier, and Adam's stunning re-affirmation of life in a performance by real-life Lebanese artist Yasmine Hamden. The stark contrast between Adam's chosen hideaway and Eve's sanctuary in Tangier is startling and works in mystical ways, just like the music, to add color to each character. One of the most poignant moments in the film occurs after Eve rejoins Adam and he takes her on a drive around the city. They stop at the place of an old theater in ruins. Hints of a glorious past barely show through the dirt in the ruins of architecture and deteriorating frescoes. The ground-space is taken by junked cars and trash. Still, as Eve declares, when the southern areas fall, Detroit will flourish. After all, "there is water here." When man has exhausted his pursuit of self-deceptive height defined by power, accumulation and dominance, he will be forced to fall back to his basic nature, the one which burns the meaninglessness of cold hard cash for the inescapable necessity of cold water. While Adam exists in the perpetual darkness of Detroit, Eve seems to have found an incredible oasis in Tangier, the streets and architecture glow in and out of the off-white stone buildings. Eventually Adam is convinced to return with her, where he discovers something fresh. He is reinvigorated. And this helps them regain the strength to do what they have to do to survive, what is in their natures. This experience is Yasmine, performing in the open air of a quiet Tangier night. The people gathered around her are captivated, but also seem on the verge of a peaceful sleep, like a child being sung to before bed. This film resonates with me as it touches on one of the most basic pursuits of human beings, that of connection that is threefold; connection with other human beings, (or those "like" us), with existence, and with the scientific knowledge and discovery of that existence. But instead of trying to answer tough questions, the film rather focuses on the practical application of living without knowing them. Like Camus writes about the absurdity of life and the necessity of being a rebel against the endlessness of uncertainty, and like the Buddhist virtues of finding wholeness in emptiness, the film makes a statement about human life and how what we do with it is so unnecessarily influenced by the constant knowledge that we have a finite amount of time. Perhaps if we imagined life as timeless and boundless like Adam and Eve, we could learn the importance of recognizing that each moment is not only precious, but all that exists, and that what we choose to do with what is. now. becomes the substance of what we end up obsessing over only when it has become out of reach, or worse, never realized.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starring Tilda Swinton as Eve and Tom Hiddleston as Adam, they're a vampire couple who has been together and in love with each other for centuries. It's actually quite a beautiful description of love. Two persons (in this case, vampires) who don't necessarily even need to live in the same city, but are always there for each other. And no matter how much time passes, their love and respect for one another is still strikingly present. The tenderness was hard to watch for time to time. It is beautiful, yet it feels a bit too personal.I love Tilda Swinton and her Eve's the exact kind of vampire that I would probably be; surrounded by books. I loved the long scene showing Eve packing her favorite books for a long journey. Eve is quite a little drop of sunshine for a vampire, who enjoy all the exciting events that us humans created, like the Middle Age and Inquisition. Thus she's the best counterpart for her melancholy liege lord, Adam.Instead of books, Adam surrounds himself with every kind of musical instruments and creates eerily beautiful pieces of music. Instead of being amused by our antics like Eve, Adam is quite sick of us zombies (that's what they call humans). He seems to be always sad to the point of being suicidal, except when he's around Eve. With Eve, he seems to come alive, well, as alive as a vampire can be. Tom Hiddleston plays brilliantly a role that's quite the opposite from his previous role as Loki. There's a vulnerability in Tom that makes Adam's dull characteristics amusingly awkward and lovingly adorable.All in all, I loved the pitch black humor, almost banal problems of our heroes and the peaceful pace.

		<shortDescription>Hauntingly Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's nothing to jump up and down about this movie, yet there is something that just creeps and stay with you after watching it. It's one of those hauntingly beautiful artistic films. After saying that, the only dilemma I had with this movie was the story line or the lack of plot. It has a slow moving plot which is quite open ended. I guess it's up to you on how you interpret the movie and what you get out of it. But that's only speaking on the surface, because there are quite a few things you can get out of it if you really dig through it. Quite a bit of historical and cultural references scattered throughout the movie. Perhaps it is one of those 'saying nothing is saying everything' angles. What really sold me on this movie are the characters. They could not be more perfect. The characters are a brilliant representation of yin and yang; opposites that needs each other. Jim Jarmusch managed to make this couple not fit into any stereotypical and cliché relationship pathway which really is a breath of fresh air. They just are sophisticated, beautiful, smart and cultured, the way vampires should be. The music lends a dream like feel to the movie where the experimental guitar sounds like music caught between time which then stops time all together. There's a deep mellow romanticism quality towards this movie that just draws me in and lingers. After watching this movie, it made me feel a little frustrated as i was left wanting more. So I would say if you are looking for a straight forward, feel good movie, or the typical vampire movie, then you should pass this one. But if you're looking for something more skin deep and melancholy, don't for a moment hesitate to pick this up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Up off the sofa and out to see a film at the cinema. It's been a while and it's the latest from Jim Jarmusch that gets me off and out. Actually, I'm not sure i would have known this was a Jarmusch film if I hadn't known. Not his usual cool minimalism. But I guess his personal passions are on display and the movie gets off to a brilliant start with the two main protagonists plus John Hurt's character, quickly and interestingly established. We also get a loving look and listen to vinyl records and guitars as the three are gradually brought closer together. The loving couple get together amidst the glorious rough and tumble of a Detroit property and oh, aren't those dying Detroit streets used to great advantage as mournful drives (at night, of course) illustrate. For me the mood is too painfully broken halfway through with the arrival of a brat sister and the whole film changes gear. Still very good but for a while I was basking in brilliance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Night of the Living Detroit (and sometimes other places)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Jarmusch's vampires in the world he creates in Only Lovers Left Alive are, in essence, him doing a movie review on the quality of vampire movies of the past several years. Twilight? Screw that. Maybe a little closer is Let Me In/Let the Right One In. But it needs something else... music, rock music, moody rock music at that with instruments played at erratic intervals and blood that is not sucked dry out of unwilling human hosts. No, that could be too risky. Instead, blood comes from a hospital and in vials. They are lovers, but can the love last as the world - this wasteland of Detroit, Michigan - has not much left to offer in way of culture and arts and fulfillment? Only Tom Hiddleston could have pulled off such a character as he and Jarmusch create here, which is much less Loki from the Marvel movies and more like Morpheus from Neil Gaiman's Sandman: clad in black, easily perturbed but hard to fully anger, his hair also black and frumped over, and his domain small but intensely private for him. Yeah yeah yeah he's a vampire with musical cred, but he looks just like Gaimans creation. And yet amid this intentional or not homage, he finds the way to play the straight man in certain scenes, or to find some way to convey humor as, for example, he plays a violin with his foot.This movie he inhabits and also featuring Tilda Swinton as one of the sweetest vampires on screen to balance Hiddleston's bitter side, is a splendid work of meta-movie-making. Though they rarely raise their voices so high, and the high-point of excitement is (no kidding) finding Jack White's house and staring at it at night, they have a wonderful chemistry that just has a natural air to it, as characters bound for centuries and they know each other well - perhaps, at times, too well.And being shot in Detroit, and featuring a main threat as "contaminated blood" (not to be confused with true blood), it's socially conscious and aware. The misanthropy is conducive to these folks being total outsiders looking on to a world full of "zombies". Sometimes, as with Mia Wasikowskas "sister" - perhaps even more pointed as criticism of what a young vampire would be like for Jarmusch's dry comedy - is very funny. And of course it's full of Jarmuschs self conscious humor and nods to history - when hiddleston goes as a doctor to get blood he is Dr Faust, also Dr Strangelove and Dr Caligari.And where would a vampire story be without some obvious winks to history (from the real author of Shakespeare's plays in John Hurt to who really added Schuberts addiagos). If there's a problem here, and I think there is, it feels a little cold and aimless in spots; I suppose that's maybe the point, or part of it. These are people in a hermetically sealed world, but they're never uninteresting, they're cool and blackly stylish, and its all like a big eff-you to the commercialism that's taken out the eerie and Gothic and, indeed, romance of vampire horror, and this is not only welcome but a sign of a director trying something new and mostly succeeding in sustaining that mood.If it's not one of Jarmuschs best, it's still a worthwhile subversion of genre, with a nothing-less-than-cool soundtrack of muddy guitars and bluesy riffs, and if you're looking also for something hardcore like lots of biting of necks look elsewhere too. These blood drinkers only bite on occasion. It's all shot at night, which makes it further a unique diddy; whether you want to take the plunge of course will depend on some familiarity with his past work. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hypnotic, Smooth, and an Acquired Taste is the New Jim Jarmusch Film. A Movie about, wait for it, of All Things, Vampires. But of Course this isn't Your Teenager's Vampire Film. Although it does have a Trapping of Goth, New Age, Hippiedom with its Earthy Style and a Vampires Love for the Planet that the Human "Zombies" have Abandon. They have Fouled Their Nest and made it Increasingly Uninhabitable for Themselves and in Turn have Turned not Only Their Home but Their Blood into Poison.It's a Crafty Movie Full of Weavings of the Past that Wrap Around New Things Like Cell Phones and Such, but it is History that is Most Revered and Talked About in this Poetic Recital on the State of Things and the State of Things to Come. "Have the water wars started yet, or is still about fossil fuel?"The Acting from All fits Perfectly in the Director's Vision and the Sets and Settings are Nothing Less than Mesmerizing. It's a Smooth Palette of Dark Paisleys and Endless Spirals or Circles. The Music is Hybrid with References to the Past and Influenced Riffs Played with Industrial Abandon and Incoherence. It Fits Perfectly in this Last Curtain Call for the Vampire Movie about the Last Curtain Call for Planet Earth.This is an Infectious Movie that on the Surface may Seem Shallow and Not Much Happens, but it will get Under Your Skin if You let it. These Philosophizing Vampires have a lot to Say Worth Hearing and Their Love Story is Heart Rendering and Worth Seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Little to sink our teeth into</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mystics, saints, and sages throughout the ages have said that life is forever and that love is forever but I don't think they had vampires in mind. Though around for ages, vampires seem to have become more popular in our society today, perhaps reflecting the corporate consumerism sucking the life out of our society. Though vampires may be reflective of the corporate culture, they may also be metaphors that describe those who are blind to the wonders and beauty of life and can only suck the blood out of it. In Only Lovers Left Alive, director Jim Jarmusch attempts to deconstruct the classic vampire story by eliminating most of the "horror" aspects, substituting a wry cultural elitism with an unholier-than-thou attitude.The film stars Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddleston as Eve and Adam (you heard right) as lo-o-o-ng-time lovers who, unlike their "zombie" counterparts in everyday life, survive together over time by being agreeable and refraining from throwing things at each other in a fit of rage (maybe it works out after a few hundred years). Though the film is witty, romantic, and well-balanced without descending into camp, it has a curiously flat quality and its attempt to convey sophisticated ennui comes through only as sad cynicism and world-weariness.Adam and Eve have been separated from each other, though for how long and for what reason are not explained. Perhaps after hundreds of years together, they needed a break. Adam is a musician living in Detroit, Michigan which is shown as a desolate, industrial wasteland. Not necessarily anti-social just anti-zombie (his word for us ordinary humans), Adam thrives on being alone. The wild-haired Eve, a studious scholar, meanwhile, has been living in Tangier, Morocco, a city that Jarmusch claims is his favorite city on Earth (we don't know if he has a favorite somewhere else).Eve's best friend is the ex-boy wonder of the 16th century, Christopher Marlowe, who survived a knife in his head to become a vampire writing under the pen name of William Shakespeare (we knew there was something odd about the man from Stratford). In any event, Adam and Eve no longer attack human beings to drink their blood. That is sooo 19th century. Each has their own supplier of purified blood which they drink from cocktail glasses (Bloody Mary, anyone?) I wouldn't say Adam is lonely and depressed, but is more than willing to spend his cash (saved over the centuries, perhaps) on a wooden bullet encased in a gold shell in case he wants to end his bloody life (didn't know that vampires had it in them).When Eve gets a sense that Adam has an aliveness problem, she flies from Tangier to be in his arms once again. Now, they can talk about Adam's priceless set of guitars that he purchased from Ian (Anton Yelchin), one of the nicer zombie's around and drop names of the people they have known such as Schubert, Byron, and Shelley and probably Dracula. Soon, Eve dreams her sister Ava (Mia Wasikowska) into coming from Los Angeles to visit them (spooky movement at a distance).Full of youthful energy but without true vampire scruples, Ava helps herself to the "good stuff" in their home and generally acts in a selfish manner until she is sent packing and told to go back home to the true zombies who live in Los Angeles. While it is a treat to see "cool" vampires instead of the usual ghouls, there is no real joy in the film. Jarmusch is going for romance and humor and atmosphere by the bucket load, but the film is emotionally wooden and all the centuries-long love affair has produced seems to be a couple that really like each other, who have an eclectic musical interest, and just enjoy lounging around between meals.Only Lovers Left Alive, aside from some flashes of stylistic brilliance, has no compelling story to engage us, nor anything of importance to say - no insights, realizations or character growth. Shall we say, there is little to sink our teeth into. Judging by the reaction in the theater, the lovers in the film's title may be the only ones left alive, only because there was no one left in the audience who fit in that category.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hipster Vampires!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vampire's have been an age old tale of seduction, sexual discovery and eternal youth/life. With the recent surge of popularity towards these alluring figures, more and more film makers have been thinking of more interesting ways to depict them. Director Jim Jarmusch considers here the possibility of eternal love over centuries and the interesting perceptions gained through experiencing and living through so much history.Tom Hiddleston plays Adam, a vampire who lives in seclusion on the outskirts of Detroit. He comes across as a man who has seen and experienced the damage which human's have inflicted on the world. He refers to human's as zombies largely because of their continued ignorance and is coming to the point were he is seriously considering to end it all. After a video conversation with his wife Eve (Tilda Swinton) who lives in Tangiers, you get the feeling he has considered suicide many times before. Eve makes plans to fly over to Detroit to see Adam. She arrives at the slightly dilapidated building he lives in which is filled with analogue recording equipment, old, dusty books and vinyl's. He is a former famous rock star and as we get further into the film, we learn he was involved in many of the creative scenes in history. He was a composer, a poet, a writer, philosopher and general visionary. He writes what he calls funeral music, which provides the dark, feedback laden, post rock instrumental soundtrack for the majority of the film.Much of the cynical observations Adam makes about humanity is interesting. Religion and superstition are much to blame in his eyes as he says how the zombies all live in fear of their own imaginations and how they are all still bitching about Darwin. He also mentions the beautiful possibilities of Nikolai Tesla and how he was ignored and ridiculed in favour of the power grid which he considers uninspired and impractical. Eve has a more positive view as she points out that worse has happened even before their time.Both Adam and Eve have found a way to blend in with the 'zombies'. They make arrangements to bribe Doctors for clean, high quality blood which they drink out of a glass. They keep themselves busy by reading old literature, listening to vinyl's and exploring what is now an urban wasteland that is Detroit. It was once a place that was booming with industry, but now it seems to be full of abandoned warehouses with faded graffiti. They go to what was once an iconic concert hall which has turned into a car park. Again, expressing frustration at the senselessness of human planning. While they try to blend in, but at the same time, keep themselves to themselves, Eve's sister Ava (Mia Wasikowska) turns up. She is from LA and seems like a bit of a party girl who cannot be trusted. She likes to play Adams music without permission and wants to know where the blood supplies are kept as she cannot seem to get enough of it. When all three of them go to an underground venue to watch a band, Ava takes a liking to Adam's trusted PA Ian (Adam Yelchin) a guy who may or may not be leaking Adam's secret music. When Ian comes back to Adams place and is left in the company of Ava, Ava kills him by drinking his blood. Disgusted at this, Adam and Eve throw her out in the streets.It may be a film where there is not much of a story, and many people hold the opinion that nothing much happens. If you read between the lines, there is much to gain from this film. Philosophy, literature, music, society, resources and many other things are discussed in relation as to where humanity is heading. The blood supplies can be viewed in two ways. Both as an allegory to drug dependency and symbolism of dried up resources, specifically oil. In various parts of the film, it is mentioned that blood is contaminated. This symbolises sexually transmitted disease. Ava seems to be the embodiment of excess and care free partying to the point that I think she was already poisoned even before she arrives on screen. The slow pace may infuriate some people, but I liked the cinematography and the accompanying soundtrack as it added style and atmosphere, and the place where Adam lived looked like paradise to me with all the vinyl's, books and guitars in abundance. The chemistry between Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton really worked. It could have been a partnership that easily could have not worked as there is considerable age difference (Tilda Swinton being much older), but I think they both looked good on screen and Tom Hiddleston although still quite young displays the wisdom needed for his character. Also it is always good to see John Hurt in a film. He plays celebrated 16th century author Christopher Marlowe who faked his own death and was 'turned' in his latter years. He is a close friend of Eves and represents the last of the older vampires as by the end of the film, they seem to be a dying breed due to the lack of clean blood left.The film is a celebration of old values and some traditional values. Although Tom and Eve denounce 'zombie' superstitions, they still practice some of the vampire superstitions, like inviting a guest in the house which they perform ritualistically. After all, they are from another time and old habits die hard and all that. It is a well observed film which I think is one of Jarmusch's best as I have not enjoyed some of the more subdued efforts like 'Broken Flowers' and especially 'The Limits of Control'. An achievement of style with thoughtful symbolic possibilities.Check out my film review blog - www.projectionistreview.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Jim Jarmusch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nice take on vampires, but the movie lingers on for a while and does not seem to go anywhere. For those of you who are guitar freaks Tom Hiddleston does a great job at playing Adam, a musician who is all about the music and has a thing for guitars that have been around almost as long as he as. His love in the movie, Eve is played by an the actress who looks like a vampire. The movie is very centered around music, but not necessary the music scene around Detroit, Michigan where the movie takes place, and showcases how perfect the practically abandon city is for vampires. The fact that it is centered around music kept me interested and if you love music, that may keep you interested as well. I did like Anton Yelchin as Adam's link to the outside, or daylight if you will, who seems to have a connection to the music scene and helps Adam increase his collection of old guitars and gets him even weirder stuff, no questions asked. Also, the slow pace and focus on the main character allows for a broader conversation to trivial facts about vampires that would have just been glanced over in other vampire films as secondary conversation. Like the effort it takes for a vampire to get from one country to another by air travel or how they get their blood from blood banks, things like that. So if you are interested in things like that, than you may find the movie interesting.Other wise it's a love story about a group of people who are so greatly in love that there is no real conflict. All the other side notes, like Eva, Eve's sister who seems to be a bad vampire, seem to come and go as a small attempt to move the story along.It's worth taking a look at, maybe if you stream it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lost and without Direction it might be, however still enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to this film without any preconceived ideas about what I was in for (I have never seen a Jarmusch film before)expecting to enjoy another offering in the Vampire tranche. And for that I wasn't disappointed, as a fan of the main three actors and appreciative of Mia Wasikowska's up and coming talents in Stoker etc, all three played their arts well, so as to make the 123mins pass by.I liked the darkness which hung the film together a lot, and the setting of Tangiers, which its history of drug fuelled anything goes, enabled the direction to go anywhere it wanted to without upsetting either film purists or Vampire aficionados. And that was the problem it didn't seem to want to go anywhere except its own bottom. For all the credit I have given the film so far, the one thought that was prominent throughout was 'well when will the story start?" and to be frank it never did.This was a film which like many films these days, oh to many in my book, which expects the viewer to have an understanding of the incitements of the main characters, as well as an insight of the directors humour (Kit Marlow, FFS) What ever happened to a start, a middle and an ending? lost on the cutting room floor perhaps. I do not like the presumption that we already know what it going on, what drove these Vampires to separate and lead seemingly separate lives across the planet, whilst being still married. Yes I do need plot fillers to bring me up to date, no I do not expect the glorious colour of the piece to be enough to under stand why Kit Marlow was in the flipping thing? Why not Andy Warhol, Bert Blogs, et all, what was his 'crime' to see him ended up as a blood sucking ghoul aged 435 or so.It was this limpness of plot development and the lack of any clear editing which soiled a large section of the film for me.I suppose the reason why I gave it 7 was simply because this is what a whole lot of films are made of these days and it was in parts worthy of that much.Wait for the DVD release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most Jim-Jarmuschiest of his films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you don't like JJ's other films, chances are you won't like this. Now that's out of the way, I must say that this was the only vampire film I've ever seen which didn't make me roll my eyes and immediately wish I was watching something else. In fact, it feels kind of wrong to call it a vampire film. What this is, is a gentle eye on two different parts of the world, both which have seen better days, and the wistful musings of a couple who have been around long enough to provide insightful asides. One scene (in the abandoned theatre) almost seems like some sort of documentary about the site, and not in a bad way at all). The age of the characters is used to maximum, charming effect, and the male character's ennui with life is akin to the kind of malaise which would afflict many an elderly member of the worldy-wise intelligentsia. I found this film beautiful, funny and warm. I disagree with other reviewers' ascertations that it is about hipsters. In my opinion, these two couldn't be less like hipsters if they tried (hipsters being the misguided, irritating, attention-seeking douchebags that they are). Every bit of art, clothing, etc., owned by or worn by these characters is a direct result of their ageless odyssey, and has its special charm and/or meaning for them. Well done Jim.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Jarmusch, an independent spirit, makes idiosyncratic movies, of which this is as typical an example as any in his output. It looks terrific, containing some beautiful imagery. The sets are superbly dressed, the costumes perfectly judged. The locations have been cleverly chosen - the bleakness of Detroit, the warmth of Tangier. It is very well acted, with a charismatic (and stick-thin) leading couple, as well as boasting a particularly touching cameo from John Hurt. It is occasionally polemical (about the mess we 'zombies' are making of the planet) and it is occasionally amusing. In spite of all of that, after two hours of unhurried pacing, I came away feeling that this was a trite piece of work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After many years I've never experienced any film from the catalogue of Jim Jarmusch, where before I just considered this to be a consequence of a non path cross, I now see it as a crime on my part.For my first movie (ironically his latest output) to see of his, Only Lovers Left Alive paints a beautiful cinematic work on a canvas of a Detroit setting that feels like its most at home in a 1990's environment. This backdrop is but one picture piece included in a puzzle of film beauty, a romantic story of darkness, light humour, death, history, relationships and a helluva musical decadence.Brief, but words I feel totally appropriate in describing OLLA.If you love Tilda Swinton, Tom Hiddleston, John Hurt and some neat bow tie performances from Mia Wasikowska and Anton Yelchin, oh and of course Vampires of old. Then Lovers will not disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Art Film - Not For Everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a slow-moving art-house film that is not for everyone. It is a languorous love story between two vampires whose lives are disrupted when her spirited and non-conformist sister visits.For the first half of the movie, it weaves slowly through, the characters reminiscing about the lives and people hundreds of years past. It's interesting to hear how they influenced some of the biggest names of history, but it really needs patience to sit through some of the long slow scenes. Adam laments the gradual deterioration of society and culture so much you wonder why he hasn't killed himself or the others yet, or moved to somewhere more Old World.Tilda Swinton is suited perfectly for the role of Eve. She has the looks, bearing and acting chops to portray relatively-cold personas like vampires and ice queens. Tom Hiddleston puts in a commendable performance as Adam, her longtime lover. I loved Mia Wasikowska's performance as Ava - she injects the zest needed to perk up the movie. I wished Anton Yelchin had a bigger role as Ian though - his was a character worth developing a little more.You'll enjoy the music if you enjoy the film - it's a mix of old and new that gets you into the prevailing mood of the film. All in all, this is not a movie for everyone, but if you're in the mood for a slow unfolding tale, this is a good choice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is the point of this film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tells the story of two vampires who have been in love for centuries, even though they live apart at times."Only Lovers Left Alive" is a very artistic film, as the cinematography is beautiful. However, that's about the only good point of the film. The story is almost non-existent. It only features Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddleston frequently drinking blood, moving slowly around the place, and speaking monotonously. There is no explanation of why they live apart, and why they reunite. The addition of Mia Wasikowska's character brings the film to a more lively level, but the antagonism of Tom Hiddleston against her is irritating. The film is a downright bore, and I am just glad when the film ended.I do not quite see the point of the film. It's dull and flat, and not interesting at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Daily life of vampires</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally when You comfortable sit in armchair and start watching story about vampires you are prepared for something unusual, maybe scary or some vital action on different creatures culture. Unfortunately film describes the live of modern vampires in the daily routine hard to figure out why? Strong point of storyline is claustrophobic world that easy suck You in. But is it enough to catch You for 2 hours in front of the screen? If You like stories about love not necessarily matching only for vampires there is good for You, but if Your imagination want something more You can be very disappointed. Some moments picture deliver us with some philosophical thoughts and that could be also some plus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this film was wonderful. If you want to see a 'vampire' film, then go watch Twilight. This is a thoughtful film, a film that points out how banal everyday life has become, a film that reminds us there is so much beauty in the world but we're too busy to see it. Sometimes in a back street of a tiny little town you will find the most wonderful, real, raw talent. Swinton and Hiddleston are stunning actors and perfectly cast. Hiddleston's character Adam, is depressed, and after spending hundreds of years seeing how the world has changed you can't really blame him. Eve (Swinton) his true love tries to help him see the wonder in things again, in doing so she makes the audience see the wonder in things again. It's a quiet film that makes you want to go out and look at the stars and see them, really and truly see them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful photo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wonderful photo. Still, a 120 minutes long photo.Jarmusch intent is quite clear since the first moments of the movie: redraw the vampire's icon in modern society and redraw society's decadence via vampire icons. This sociological panorama is figured with refined symbolisms and a scrupulous characterization. That's almost what happens in the movie: it's a kind of "making of" a beautiful painting. What we miss is a definitive choice: something can be static, something can be dynamic, what we don't want to see is something painfully slow. A poor plot is better than an easy predictable one. Many parts of the story and pushing on the claim of characters playing great geniuses of the past seem last minute unconvinced attempts to fill the bra, as it'd come from a third party request and result as adding meat in a vegan dish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missed opportunity of a beautiful but empty missive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with an auteur like Jim Jarmusch is that all the things which might lead to such marvels as originality, inherent style, a singular perspective, peculiar vision etc, can also mitigate against those very characteristics. Only a movie with a single Captain at the helm could so beautifully marry the visuals with the music, perhaps only an auteur could speak so directly to the audience of his own thoughts on so many loosely allied political positions, but if only there was a narrative that developed beyond the first musings of what happen if....these were the only lovers left alive? Tilda Swinto. Proves able to transcend such limited colourings of character and plot development, but Tom Hiddlestone, perhaps belying his limited leading man screen appearances, was trapped in a one note performance of a one note character in a one note plot, to this reviewer the undeveloped adolescent moodiness and faux introspection that causes youth to paint their bedrooms black and rant about the world outside in a dull and unleavened critique that time will amend and perspective reshape....as it should have done for Jim Jarmusch. One can't help feeling that all the potential could have been shaped into a more engaging story, and even a more compelling political rant, had the auteur been forced to submit to some suits in a studio who had some sense of the audiences desire to be entertained by a more adept storyteller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Into the depths of boringness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a scale from 1 to 10 this movie is a solid ZERO. I have no idea how it got a 89% fresh rating on rotten tomatoes or 7.7 on IMDb. Maybe it was rated based on past accomplishments of the director. Maybe it was rated solely by the stupid fraction of the highly pretentious hipster crowd. The fact of the matter is: This movie did NOTHING right. It is literally a waste of 2 hours of your life. For the first 60 or so minutes nothing happens. You're (poorly) introduced to the two main characters and watch them do absolutely nothing. If the movie ended here one could claim that it's an atmospheric movie made to evoke emotions not through a story, but through visually and auditory stimulating your senses. The problem with this is that the (admittedly really good) soundtrack lasts for only about a minute out of those 60 and that relayed atmosphere is far beyond melancholic and well into the area of making you feel like cutting yourself. If it had ended there the movie might qualify for about 2/10 points. However, the director decided that 60 minutes of boringness are not enough, so he throws in a story. The story itself is plain stupid (not to mention boring) and the characters act and talk so unrealistically that it makes you wonder if they are supposed to be brain damaged. Additionally, the director decided to add some more "substance" to his movie and throws in some "social criticism". This however, is done in a completely lackluster way. The "criticism" basically consists of two short sentences and calling humans zombies half a dozen times randomly during the 122 painful minutes of this colossal monstrosity. The whole movie felt like the director had no idea what he wanted to make. Do not watch this piece of trash!</fullReview>
