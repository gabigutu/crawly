		<shortDescription>Great Saturday Night Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why do people trash this movie? It's not high art but it's thoroughly entertaining. WH's performance in this movie is better than all her others...just watch the scene when she asks Frank Farmer to take her on a date. Natural, unaffected and charming. Kevin Costner underplays his role and I enjoyed watching him. I just bought the anniversary DVD and it has great backstage footage and very interesting tidbits. For example, it was Kevin Costner's idea, against a lot of protest, to have WH sing the first few bars of 'I will Always Love You' acapella. Smart man. And it is interesting to listen to the comments of Costner about this movie. He was a major star but he waited and held up production of this movie a year so he could get WH. He didn't want anyone else and was willing to wait for her. He refused to interject a story line that would 'explain' the Black/White thing (Bravo). And although Black/White pairings are fairly common now, THEN, for a major star to have a real black love interest ( and an untested actress at that) was a bold move. And it paid off. I don't know why he has not been as successful recently. The DVD interviews were done about 2 yrs ago and WH was still drug crazy (so no interviews with her) but Kevin Costner's last words in the interviews are about her and he said, among other things, that he would always love Whitney. Their chemistry was spot on. I WILL ALWAYS LOVE THIS MOVIE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story of a superstar singer who falls in love with her bodyguard could have been a major disaster. I remember the previews and thinking it was going to be one. However once the film was out and I actually watched it I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this is a really good romance and a really good thriller. Of course its hokey and Hollywood and all of that but you get sucked in and carried along for its running time.Trust me this is better than you think it is.The only problem is that the film is a bit too long to do what it has to do. I think the problem is in the early part of the film where all of th e pieces are being set in motion, however once its all going its great.Get some popcorn your honey and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I quite enjoyed it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bodyguard is fundamentally a love story between two contrasting characters with their own idiosyncrasies. The plot is intriguing enough to carry the film through and the romance between Costner and Houston builds steadily and realistically.With some decent action scenes, a decent cast and a great soundtrack, i found the Bodyguard to be an enjoyable movie.Clearly this film is not for everyone, it doesn't have enough action to satisfy the action fans, it isn't thrilling enough to be a thriller and as a pure romance film it is fairly weak; but i have to admit it does balance between these 3 genres quite well without excelling in any one of them.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Farmer is a top line bodyguard, formerly secret service protector to President Reagan, he is approached to guard Rachel Marron, the latest pop sensation on the cusp of Hollywood domination. After initially being reluctant to take the job, Farmer gets to the task of protecting Rachel from a potential maniac who's been sending her threatening letters. As the initial in camp hostilities die down, Frank &amp; Rachel start to draw ever closer, but so does the person who wants her dead...The Bodyguard is one of those films that was long in gestation, originally mooted in 1976 to star Steve McQueen (it was written with McQueen in mind in the 60s) and Diana Ross, it was put on the back burner after McQueen fell ill to the cancer that killed him. Then it resurfaced in 1979 with Diana Ross to play opposite Ryan O'Neal, but the two stars just couldn't get on and the project again fell by the wayside. Enter Kevin Costner and his boys at TIG Productions, original choice to star alongside Costner, Maddona, ruined her chance (thankfully) of starring after being a bitch to Costner in her Truth Or Dare documentary. In stepped Whitney Houston (brilliantly diva casting), Costner gave himself a crew cut (in homage to McQueen) and The Bodyguard went on to make $410,900,000 worldwide.The film now seems like a myth to me because the rating across many forums is on the low side, critics hate it and you will be hard pressed to find macho film fans readily about to own up to liking the picture. That's a shame because as undeniably nonsense as it is, it has got a great thriller heart to blend in with its romantic core. The good ship Bodyguard may dock at all the formula ports in the genres, but it's one hell of a journey getting to the end, even with that song that seemed to top the charts for years! (the soundtrack to the movie selling 17 million in America alone).In spite of the obviousness of the plot, and the general feeling of familiarity, The Bodyguard has much going for it, things that ensured it became a monster hit and had cinema goers queueing round the block to see it. Houston is something of a revelation, here she nails the diva bitch heart of gold portrayal of Rachel with astonishing ease, and couple that with a voice sent from some deity paradise far away, makes her total value for money. Costner also stepped up to the plate to win a new breed of fans as Farmer, his charm and laid back manner works well with a ruggedness that the male viewers could easily get on side with. The rest of the cast are merely playing second fiddle to the well matched up leads, and outside of Gary Kemp becoming increasingly annoying as the film progresses, they all blend in well to create what is now a sadly undervalued picture.See it with someone you love, don't just take my word for it, look at the box office take, it doesn't lie. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best bad movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bodyguard is a movie with many flows and one redeeming factor: the WH factor. People went to see this picture because they wanted to see Whitney singing and she delivered some of her most passionate vocal performances before the mesmerised eyes of her millions of fans on the big screen. Let's face it, who wants to see her acting when she can sing so beautifully? The unrelenting criticism by couch 'drama experts' of her acting seems a tad over the top. She never claimed to be an actress and despite this being her film debut, she did not disgrace herself. She did the best she could with what she was given: a patchy character with very little to say. What else could she do to play this role? Well, just what she did, sing her heart out.The best thing that Kevin Costner did was to insist that Whitney was the only one he wanted for this part. He knew he had a winner, but he also tried to do too much with the story: a romantic thriller with patches of 'comedy', a study in professional-personal conflict and 'who done it' thrown in. That's the reason for the plot's erratic turns and the non existent character development. The glue that holds the whole mess together is Whitney, the singer, looking stunning and sounding like an angel.This could have been a gigantic flop and instead it was a massive hit. It will remain a phenomenon in popular culture because it delivered what the vast majority of its audience wanted: escapism, a couple of hours away from their own reality and a look inside the glamorous life of a superstar. They were entertained by a great pop singer, who had made a huge video clip for her songs and they did not mind paying for the privilege. Those who hate The Bodyguard, went to see it with some unrealistic expectations of 'serious cinema and acting'?! Hey, go to see foreign movies with subtitles for that and come down from your pretentious cloud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched many action movies but this one makes one think: what happens next? This material could have been handled badly, but it comes out refined and elegant.Both Whitney Hustoun and Kevin Costner stay true to their types, yet sharing a common purpose giving a spiritual dimension to the movie as observed by a commentator.This is not a conventional romantic movie and that is why many are disappointed. It is a throwback to old concepts of chivalry and knighthood. The remarkable point to observe is that it is a modern story about an independent woman and her child.This is a movie which feels good and genuine in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh my, what a wonderful movie. Hollywood is known for churning out a lot of sentimental mush that's supposed to pass for romance. But, thankfully, this is not one of those movies. In this movie the main characters, the bodyguard and the lady he is hired to protect, are likable and have a relationship that develops into something really beautiful and special. Moreover, the story is plausible and the movie is well-acted too, with Whitney Houston turning in an outstanding performance reminiscent of Diana Ross's in Lady Sings the Blues (which is another great movie). If you want to watch a movie with good acting and an engaging story, then this is the movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Costner and Houston's chemistry save a bland plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie/music star who needs protection from a psychotic fan, wow what a concept. And who better to play it than Whitney Houston, a stretch I know.The plot is totally disappointing and bland. Luckily the on-screen romance and chemistry from Houston and Costner, along with a great soundtrack, save this film from being a total bust. The love story between Costner and Houston becomes the main driving force, preventing the film from running out of ideas. In the end the romance is what you take away from the film, not the convoluted mystery plot.It's enjoyable in the end and I would recommend it. Of course the soundtrack is one of the best and most popular in history with "I Will Always Love You", "Run to You", "I Have Nothing", and "I'm Every Woman."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adequate Thriller-Romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was interested to note from your "Trivia" page that it was originally intended to make this film in the seventies with Steve McQueen and Diana Ross in the leading roles, but that the film never got made because it was "too controversial". The cause of the controversy was presumably the mixed-race love-affair between Frank and Rachel, as there is little else in the script that might upset anyone. The story centres around Frank Farmer, a former Secret Service agent now working as a private bodyguard. He is hired by Rachel Marron, an African-American pop star, who has been receiving death threats, presumed to come from a mad stalker. Frank's obsessive concern with security initially alienates both Rachel and some of the other members of her entourage, but, after a number of misunderstandings, he becomes first her friend and then her lover. He, however, is unhappy about becoming emotionally involved with a client and ends the affair. He would also like to end his employment with Rachel, but she is becoming genuinely frightened for her own safety, and he agrees to stay on to protect her when it is clear that she is in danger from an unexpected source.When I first saw this film in the cinema I disliked it. I was a great admirer of Kevin Costner's performance in "Dances with Wolves", and I went to see "The Bodyguard" in the hope that it would be a film of similar scope and vision. Of course, it isn't, but then it was never intended to be. Having seen it again recently on television, I was rather more impressed than I had been the first time. There is a respectable performance from Costner as Frank, a man who on the surface seems cold and detached but who hides his emotions under the surface- not only his love for Rachel, but also his feelings of guilt stemming from the assassination attempt on President Reagan in 1981. Frank was not on duty at the time- in fact, he was attending his mother's funeral- but he cannot escape from the thought that, if he had been present, he could have prevented the President from being shot.Whitney Houston is a beautiful woman, with a beautiful voice which was shown off to good advantage in this film. Her rendition of "I Will Always Love You" is one of the most haunting ballads I know, far superior to the Dolly Parton original. Her character is supposed to be an actress as well as a singer- the finale actually takes place as she receives a "Best Actress" award at the Oscars. Unfortunately, it seems unlikely that Whitney will ever emulate her alter ego in this respect, as her acting is certainly not in the same class as her voice. She seems to have too small an emotional range, and it is no surprise that her subsequent film career has been so patchy. "The Bodyguard" is a perfectly adequate thriller-romance, if at times too slow-moving, but I felt that it might have been better with a more commanding female lead. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem with this film is the total lack of chemistry between the two lead characters; or rather, between the actors who play them. That attraction is supposed to fuel the movie and drive it forward, but it's water in the gas tank; this clunker only rolls a few feet.Whitney Houston is so talented and beautiful, but exudes no sex appeal. In that respect she is like Julie Andrews of old; very talented, lovely, but, as one critic wrote of Andrews, "Has all the sex appeal of a very efficient dietitian." I would rather have seen, oh...Halle Berry or some actress with real dynamism (and dubbed voice) getting mixed up with Kevin Costner.Kevin Costner is a fine actor who was absolutely doing his best Steve McQueen impression. Women love to see a powerful, internally sensual man succumb to a woman so sensual or otherwise desirable that the poor guy's helpless. Costner is a powerful actor and few female actresses have that presence...Angelina Joli? Costner even was too powerful for Susan Sarandan in Bull Durham. I agree that, second to the flat interaction of the main characters, the story made little sense. If Frank Farmer had such a fragile ego that he could not come to terms with a tragic event he had nothing to do with, he would not have been selected by the Secret Service in the first place.And what was the plan with taking the entourage to the lake? Were they going to live there indefinitely? Papa Walton, by the way, was miscast as Frank's father. He seemed to be ready to break into a smile at any moment; or perhaps the corners of his mouth got caught on his dentures.The sister and son were very good. I liked the acting ability of both; Fletcher was very subtle and sensitive in a film that wasn't.The Oscar scenes were funny. Anyone who saw Naked Gun 33 1/3 keeps expecting Mary Lou Retton to come flipping and bouncing down the aisle. Rachel's (joking) reason for risking her life in attending was ludicrous...you gotta cheer when Frank's stoic chastity appropriately caved; if she was a Darwin award candidate, her days were numbered anyway, so why not? Actually, I thought Whitney Houston's acting was fine; she downplayed the role, seemed rather shy, and perhaps if there were more chemistry with the male lead, she would have received less criticism. I would like to have seen Diana Ross and Steve McQueen; they were equally matched dynamic folks.Oh well, there are worse movies. Just because this one lacked chemistry, motivation, and sense, doesn't make it half as bad as the remake of Lost Horizon...my overall standard of rotten films.And hey, I thought Frank's haircut was sexy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lightweight melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whitney Houston's screen debut is a lavish urban thriller that takes itself quite seriously but never gets going. The film stumbles from one scene to another and never has any semblance of a coherent, believable story. The production values are top notch all around but the plot is utterly senseless. Houston does well in her role as a temperamental diva, is talented, pretty, bitchy and vulnerable. She fares much better than star Kevin Costner, who plays the title role. Costner seems unsure of himself and comes across as tentative and hopelessly wooden, although he and Houston do seem to have a bit of chemistry between them. Ralph Waite is fine as the bodyguard's father but the rest of the cast overacts to the point of silliness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very standard movie with a little bit of corn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Former Secret Service agent Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner) is a no nonsense bodyguard who doesn't like to get involved with his clients or stay around too long. Rachel Marron (Whitney Houston) is a pop diva with a stalker. Her manager Devaney (Bill Cobbs) begs Frank to work for her. She is reluctantly to have the bodyguard interfere with her life, and it's obvious that they haven't told her the worst of the situation.Written by Lawrence Kasdan and directed by Mick Jackson, this is a very standard and predictable thriller. Kevin Costner is very solid as the straight laced guard. Some may downgrade the movie because of Whitney Houston. However I found her to be a good natural performer especially for someone who is untrained. She actually adds a sense of reality. There is no denying that she has the persona of a pop diva. And it helps to have her great soundtrack to prove the point. The romance is a bit corny. That's probably its biggest weak point. The movie expects a little too much from an acting novice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Dull movie, magnificent soundtrack"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the title states above, that's all I really think about with this movie: an incredibly boring and predictable plot. But the key to this movie's success is its multimillion-selling soundtrack by the incomparable Whitney Houston. Although, it has to be said, her acting was lackluster at the worst of times, her presence as one pop icon's biggest stars was why people went to see this movie and the reasons for its high gross: to see her sing some of the biggest ballads of the modern era.The lack of sexual chemistry between pop star Rachel Marron (Whitney Houston) ? I know, not much of a challenging role playing yourself right? ? and Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner) as her bodyguard is just one of the many reasons why this film didn't really work.It was obvious that this film wasn't going to win any Oscars for acting as it was simply lifeless. Instead, the pair relied on a relaxed approach to their scenes to try and ignite some kind of genuine or uncontrollable passion. However, I did not see any passion in the movie except for Houston's vocal numbers and perhaps (I'll give it to the movie) the kissing scene at the end of the picture before Houston's iconic rendition of "I Will Always Love You", an old country tune came bursting in at the credits.However, the fact Houston essentially played herself in this movie demonstrated how much it lacked in believability, I'm guessing the kind of message Costner and the producers were trying to put across was an unconventional love story. Instead the picture focused on Houston's vocals (amazing, mind you) and that's what sold this movie to millions of fans.Costner knew what he was getting himself in for when he cast Houston as the lead ? mega bucks. What I will take away from this movie ? a positive ? is giving Houston the opportunity to give the world some memorable ballads that will stand to the end of time as some of the greatest songs every recorded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thriller that needs to find a main focus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Romantic thrillers can work, they just need to have good direction. But for this film, directed by Mick Jackson, did not keep a steady eye on where the plot had to be. Much of the time I was trying to figure out what on earth was happening with the plot that seemed to go on endlessly.The story of the bodyguard is about Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner), a veteran in the art of protection and now only takes care of special VIPs. Sadly, the character of Farmer is so thinly written that nothing ever changes for the better in this man. His entire outlook on his job is strictly to be emotionless. The audience isn't even explained to why the only beverage he drinks is a glass of orange juice.Co-starring Costner is Whitney Huston, a pop culture icon ironically playing a fictional pop culture icon named Rachel Marron. Her character is eccentric and snobby but it works. At least she tries to excite Mr. Farmer, but even she is not able to get him to come out of his cage of cautiousness. It's almost as though the lines written for Huston's character were supposed to be more entertaining than Costner's.The problem with these two characters is that the connection between them just didn't feel or look like it was there. That and the fact that the film focused more on these two people more than the plot. The main plot here was to about Farmer protecting Marron from a psychotic killer whom when, on screen, seemed like he had some serious issues. Turns out though, this creep is hardly ever focused on at all. And it's because of this that the tension in this "romantic thriller" is lost. Nothing gets tense at all until the finale.The music, which was for the majority of the time provided by Huston, nonetheless has energy but all this does is support the fact that Huston is better at singing. Of course her acting is good but her voice is the top gun that she has. The rest of the score was produced by Alan Silvestri and once again, just like Unlawful Entry (1992), was a let down by the fact that there was not enough music to keep the scenes tight. But then again, who could blame him; how could you produce a score for a thriller film that rarely focuses on the thriller aspect of it?Huston isn't bad at acting here but all this does is prove that she should stick to singing. Not to mention, the lack of balance in romance and thriller makes this film hard to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>but oh! it was magic to see it again after all these years. Probably the most awkward time to do so, alone, in the middle of the night, when most IMDb reviews suggested to watch it with your "sweetheart", i rebelled, thinking I can handle the oozing cheese coming out of the film from all sides.Honestly though, for a Hollywood flick, it's a classic. I know there's a love/hate thing going on with The Bodyguard, but it should be all love, if not for anything else, the two leading stars Kevin Costner (at the prime of his career) &amp; Whitney Houston (at the prime and beauty of hers). You don't see a lot of chemistry these days like the one these two had, they must of known they were meant for their parts because they were played so well under the circumstances. It's *hard* to make a decent movie when it's partly a musical. You have action + suspense + romance + and epic soundtrack rolled into one, you think people would be happy? But no. It's either Whitney's acting is horrid, or Kevin is too short. Well maybe he is, but I still enjoyed their performances nonetheless.What I also liked about this movie was its heart. There were the lovable other body guards, the cute kid, the envious sister, and intimacy like you've never seen! Call me immature, but by the end I was gushing (not crying) simply gushing over their last passionate kiss goodbye. This film was made to be remembered, a sort of time warp back to the 1990s, when there weren't cell phones, but soundtracks about real love, and a lot of spandex (as you will see in numerous outfits throughout the movie.) In a nutshell, I loved it. Fully recommend it, because we all get those late night cravings for ultimate cheese, and this wasn't so much as cheese as it was heart-warming, butterflies in your stomach, at least that's the feeling I got. Open up your mind &amp; heart (corny, yes) to The Bodyguard... and no I will not stoop down to add to the pre-crack Whitney jokes. Goodnight folks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effectively contrived romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a stand-up advocate of the obvious as long as it's done well. The Bodyguard is a straightforward thriller with and entirely believable romance, told in a manner which makes you feel, er, both thrilled and warm.Not only are there no surprises here, we are also seeing another in a long line of films made specifically to showcase the talent of one of the stars looking for a new pocket of audience for their great success elsewhere. No doubt a fair proportion of the audience that went to see The Bodyguard and bought the videos, DVDs, soundtracks and, no doubt, fridge magnets were only interested in new performance footage of Whitney Houston the (unarguably gifted) singer and a fictional dramatisation of what they imagine her fabulous, starry life to resembles.No matter. This issue is decently integrated into the film. Costner gives us just enough ennui to translate into genuine care and Mick Jackson understands how the star and fans want to commune with it all. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TCM was showing this as part of their "Oscar" month. I ended up staying up late to watch it.Wow, what a waste of time! The problem isn't KC or WH or their chemistry (or lack thereof), but the idiotic plot that just doesn't make any sense. I could fill pages with examples, but the one that made me really sorry that I had sacrificed my beauty sleep to watch this was when Costner's character dives into a freezing lake to knock a kid out of a boat, but for no apparent reason other than he just figure out that the bad guy is nearby. After safely out of the water, the boat stops in the middle of the lake and blows up. Since neither Costner or Houston's characters had been in the boat or shown any interest in the boat, the whole idea that someone would try to kill them by blowing it up made absolutely no sense at all.And what about the ridiculous attempt at romance, which is obviously the whole point of the film? There is not one credible scene that explains either character's attraction for the other. None. So, the reason for no chemistry between the two is that the idiot who wrote this didn't provide any dialog or staging to provide them with any motivation.So, my advice is to buy a Whitney Houston album so you can hear her fabulous voice without interference from all the foley noise, and then rent "No Way Out," which provides all sorts of motivation for the romance and sex scenes with an equally serious, but far more plausible performance from Costner.</fullReview>

I did read that Kevin Costner's part was originally written for Steve McQueen, and he may've been able to pull it off. Note that K.C. has Steve's haircut. This is a demonstration that celebrity in one area doesn't necessarily to talent in another area. The film needs a female lead who can act, and ol' Whitney ain't the gal for the job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Bodyguard is a bad film. Whitney Houston stars as this pop star who has gotten some threatning messages from an obsessed fan and Kevin Costner is hired to protect her. Now this star is a diva from hell and The Bodyguard is so empty and dull person. They don´t have a good relationship in the beginning but in the end they fall in love but the man who is trying to kill Whitney is still out there and they have to be very careful. Overall this is the plot of the movie and it is allright however it is ruined by the terrible acting, the horrible screenplay, outdated camera work and direction and bad music. Whitney is terrible in this film and she is worse than Mariah. Kevin isn´t very good either and I belive this is the film that made everyone hate Kevin Costner. The Bodyguard is also long and in many scenes nothing happens. This film premiered in late 1992 became one of the decade´s most successful film grossing over 410 million at the box-office around the world and the soundtrack became also one of the decade´s biggest selling LP with more than 33 million copies sold worldwide. I Believe the only reason why this film did anything is because of the soundtrack which isn´t anything special either. It just shows you how many people have bad taste. Don´t Overall grade: 3/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the misfortune to see this film when it was first released. A decade on, and my hatred for this puerile stinker remains unabated.Think of your very worst celluloid nightmare. Multiply it by a hundred and you are only a fraction of the way to realising what an artistic shambles this film really is. Even "The Swarm" had some redeeming features.All the depressingly familiar ingredients are here: wooden acting, stilted dialogue and warbly singing. It's overlong, overrated and features one of the most irritating soundtracks in the history of American cinema, which makes me want to stick pins into a wax work effigy of Dolly Parton every time I hear it.Mow the lawn, bath the dog, watch paint dry. I implore you do anything but watch this film.How the respected British Director, Mick Jackson, became involved with this outrage is anyone's guess. Back in 1984, he brought us one of the most disturbing and innovative films ever shown on British TV called "Threads". Perhaps he should attempt to combine the two films together. Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner disappearing under a mushroom cloud - now that's what I call a happy ending!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kevin Costner was right to insist that Whitney Houston costar in this film. All doubts were removed after she nailed the screen test the other producers insisted upon before they would agree.This may have been her film debut, but she came across as extremely believable in her role. Yes, it was a bit hackneyed, especially with the addition of Ralph Waite as Costner's father, but it was still very enjoyable.If you watch it for nothing else, the music was sensational. In fact, the soundtrack sold 100 million copies. It was that good. I Have Nothing and Run to You even got Oscar and Grammy nominations.It's a very good film to sit back and enjoy just for Whitney's singing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the greatest soundtracks of all time linked to one of the lamest movies of all time.The entire premise of the movie is a bodyguard, played by Kevin Costner, out to protect a rock singer, played by Whitney Houston, and the 2 fall in love. But outside of that, there is no story. No plot. Nothing to make it watchable.However, its soundtrack is still one of the best soundtracks to date. Especially with one of the best love songs of all time, "I will always love you." In fact without the soundtrack, the movie would have died on its first weekend. The song is the whole premise of the movie "The Bodyguard," while the movie itself is 2 hours of aimless garbage.Without the soundtrack, the Bodyguard is at best zero out of ten. But even with the soundtrack, it still rounds out to a disappointing 2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually one can count on high production values to make even a bad Kevin Costner movie interesting. Alas, despite having high production values, "The Bodyguard" was a bore. Let me count the ways: slow plot, preposterous story, and bad acting -- particularly by Whitney Houston. In fairness, I should say that the completely unbelievable conduct of Houston's character does serve to make her performance seem even worse than it was. Costner does not a bad faux Steve McQueen as the existential and dour (depressed?) athletic pretty boy, Frank Farmer. But his performance does not save the film. Indeed, I doubt that De Niro could have saved it. Spend two hours and ten minutes elsewhere; not recommended; 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A boring mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**POSSIBLE MINOR PLOT SPOILERS** Superstar Rachel Marron (Whitney Houston) is receiving death threats and fears for her life. She hires a high-priced but excellent bodyguard Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner). They hate each other at first but naturally fall in love. Utterly predictable and a real mess. There are so many things wrong with this movie it's hard to know where to start. First off Costner's haircut is terrible! Seriously, it's so bad you look at it in amazement. I realize he did it because Steve McQueen was originally supposed to be in it--but that's still a stupid reason. The script is just lousy--full of terrible lines and the plot really doesn't make a lot of sense. The romantic sequences between Costner and Houston are so horribly written and acted that it's almost embarrassing. Purportedly Houston and Costner got along during the filming but they don't show any sparks on the screen. The acting doesn't help. Costner plays the movie with a blank expression on his face throughout (but that DOES fit his character). Houston is a very beautiful woman and a fantastic singer--but she can't act. A few times I was actually smirking at her terrible attempts at acting. An overblown overdone mess of a movie. Very dull too.Also if you're seeing this for the music don't bother. Houston sings four songs that all became hits (especially "I Will Always Love You") but you never hear the full versions of the songs in the movie! You might hear the beginning and middle but never the whole thing. Despite all this though audiences in 1992 loved it. It was a huge hit and was nominated for two Academy Awards (for the music). So, use your own judgment. Also Debbie Reynolds turns in a pointless cameo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't care if people say it's a chick flick. I don't see it that way. I think this movie was a great start for Houston's acting career. The character of Rachel Marron was complex, and her personality clashing with Fram Farmer's set the tone for this movie.I quite enjoyed the soundtrack as well. The music as well as Rachel's performances at various stages of the plot fit perfectly with the mood. The "Queen of the Night" performance was out of control, as was the situation at that point in the movie.What can I say about the end? A perfect ending for a chick like me, I suppose. On a more serious note, I liked how the movie wasn't perfectly happy and warm at the end. It was obvious that these two could not be together at this point in their lives, because they got in each other's way. But, that does not rule out the possibility of them finding one another again later on down the line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Music superstar is threatened by a twisted fan and so hires a stolid bodyguard to protect her--and quickly falls in love with him. Nonsensical rubbish served as the debut acting vehicle for real-life music diva Whitney Houston, who does passable work off the stage. Kevin Costner, on the other hand, is enervated beyond belief; his brand of low-keyed machismo isn't in tune with the general air of camp inherent in this tacky scenario--he doesn't seem to be in on the joke and comes off seeming tired and indifferent. This got by with audiences via Houston's musical numbers; otherwise it is second-string stuff, with a script that makes very little sense, tossing ideas at the screen with no point or purpose. Disappointing throughout. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overblown, overheated, overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Annoyingly stupid movie, meant to launch Whitney Houston's acting career and, apparently, Kevin Costner's fallback career as a model for terrible haircuts. Houston is, of course, gorgeous and sings like an angel, but her acting "talent" is nowhere to be seen, and her ineptness brings down the whole movie--not that it had a lot going for it in the first place. After Houston, playing a pop diva, starts getting death threats from an obsessed and obviously crazed fan, Costner--a former Secret Service agent--is hired to protect her. Instead of showing appreciation for his efforts to save the lives of her and her family, however, Houston proceeds to fight him at every turn, insulting him, mocking his attempts to turn her house into a secure area and generally making a complete ass of herself, and her attitude spreads to her entourage and hangers-on, all of whom turn on Costner. In the real world Costner's character would have told her to screw off after the first day and dumped her, but--in a plot "twist" you can see coming a mile away--they proceed to fall in love. Yeah, right.Anyway, like I said, Houston is great to look at, her voice is divine, and Costner tries hard, but overall this movie is not much more than an extended episode of "General Hospital" or some other equally brainless soap opera, and is just as predictable and badly acted. Houston's fans will like it, Costner's fans might like it, but anyone else is strongly advised to avoid it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bodyguard (1992)Plot In A Paragraph: Frank Farmer (KC) a former Secret Service agent takes on the job of bodyguard to a singing superstar Rachel Marron (Whitney Houston)Whilst I do not rate The Bodyguard as high as some people do. It is an enjoyable movie, I happen to have watched it a lot in recent years, and I always like it, but I can go years without feeling the need to revisit it.It is hard to say what I don't like, as it's nothing in particular, I just find the directing a bit flat, and at times the actors are poorly framed. I remember I loved it when it was released, but by the time I watched it again on video, my opinion if it, had dropped considerably. The soundtrack is very effective, all the new songs are catchy and for the second year in a row, the single to a KC movie dominates the charts. I knew the song I Will Always Love You from the Burt Reynolds/Dolly Parton movie The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas. And whilst I still call it a Dolly Parton song, I know many call it a Whitney Houston one, and think of her version as the definitive one. Of the cast, in her first movie Houston is very good. I'm surprised she didn't make more movies (she only made 4 more) as the talent was there. It's another less is more performance from KC, similar to his performance in The Untouchables, but it's still effective here, and he has some good, witty lines. All the supporting cast are fine too. The film had to undergo some hasty re-cutting when test audiences hated the original ending with Farmer dying after saving Marron. I remember KC saying in an interview, that he didn't even understand the new ending to the movie. Sadly for me the tacked on happier ending ruins things a bit!! As Farmer is clearly shot in the chest and gut at Oscars, but he turns up at the airport with his arm in a sling. It was another $100 million plus grosser for KC as The Bodyguard finished the year the 7th highest grossing movie of 1992, with a domestic gross of $121 million. 8/10 for this reviewer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston star in this 1992 drama. Costner (The Untouchables) plays Frank Farmer, an ex-secret service agent who is hired to protect feisty, pop singer, Rachel Marron (Houston) who has an obsessed, crazed fan threatening her. After getting off to a rocky start, Frank and Rachel get romantically involved with each other in the process and he also gets to know her family too. This is a good romantic drama with a few suspenseful moments, Costner &amp; Houston are great in it, had good chemistry with each other and who can forget Houston's hit song, "I Will Always Love You." Also, the late, Steve McQueen and Diana Ross were originally considered for the leads. I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I will always love you, movie, even if you're a bit mediocre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Houston, we don't have a problem. At least, not in 1992. In 1992, both Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston could do no, wrong. At the time, Kevin Costner was one of America's most accomplished thespians and Whitney Houston was one of the most popular singers. When you combine them, in the movie, 'the Bodyguard'. You get a semi-OK-masterpiece. This schmaltzy proposal for this film was rejected 67 times before Kevin Costner got the rights. It was originally written by Lawrence Kasdan for Steve McQueen and Diana Ross in the 1970s. Directed by Mick Jackson, the movie tells the story of Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner), a former Secret Service Agent for the President, who became the private bodyguard for international pop star and actress, Rachel Marron (Whitney Houston) after she been, receiving death threats from a dangerous stalker. Can Frank save Rachel or will the killer win out in the end? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling too much of the film, I found Kevin Costner's acting in this, pretty dull. I know, that his character is supposed to be stern, but gees? they could have, lighten up, the character, a bit. Even, in the lake scenes. He was pretty blend. Despite, that, he made a pretty realistic bodyguard. He was also, a pretty cool, action star at the time. He deserve more credit for this movie, from stopping it from totally tanking with his action scenes. The scene where he was chasing the killer, through the woods was intense. Kevin Costner was so insistent that Whitney Houston and no other black singer/actress play the part that the film production waited 1 year for Whitney to be available to film. In my opinion, it was a good choice. She was a good singer, but not a good actress, even when seemingly playing a variation of herself. Whitney Houston as Rachel, was mediocre, at best. I give her some credit, for at least, trying to act. She did suffered a miscarriage during production and missed a couple of weeks of production recovering, and you can't tell, by her performance, how truly depress, she must have, been at the time. I just glad, Whitney Houston's character wasn't playing like a gimmicky black singer stereotype. Still, most of the movie, I felt that her character was a bit annoying. Even, test audiences, couldn't stand all, her b*tching as the film had to undergo some hasty re-cutting. Still, with those cuts, her character never truly understood, how much, she was in danger, even when, things became really serious and it bugs the living hell out of me. I know, she supposed to play a diva, but I didn't like, how much, Rachel and Frank fought against each other over, how much protection, she needs. It made the romance seem so unrealistic. I didn't think, that the actors have that much chemistry on film. Still, they both look, beautiful, together. One thing that I kinda love about the film, is how brave, the filmmakers were in showing interracial relationships. Even in the 1990s, seeing this was rare. Houston's mainstream appeal allowed people to look at the movie color-blind, and never once, did I find the fact that a black woman and white guy falling in love, jarring. Still, controversy arose as some felt the film's advertising intentionally hid Houston's face to hide the film's interracial relationship. I think, this was made to keep, the movie from being spoiled. The reason The Bodyguard scored more than $410 million worldwide is not, because of the two stars sex appeal. It's the film soundtrack, which to date, as of this writing, stands as the highest selling in movie history. It features six songs by Whitney Houston, including "Queen of the Night," a remake of Chaka Khan's "I'm Every Woman," "I've Got Nothing," and, of course, her signature cover of Dolly Parton's "I Will Always Love You." Although her songs make up half of the soundtrack, she is credited for the album's popularity, which in turn drove people to see the film. Two songs from the film, "Run to You" and "I Have Nothing", were nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Song. While, 'I will always love you' got her, multiply rewards and became one of the best-selling single by a woman in music history. The character of Rachel was originally going to sing "What Becomes of the Broken Hearted" instead of "I Will Always Love You", before 1991's film, Fried Green Tomatoes used the former song. Kevin Costner is the one who wanted the song written by Dolly Parton to be sung by Whitney Houston. He convinced Whitney to sing it "a capella" for the movie. Whitney's rendition became so good, that Dolly Parton pretty much, disowned it and gave it to Whitney. Regardless of whether you're a Houston fan, her talent as a singer is what makes the movie halfway watchable. If this movie was made today, it might be an all-out-disaster. Both celebrities went into a shaky time in the late 1990s/early 2000s. While, Whitney Houston's career never really, bound-back, to the success of this film and its soundtrack. She did have some minor hits, before dying in 2012, in a drowning/drug overdose accident. Kevin Costner was able to have some success after his double whammy of post-apocalypse sci-fi flops movies in the mid-1990s, and his career is still going strong. In many ways, he always thought of this movie, as one of his greatest works, and always felt open in making a sequel or remaking it. Celebrities like Rihanna, and Princess Diana was once sought for re-dos. Who knows, if a sequel will be made? Overall: Yes, it could had been better, but I quite enjoyed the film. I do recommended, at least, seeing it, once. In the end, if you don't bother watching the film. At least, try to listen to the soundtrack. You'll probably enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Song and Creepy Irony</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Will Always Love You will be remembered for a long time with this movie. In fact, singers imitating Whitney Houston are still winning Karoke Contests using this song 20 years later. The power of this song is perhaps more powerful than the film itself.Still I would argue this film is one of the roles which helped establish Kevin Costner's career as he is excellent in his title role. Whitney Houston gets to play herself in a lot of ways here which makes her acting very effective. There is a lot good about this film.The creepy part is hindsight. While the body guard in this has to deal with an insane killer trying to shoot Whitney, the reality is she really needed a bodyguard for an entirely different reason - to stop her substance abuse. Her line "I am not a morning person" is one of the cliché lines of a person with that problem. That makes the film creepy in a real retrospect fashion.When you look at Houston in this film, she looks as great as she ever has. She is actually portrayed as a beautiful young rock star who her fans and a lot of others would fall in love with. I have the same feelings for her here as many would in that her character portrays success in the way that it is often achieved, at the loss of a personal life for the star. The script then exploits that perfectly by having her fall in love with her Bodyguard. That makes all too much sense and I have felt often that singers who die too soon tragically like Houston has fit the way the script is written like a glove.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK romantic thriller with some good scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the most part, this is a passable love story with thriller elements thrown in. It's easy to watch. What's odd is that Whiteney Houston, who is not an experienced actress, gives a more believable performance than veteran actor Kevin Costner. Costner has done well in other movies but was wooden here. He's trying to do a Steve McQueen cooler-than-cool turn, but he seems like a wind-up toy soldier. Also worthy of censure is Costner's haircut, which was rightly criticized at the time. Houston is convincing enough, but it's because she's essentially playing herself. They have a love scene, which was also OK but nothing memorable. There is the supporting cast, which is good enough but nothing memorable. The screenplay is occasionally exciting but usually routine and not always believable. Costner's character probably wouldn't have been in the secret service to begin with if he's traumatized by a shooting that took place when he was off duty at a funeral. The soundtrack is the real star and this film features some great songs. Also praiseworthy is the ending, which was one of the few parts to avoid romantic clichés. It's very easy watching and will appeal to fervent fans of Whiteney Houston and romantic drama.</fullReview>

The bodyguard is haunted by the fact that he was on Reagan's secret service staff but wasn't there to prevent the attack by Hinckley.Eventually the bodyguard and the singer start an affair, and she begins to believe his precautions are necessary when the stalker strikes close to home.....remember back in the day when whatever film Costner was in it was Gold? well this was released at the height of his popularity, and Costner has never had a hit this huge since. Modelling himself on Steve McQueen, Costner id everything you would expect him to be.Brooding at first, but eventually becoming a man with a heart of gold and being friends with everyone. But the real reason to watch this film is Houston, and to be fair on her, she isn't all that bad, but is as what you would expect, all attitude and 'mmmm hmmmm', until you discover that she has a heart of gold too. It's just that the two of them can't swallow their prides to tell each other how they feel, until the very last frame.And somewhere in the film, there is some plot about someone wanting to kill Houston with sarcasm and threatening letters, and it's not who it would seem.It's inoffensive stuff, very easy to watch and as equally enjoyable, just don't expect too many people to admit it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I too have seen this movie at the theater a long time ago, and the memory of it was on the positive side as I've always appreciate K Kostner's work and don't mind W Houston voice although I would not go as far as declaring myself one of her fans. Yet her rendition of the song is so powerful, it has to be taken noticed of! So today when it was screened on our TV screen I decided to have another go at it and certainly do feel it was a worthwhile decision! I enriched my feelings about this film, beside my own, reading very interesting entries in IMDb. I understand now why Kevin Kostner reminded me so much of Steve Mc Queen. I won't repeat what others have already very well said and what is also fairly well documented in that regard. I am a little surprised too by the low average rating of what I think is a very entertaining movie and do share the thought that someone expressed already here; something like: There are too many snobs "would be critiques" who look at this kind of work as it it was a piece of art fated to go in a dusty museum shelf and studied under a microscope for every possible imperfection, instead of its entertainment value. I consider myself having been well entertained and I guess I should give it a 10 just to rectify the balance, but who's counting! I did not feel W Houston acting was that bad either and what she delivered, to me, was fairly appropriate. A successful, talented singer who enjoyed the ride and wanted to make the best of it. Something I believe she did with her career anyway. So she probably just had to be herself anyway.</fullReview>

It is also interesting how you get to see 'behind the scenes' of a person who is a mega-star. You get a little peek into the private life that you might not see otherwise.At times the film feels lurid and soapy. But other times it is fascinating. Kevin Costner did a very good job here and looks so handsome. He really gave his character life here. Whitney Houston also does a good job and it wasn't any stretch at all to believe her portrayal of the big star singer. Probably a film that women would enjoy more than men but despite the flaws, I did enjoy it. I don't think it ever became too sappy. I think the reason for the attacks on the star are probably the weakest point of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whatever films I comment on this site, The Bodyguard was clearly a movie that saw Kevin Costner's film career start to wane through highs and lows where to this day, he makes frequent appearances in inferior films and because I did not read any reviews from the film critics when this 1992 film first came out, The Bodyguard looked to be promising due to the number of promotions it had with a TV commercial or movie posters displayed at lit-up bus stop shelters and shop windows.However, a couple of years later when I viewed it on the living room box, I couldn't believe what a stinker this turned out to be and even seeing the average ratings given in the TV guides for one of the biggest problems with this film is that turned out to be rather dull for a number of reasons with the plot about a bodyguard assigned to protect a celebrity singer played by one Whitney Houston, fictitious or not! Even if some say that Costner was miscast as the minder, then Houston's "off-stage" part is so annoying as if she cared less about her own safety from a mob of deranged fans and behaves like a spoilt child and all I can say, considering the number of promotions this film received around the time it hit box office in the early 1990s, its such a waste,</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hopefully, you won't be left in the dark about the ending of this one. Very predictable, poorly acted, poorly conceived. If this is meant to have suspense in it, I'll be surprised. That's the only surprise about this movie. Watch the first five minutes. You'll know the plot, the "twists" and all. Then fall asleep like I did. Watch the last five minutes to confirm what you already know to be true. You'll have a great nap and know you solved a "twisted" plot with no effort whatsoever. If you can handle watching old Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston's lack of chemistry which is supposed to be so much a part of her motivations (and his), try to watch it all the way through. Like I said, at least you'll get a good nap out of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Bodyguard" is simply one of the decade's worst films. There is no chemistry between Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston at all. Another problem with this movie is its slow pace. The story just keeps dragging along with no plot development. "The Bodyguard" is one of the few movies you can start watching, leave, come back a half hour later and nothing would have changed. Frankly, if I had to choose what side to take, it would be the one of the assassin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable fluff suitable for Houston debut.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bodyguard has a history behind it that should have served as a warning to Lawrence Kasden and Kevin Costner when they considered making this film. Of course after the box office that this film grossed, (it made a lot) I am certain they don't see it that way. The script for this film was originally intended as a vehicle for Clint Eastwood with Diana Ross to star as the female lead. I'm not too sure what happened over the years, but the script sat in limbo and the stars got too old to play those parts. Kevin Costner got the script and originally wanted Madonna to play the female lead. A bad mistake, to say the least, but suffice it to say, she turned it down. In the end Whitney Houston, who was looking for something to launch her inevitable movie career took the part and history was made.The Bodyguard is the story of a former secret service agent, Frank Farmer, who can't forgive himself for the fact that he had the day off the day that Ronald Reagan was shot. I'm sure Jim Brady would have some choice words for this guy. (In the original script, Eastwood would have been agonizing over the Kennedy assassination.) To console himself he works as a bodyguard for private citizens.His latest job offer is for pop diva, Rachael Marron. She has a stalker after her and her people are keeping her in the dark as what is going on. Even though Frank doesn't do celebrities, Rachael's people convince him to take the case. And from here the story moves on its predictable course. Naturally Frank and Rachael do not get along at first. He's the serious type who puts all of his energy into his work. She's the bitchy type who puts all of her energy into her work. Frank finds fault in Rachael's current security and goes to great lengths to fix everything. At the same time, a list of suspects start to come out of the wood work. It seems that Rachael has a few enemies in her jealous sister, her over eager publicist, her macho bodyguard and some freaky looking albino guy who can't stop following her. Some mayhem occurs, and of course Frank and Rachael start to fall for each other. Kevin Costner is by far the most boring actor ever and this film simply serves to prove that, even though he over acts to the bitter end. Whitney Houston is OK playing the disco queen from hell, however something tells me she didn't have to stretch too much for this one. All in all the film follows along the typical Hollywood path of boy meets girl, boy hates girl, boy has sex with girl, boy and girl fight the bad guys and so on. The Bodyguard is a movie that I suggest you pass on, particularly if you like some depth in your films. Whitney fans should stick to the sound track. Costner fans should stick to some of his better films, like Field of Dreams and Dances with Wolves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has a dark atmosphere, which is something I love about it. It's not like most love stories. This movie is so different from a typical romance film. It doesn't just focus on the romance, it focuses on Rachel's career, the stalker, Frank's resistance to grow close to his client. That's what makes this movie so special. "The Bodyguard" is one of Whitney's best performances. You can tell she is in her prime with her career. She and Kevin Costner are outstanding in their performances. I love the performances throughout the movie most..Kevin Costner portrays Frank Farmer, a no-nonsense bodyguard hired by the singers associates that struggles with Marron's devotion to her career and her own deluded view that she is invincible. Houston plays a character that parallels her real life, an accomplished actress and singer who is being stalked by an obsessive fan. Bodyguard was to be the big vehicle to launch Houston into a mega film career. Although Houston's performance is commendable for her first film effort, her shining moments in the film are when she showcases the soundtrack, which is incredible. Costner is strong in his stern, powerful role. If you like a who-done-it film, amazing music, watching Kevin Costner, as well as just the right mix of romance and damsel in distress, you've got to get The Bodyguard (and get the soundtrack while you're at it).Overall rating: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it to remember Whitney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I vividly remember the stranglehold Whitney Houston had on the closing months of 1992 because of THE BODYGUARD, but I didn't remember much about the actual movie. I wasn't expecting much, and I guess that's why it exceeded expectations. . . but only just.Whitney for the most part fits what the role requires: stuck-up, naturally über-talented; she doesn't need much range. This whole thing rests on the shoulders of whoever's playing her protector. And Costner's decent here; he gets to flex his action movie muscle with a sweet dive through a window into a crouch, although he's frequently got that anxious trying-to-remember-my-next-line look on his face (unusual for him). He's got a ridiculous character name - but also drives an El Camino. The man is complicated.But on the whole, the movie never rises above mediocrity. It's a love story without passion and the tension doesn't come until the last ten minutes of the movie (which it really needed much earlier). But I also didn't feel like quitting before the credits rolled, which kinda surprised me. I can see why it was the IT movie of its time (it's very '92, like a shot-for-MTV snapshot of the period), but staying power is not one of its virtues.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An undeniable classic thriller, Costner at the very height of his career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bodyguard was always one of my favourite Costner flicks. I am a huge Costner fan even though he has slipped from Hollywood stardom in the last few years. I hadn't seen The Bodyguard in awhile and wanted to review it so I sat down to enjoy it again. I was surprised to discover that I found it a little slow at times, that it looked a little dated, and while I still enjoyed my favourite parts, the grainy and gritty romantic thriller definitely ages itself. But don't let that discourage you. The film is still a classic of its time. The pace of the film is definitely methodical, it doesn't apologize for taking its time to really lay out the characters and the mystery surround the stalker. The characters are all very well developed and the chemistry between Costner and Houston is really what makes this film, and the music of course. Houston's soundtrack to the film is formidable, and brilliant and you buy her as an insanely successful pop princess because she was and still is.Kevin Costner's Frank Farmer is this brooding, seemingly hardened former Secret Service agent. He enters the film mysteriously but you learn more about him throughout the film. Its really a great character and I can't imagine for minute anyone other than Costner playing the role. The late and legendary Whitney Houston plays Rachel Marron. She's the hot headed, short tempered diva but her character takes a lot of turns too and she definitely becomes more likable though she really does remain a diva throughout. Her and Costner are just sexy and brilliant together. The film has a terrific supporting cast including Bill Cobbs, Gary Kemp, Tomas Arana and Mike Starr should be called out for especially strong supporting performances. Michele Lamar Richards does an okay job as Marron's sister Nicki. I always thought she was one of the poorer performances in the film which is really unfortunate especially being what a big important part she has in the film. DeVaughn Nixon does a decent job as Marron's son Fletcher.Everyone works very well together and some of the chemistry (as previously mentioned) is truly great while others go a little understated like Houston and Richards as sisters. Director Mick Jackson was really just getting his legs under him when he directed this film. He does a good job, his direction is decent, but the pacing could have definitely been better handled by more experience. I think he got lucky with a strong cast, especially the stars, and a well written story. Regardless of its few flaws and its slow pace, The Bodyguard is a nineties classic and must see viewing for Costner fans and Houston fans. Its the perfect romantic thriller for a quiet date night. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Bodyguard" is bookended by two very excellent scenes.Everything in between those scenes is primarily interesting in the way it condenses a number of very powerful fantasies. So you have the fantasy of a celebrity falling in love with a regular guy, of the chivalrous knight rescuing the princess, of being the "strong silent type" who can't help it that ladies (and their kids and sisters) fall for you, and for the ladies, you have a man dedicating his life to defending you, your nest and your kids.The film was directed by Mick Jackson, a television director. His direction is plain, but the film channels well the tone of 1960s/1970s crime movies ("Point Blank", anything by Siegel, Peckinpah, Steve McQueen etc). Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner are our stars, he doing a monosyllabic Steve McQueen routine, she a bit abrasive in front of the camera. Their romance is underwritten."Bodyguard" movies were all the rage in the late 80s/early 90s, think "Terminator 2", "The Specialist", "In The Line Of Fire" etc. Why is this? Pop culture and pop music have a lifespan of a few months if you're lucky, today's fad swiftly turning into tomorrow's joke. All this film's "hollywood", "MTV", "music" and "popstar" moments thus now look tacky, changing trends having rendered them silly. Costner's the only artifact who's survived, his character modelled after Kurosawa's "Yojimbo" and other Samurai flicks. Like McQueen often did, Costner strips his character down to the bare minimum, leaving time with nothing to take away.7.5/10 ? "The Bodyguard" made zillions at the box office, writer Lawrence Kasdan and actor/producer Kevin Costner hitting upon a script that condensed a powerful set of very archetypal fantasies. The film is worth watching for its opening and closing scenes. Plans are currently underway for a remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Kevin Costner as ex secret service agent Frank Farmer looks genuinely board stiff as his role demands him to be guarding the body of singer and actress Rachel Marron, Whitney Houston, as her bodyguard in "The Bodyguard". Coaster or Farmer walks around looking so deadpan throughout most of the movie that he seems to be suffering from a serious case of shell shock from his previous job as a secret service agent. It's a habit that he picked up over the years guarding both Presidents Carter and Regan in him being able to blend in with the furniture or background in him remaining inconspicuous, to any attempted assassins, on he job. Taking on an assignment at the insistence of his good friend Mr. Dewaney, Bill Cobbs, to be Miss Marron's personal bodyguard the company that he surrounds herself with get so intrusive in him doing his job that he almost quits before he begins. It's Rachel's sweet looks and bubbling personality that keeps him on the job guarding her and also the fact that those in her entourage of flunkies and hanger on being so completely incompetent in doing their jobs that makes him stay.We and Farmer know right away that someone out there is trying to do Rachel in but that fact is kept from her by those around her that makes Farmer's job that much more difficult. Acting as if she doesn't have a care or fear in the world Rachel doesn't realize that her life and body, the body that Farmer is guarding with his life, is in serious danger. It's only much later when Rachel gets a disturbing pone call, on her private phone number, that she finally gives in and lets Farmer do his job protecting her life. It's her obsessed fan and stalker who's planning to whack her at the biggest moment in Rachel's life when she's to accept the Academy Award for best actress with over a billion people watching the great event live and on TV all over the globe.***SPOILERS*** The love angle in the movie doesn't quite pan out with Farmer and Marron never really clicking in their love scenes that come across mechanical and not genuine at all. Farmer for one is so intense in all of his scenes that showing affection towards Rachel seems out of character for him in the movie. It's only in the last few moments that Farmer gets his act together in realizing who's out to knock off Rachel that he really seems to care for Rachel and tries to save her life even at the expense of his own. But by then she's so turned off by his almost zombie or robot like action that she almost allows her intended killer to do her in by not believing or responding to Farmers frantic attempts to save her life.Both Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston as Frank Farmer &amp; Rachel Marro did their best to make their parts in the movie work and the final payoff with a by then a disgraced, in letting things get out of hand, Farmer saving Rachel's life which saved the film from being total disaster. It was sad that the film "The Bodyguard" in a way predicted its star Whitney Houston's actual death some 20 years later in 2012. It was then just like in the movie Whitney faced death this time in her hotel bathtub, not from an assassin's bullet, just before she was to receive a Grammy for her music like an Academy Award for her acting in "The Bodygurad". But this time in real life not in the movies the outcome was sadly a lot different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Melodramatic Love Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bodyguard is a romantic thriller film starring Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston. Costner stars as a former Secret Service Agent-turned- bodyguard who is hired to protect Houston's character, a music star, from an unknown stalker. Lawrence Kasdan wrote the film in the 1970's, originally as a vehicle for Steve McQueen and Diana Ross.It was directed by Mick Jackson. When imperious musical superstar Rachel Marron begins receiving death threats, she is compelled to hire a bodyguard. An ex-Secret Service agent, Frank still hasn't purged himself of his guilt feelings over his inability to protect from an assassination of the President of the United States.He is now a highly successful private and professional bodyguard who protects corporate VIPs. He is hired by Rachel's manager, Bill Devaney to protect her after she receives a number of threats against her life and a small bomb detonates in her dressing room.Gradually,Rachel and Frank fall in love. This 1992 crowd pleaser made almost as much money for Whitney Houston as its chart-busting soundtrack. A high-wattage star vehicle as only Hollywood can make as she is baring her tonsils with a rousing rendition of the Dolly Parton chestnut "I Will Always Love You".Overall,it is a cheesy, melodramatic potboiler with occasional moments of electricity.But nevertheless,it does contain a love story, but it's the kind of guarded passion that grows between two people who spend a lot of time keeping their priorities straight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's taken me a while to see this movie, and now that I have, I really just didn't like it. I had heard about this movie before Houston's death, but I still didn't really want to see it. I really wasn't interested at all. When she died, there was a lot of talk about her movie with Kevin Costner, and his eulogy was very moving to me. He spoke a lot about the movie, and around the time of her death, people kept talking about it and how good it was. So I added it to my Netflix queue, still not really expecting much, and I got just what I was expecting. The movie seemed very lazy to me, put together and didn't really come off as a movie of a specific genre. This movie is for people who want to hear Whitney Houston's voice, which is quite an amazing singing voice. I have nothing against Whitney, I just didn't like the movie. She was an amazing talent, but I just didn't like the movie very much.The first five minutes of the movie had me interested, I won't lie. The story of the movie goes something like this: a former Secret Service agent is hired by a pop singer to be her bodyguard, after a murder attempt. Once he arrives to meet her, he realizes how much security she is lacking. She is a very famous pop singer, and yet she is living in the most vulnerable way. When he meets the pop singer, Rachel Marron, that's where things started to get a little "eh" for me. I knew it was Houston's first movie debut, but I just couldn't buy it. As much as I tried, I really couldn't see Houston as an actress. I see her as a singer, and that's what she should've stayed as. To me, she was very unconvincing as Rachel Marron, even though she was practically playing herself. She just wasn't good at acting through this whole movie, and I just didn't like it for that. But there's more reasons to why I didn't like this movie. I couldn't stand the way this movie bounced across genres. What was this supposed to be? There are different genres that can be combined, like an action-comedy. Two genres in one, that's usually the limit in which a movie can stay good. But this movie had way too many genres, and it was hard to keep up with. Is it a romance? Is it an action movie? Is it a thriller? Is it a comedy? Drama? Music? It goes on and on, and Mick Jackson just tried to jam-pack all of these into a movie that was two hours long, and that was just painful for me to watch. They could've made the changes make sense at least, and have them move from one to the other in a smooth way. These genres were put together in a five minute scene, where it starts with Houston singing, an ominous person, a shootout, then a romance scene between Costner and Houston. I couldn't stand it, it was too sloppy for me.I would avoid this movie, but I know a bunch of people like it. But I'm a cinema fan, and I see movies for their value. A lot of people liked it, for they saw it as a romance movie. But I see it as a movie that's overloaded. 3/10</fullReview>

It did pick up somewhat as the plot thickened. As for Costner, as the over-zealous agent, he was never better. What makes the film so good is the believable plot twists that are discovered. All does not seem to appear what it should be regarding a former agent as well as the woman who portrays Houston's sister and secretary.

The kid obviously doesn't know how to ride the boat, so if he goes too far, what is Kevin's character supposed to swim for 15 minutes in freezing water to get to him? No. So he didn't take a chance and jumped to prevent the kid of getting away and going too far.

Mutual attraction will place limits on both of their lives - if they manage to stay safe for long enough, that is...Costner is well-suited to playing the stoic and intense action man, and casting Whitney Houston as a singer allows her a fairly comfortable start in the movies. They make an appealing enough couple and their chemistry together is of the simmering type. Some have criticised the leading female, but I believe her underplaying works well enough that we can glimpse a vulnerable dimension to her character.The whole thing seems content to serve as a glossy potboiler for the shameless romantic - and help to shift millions of soundtrack units along the way, of course. It's something of an easy sell, I suppose, but I'm still left admiring how it's packaged. A triple handkerchief affair for some females, no doubt, but it's flashy enough in certain spots to be of moderate interest to the guys too. Cross-gender appeal is what Hollywood strives for, and they hit upon a smooth and stylish blend here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A successful and bad movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why was the "Bodyguard" so successful at the box office? I know the reasons. Does it mean that it's a good movie? That all depends on who you ask. The Bodyguard is a story that only appeals to one's emotions and never intellect or depth. This movie has a very weak script. The plot is just elongated with the spirit of your typical love story formula. And it touches on all the essential romantic buttons to have girls flocking to the theater. No it will never be heralded as a masterpiece and it even lacks the depth of movies like, "Love Story" and "The way we were". First off, the pairing of Houston and Costner was unique and somehow drew you in. Houston plays herself pretty much; the spoiled, talented and exceptionally beautiful pop star. Costner plays the dry, uptight and boorish professional bodyguard. They are both opposites, but that is what makes the love story intriguing. Costner has been bashed for his boringness, dullness and lack of charisma. He never really qualified as a leading man in my opinion. But here it somehow works, because Houston's beauty was more revealing as a foil to his bland as goat milk persona. And Whitney Houston was at the height of her career and beauty in 1992, and Costner was at his prime as well. Intellectuals and film critics are more likely to be annoyed by this sappy and overblown love tale. But there are those that just can't help but be immersed in the romance intrigue of it. This is your rare and typical successful bad movie that ranks up there in the same phenomenon as "Rambo", "Terminator 2", etc. Brainless films that just appeal to our senses and emotions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most emblematic romances of the 90's ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1992 left two romantic moments for cinematic posterity, both musically immortalized: the magic carpet ride in "Aladdin" where "A Whole New World" opened itself to Jasmine's dazzled eyes, and Kevin Costner protecting Whitney Houston from the riot that just interrupted her concert. While the song is never heard at that moment, we all visualize it with "I Will Always Love You" playing in the background. That image of Houston in Costner's arms is one of the most defining of the romantic nineties, Houston's feet never touched the ground but her soul touched our hearts forever and even more after her untimely passing, last year.It's the mark of great movies to be able to capture the soul of a relationship by only using the simplicity of images and music: a film like "Titanic" will always be remembered for the flying-over-the-boat moment and "My Heart Will Go On", "Ghost" for the pottery scene erotically conducted with the "Unchained Melody", and "Dirty Dancing" when Johnny gives Baby the time of her life after putting her off the corner, and so on and so forth. And whether the film is good or bad becomes almost pointless when it reaches such a classic status. Cinema is not a rational world you know, imagery, lyrics, music have their 'word' to say and sometimes it transcends any attempt of an objective reasoning.My tone is partly defensive because I'm aware of "The Bodyguard"'s reputation, I know that the film met with mixed to negative critics, that it was panned for its formulaic story, for the wooden performance of Kevin Costner, the eternal Razzie's scapegoat, and even Whitney Houston, didn't escape from criticism. "The Bodyguard" would almost need a bodyguard of critic to reply to its harsh disapproval. But I believe a film is also to judge in retrospect, at the light of what it has become and what has generally become of Cinema for the years after. Take all the movies I mentioned, with the exception of "Titanic", a few romances ever make it now to the top highest grossing films of the year. We thought the 90's to be 'cynical' but in comparison with the 2010's, it's the 60's.Today, most successful films are action blockbusters / Pixar / Marvel adventures' adaptations or successful franchises, the recipe for success is clearly established, and a film like "The Bodyguard" wouldn't have necessarily worked or even been considered to be made. Take the script, written 20 years before the release (for Steve McQueen and Diana Ross as the leads): a former ex-Secret Service Agent is assigned to protect a pop star whose life is threatened by a stalker, the material is simple but it's only through the casting that Mick Jackson elevates it, by confronting two of the then most inevitable faces of show-business. Costner is Frank Farmer and Houston Rachel Marron, but we all know she's playing herself, like Ava Gardner in "The Barefoot Contessa", she gets a role tailor-made for her, and a powerful testimony for the person, that she was.Marron is Houston, and vice versa, a diva whose talent and unique voice brought her on the top of the billboards and the kind of spotlight that unveils the darkest side of stardom. As Costner said in his eulogy: "anyone could have played the leading man, but only Whitney Houston could have played that part"; in one sense, he was right, even a star like Madonna wouldn't have fit the film. She already played in movies, which would have damaged her credibility as a 'vulnerable' star. Houston showed enough strength to convince us as a diva (because she was one) but she was fragile enough to need a strong shoulder to put her head on. But Costner is wrong about himself, he always cherished lone-ranger roles, men who combined both competence and high morality, with a wound in his past, so only him or a younger Clint Eastwood could have made it work.And both Costner and Houston make it work. And the film never treats the interracial romance as if it was relevant to the story, but nevertheless it accentuates the gap between the two characters. He works in secrecy, she's a star, he takes his job in a no-nonsense way, she embraces celebrity with full arms, knowing that it's part of her competence to be available to the crowd of fans. These contradictions create many situations where they have to make the rules, to adapt to each other, but we know these scenes are only meant to make their chemistry grow slowly and surely until the romance finally blooms. The romance is convincing because it starts as respect, understanding, and empathy to the point of when it happens, we don't feel it contrived, but as natural, exhilarating and passionate as the song that defines it.Indeed, "I Will Always Love You" is the darlings of Karaoke and the ultimate test in musical reality programs, and that's a credit to Whitney Houston's miraculous talent for having made both the opening and conclusion, such milestones in the world of music. It was Costner who picked the original Dolly Parton's song and suggested Houston should remake it. That fact alone proves that his casting was a blessing. "The Bodyguard" is as great as a film can get in terms of impact, and music enhances it to an extraordinarily emotional level, being till now, the all-time best-selling soundtrack.Naturally, "The Bodyguard" was nominated for every Razzie Award possible, but like I said for "Mommie Dearest", some films stick in our mind, no matter how seemingly bad they are for some pompous critics, and that's the kind of achievement some 'greater' movies fail to achieve. The only difference is that I called "Mommie Dearest" a guilty pleasure, while I don't feel so guilty for having enjoyed "The Bodyguard".</fullReview>

Hearing Whitney's voice however brought emotions to my ears, because her voice is beautiful, as well as she in no longer with us:( I like the suspense with a little romance all mix in one. As written in some of the previous reviews I saw about there being no chemistry between Kevin/Whitney? I notice it, but it's not throughout the entire movie... I saw chemistry on/off.In conclusion, it was a great little movie, even my guy enjoys watches it, he sure isn't one for soft movies, but when a movie is great, its that! thumbs up to the late Whitney. a special thumbs up to the sexy Kevin Costner!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining romance/thriller with some tense scenes and a good soundtrack.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a bit surprised the rating for this movie isn't a bit higher on here. I've read some of the negative reviews and I have to disagree with most of them. This is a pretty entertaining film all around, with a love story for those into that sort of thing but enough elements of a thriller to not put off the males in the audience. Personally, I think they blended the two genres together pretty well here.Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston did fine in their respective roles and the film had a nice pace throughout.I also have to commend this film for some pretty tense scenes that I don't think the other reviews gave enough credit for. The scene at the Oscars was pretty good stuff. The mystery of the stalker kept the momentum going, and the letters and phone calls were genuinely creepy.This may not be a bona fide classic, but it's certainly a very entertaining early '90s romance/thriller with some good songs thrown in as well.I can't imagine what disappointed the others. Maybe they should remove something from their behind area before watching a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overblown, and surprisingly dull Romantic/Thriller, with only a few entertaining moments *spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bodyguard is an OK film, but nothing particularly exciting, I am usually a huge fan of Costner's but here he pretty much bored me, and Whitney Houston should really stick to singing, plus while there are a few memorable moments, like the finale at the award ceremony, I found the killer to be quite predictable. Costner and Houston's chemistry was really lacking, and it's also way over long for it's own good, plus I am surprised this was the huge box office hit it was. It does have a few tense moments here and there, and Costner has a couple good scenes, however the ending is too stupid, as I felt there kiss was too passionate!. None of the characters were particularly likable, and this deserves it's low rating it has, plus the dialog was quite boring in my opinion. This had the potential to be a great entertaining film, but it's ruined by over length, and dullness, and characters we can't give a damn about, so Overall it's worth a watch i suppose but don't go out of your way to see it. **1/2 out of 5(barely)The Acting is OK. Kevin Costner is alright here, but not at his best, I think he is a great actor, but here he is mostly dull, as is his character, he tried to come off as a Bodyguard who was tough, but I simply didn't buy it, he had a couple of good scenes, but he was mostly miscast. Whitney Houston is so so in her 1st major role, she's definitely good at the singing, but acting she's not that great at, I didn't buy her role, and her character got on my nerves. Gary Kemp plays his annoying selfish role well as Sy. Bill Cobbs is good in his role as Devaney and did what he had to do well. Tomas Arana is OK in his role, and did a decent job near the end. Michele Lamar Richards is OK as the selfish sister she did decent. Mike Starr is alright as Tony and brought some comic relief. DeVaughn Nixon is a cute kid, and did fine in his role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never get tired of watching this movie. I am a die-hard chick-flick fan: fluff all the way, all that meaningless dime-a-dozen stuff. But this is one movie which breaks my mold and I consider a new classic. It's a movie I have to be in the right mood to watch, but it's one that I never get tired of. It's a great drama--romance, mystery, with a spice of humor thrown in here and there, enough to make you smile and lighten up the mood but not enough to make it seem tawdry. Kevin Costner's performance makes the whole thing for me: he spins a great character without becoming bland or stony. Whitney Houston is fairly good as an actress, smiling and charming in her pleasanter days, and obviously her songs are very good--I hope no one will contest that she has an excellent voice (or did; does she even sing anymore?). Watching the little boy, Fletcher (sorry I don't know his real name), was also a treat. He's the precocious-almost-to-a-fault genre, but it was fun seeing all his antics and especially hearing the things he said.I think this movie has gotten a much lower rating than it deserves. The plot is not extremely involved, but I was surprised by the ending. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERS--but if you cannot work out where this film is going,then you should go back to reading books. First let me admit that I actually like a lot of Kev's movies,even "The Postman"(must write a review)but lets face it,more fun slagging something off and with this mega-hit movie its not too hard. The acting-ok-ish-but they are getting paid a lot,so its the least they could do,having said that our Kev could have sent a plank of wood instead of bothering to turn up. The script-well its got words in it-please no I can't go on-please don't force me to say it-I must try to keep the job apart from our relationship-how can I be objective if I carry on sleeping with you-oh sorry getting carried away there.ok it is terrible. The whole thing is built around the premise that Kev is right and everyone else is wrong,actually starting to sound like a lot of his movies.He is of course the strong silent type(he saw the script)and our Whitney,she's in it,in case you did'nt know,is the liddle liddle girlie who should know better.This is like an old tv episode of "Cannon",he was always putting those youngsters on the right track as well, the production values look equal to a tv movie to me,so maybe thats where they got the grand idea. All in all a very good example of a superstar topping up the pension scheme and possibly the worst of Kev's movies. Having said all that,it is watchable,in a daydreamy sort of way. POSSIBLE SPOILER(but I dont really think so if you are over the age of twelve)Hero Kev gets shot,in the film,but don't worry,they don't hit his ego.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do enjoy watching this corn-filled extravaganza starring the wooden as always Kevin Costner, and the nevermore beautiful Whitney Houston.Frank Farmer is a former Secret Service agent who couldn't protect President Reagan from being shot, so he retired and goes into private business. Whitney is Rachel Marron, superstar singer/actress, getting death threats. Farmer takes his job too seriously, and gives her crap once she hires him. She is a prima donna around him. Ultimately they fall for each other, but love ain't easy in their world.This movie is a marvelous cheese-fest that never truly gels, with a bunch of characters tossed in to annoy us when we could have settled for just the two leads. The dialog is so trite, and it doesn't help that mostly everyone's acting is by-the-numbers. Hollwood limelight is exaggerated to borderline annoying. It feels very 70s, and rightly so, because that's when it was written for Steve McQueen and Diana Ross.While we all know that Costner is not the coolness that was McQueen, the guy does a fair impression of him throughout the film. And Whitney is not the best actress, but she was way hotter than the former Supreme, and that's fine by me. Stifle a laugh when her character is nominated for an Oscar, though. The two may look great together but I can't help wonder what might have been.Once the payoff is revealed and the very laughable Academy Awards scene occurs, is when "The Bodyguard" completely runs out of gas. Still, this is an entertaining chick-flick, because it was never intended to become high art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah, The Bodyguard, I was 7 years old when this film was released, and the funny thing about it is that I actually remember all the hoop-la there was about it. Well, mostly what I remember is how much my mom and sister complained about it's hit song by Whitney Housten, I will Always Love You, was way too over played on the radio. Hence the reason why I never saw this film, well, I passed it at Hollywood Video and I figured I would see what it was about and if it really should of got all the praise that it did in 1992. Now when the film started out, I was actually surprised, I found myself enjoying it, but then it got into a mystery thriller that wasn't really needed in my opinion, that wasn't explained very well or wasn't even enjoyable.Frank is one of the best bodyguards around, he has protected some very important people in his life, but he refuses celebrities. But when a superstar, Rachel Marron, is getting death threats, her assistant begs him to join the team. One problem, Rachel is a bit of a diva, big surprise. Her and Frank keep clashing but can no longer hide their deep sexual tension for each other and give in. But Frank must remember that he is here to protect Rachel and save her life and protect her family as well.The Bodyguard had it's moments and a very promising plot that could have worked, but unfortunately what happened with the character, Rachel's sister, just got too confusing among with the friend of Frank. You'll see what I mean when you see the film. I'm not sure if I would recommend this film or not, but I do think it's worth a look. But I agree with my mom and sister, I did fast forward through the singing moments, no offense, Whitney.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this Mick Jackson-directed film from Warner Brothers, which was produced by Lawrence Kasden, Jim Wilson, and one of the two main stars...Kevin Costner..., the issue of interracial relationships is addressed; while that is a matter now tolerated but not totally accepted, even though it is much more frequent than it used to be, this movie presents it as a situation which can be warm, so much so that the sometimes-negative attitude toward it does not "stick out like a sore thumb", to employ a favorite cliché. Kevin Costner is in one of his best roles as the secret service agent, Frank Farmer, who is hired to protect Rachel Marron (played by Whitney Houston in her movie-acting debut), but neither has any idea that there will be love between them. In the movie Farmer does not beg Rachel Marron to be protected by him when the independent Marron is often hostile toward him, but that changes and then, again, love develops between them. Bill Cobbs and Ralph Waite do well in their supporting roles. The color is beautiful, so much so that the northern part of this country, with its snow-capped mountains is, in turn, beautiful and refreshing, and the ocean bordering Miami Beach is drawing and refreshing. There is plenty of exciting action, a bit of mystery, and, obviously, warm romance. Whitney Houston is her beautiful self as she portrays her consummate singing ability through such songs as "If I Don't Have You", as well as a signature song "I Will Always Love You". Because of all its trappings, the movie is one that could never be easily forgotten.</fullReview>

The dialogue is cheesy, the characters underdeveloped and lacking subtlety, the pace drags in the middle and the story makes little sense. However we do have some good cinematography, locations, costumes and editing, credible direction and a great soundtrack including the haunting And I Will Always Love You(and it will always be the best version no matter how many Huston wannabes try to sing it and end up murdering it). The acting is fine, Kevin Costner is good and Whitney Huston is more than credible in a role that showcases her beautiful voice excellently. Overall, The Bodyguard is a love or hate it sort of movie, but for me my reaction was mixed. 6/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lawrence Kazdan has written a dozen of memorable films and directed some of them ( 'Body Heat'(qv) is among the very very best films noirs ever ). Here he selects the hate of Nikki for her extremely successful younger sister as the basis of his plot. Why not ? But difficulties arise when it comes to explain how a girl without connection with the underworld can get the services of a gun for hire. Kazdan tries it thus : full of guilt over the unwanted near-death of her nephew, Nikki confesses that ,-though so drunk as not to remember the name of the bar she went to -, she made enquiries and got in touch with a go-between , and hired a killer (perhaps the best one in the States, by the way!); and she paid the whole price (a quite sizeable sum ) in advance - when she could have been so easily swindled . The confession is conveniently stopped by the yapping of the watchdog; and immediately after, she is ( also conveniently ) bumped off when trying to stop the killer ... But " The Bodyguard " being a very well made and entrancing film, the foregoing shortcomings of the plot appear only long after the film has ended . The cast is quite satisfactory : I am not an unconditional fan of Costner's, but he manages well enough, and has some powerful chemistry with Whitney Houston; she is quite convincing in her movie debut, and her voice is a marvel. And all supporting actors are well selected , including reliable veterans Bill Cobbs and Ralph Waithe, and intriguing Tomas Arana. The film made quite a pile of money, but apparently did not help the career of its director, Mick Jackson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mick Jackson's 'The Bodyguard' is a film that has a routine story about a Secret Service Agent turned bodyguard who is hired to protect a music icon, from an unknown stalker. Depsite zero novelty, I loved the film. It holds appeal from start to end, it keeps you interested even when the story isn't really moving. In short, a winner all the way! 'The Bodyguard' was also a Box Office Blockbuster Hit during it's release, way back in 1992. It has since gained a fan-following, it's a classic. It's Lawrence Kasdan's water-tight screenplay that keeps you glued, and Jackson's direction keep the proceedings alive. Alan Silvestri's music score, is another brownie point.Now coming to the acting department, Whitney Houston sinks her teeth into the character and brings it out like flying colors. She steals the show all the way! Kevin Costner is restrained this time, which works only to it's advantage. Gary Kemp is passable. Bill Cobbs is okay. Others fill the bill.On the whole, A Must Watch Film! Two Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE BODYGUARD, in my opinion, is a great Whitney Houston movie. One of the greatest things about this movie, in my opinion, is the music. I thought that Rachel (Whitney Houston) sounded really good. My favorite song of THE BODYGUARD is "I Have Nothing." Also, in my opinion, Frank (Kevin Costner) was really attractive, strict, a good bodyguard, and business-like. I thought that Rachel looked very beautiful in the dress she wore to the Oscars and that Frank looked good in the tuxedo he wore to the Oscars. Also, if you ask me, he and Rachel made a really cute couple. In conclusion, I recommend this movie to all you Kevin Costner or Whitney Houston fans who have not seen it. I absolutely guarantee you you're going to enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as the voters think.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, I was looking at IMDb's database on romance and was pretty stricken to see that not only 'Vertigo' was rated a romance(!), but five of the top twenty were written around and before fifty decades ago. Ghost? Nope! Dirty Dancing? Ha! Try 5.3. Titanic? 9100 votes gave it a 1. Ever After? Female votes have scraped it up to a 7! Wedding Singer, Pretty Woman, GREASE of all movies. Modern romance has been beaten to a pulp, but even though the same conventions of romance movies exist in The Bodyguard, I'm not one of those people who hated it.After missing out on Reagan's assassination attempt, bodyguard Frank Farmer is now working for-hire. When a singer hires him after she gets death threats, conflicts begin but feelings follow.The Bodyguard plays out your basic romance and resists the urge to jerk any tears. I don't think the actors could pull it off though. There's a point in the movie, when they realize their romance, when their reactions don't make any sense, but afterward everything about the movie plays out like it should and it's well made! Although I believe people are rating the movie on what has happened to Whitney Houston in recent years, they should judge it for the performances themselves and that means it's not bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say this was and still is one of my ulitmate favorite romantic movies. The soundtrack is amazing! The scenery is beautiful, the plot is great, and the characters are just what you want to see. Kevin Costner is a great actor and I thought Whitney Houston did a great job acting in a part similar to her own life very well. Viewers might hate that she is so spoiled and selfish and that's a lot of the reason why her sister seems so quiet and kind of like a slave to her whim. Kevin's character you take to heart, since he is a great worker and does his job as he should. The scene that they know they have fallen in love is so beautiful and well acted that I will remember it forever. You look for a great scene in every movie and there were a few in this one as well, but I don't want to give it away for those that have not seen it yet. The ending made me cry when I first saw it and still makes me cry, it's just tragic that not all loves end up the way they should. I'd rate this a ***** out of 5!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It struck me as extremely funny that 2 of the biggest box-office movies of all-time, The Bodyguard and Titanic, were and are considered BAD MOVIES!!! So what is it that people want? A serious interesting movie with great acting and great writing,or a bad movie with likeable attractive stars and great music..which both Titanic and Bodyguard both have! Why is it that many comments about this movie are either Loved it or Hated it! Seems that box office is what matters when deciding if a movie is entertaining or not! People go to movies to be entertainedand escape the reality of everyday life! This movie is like an old hollywood movie from the 1940's when big stars would fill the screen with thier glamorous looks and charm and persuasive personalities that would pull us in and not let us go till the credits rolled! So sit back and grab a coke and enjoy a throwback movie! 4/5 St</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romance, thrills, comedy, action, music. The Bodyguard has it all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bodyguard starring Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston is one of the most successful movies of all-time, grossing over 410 million dollars worldwide. Why? There are several reasons:First of all, the chemistry between Kevin and Whitney is great. Whenever they are on screen, you can't take your eyes off them. They are very talented and very attractive.Second, the music in this movie is incredible. Whitney's voice soars on ballads like I Have Nothing and I Will Always Love You, and she brings down the house with the rocky Queen of the Night. No wonder that the soundtrack is the biggest selling soundtrack of all-time (37 million copies sold worldwide).Third, the story is fun and the characters are well developed. There are so many funny one liners in this movie, I don't know where to start. There's plenty of romance for the girls and plenty of action/suspense for the guys. The Bodyguard is a classic. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Won't Always Love This Movie...but it's easy to watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You're going to see "The Bodyguard" spoofed a lot. Just two days ago I saw an episode of "The Simpsons" with Homer saving Mark Hamill from a horde of geeks. As the song "I Will Always Love You" swelled in the background, the image of Homer carrying an animated Mark in his arms filled the screen.Of course, the film itself isn't a good movie. "The Bodyguard" is, in fact, a very bad movie. But I like it, in an odd sort of way. It's one of those likable but stupid movies that make the time fly by on a Friday night -- unless, of course, you have something better to do than waste your time watching Kevin Costner attempt to act and Whitney Houston attempt to love him.The movie stars Kevin Costner as Frank Farmer, a bodyguard who blames himself for events from the past that come back to haunt him. Whitney Houston basically plays Whitney Houston (though the character's name is different in the film), a famous singer like herself who falls in love with her newly-aquired bodyguard and sparks an interracial romance that threatens her career almost as much as the death threats she has been receiving in the mail.Frank's mission is to protect her at all costs from the assassinator, who is not a metallic cyborg and who does not bear an uncanny resemblance to Arnold Schwarzenegger (though it would have helped market the film). The surprise at the end is that the killer is not who we think it is throughout -- so don't think at all! Just watch. I hope I didn't ruin any part of the movie for you. But don't tempt me -- I'm about to give away the rabid fan's identity to you."The Bodyguard" is a big, mushy mess, filled with bad acting and bad scriptwriting. The entire movie is bad. It's way too long for its own good -- especially when it is broadcast on network television and stretched to a near three-hour showing. (Do they really provide fifty minutes of commercials these days on CBS?) I've seen the movie numerous times, on network television and unedited, and it always seems too long. But, despite its (extremely) bad traits, the movie is a lot of fun to watch.I don't like Kevin Costner. I think he is, what I call, a *blah* actor. He talks with such a lightweight mumble that it often induces sleep. If Costner wants to make money after his film career is depleted (that's happening, folks), he should market Costner Sleep Cassettes. Insert a cassette tape/CD of Kevin Costner reading your least favorite book, and you're guaranteed to fall asleep in less than five minutes -- or your money back!I found one great role that Kevin Costner has played over the years, and it was the role he played in "The Untouchables," opposite Robert De Niro's Al Capone. Brian DePalma directed that movie, and it worked because the role for Costner fit his dull acting talent. Watching him attempt to *really* act is quite sad. Remember his interpretation of Robin Hood? Some people liked it, but I thought it was a disgrace to Robin Hood.For what it's worth, Costner is good here, mainly because he acts like a dull bodyguard who is required to show absolutely no feelings whatsoever. His character basically walks around with a single expression on his face throughout the film, including while he's on a date with Whitney and the night after (if you know what I mean).The movie sparked a lot of controversy because the couple embrace in a passionate kiss at the end of the film. If you don't mind sitting through bad acting, bad directing, bad scriptwriting, all stretched out to two and a half hours...then this is the movie for you. I, personally, sorta like it. But I don't respect it.3/5 stars.- John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kevin Costner seems to be very concerned with making each new film that he does as completely different from the one before it as possible and with this one, this is how he follows up on the much stronger film, "JFK." Costner is wasted in the title role and Whitney Houston costars to some level of OK effect but this film is much better noted for Houston's songs than anything else. If you want to see the talented singer Houston make a better attempt to establish herself as an actress, see "Waiting To Exhale" instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The soundtrack is outdated, but the movie's still good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it was first released and didn't really care for it. Well, basically I was still in grade school and didn't care for anything that wasn't loaded with action or comedy. I gave this movie another try when it came on Cinemax and recorded it on tape. It's a very impressive film that's both suspenseful and romantic, without being over-the-top. The only thing that really bugged me was the soundtrack. My cousins upstairs bought the soundtrack and would listen to it constantly, so I'm pretty much tired of hearing every single one of those songs. Kevin Costner gives an engaging, charismatic performance. Whitney Houston is not a terrific actress, but she can pull of a dramatic line without making me burst into laughter. So I gotta give her a little bit of credit, being that this was her first performance. I've seen much worse. And it's nice to see Whitney looking very pretty, as opposed to now where she's destroying herself with drugs. And though the relationship was between a white man and a black woman, the film didn't get preachy about it. I just think Lawrence Kasdan (who wrote the script) should've just made Whitney's character a singer, since we never see her act in this film. We never see clips of her films. All we see her do is sing. So why not make her a singer and have the climax at the Grammy Awards? Nevertheless, I really enjoyed the film. It works well as both a love story and a thriller. And unlike most romantic films, the two characters don't constantly jump into bed together and the sex is left to the imagination. We actually feel some real chemistry, through dialogue and character development. My score: 7 (out of 10)</fullReview>

Not in the least.In fact if it ever came my way i would kiss it off (granted it never will..sort of like me owning the buffalo bills). This film is a fantasy action adventure romance in which Costner plays the nice guy action heavy against all the bad guys in a story about a guy who operates in the world of the cult of personality. Personality and being seen witht he rich and famous are things I have never craved in this film Costner plays a PI/bodyguard who has to keep it in perspective and do his job. The bright lights and spotlight can be distracting to some yet his character is a professional who is not distracted. A interesting concept.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a personal fan of Whitney Houston, and I believe she didn't cause any dishonor to her flawless reputation. Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston truly portrayed the couple of the year. What I like about this movie is its simplicity, honesty and magnificent music. I don't know why the Razzie Awards attacked the film so much, it's a truly classical love story with great performance, music and directing. Although the roll was originally for Diana Ross, I can't imagine Rachel Maron being interpreted as any other woman but Whitney Houston. If you haven't watched it, I honestly think you should, because this is a mist-see cinematographic treasure that is rare to find in today's modern chaos. It has no special effects or any computer tricks, it is as simple as it gets, and I believe that that's the secret to a great film. The outline of this movie is Frank Farmer (Costner) being an extremely serious bodyguard protecting Rachel Marron (Houston), an extremely immature person. The different points of view of both affect Farmer's way of working, causing chaos during the process of Rachel's protection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston have good movie 'chemistry'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whitney Houston, in a role that wasn't much of a stretch for her, plays a famous singer Rachel Marron. I suppose it is a reality of the entertainment business that "fans" can get out of control, so bodyguards are necessary. Ms. Marron's handlers are also concerned that she is being targeted for death. They recognize that her personal security isn't as tight as it should be, and with much coaxing get noted specialist Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner) to take the job of providing security.When we first see Frank entering the grounds of Ms Marron's home, he doesn't come in the usual way. Instead, he basically breaks in, as a way of demonstrating to himself and others how poor the security was. I really liked the role of Tony Scipelli (Mike Star). Being the current security specialist, and a somewhat intimidating looking person, he doesn't look kindly on his rather small person in Frank coming in to tell them what to do, so he challenges him. That scene alone, where Frank whips up on him is worth the movie.Farmer has been hard on himself since President Reagan was shot, because he wasn't on duty that day. That is part of what he has to overcome personally through the movie.MAJOR SPOILERS. Frank does his thing, security is top notch, there begins some romantic feelings between Ms Marron and Frank, during tense minutes at a concert, Frank figures out who the assassin is, and gets the upper hand. As a professional he realizes that a romantic relationship with his client is out of the question. As the movie ends we see he has taken a job guarding a politician again.Overall a good movie, one of my favorite Kevin Costner roles.April 2008 update: We watched it again, on the special edition DVD. It has an excellent 25-minute special on making the movie, and the picture and sound of the movie are first-rate. This is definitely a better movie than its low IMDb rating would suggest. Costner is good as the bodyguard and for a singer, Houston is excellent in her role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>..but unfortunately it took over two hours to get to it. Its a great moment and is very old-movie in its execution, but the movie preceeding it is mostly awful. Don't read this if you want your 'experience' ruined..Kevin &amp; Whitney have some moments of genuine chemistry. He is hired by her staff because she is receiving threatening letters and intruders (she's a double threat - big in movies and in music - just like Neely O'Hara!) but she is mostly being kept in the dark about her stalker because she might get 'upset.' Her staff is comprised of shady characters, all designed to make you think any of them could be guilty of stalking.She wants her freedom but he's very professional - he worked for the CIA and still regrets not being on duty the day Ronald Reagan was shot - so They Clash, so that they can Overcome That and Become Romantic. Inexplicably, his professional responsibility is put aside and he decides to accept her invitation to go on a date. Being that she is a huge star, its unreasonable that she is never recognized, but I digress..He realizes that they should not have gotten close the Following Morning, and she is angry that they won't be waking up together anymore. When the threats take a more serious tone, they agree to get serious about her being guarded. You don't want to know the rest. See the fey dye-blonde guy who is obsessed with Whitney. See the co-worker of Costner trying to get some of what Kevin was given. See the resentful sister/secretary seething at every turn.The best is the Oscars ceremony at the end, where she wins, but is almost gunned down..maybe the killer was pulling for someone else in her category!The script is a mess. Costner is wooden for the most part. Houston is very good but has a lapse in some heavily dramatic scenes. I don't think playing a spoiled diva is a huge stretch for her but its good to know your own limitations, too. As mentioned, the finale is very well done, very emotional and cathartic. Its the only spontaneous, real moment in a mostly artifical movie. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I never really cared for Houston's singing from the beginning of her career. It was too Ethel Merman/Carol Burnett, but at least they were fun. I preferred Dolly Parton's version of 'I will always love you' for its sweetness. It's not the kind of song that needs to be belted out at full volume. Second, I don't think she is all that beautiful either with those lifeless eyes of hers and the bitchiness came way too easy for her.Kevin Costner looks good in clothes (costumes) but has the voice of a 15 year old boy. I've never liked any of his movies or his attempts at acting.Put these 2 together and voil?, an awful, awful mess. Was the interracial love affair supposed to be daring in the 90s? Did Whitney get threatening letters for her performance in this thing as well as the character she played? Did Kevin go to Supercuts during a power blackout? We want to know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie "The Bodyguard" is of a singer, Rachel Marron (Whitney Houston), who is been followed by an obsessed fan. Her new bodyguard is an expert, Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner), who is flawless and does everything to protect Rachel. So, it was a short plot in my words. The movie was actually pretty good, romantic and entertaining, though there was a little too little of drama and thriller. Kevin Costner probably did his best role as nowadays it is hard to even remember that there once was an actor by his name. Whitney Houston is a define B-class star, she should stay with singing.The songs were the ones that saved the movie and made me almost but not quite love it. "Queen Of The Night" and "I Have Nothing" made me shiver and search the Internet for mp3-s. I'm really sorry that Whitney has gone from a great singer to a drug addict. Sorry, but that is the pure truth. So, to put this all together in a few words, I would say: sweet, entertaining, full of fantastic songs. 8/10 points from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>underacting, a wise choice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this movie when it first came out in the theater. I just saw it again on tv. I must admit I always thought - and still think - that Kevin Costner is an overrated actor. He manages to be quite believable in this flick because of his underacting. But yet he has a hard time always finding the right facial expression within his (IMHO) limited range. Whitney Huston on the other hand did a rather good job since she has to go through many more emotions. Of course she only is really at ease when she sings. When she is afraid or furious, her lack of acting experience shows through. I only can thank the director Mick Jackson for telling both stars to take the underacting approach during dramatic and romantic scenes. It actually works. Check Kevin Costner in JFK when he has his final speech and fights his tears with his voice failing. He just seems to shy away instead of putting his heart into it. The same goes for the, admittedly much less dramatic, scene near the end of "The Bodyguard" when he has to fight his tears for a moment (sure he is a tough guy). I still bought it because it was very subtle. Very good direction.The only movie where Kevin Costner really convinced me was "A Perfect World", directed by Clint Eastwood, made one year later.The music is definitely outdated especially for ther flashy digital keyboard sounds which are by now replaced by either rougher or more machine-like sounds. Yet it's nice listening to the last remains of glamour in pop music. It's all but gone by now. Spoilers ahead!I found some of the music numbers a bit exaggerated with all fireworks and everything. I also found it one too many that Rachel (Huston) actually won the Oscar. I guess it's the lack of a setup (we don't even know the film Rachel is in and neither the other nominees, so we don't really care).I totally agree with one user comment that points out the poorly constructed plot regarding Rachel's older sister and the killer. I even would like to add that her phrase "I never would hurt Fletcher" was of very bad taste. So she's a good girl after all. She doesn't hurt her nephew, she "only" wants to kill her sister. Hmmm. That can't even be explained with feelings of guilt clouded by booze. End of spoilers.All in all still an enjoyable movie. Production values are excellent and the complete supporting cast is simply great. I also liked the fact that the racial differences are not mentioned in the dialog.*** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why it's nowhere near CASABLANCA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This fairly well-constructed movie/music collage is rather dated as my wife and I watched it again July 2002. The 10-year gap wherein some of the plot deficiencies would be unbelievable nowadays makes this seem "long ago in a legendary land." The "Mine" club scene especially seems like a 1930's kind of gag since passing a grown woman in a kind of "mosh" setting would never really happen with such a harmless, happy ending. Being stranded at the remote family hideaway with no lines of communication or emergency back-up plan also seems pre-World War II. To enjoy this movie one must enjoy the pop sound of Ms. Houston as well as tolerate the country (light) music of "I will always love you." It is admittedly wacky when it dissects the Oscar/Academy Awards facade; after all, nobody ever really muffs their lines when the television audience is 2 billion viewers, really (??). This movie should never get serious consideration for telling its viewers that much about "LOVE" as does a much better but still "dated" movie: Casablanca (director Michael Kurtiz). I believe that BODYGUARD is alluding to it in its choice for an airport penultimate scene; neither principle actor in the 1992 casting approaches the sensuality and romantic extremes of Bergman and Bogart. Who is the "third" side of the LOVE Triangle in this subtextual riff? Probably the Bodyguard's own sublimated Father-figure aspect with the Diva's son. That kid is left adrift in more ways than one in the course of the movie -- whether he can swim and just what the "name" of the Diva's nominated movie is seem to be not very solid at different points of the screenplay. For its strengths of music and comedy (sometimes inadvertent), I give it an "8" out of 10 star rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kevin Costner stars as secret service agent Frank Farmer who getsassigned to protect a former female singer by the name of Rachel. At first,Frank is reluctant about the protection of this womanuntil he is drawn in closer to Rachel and finds out what she's really like.The two of them embark on an affair and end up falling in love,but then danger strikes when Rachel realises someone is out to kill her and begins to stalk her.The Bodyguard is a fast paced romantic thriller which offers a bittersweet sense and really is a movie to watch with your loved ones.Don't underestimate this film,it is one of the most romantic films I have seen along with Ghost.The soundtrack is depressing but brilliant and by the end of the film you'll be in tears. It is kind of a mix,first off you have the romantic side of it all,and then you have the thriller side of it and it works perfectly. Whitney makes the screen shine as one of the best female singers of our time.Kevin Costner is brilliant as the depressed bodyguard and the film all together is one big amazement and will reman as one of the best romantic thrillers off our time.I rate 5/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't care what the critics say, this is a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner) is a former Secret Service agent who now does private security work and falls in love with his present client, Rachel Marron (Whitney Houston), a singer turned actress who resists his overbearing ways at first. Rachel is stalked by a crazed man and Farmer is called in to protect her. She must be convinced into accepting his services and they eventually develop a relationship. But Farmer realizes that this relationship will interfere with his job as a bodyguard. He ends the relationship, but Rachel, out of concern for her son, Fletcher, soon realizes that the bodyguard relationship is more important than her feelings for her bodyguard. A great, if not intentionally low-key performance by Costner and over-the-top performance by Houston make this an enjoyable film to watch over and over. The excellent writing and great one-liners don't hurt either. Three out of four stars, especially due to the great ending!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GREAT Whitney Houston movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE BODYGUARD, in my opinion, is a GREAT Whitney Houston movie. One of the greatest things about this movie, in my opinion, is the music. I thought that Rachel (Whitney Houston) sounded REALLY good. My favorite song of THE BODYGUARD is "I Have Nothing." In my opinion, Frank (Kevin Costner) was REALLY attractive, strict, a good bodyguard, and business-like. I thought that Rachel looked VERY beautiful in the dress she wore to the Oscars and that Frank looked good in the tuxedo he wore to the Oscars. In conclusion, I recommend this movie to all you Kevin Costner or Whitney Houston fans who have not seen it.</fullReview>

You get to know the characters by how they talk to one another and how they react to the events throughout the movie. You will also not expect the ending you thought you would get. It leaves you wondering. This is a great movie to go rent, so go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Date Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's got stuff for the guys. It's got stuff for the girls. Face it - it's the ultimate date movie! You know - a movie a man and a woman can watch together and really enjoy. Why this movie is coming in at a 5.3 on IMDb is beyond me. It's so much better than that on general appeal alone. Whitney and Kevin were at the height of their careers when they made this movie, and it shows. He's got the gun, the moves, the Samurai sword. She's got the voice, the attitude and the need. It all works perfectly. Hey - it's a story! You want realism open your local paper. And be bored. Pick up this movie, with a bottle of wine and a bowl of popcorn and a special someone and be entertained. I have not seen a movie since this one that does that as well as this one does. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worse the waterworld</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yeah, I got roped into seeing this cheesy 90s chick flick cause of the girl I was dating at the time. Hollywood couldn't find away to make truly good movies in the 1990's, and many times through together movies like this, roped some big time actors into doing in in order to get people in the theaters, only to see the flicks quickly disappear when the audiences quit showing up. What we have in a contrived, rather implausible little story that never gets the viewer interested, and can't even get the viewer to care about their respective fates. Whitney Houston, providing scant actor ability, has zero chemistry with Kevin Costner, who should be more happy to include Waterwold, or the 1970's drive in flick Sizzle Beach USA on his resume then this fluff. Shoddy direction, implausible ending, and more or less, a script that seems like it was written on the fly. I remember being so bored out of my mind, that I was actually reading the box my popcorn came in. Even the girl was completely bored. We left as the movie was ending, as did the friends we came with. We all agreed that we could have spent the money better by tossing it in the toilet, and flushing. One of the worst films from the decade of sub standard music, and a down period for Hollywood flicks. Absolutely zero grade, and only should be watched if you don't get the lifetime network on your local cable system. Useless fluff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This modern story of a knight in shining armor just didn't do it for me the acting and story is just to childish. And I must mention that Kevin Costner disappoints again folks this guy just doesn't impress me. Whitney Houston's hit songs on the soundtrack "I Will Always Love You" and "I Have Nothing" are great but I must say Whitney your acting is much to be desired. The, Bodyguard is a movie to watch but this film is more known for the music it helped make popular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't help it Costner is sexy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I gave it a 10. I just can't help it. Costner is sexy as the reticent bodyguard and Whitney Houston was at her most beautiful. I'll even admit to having loved the soundtrack when it came out. I think the plot surprises, too - though that could be my relative innocence. My recollection is that the movie was critically panned. But it kept me up all night on late-night TV tonight - because I had to see the ending just one more time. I think my 9 year-old will love it, and I'm ordering it on Netflix. If you're looking for something intelligent, forget it. I also think you need to be female to see any merit in this movie at all, because it really is about Costner's appeal - to Whitney and to those of us up too late at night. He's not Benicio Del Toro (there's only one of those) but he's definitely well-cast for The Bodyguard. Watch it with a girlfriend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing special in this film which I suspect was created to enhance the careers of the 2 main stars. I wonder if it did although I don't see how as it was just another sexy suspense tale with a nice little predictable ending. Not a total dud so see it if you have a couple of spare hours with nothing going on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has grossed over 410 million dollars worldwide at the box office which makes it one of the most successful movies of all-time. If you haven't watched it, then that reason alone should be a good cause to watch it.Both Whitney Houston &amp; Kevin Costner did a great job. The movie has a lot of great one liners, it's too funny. Of course the music &amp; singing are incredible. Now if they can only release a special edition DVD with some extra features it would be great, the dvd currently available was released in 1997 when DVDs were still debuting. Anyways, this movie is a good combination of thriller, romance &amp; humor. If you haven't watched it then check it out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An awful film, which does NOT work. The recreation of the Oscars is awful (heck, even "Naked Gun 33 1/3" did a better job!). Whitney Houston cannot act, and Costner is in robot mode. The soundtrack is bad as well, and too much of the film is concentrated on it... The plot is pure old Hollywood garbage that I thought had stopped being made a couple of decades before... A complete nightmare, and hard to sit through... It sure deserves to be in the Bottom 100 list...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bodyguard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people know about this romantic (not very thrilling) thriller film because of the number one theme song, from director Mick Jackson (Volcano). Basically former Secret Service agent turned on bodyguard Frank Farmer (Razzie nominated Kevin Costner) is hired by the manager of successful pop singer turned actress Rachel Marron (twice Razzie nominated Whitney Houston) who has recently been receiving threatening notes/letters. Farmer is haunted by the fact that he quit being a bodyguard for Ronald Reagan, just before he got shot. Farmer wants to keep his relationship with Marron professional, but he does agree to go on a date, and they do sleep together, but of course he feels this was a mistake, and she is obviously being bitchy towards him, and he knows he can't stop thinking about her "in that way". Rachel had been nervous going on stage during this difficult time, but you can imagine her fear on the big Oscar night when she is presenting an award, and then nominated for Best Actress, which she does win, and her assassin is certain. Rachel was saved by Frank, and he is later seen as she boards a plane with a new (older) bodyguard, but she can't take off without that big kiss. Also starring Gary Kemp as Sy Spector, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer's Bill Cobbs as Devaney, Ralph Waite as Herb Farmer, Tomas Arana as Portman, Michele Lamar Richards as Nicki, Dumb and Dumber's Mike Starr as Tony, Christopher Birt as Henry, Terminator 2's DeVaughn Nixon as Fletcher, Home Alone's Gerry Bamman as Ray Court, Batman's Robert Wuhl as Oscar Host, Debbie Reynolds and Deep Impact's Richard Schiff as Skip Thomas. Costner isn't completely believable, and as for Houston, while her singing is fantastic, her acting is lacking a lot of flare, and it is ironic that she was nominated a Razzie, and that in the film her character wins an Oscar. It just isn't my cup of tea for a thriller or love story, I found myself wondering why do so many people, particularly women, like this mediocre schmaltz, it is as the critics say (not very, in my opinion) entertaining baloney. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Song for "I Have Nothing", and Best Song for "Run to You", and it was nominated the Razzies for Worst Original Song for "Queen of The Night" (it's not that bad), Worst Screenplay and Worst Picture. "I Will Always Love You" was number 65 on 100 Years, 100 Songs, it was number 33 on The 100 Greatest Number One Singles, but also number 51 on The 100 Worst Pop Records, why? Okay!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jarring Jump Cuts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Strange as it seems the director of THE BODYGUARD is a former BBC director called Mick Jackson who made the nuclear holocaust docudrama THREADS . I say it`s strange because there surely can`t be a bigger contrast between a director`s two pieces of work . On one hand you have a very cheaply made kitchen sink drama dealing with a subject you pray will never happen , or if it does you`d hope to be vapourised in the opening exchange while on the other you have Hollywood blockbuster melodrama material (Though the plot has also popped up in several latter TVMs ) featuring love and songs and the occasional shoot out There is a stylistic connection between these two Jackson directed contrasts and that`s the jump edits . I checked the credits on both THREADS and THE BODYGUARD and was very surprised to find that different editors were used in both because the editing is very similar in its jarring quality of having a scene where noise is overwhelming followed by a scene of total silence which lasts several seconds . I guess it`s the fault of the directorAs for the rest of this movie I didn`t think much of it . For a romance to work on screen you need a lot of chemistry between the two romantically linked protagonists and THE BODYGUARD features the charisma free Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston , and I was certain that the film would have worked far better if the movie was produced in the mid 1970s with Steve McQueen and Diana Ross in the main roles . It wouldn`t have saved the film from its TVM type plot but at least we`d see some convincing characterisation and acting Finally the title song is one you will either love or hate . I hate it</fullReview>
