		<shortDescription>In this movie, Bogart proves to be the sneering, sadistic gangster?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After nearly a decade of concentrating on the gangster period of the twenties, it appeared that Warner Brothers had decided to make one, final glorified kiss-off to the genre in the spectacularly staged "The Roaring Twenties." Director Raoul Walch was an odd choice for what turned out to be a first-rate action film, for Walsh was not normally a crime-film director? The film contained every possible cliché connected with the era? Bogart's portrayal was interesting as we watched him coldly murder an ex-army sergeant who had given him a rough time in the service, and then set put to get rid of Jeffrey Lynn, now a successful lawyer working for the district attorney and intent on crushing Bogart's empire? Cagney, whose energy gave him a panerotic sexual magnetism, was evident with his two relationships which both tend to increase our valuation of Cagney as a person as are the two ladies involved: Priscilla Lane, the innocent whom Cagney helps and loves, and the experienced Gladys George who is evidently devoted to him but never expresses her feelings to him? This basic relationship between Cagney and the two female characters does not take away the great merit of "The Roaring Twenties"?much more it proves the skill of Raoul Walsh and the writers in deploying conventional elements in an effective and meaningful way?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is not as centrally dynamic as THE PUBLIC ENEMY nor as Freudian as WHITE HEAT, but THE ROARING TWENTIES is a leading gangster film for Jimmy Cagney as it details the rise and fall of a gangster Eddie Bartlett. The product of World War I and Prohibition, Eddie rises to great power as the head of a gang, always trying to return to legitimate society, and then to fall again due to the Wall Street Crash and the machinations of his right-hand man George Hally (Humphrey Bogart). Both men's characters are far more subtle as studies of success in criminal enterprise than the normal crime bosses of the 1930s. Eddie painstakingly builds up a taxicab corporation to gain legitimacy, as well as his stock acquisitions. Bogart, a bit more realistic on what types of businesses he understands, does not get involved in the stock market. But he enjoys the trappings of the upper class. Witness the scene when he is talking with his underling (Abner Biberman) and he is practicing his putting in his office. At the conclusion, Bogart is living in a townhouse (a sign of his financial success).There is a tradition in the films of the depression that some gangsters are not as bad as others. This is not to be taken seriously in real life, but the idea is that certain people are driven to crime by economic circumstances (Cagney returning to no job at the end of World War I) and some are driven by pure evil (the sadistic side of Bogart's nature). Cagney, on his rise, gains the friendship of people like Gladys George (actually the unrequited love of Ms George) and tries to find room in his organization for people like Frank McHugh, a nice guy who really never fit in properly as a criminal - and dies as a result. Bogart gains the support of like villains (Bibberman, who shares Bogie's fate at the end), and keeps showing a contempt for human life in most of the film (witness how he kills a cop on one of the rum runners he and Cagney are on, because the cop was once his sergeant in the army who punished him for breaking the rules when he did). But Cagney turns out to have more guts in him than Bogie. At the end of the film the latter, facing his own demise, turns into a total coward.The film has many touches to set the tone of the 21 years it covers (1918 - 1939). At the start newsreel footage takes the audience back to the end of World War I, showing Presidents and events up to Wilson (who, curiously enough, is shown by an actor playing the President, not as part of an old film). It has been noted that Gladys George's Panama is based on Texas Guinan, the speakeasy hostess. The death of Cagney on the steps of a church is based on the death of Hymie Weiss, a Chicago gangster rival of Capone who was killed that way in 1927. It was too good a death to not use in a gangster film, as it seems more symbolic than it was in real life (it does remind us of how Cagney, for all his good intentions, came up short due to his profession in violence).I have not commented on the love triangles involving Cagney, Jeffrey Lynn, and Priscilla Lane (and Cagney, Lane, and Gladys George). The irony that Cagney never sees that George is more than just a good friend is rather poignant, for both of them. And it is George who cradles his dead body in the end and gives his epitaph. Perhaps today a director would allow Cagney to wise up and get away with George. But that would spoil the full effect of the film's conclusion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got a kick out of this flick having seen in on TCM. In fact I get a kick out of all TCM movies because there are no commercials so whether you like or dislike Ted Turner, I gotta thank the man for giving us that channel and that format. It's just like sitting in the Bijou after buying a ticket for a quarter and a box of popcorn for a dime. Those were the days. When we hear the names Cagney and Bogart,what's taken for granted? Both were legends. Hollywood immortals whom as long as film is preserved, will never really be dead and "The Roaring Twenties" showcased the dynamic duo to the Nth degree. Bogie did not get top billing as did Jimmy however shining throughout that entire movie was unmistakable greatness yet to come from the guy with the impressive speech impediment. His villainous,conniving rotten gangster disposition was there to exploit in how many more films with him? And Cagney too was contemptible but in a nicer way-if indeed that makes any sense whatsoever. I guess I mean to write that if Cagney would shoot someone, he'd first apologize and then perhaps pay for the funeral.But when Bogie shot, his followup would be two or three more right to the gut. Regarding the story line of the film, it's quite straightfoward. Bogie and Cagney meet as Doughboys in France in W.W.I. The war ends, a few years later the Volstead Act becomes law which gives birth to bootlegging, rival murder etc. Jimmy, who's nuts about a gal who sings and is just out of high school is warned by his pal in booze,Bogie,that the gal is two-timing him for their lawyer and so forth and so on. A one time rock solid friendship between Cagney and Bogart disintegrate and why go on? See the film. It's classic gangster stuff and highly enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is hard to believe so many truly great films were made in 1939, and I can only guess that the sheer volume of excellent pix from that year is the only reason why THE ROARING TWENTIES does not have truly major classic status. 1939 seems to be cluttered with a plethora of cinematic riches, thus burying this astonishing and entertaining crime film. I also have been roaring (with laughter) at some of the astonishing silly comments also on this film's viewer comments page: from: "Blondell's haircut is worth the price of a ticket" (Joan Blondell is not in this film, sweetie, read the credits!) - to '"Another MGM gem"...hello? pal, the opening of the film has a great big shield with WB stamped on it followed by "Warner Bros Presents". Almost everyone commenting then proceeds to tell the whole story, each one after each one as thought they are the only person writing a comment. Yeesh. I am the only person who firstly reads what is already there in order to NOT duplicate plot points or characters or the same old same old same old? For genuine long lasting flabbergastering I prefer the movie's solid direction by Raoul Walsh the sensational crackling screenplay by Mark Hellinger and Jerry Wald and mostly the truly major performance by James Cagney. This role and it's ride is possibly the best I have ever seen from him, especially in the latter scenes on skid-row. It's a very mean cruel story with Bogart's jawdropping viciousness several points above censorship rulings - all thankfully intact and now in crisp DVD clarity. The production values are equally solid well decorated nightclubs and houses and rooms and very believable and expansive sets and scenes - especially in the WW1 intro. Yes it even has a terrific Citizen Kane style march of time newsreel tone and urgency. This is a genuine gangster masterpiece and well worth finding and sharing with other vintage WB (not MGM) crime buffs. THE ROARING TWENTIES deserves to be one of the most famous gangster films for everyone of its plot, acting , character and production qualities - they are all there on show. I would love to know the budget and the box office. I know the film was a big hit but exactly how big? It deserved to be massive. Also, the best saddest role of a lifetime to the superb and endearing Gladys George as Panama. As if everything else wasn't perfect enough! This film is a collectors must-have. If remade today, it would be exactly the same, such is it's timeless tone and production. In fact it is had to believe it was made 20 years earlier than SOME LIKE IT HOT. Both films look identical. Don't waste another day, put THE ROARING TWENTIES top of your must see list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Foursome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two of the most famous actors of their day - James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart - are featured here, along with two very interesting women (Priscilla Lane and Gladys George). That foursome would be fun to join anywhere.Lane is the wholesome pretty girl and George is the tough female bar owner. The latter may not look as good but she delivers the best film noir lines in the movie near the end. In addition, Jefferey Lynn is good as the clean-cut, nice-guy attorney and Frank McHugh draws laughs as Cagney's buddy (as in real life). Paul Kelly is convincing as a hood.With this cast, you know you are going to get a well-acted movie. It moves at a good pace, too, with few lulls. The gangster language of the period was fun to hear.The first time I saw this film I was disappointed. Maybe I expected too much. On the second viewing, I throughly enjoyed it. Having a great DVD transfer on the second viewing didn't hurt, either. It's a nice sharp picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best of Warner's Gangster Films!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Roaring Twenties" more or less marked the end of Warner Bros. gangster films popular during the 1930s. For the next few years WWII would form the backdrop of their action films.This one is full of action and memorable characters due largely to the presence of legendary director Raoul Walsh and its stellar cast.Three soldiers meet on the WWI battlefield in 1918. One is the all good lawyer Lloyd Hart (Jeffrey Lynn), one the thoroughly bad George Hally (Humphrey Bogart) and the third, an everyman named Eddie Bartlett (James Cagney). Eddie is smitten with a girl, Jean Sherman (Priscilla Lane) who has been corresponding with him from home.When the war ends Eddie returns to New York and hooks up with buddy Danny Green (Frank McHugh) who is a Gabie. Eddie goes to meet Jean but is disappointed to learn that she is just a teenager. Unable to find work, Eddie is forced to share the driving of Danny's cab. In the meantime, prohibition takes effect and Eddie discovers that bootlegging is the way to get rich. At the onset he meets saloon girl Panama Smith (Gladys George) who turns out to be his only friend.Fast forward to 1924 and Eddie re-discovers Jean in a chorus line and decides to take a hand in her career. Eddie is now hopelessly in love with Jean much to the dismay of Panama. Jean however, is in love with Lloyd who has turned up as Eddie's lawyer. One night while hijacking a load of booze from rival gangster Nick Brown (Paul Kelly), Eddie meets up with George Hally (what are the chances of that?) who works for Brown. Hally decides to double cross Brown and throw in with Eddie. All the while Eddie is buying up taxis until he has immersed a fleet of 2,000 cabs.Everything is running smoothly until Hally begins to get his own ambitions and sets up Brown to Murder Eddie. The plot fails. Meanwhile Jean leaves Eddie and runs off with Lloyd and Eddie begins to drink. At the same time come the stock market crash of 1929 and Eddie is ruined. Hally however, didn't play the stocks and buys out Eddie's cab business for a small figure and leaves Eddie with but one cab for himself.Eddie hits the skids along with the ever faithful Panama until Hally threatens Jean and Lloyd and.............Cagney as usual dominates the picture. He is his usual cocky Irish tough guy but with character flaws. His love for Jean ultimately is what destroys him. Lane contributes a couple of classic songs (in her own voice) as Jean. Bogart as the thoroughly evil Hally gives us a preview of the Bogart tough guy image to come in the 40s. Gladys George almost steals the picture from Cagney as the tragic Panama and McHugh is sympathetic as Danny.Oddly enough, for a gangster picture, there are no major characters in respect of crusading cops or district attorneys. All of the action is between the gangsters.Cagney would not appear in another gangster film for ten years until "White Heat" (1949).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent Dramatic Story of Crime and Romance, Supported by Historic Events and Wonderful Songs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1919, in the end of the World War I, the G.I. Eddie Bartlett (James Cagney) meets George Hally (Humphrey Bogart) and the student of Law School Lloyd Hart (Jeffrey Lynn) in a trench and sooner the war ends. Back in USA, Eddie is not able to find a job and is sustained by his great friend Danny Green (Frank McHugh), who offers Eddie to share his cab and make some money working as cab driver. Eddie decides to visit Jean Sherman (Priscilla Lane), who had corresponded with him during the war and is crazy about him, and for his surprise, she is a teenager. In 1920, with the 18th Amendment, the Volstead Act is in force, beginning the period of the unpopular Prohibition. Eddie accidentally meets the owner of a speakeasy Panama Smith (Gladys George), they become close friends and she introduces him in bootlegging of liquor. Eddie becomes rich, meets Jean Sherman again and falls for her. He also raises a profitable partnership with George and Lloyd is hired as his lawyer. In 1924, bootlegging has a grown from individual effort to a big business associated with corruption, violence and murder, and the light machine-gun Tommy becomes an important tool in this business. Lloyd and Jean fall in love for each other, and Eddie has a great deception. Later, on 19 October 1929 with the Black Tuesday, Eddie looses all his fortune, and when the Prohibition falls after thirteen years in force, he returns to the activity of cab driver. On the Christmas Eve, when he meets Jean again as a client of his cab, his life is leaded to a tragic end."The Roaring Twenties" is certainly the best gangster movies I have seen together with "Once Upon a Time in America". I have just included this stunning movie in my list of favorite films ever. It is impressive the capacity of the screenplay writers and director Raoul Walsh in developing a complex and magnificent dramatic story of crime and romance, supported by historic events and wonderful songs, in 104 minutes running time only. The cast, with James Cagney, the lovely Priscilla Lane, Gladys George and Humphrey Bogart among others, seems to be in state of grace with perfect interpretations, particularly Priscilla Lane, singing magnificent classic songs with a wonderful voice. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "Heróis Esquecidos" ("Forgotten Heroes")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Chronicle of the causes and effects of National Prohibition of Alcoholic Beverages following World War I. "National Temperance" becomes parent of Organized Crime.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We may just be able to chalk it all up to "Nostalgia", but there's no denying that the Gangster Era, Prohibition, Speak Easies and Thompson Sub-Machine guns all seem to have a place in the hearts of most Americans. Libraries and Book Stores, be they one of those big chain shops or a small, independent Out offprint dealer, all prosper if they have an ample sized shelf of those Crime related volumes on hand.So too it is with the motion picture with the Gangsters always seems to "pack 'em in." Down through the years we've seen an evolution of the Gangster Genre; with the changes in both storyline and stark "realism" all coming along in direct corresponding degrees to the changes of the mores of the times. Hence we would see many different attitudes portrayed in LITTLE CEASAR with Edward G. Robinson (Warner Bros., 1931), THE PUBLIC ENEMY starring James Cagney (Warners, 1931) and Paul Muni in SCARFACE (Caddo Co./United Artists. 1932) than we would see represented in AL CAPONE with Rod Steiger (Allied Artists, 1959), THE BROTHERHOOD starring Kirk Douglas (Brotherhood Co./Paramount Pictures, 1968), Robert Mitchum in THE FRIENDS OF EDDIE COYLE (Paramount Pictures, 1973), just to name a few.When the great gangster pics are discussed and disgusted, it seems that Director Raoul Walsh's THE ROARING TWENTIES (Warner Brothers, 1939) seems to get the also ran treatment of a "B" Picture or something. It is a rap that is undeserved and should have a "Mass Media Pardon"from any such a shoddy reputation.We watched it last night on Turner Classic Movies and got the pleasure of having the "kids" over, who were never exposed to it before. As for the wife and meself, it had been such a long time that it was almost like a brand new experience. The fact that TCM, like so many Cable/Satellite channels shows a picture start to finish, no commercials or interruptions whatsoever. And that alone proves to be most helpful in screening a picture.It wasn't so long ago that the best we could do was to see a movie like this on the nightly movie. That meant our tolerating umpteen commercial breaks and many a film sans some of its footage, left out in order to fit the movie into a particular time slot and still being able to get in all those "Messages of Interest and Importance." We recall that our local Channel, WGN TV had presented THE ROARING 20's by starting the story with Cagney and Frank McHugh's ride out to Mineola, Long Island, New York to visit the young girl who corresponded during the World War, Jean Shepherd (Priscilla Lane). This meant that the scenes of battle in the trenches with James Cagney, Humphrey Bogart, Jeffrey Lynn and their nasty Sergeant, Joe Sawyer were never seen, that night. Bogie doesn't appear until about the halfway point. The conversations between the men made no sense without having benefit of seeing the prior encounters.And now, it's Time for our Feature Review! OUR STORY??..THE ROARING TWENTIES is the film principally written by New York Broadway Columnist, Mark Hellinger. Like so many successful writers of great fiction, he took real people and situations and adapted them to a story, with fictitious names and made up places in New York City. Mr. Hellinger was well known as a writer about crime and was fascinated with those Damon Runyonesque Con Men, Hoods, High and Low ranking Gangsters, Hangers-on and Wannabees. He was also an incurable apologist for The Great White Way, Bagdad on the Trolley, the Big Apple, etc.The story is one of real significance to countless thousands of our "Doughboys" of the American Expeditionary Force (or A.E.F.) to war weary Europe in 1917-18. You see, this was to be "a War to end all Wars", or a "War to make the World safe for Democracy." Those who survived combat in the trenches returned home to a short lived Hero's Welcome only to find out that the Country had voted itself dry in their absence. A popular song of the times asked, "How you gonna keep 'em down on the Farm now that they've seen Paris? (Pronounced Pair-ee!).Lost jobs, an almost universal contempt for Prohibition and the general let down over the Wars failed mission ushered in "the Jazz Age", Flappers, Hip Flasks, Speak Easies and "Bath Tub Gin." The otherwise Law Abiding were corrupted with a giant case of "When in Rome?" or "Everybody's doing it" logic. As time passed, what had started out as a seemingly harmless participation in a highly unpopular, unfair and even Un-Constitutional Prohibition Law in the Volstead Act, became an Urban Civil War over sales and control of Booze in the various designated territories.Some fortunes were made and some were lost as the decade came to nearing its end with the Great Stock Market Crash, on "Black Tuesday", October 29, 1929. The trumpeting herald had sounded as the signal of the beginning of some years of Economic Hardship of the Grerat Depression.Mr. Hellinger's characters vividly portray the convulsions that the Country faced. Those, who once again were based on real life Bootleggers, Rum Runners, etc. were handily portrayed by the Warner Brothers stock company of players headed up by Mr. Cagney, Bogie, Jeffrey Lynn, Priscilla Lane, Gladys George, Frank McHugh, Elizabeth Risdon, Joe Sawyer, Dick Wessel, Ben Welden, Paul Kelly, John Hamilton, Abner Biberman and a cast of thousands! Mark Hellinger's story served as a fictionalized kaleidoscope of the bizarre events of American History during a 13 year period of time sandwiched into those years between the two great World Wars. By way of the drama, Hellinger tries his best to offer us perhaps not any excuses for the bad behaviour, but rather the reasons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite thirties Gangster Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the famous gangster films were made in the early part of the decade, before the infamous Production Code took all the sex and violence out of the movies, and before they figured out how to make decent movies with sound. The landmark films of the genre like "Little Caesar" and "Public Enemy" are actually kind of poorly made, by modern standards.Not so this entertaining film, it's full of life and energy and great fun to watch. James Cagney gives a wonderful performance as a dynamic and ambitious man who goes from a barely-eating taxi driver to a gang lord, and back again. Humphrey Bogart gives one of his best pre-Casablanca villain performances, and even generic leading lady Priscilla Land is fresh and likeable.The only quibble I have with this film is it lacks the immediacy of the earlier "ripped from the headlines" films. It's made about days that had since gone by, and owes more to earlier films than the reality of the day (post-modernism in the thirties?). Still, it's great fun, do see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vintage Warner Brothers of the thirties</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not as well remembered as "Little Caesar" or "Public Enemy," "The Roaring Twenties" is the culmination of a decade's worth of Warner Brothers gangster films. It was also James Cagney's last tough guy role at the studio for almost a decade.Cagney is criticized by some in this one for not packing the cinematic punch he did in "Public Enemy" or "White Heat." But this film was the brain child of former Broadway columnist Mark Hellinger and was written as almost an ode to the Damon Runion-like characters Hellinger knew when he prowled the great white way during the 20s. Hellinger was a regular at the famous El Fey club and friend of Texas Guinan, the wild saloon hostess who personified the twenties. Cagney's good/bad guy character, Eddie Bartlett, was in fact based on Larry Fay, the cab driver turned bootlegger who opened the El Fey and hired Guinan as his hostess. Fay is also believed to have been one of the inspirations for F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby." Bartlett is meant to symbolize,not a psychotic criminal, but more the social confusion that resultedfrom the passage of a highly unpopular law meant to regulate character,which wound up having the absolute opposite effect, spawning an era of lawlessness.Although Cagney dominates every scene he is in, the more ominous gangster in the film is played by Humphrey Bogart in one of his best performances prior to assuming character roles in the late 40s. His trigger happy hood was probably fashioned after Owen "Ownie the Killer" Madden, the bootlegger who bought into Harlem's Cotton Club and formed a loose alliance with Fay.Strong supporting work comes from Gladys George, who plays Panama Smith, the Texas Guinan character.This picture is slick, well produced, uniformly well acted under the direction of action specialist Raoul Walsh and features some great Cagney stick. When he exploded on screen, there was no one like him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The cycle of gangster movies made at Warner Brothers in the 1930s, regardless of who was in them, who directed them or how their stories panned out, all had one thing in common. They came at their audiences at breakneck pace. While their ostensible aim was to condemn violence and lawlessness, their real agenda was one of thrills, danger and nonstop action.The odd thing about The Roaring Twenties, is that there is not really a lot of action or typical gangster business in it, at least not at the beginning. Bootlegging is seen as a relatively tame activity, and criminality as something any reasonable person could slide into. There aren't even any scenes of gangland violence until 55 minutes in. However it still has that typical crime drama speed and punch. A lot of the impact comes from the regular background-info montages, a staple at Warner Brothers but rarely done better. Most of the shots are close-ups and almost all of them feature some sharp movement, like a kind of visual roller-coaster ride. A lot of thought has gone into how each shot will fit with the next. During the montage showing the effects of prohibition, we get one shot of a car crashing straight towards the camera, followed by a quick dolly in on a row of bottles, giving a dizzying push-pull effect.Director Raoul Walsh also gives a racy feel to even the more straightforward scenes. He gets the actors constantly moving as they talk, and the camera stays tight on the action, constantly back- and- forth with the players. The first half hour is like a whistle-stop tour as we are buffeted from one scene to the next, and the dialogue is snapped out like gunfire, making up for the lack of real shooting. Even in the relatively sedate scenes towards the middle, where Cagney gets together with Priscilla Lane, Walsh still keeps a sense of nervous edginess with extras milling about in the background, with only one or two genuinely tranquil moments here and there to highlight something of importance or emotional intensity.The Warner Brothers style had its ideal star in James Cagney, and here he is the usual bundle of shrugs, twitches and cracking delivery, albeit far from his best performance. He simply slots into the general pattern of punches and wisecracks, rather than commanding the screen as he did in Angels with Dirty Faces. His love interest Priscilla Lane makes a disappointingly dull leading lady, although she does have a lot of charm and character when singing. However the best turn of The Roaring Twenties is by alternate female lead Gladys George, billed lower but with comparable screen time and oodles more screen presence. George is the perfect moll, full of vibrant personality, and yet behind her eyes you can see the great weight of sadness. Her Panama Smith is the only truly real-looking character in this drama.And this emotional strand brought in by the Gladys George character is important to The Roaring Twenties. While every gangster movie of the time finished up with the hero's ignoble demise, perhaps none before it had such a feeling of tragedy and nostalgia. It's no coincidence that the movie's signature tune is "Come to me, my melancholy baby", for this is the most poignant of all the Warner's gangster flicks. And yet this aspect is still underdeveloped, because this is still at its roots a standard genre movie, an uncomplicated action package. It's actually shame that in those days a picture like this had to be a certain kind of thing, because with a little more reflection and credibility The Roaring Twenties could have been a truly moving experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cagney on top form in this anything but routine gangster film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that Cagney gives one of his best performances here, as the fairly hapless Eddie, being defined by, while mirroring the times he lived through, from First World War to New Deal. The thing that sets his performance apart is the way we see him constantly struggling with the morality of his actions - especially in contrast to the psychopathic Bogart who has no such problems with inner struggles. We see this at the very beginning in the war scenes, we see it again in his rise up the bootlegger ranks, and his acceptance of the loss of the love of his life to his best friend. Finally, of course, we see it in his actions to protect the lives and life of those who have hurt him most. Cagney gives this fairly typical gangster character depth and pathos that make a very good film into a great one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great cast doing a classic gangster genre film. Director Raoul Walsh was over shadowed in 1939, but when you watch this film it is as good as any film made in this genre. James Cagney &amp; Humphrey Bogart play bootleggers &amp; hoods and make their portrayals very realistic.The original material this film is based on was written by a contemporary of Walter Winchell who did some excellent writing in this field. This is not you standard gangster film either. Walsh's film departs from glorifying the gangsters by killing all the big shots by the end of the movie.A clip of Cagney from this film was used in Elton John's Classic Diet Coke Commercial in 1992.

		<shortDescription>Well Paced And Exciting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrific, involving gangster film by director Raoul Walsh featuring top-notch performances led by the usual good as gold James Cagney. JC plays a good man who comes home from WWI realizing the world has changed and there is nothing there for him compared to before he went overseas. Though his introduction to the underworld is set-up without him knowing, Cags takes to the lifestyle since the best he can do is make a living as a cabbie. He fly's to the top during prohibition falling for Priscilla Lane, the girl he brought into his nightclub to sing and who doesn't return his affection, as well as taking Humphrey Bogart on as a partner. Lane falls for JC's good guy lawyer Jeffrey Lynn who she eventually marries and has a child with. Along the way, Lynn has been made an assistant district attorney. With the repeal of prohibition, Cags falls on hard times and is forced back to the cabbie ranks while ex-partner Bogart rises to the top. This sets up a memorable confrontation between the two as JC tries to prevent Bogie from knocking off Lane's lawyer husband.Some folks found this film to be slow moving but I didn't. Sure, it doesn't crackle with an over-abundance of energy like some of Cagney's other gangster films but I thought it was well paced and exciting enough. Lot's of great dialog and a nice semi-documentary style employed by the great Walsh. The performances are excellent all around and as usual, Cagney stands out but the one performance I do want to mention is that of Gladys George as Panama Smith. Her friendship and chemistry with Cagney bursts on the screen as soon as they meet and the saucy George is also tough as nails and at the ready with a great one-liner. Her toughness is at times just a mask for a soft heart and an obvious boatload of affection for Cagney's Eddie Bartlett. It really is a memorable performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The James Cagney Movie Formula Before the Fall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After "The Great War" ends, G.I. James Cagney (as Eddie Bartlett) returns home from France. He expects to return to his old job as an automobile mechanic; however, the boss breaks a promise, and turns Mr. Cagney away. In fact, the United States is descending into economic turmoil, which will end with "The Great Depression". Unable to make an honest living, Cagney drifts into profitable "Prohibition"-era bootlegging. Valiant speakeasy hostess Gladys George (as Panama Smith) pines for Cagney, but he only has eyes for sweet Priscilla Lane (as Jean Sherman). As the years roll along, Cagney's trusted lawyer Jeffrey Lynn (as Lloyd Hart) falls in love with pretty Ms. Lane? Warner Brothers seems to have pulled out all the stops for "The Roaring Twenties". Cagney, who had reached an extraordinary peak with the recently released gem "Angels with Dirty Faces", is a marvel to watch, from beginning to end. Interestingly, after this film, Cagney sought to stop to his "gangster" image, until "White Heat" (another gem, from 1949). But, here, Cagney is still the victim of circumstances; note, he does not become a criminal due to his nature. In this film, Cagney is another "Angel", with a environmentally influenced "dirty face"... "The Roaring Twenties" is, also, about relationships; or, to be more specific, it's about unexciting relationships. The only believable passion Cagney's character has is for best pal Frank McHugh (as Danny Green), who needed some more expository scenes. The one that got away, Ms. George makes the most of a poorly scripted relationship between her character and "Eddie" - this is the pairing the film really serves up short shrift.The production is "top of the line,", but the story is neither as strong, nor as artfully told as its studio's other "gangster" movies. Still, a star like Cagney, supporting players like Humphrey Bogart, and bit players down to Maurice Costello, make "The Roaring Twenties" purr.******* The Roaring Twenties (10/23/39) Raoul Walsh ~ James Cagney, Gladys George, Humphrey Bogart</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Some Spoilers) With the First World War over and peace breaking out all over the world many returning GI's were in for a big surprise when the parades and partying stopped. It was just about then that the Volstade Act, the 18th Amendment, was put into effect which opened the door to a new and very dangerous criminal element; The bootlegger and the mob who controlled him.Getting involved in the bootlegging business were ex-GI's Eddie Bartlett &amp; George Hally, James Cagney &amp; Humphrey Bogart, together with Llyod Heart,Jeffrey Lynn, who being that he's collage educated turned out to be the brains of the trio. Llyod in the end not only survived the Prohibition years but, after being a Mafia-type mouth-piece for his friend Eddie, became an assistance D.A in NY District Attorney's Tom Dewey's office.Eddie who really wanted to go legit in running a taxi garage, the job he left when he was drafted into the Army, found when he came marching home from the war that he wasn't needed there anymore. Slowly drifting from one meager job to another Eddie ended up being busted for delivering, while driving a cab, a bottle or illegal gin to this nightclub singer Panama Smith, Gladys George. It was then that Eddie had his eyes opened to what the real world was all about and went full-tilt into the bootlegging business becoming one of the top moonshine operator in NYC. It was also then that Eddie met his pen-pal from the war Jean Sherman, Priscilla Lane, whom he, when she reached maturity, fell crazily in love with. It was just too bad for Eddie that Jean didn't feel the same way about him.Things were going pretty good for Eddie as he was making big bucks delivering booze to nightclubs and speakeasy's all over town. Eddie even got his girlfriend the very talented Jean Sherman a job as a nightclub singer at one of his customers, in receiving his booze, establishments Pete Henderson's, Edward Keane, "The Panama Club". It was when Eddie got hooked up with his old army buddy George Hally that things turned sour for him. Taking on Hally's boss, known as the notorious "Spaghetti Man", big time bootlegger Nick Brown, Paul Kelly, Eddie ended up having an outraged Brown and a couple of his hoods crash into Henderson's nightclub, right in the middle of Jane singing "Melancholy Baby", where both fists and gunfire was exchanged between the two! Later when Eddie's friend Danny Green, Frank McHugh, was murdered by Brown in retaliation Eddie decided to pay him a visit at his restaurant "The Spaghetti Joint" on the East Side that lead to Brown having his last meal on earth; you guessed it a bowl of spaghetti. Unknown to Eddie it was his "friend" Hally who tipped off Brown that he was coming over but, having too much spaghetti on the brain, Brown couldn't react fast enough to stop Eddie and his boys from plugging him and his fellow hoods.It wasn't long that the stock market crashed and the "Roaring Twenties", with the both partying and boozing it up, came to an abrupt end together with all the money that Eddie made during those years. The final nail on the coffin, for bootleggers like Eddie, came when Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected president in 1932. Roosevelt keeping a campaign promise that he'll repeal the 18th Amendment finally had Eddie &amp; Co. looking for a decent job but in the middle of the Great Depression jobs, decent or otherwise, were hard to find.It's was almost by accident that Eddie, driving a cab, ran into Jean and found out to both his surprise and shock that she married his friend Llyod Hart. ***SPOILERS*** Broken hearted over the loss of Jean, to Llyod, Eddie gets a chance to redeem himself form his life of crime in later saving Llyod from being rubbed out by the Hally Mob. Eddie through Jean finds out from a couple of Hally's, who took over the late "Spaghetti Man" Nick Brown's operations, hoods that they got a contract out on Llyod who was about to indite their boss on murder and racketeering charges. Eddie goes to see the "Big Man", George Hally, in order to try to talk him out of getting Llyod knocked off and prevent Jane from becoming a widow and her and Llyod's son little Bobby, Don Thaddeus Kerr, and orphan.Spectacular conclusion with Eddie going into the lions den, Hally's headquarters, and having it out with him and his henchmen knowing that the odds are that he wouldn't get out alive. This after trying to talk Hally out of whacking Llyod but to no avail. Final ending on the steps of the Community Church has by now become folklore in movie history with Eddie finally finding peace in the violent world that he lived in all of his adult life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Warner's Gangster Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was directed by Raoul Walsh and included many of the Warner Brothers stalwarts. You'll recognize many familiar faces if you're an aficionado of the genre. Rip-roaring, no-nonsense stuff, it's basically organized around three stories: (1) Cagney's rise from unemployed ex-soldier to the top of the bootlegger heap and back again; (2) the love quadrangle involving Cagney, Gladys George as the soft-hearted blowzy Panama Smith, Priscilla Lane as the "good girl", and Jeffrey Lynn as the lawyer; and (3) the friendship of Cagney, Humphrey Bogart, and Jeffrey Lynn in the trenches, turning into a wary partnership, the eventual defection of Lynn, the ruination of Cagney, and the death by natural causes (three bullets) of treacherous, greedy, petty Bogart. According to Mark Hellinger's story, the end of prohibition by Franklin Delano Roosevelt put an end to the gangsters. Zealous moralists, take note. The answer CAN be found in the bottom of a glass.As far as the movie is concerned, there's nothing much not to like. You may have seen it before, sections of it, in one guise or another. Citizen Kane boosted his girl friend's opera career, didn't he? And as a matter of fact Cagney himself boosted Ruth Etting (Doris Day) in "Love Me or Leave Me." And this was far from the first shootout Cagney had with treacherous ex-colleagues -- or the last, for that matter. But they're all stitched neatly together here. It should be seen if for no other reason than that it's an almost perfect exemplar of Warner's 1930s gangster movies. And it has a famous last line too -- "He used to be a big shot," says Panama Smith over Cagney's corpse. Granted, it's not, "Good-night, sweet prince, flights of angels sing thee to thy rest." It's a classic line only because Walsh's direction and Gladys George's reading make it so.I rather enjoyed it. There is Priscilla Lane's plain vanilla ice-cream beauty, Bogart's horrifying overacting when he's shot, Gladys George's softly knowing brittleness, Jeffrey Lynn's unimaginative, bourgeois impulses, and above all, James Cagney's acting. He's pretty good. And good at whatever emotional state he's projecting, from doomed resignation to cocky superiority. And he's outstanding after he falls from grace and winds up a seedy bum, haunting saloons and living in hovels that offer rooms for 15 cents a night. He realizes that his time has run out just as he's leaving Flannagan's Saloon, drunk, and for some reason he pauses at the piano on his way out, stares down at a half-empty glass of beer, and smiles to himself, both with sadness and relief. The shot is held for a while too. And it's not strictly functional -- a small but masterly gloss on Cagney's character development.Well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine this for a film plot: Soldier fights in Afghanistan , returns to America only to find there's no job for him and the girl he met on an internet chat room is entirely different from how he imagined and to make ends meet starts dealing drugs and find himself climbing up the underworld ladder . You see that fictional plot is very very similar to the plot of THE ROARING TWENTIES and shows how formulaic cinema plots are . It also shows that there's an appetite of movie goers who enjoy this type of tale despite the large and small changes in society over the decades THE ROARING TWENTIES starts with a caption by Mark Hellinger lamenting the 1920s as being the decade which was marked by prohibition on alcohol . From the outset the film takes a totally unrepentant stand that prohibition was a complete disaster being both unenforceable and allowing a market to be controlled by gangsters . Hellinger hopes that America will never see such dark days again but if he were to see the damage brought on to American society in the 21st century by illegal drugs you get the sneaking suspicion that the only way to solve the problem would be by legalising the problem . Drugs including alcohol are certainly a menace to individuals but the menace to society is a bigger one if they're outlawed This isn't a bad gangster film but seems forgotten alongside many of its contemporaries . One thing missing is that it lacks an emotional core like ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES which made a more compelling movie . It also seems to run out of the steam in the second where plot turns rely on unconvincing coincidences in order to drive the story forward which is a shame since the first half is so good</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Roaring Twenties (1939) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart (who was just about to become a big star) team up here, with Cagney as a more easy-going sort of guy and Bogie as a strictly low-down type (one of his best lines: "He won't be 16"). The strength of the movie is where it plays very much like a historical newsreel headline, taking us through the intervening years from our first meeting with both men fighting together in the WWI trenches, and then later as they become ordinary citizens again and lose contact for a bit; Cagney tries unsuccessfully to get back his old job at the local auto garage but when he's turned away, decides he has to stoop to running his own bootleg liquor business when Prohibition sets in by the '20s. His is a much less conventional gangster type this time around, but he still doesn't hesitate to step into his disgruntled "mobster" mode when he gets occasionally perturbed. Not as consistent as some of Warner Bros.' earlier films of the genre, but still a good one. *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes I come to a film because it looks like it can directly fulfill, sometimes because it can provide precious background to other things that matter, letting them stand. It's watchable in itself, this one; a misfit's rise and fall played against the passing of times. Released on the cusp of WWII, it opened a portal back to more careless times, taking us on a journey from WWI trenches through the highs of Prohibition to the lows of Depression, so we could have this clear moral stance: in the new world there's no room for scoundrels. Right.Interesting here is that only a year or two before Citizen Kane we have a similar saga about the passing of the times, but one that asks no fundamental question of us, casts no doubt on its testimony. It's as lurid and constructed as newspaper headlines of the time, a main contrast in Welles' film about its world-creating newspaperman. It's machinegun history written in the staccato sounds of a newspaperman's typewriter.What I really wanted to see though was Cagney. I am in the middle of a film noir quest looking for its machinery, and as an aside I was brought to explore its roots in 1930's crime stuff. Cagney is a force in this niche. He had so much energy that he could turn into presence. He is not just amused, he doesn't coast on pushing things back like Bogart; he throws himself on the encounter, bitterly cutting himself on the edges. Not so here. He was asked to play a basically decent guy led astray by the prospect of easy money, meaning to reflect the broader American endeavor that ended on Black Tuesday. Usually in a Cagney film he lets loose in the end. They asked of him here the precise opposite; he sleepwalks, numbed by failure, a human ruin clawing at redemption. He looks like he gives it his all, but it's just not who he is. It's as if you asked Welles to strut like Wayne. If you want to see Cagney in top form, look him up in Footlight Parade fully in command of a show, White Heat to see him face real demons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The March of Crime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE ROARING TWENTIES (Warner Brothers, 1939), directed by Raoul Walsh, is a nostalgic look back into an era recollected by New York City columnist, Mark Hellinger. Taken from his original story, Hellinger introduces THE ROARING TWENTIES with this forward message: "It may come to past that at some distant date, we will be confronted with another period similar to the one depicted in this photo-play. If that happens, I pray that the events, as dramatized here, will be remembered. In this film the characters are composites of people I knew and the situations are those that actually occurred. Bitter or sweet, most memories become precious as the years move one." The story gets underway as Hellinger's treasured memories are presented in documentary style with voice-over narration by John Deering depicting the decade fondly known as "The Roaring Twenties."1918: The Great War (World War I), Eddie Bartlett (James Cagney), an American soldier on a battlefield falls into a shell hole where he encounters George Hally (Humphrey Bogart), followed by another soldier, Lloyd Hart (Jeffrey Lynn) who also drops in on them. After the Armistace is signed, ending the war, the men return to the United States, going on their separate ways. 1919: Time marches on. Soldiers return home to find the world has changed and are unable to return where they left off. George returns to his saloon business; Lloyd studies to become a lawyer; and Eddie, unable to get his old job at the garage, earns his living driving a taxi during off hours for his pal, Danny Green (Frank McHugh). Eddie comes to Minneola, Long Island, to meet Jean Sherman, the girl to whom he's been corresponding by mail during his days at war, only to become disappointed when Jean (Priscilla Lane) turns out to be a teenager attending high school. 1920: Prohibition begins, speakeasy's form with crime on the rise. Eddie, still driving a taxi, delivers a package for a passenger to hostess, Panama Smith (Gladys George), of the Henderson Club. He gets arrested when detectives find the package to be liquor. Upon his release, Eddie joins forces with Panama in the bootlegging racket. 1922: With his huge profits, Eddie buys his fleet of cabs. He becomes reacquainted with Jean Sherman, now an attractive young woman working as a chorus girl. Through his connections, Eddie gets her a job as a night club singer (somewhat inspired by popular vocalist, Ruth Etting). 1924: Bootlegging and crime are at its peak. The Panama Club, owned by Panama Smith, is established. Eddie teams up with George Hally. Jean falls in love with Lloyd, Eddie's personal lawyer. 1929: Black Tuesday, October 29th, Stock Market Crash. Jean becomes Lloyd's wife; Eddie and Panama, like everyone else, face financial ruin while George becomes head of a syndicate. 1932-33: Franklin Roosevelt becomes the president of the United States; Prohibition ends; Mark Hellinger's character study unfolds with big climatic finish.To help the story along, selected old-time popular songs from the roaring twenties era are selected, including "Carolina in the Morning" (dance number); "My Melancholy Baby," "I'm Just Wild About Harry," "It Had to Be You," "My Melancholy Baby" (all sung by Priscilla Lane); and "In a Shanty in Old Shanty Town" (sung by Gladys George). Other members of the cast include Paul Kelly (Nick Brown); Joseph Sawyer (Sergeant Pete Jones); Elisabeth Risdon (Jean's Mother); and John Hamilton (The Judge). As much as Cagney and Bogart make a great pair of friendly rivals, THE ROARING TWENTIES proved to be their third and final collaboration together, their second being a western, THE OKLAHOMA KID (1939). A well-crafted screenplay with memorable scenes, newsreels, well-crafted gun-play, authentic costumes and hairstyles reflecting the roaring twenties are an added plus here. While Cagney and Lane share equal billing above the glittering title, and Cagney being the central character throughout, by film's end, it's Gladys George, whose excellent portrayal in the Texas Guinan style, who literally steals it from the rest of the cast. She even has the now famous closing line. No doubt her performance was deserving for an Academy Award nomination (Best Supporting Actress category), which, sadly, she did not get. Regardless, she makes the movie the true classic it's become. Along with Cagney and Bogart's ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES, THE ROARING TWENTIES was one of their most revived movies on broadcast television in the 1970s. In 1974 alone, THE ROARING TWENTIES had five broadcasts from New York City television within a span of a few months/or weeks. Its continued popularity had led THE ROARING TWENTIES onto home video (later DVD) and finally cable television where it turns up regularly on Turner Classic Movies. THE ROARING TWENTIES simplifies a bygone era while Warner Brothers simplifies its grand style in crime themes that continues to be looked back with great admiration as one of the studio's finest accomplishments of its time.

		<fullReview>A battlefield in WWI is the setting for the opening of this story. Three men find shelter in a trench. As it happens, the trio will get involved later on during peace time in ways that will alter their lives. The lives of Eddie Bartlett, George Hally, and Lloyd Hart will keep crossing one another as peace is declared and they go back home to New York....Eddie Bartlett comes home to find out he is unemployed. The position he had as a mechanic is no longer there for him. Remembering his pen pal Jean Sherman, who sent him all sorts of goodies while he was at the front, he decides to meet to thank her for her kindness. His pal, Danny Green, who did not go to war, is happy to take him to Mineola to see this war pal. What he did not realize Jean is a teenager still at school living with her mother in that suburban setting.As Prohibition was enacted, enterprising men like Eddie Bartlett saw a silver lining in the fact they could make a lot of money in making their own booze, distributed in different venues of the city. Eddie became friendly with Panama Smith, a sometime singer who owned a speakeasy. Eddie figured it was the perfect setting in which to sell his merchandise. George Hally came on board to the illegal operation. Lloyd, who was a lawyer, joins the group as Eddie asked him to help Panama beat a charge. As he becomes successful, Eddie discovers Jean again working as a chorus girl in a musical revue. He wants to give her a chance as a singer at Panama's joint. Eventually, George breaks his association with Eddie to go on his own. The two men will become rivals. Eddie, loving Jean, sees her fall in love with Lloyd who could offer her a decent home away from that environment. Panama, who secretly loved Eddie, is the only one that stayed with him when the empire he had built comes crashing down.One of the best films of 1939, this Warner Bros. picture was directed by Raoul Walsh. Based on a story by Mark Hellinger, the screenplay was written by Jerry Wald, Richard Macaulay and Robert Rossen. Prohibition, as shown in the film brought out the worst in people. An ill conceived law that brought the criminal element to control the illegal liquor, was devastating for the country that was followed by the Great Depression. The film was photographed by one of the best cameramen of the era, Ernest Haller.An inspired James Cagney is a magnetic presence in the film. His Eddie is one of the best roles he played during his distinguished career in the movies. Humphrey Bogart is seen as George Hally in an understated performance. Gladys George made an excellent contribution to the film with her Panama Smith, the tough girl in the illegal booze circuit. Priscilla Lane is seen as Jean, a decent girl out of her league as she became a singer. The great Frank McHugh appeared as Danny Green and Jeffrey Lynn as Lloyd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"In this business, you shouldn't worry about your old age"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gangster films were all the rage in the 1930s, and 'The Roaring Twenties (1939)' is another excellent Warner Brothers addition. Jimmy Cagney stars as Eddie Bartlett, a WWI soldier who returns home to America to find himself without a job. When Prohibition kicks in, he earns cash by delivering illegal liquor, and soon builds a corrupt underground empire that gives him wealth and power, but not happiness. Bartlett ignites a partnership, and then rivalry, with George Hally (the one-and-only Humphrey Bogart), a hardened, sneering, ruthless criminal with trigger- happy fingers. I recall watching 'Angels with Dirty Faces (1938)' purely for Bogart, and being surprised that Cagney's personality completely dominated him. Here, just a year later, the tables have turned. In this film, Bogart is a veritable force, a shrewd and merciless thug worthy of the great gangster villains. Cagney's performance is good, but perhaps lacking the intensity of earlier his earlier gangster roles.A common element of most 1930s gangster films was a sympathetic protagonist. Despite being effectively condemned to death by the Production Code, these characters were usually forced towards a life of crime by unfortunate circumstances ? in this case, WWI robs Bartlett of his livelihood, and Prohibition provides a means of survival. This plot device, circumstances pushing characters towards a fateful tragedy, proved a precursor to the film noir mould, in which justice is inevitable. Present here is also the interesting approach of mirroring similar characters on either side of the moral coin. In 'Angels with Dirty Faces,' Cagney's character became a gangster, and Pat O'Brien became a priest. In 'Manhattan Melodrama (1934),' William Powell's conflicted District Attorney must prosecute his boyhood friend, played by Clarke Gable. In 'The Roaring Twenties,' Jeffrey Lynn's honest lawyer (if such an oxymoron is to be considered possible) serves as a counterpoint to the film's otherwise shady characters, the only man wholesome enough for the bright-eyed, rosy-cheeked leading lady (Priscilla Lane).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great old movie. A fictional story set against the backdrop of real-life America from 1918 into the 1930s Great Depression, this film exudes a wonderful nostalgic mood that recaptures that era, with its bootlegging, speakeasy, and gangster elements. Although the plot is fine for the most part, it's the characters, the music, and the overall tone that renders the film high quality.James Cagney plays the central character, Eddie Bartlett, a young soldier returning to the States from Europe, at the end of WWI. Eddie is basically a decent guy, with a good heart. But he can't find a job. He expresses his frustration to a friend: "I am tired Danny, tired of being pushed around, tired of having doors slammed in my face ?" But recently-enacted prohibition laws create money opportunities in the illegal manufacture and selling of alcohol. Into this seedy underworld Eddie drifts, a result of circumstances and poor choices.Eddie's change thus mirrors the country's change, in its fixation on illegal booze, which attracts gangsters, using their guns, fists, and smarts to build wealth, en route to the stock market crash of 1929. Along the way, Eddie reunites, improbably, with two former soldier buddies, one good (played by Jeffrey Lynn), and one bad (played by Humphrey Bogart), thus completing a trinity of characters that spans the gamut of human morality.The first twenty minutes sets up the story, but it's talky and somewhat tedious. Once we get to Henderson's Club, the plot picks up. Indeed, the nightclub sequences are the most memorable plot elements. Enter wonderful Panama Smith (Gladys George), a kind of high-class speakeasy dame with soul, who lords over these places with style. She and Eddie develop a platonic relationship, inasmuch as Eddie is drawn to a younger woman, a singer named Jean Sherman (Priscilla Lane).The film's overall tone is nostalgic, with its newsreel, march-of-time frame of reference, and its era songs, principally the moody "Melancholy Baby", sung twice by Priscilla Lane. B&amp;W lighting adds dark menace in the gangster sequences. And acting is terrific. There's not a weak performance in the bunch."The Roaring Twenties", though fictional in its story, is very much a historical document, inasmuch as real events drive the script's overarching themes, and steer characters into choices and situations they find themselves in. Regrettably, this film is not in the National Film Registry. It should be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sizzling crackle of American history that is the best gangster drama!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie covers American history between 1918 and 1939. It starts with James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart as soldiers fighting in World War I, and ends up with their involvement in post-prohibition rackets just before the outbreak of World War II. It is apparent from the get-go that Cagney is a basically nice guy who just gets a bad break. Even through prohibition, he drinks only milk, while Bogart is violent from the start. Unlike his character in "The Fighting 69th" (another World War I drama from Warners), Cagney wants to do his duty as an American, while Bogart enjoys killing from the get-go. He even wants to take his rifle back to America with him. Back in New York, Cagney wants to settle down as a cab driver and avoid the rackets which have come out with the threat of prohibition, but times are tough and even in pre-depression America, unemployment is rampant. Along with pal Frank McHugh, he goes to visit the girl whose letters kept him comforted during the war, and finds out that she is a teenager. Later, she turns up (as played by Priscilla Lane) in the chorus of a musical, and Cagney finds himself falling in love with her. With no hope of getting steady work, Cagney gets into the rackets, and as he becomes more powerful, uses his influence to get Lane a job at the speakeasy run by good-hearted moll Gladys George. It's shades of "Love Me or Leave Me", but Lane is never as interesting as Doris Day's Ruth Etting in that later excellent musical.The narration of John Deering takes us through World War I, the struggles of returning vets after the end of the war, and even how the Volstead Act came to come into being. We also see the stockmarket crash, the election of FDR, and the end of prohibition which takes rackateering into new levels. Bogart has faded out after the World War I scenes, but comes back as Cagney's prohibition rackateer gets more powerful; They ultimately join forces, but it is apparent that Bogart is bound to betray Cagney as soon as it suits him. While this narrative seems to cover a lot of territory in just 90 minutes, it does so seamlessly without being sappy or sentimental. Lane sings a couple of great songs, and later on, George does too, with that whiskey voiced cynicism that makes her unforgettable. In a year of great performances, George gives one of the best, and was certainly worth of Oscar consideration. It's obvious that she's playing a Texas Guinan type character. If you ever listen to the CD of the flop Broadway musical "Legs Diamond", listen carefully to the performance of Julie Wilson's speakeasy hostess. It is much modeled on both Texas Guinan and Gladys George here.There are some gruesome deaths in the film, including one that is particularly grizzly because of the poor victim's facial expression. The Lane/Jeffrey Lynn pairing isn't interesting, but is necessary because of how it moves Cagney's character forward and reveals hidden sensitivities inside him. When Lane is singing "I'm Just Wild About Harry", watch Gladys George's facial expressions while she watches Cagney, who is tapping his hand on George's. It's a silent performance that reveals so much and is heartbreaking. The ending is now a classic, which gives George one of the greatest closing lines in movie history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cagney and Bogart- two tough guys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story starts from the World War I.There these guys, Eddie Bartlett, George Hally and Lloyd Hart get to know each other.After the war Lloyd goes back to practise law, former saloon keeper George turns to bootlegging and out-of-work Eddie becomes a cab driver, with the help of his cabbie friend Danny Green.Eddie pays a visit to Jean Sherman, a sweet girl who had corresponded with him during the war.The only problem is, she is just a teenager and he can't have nothing to do with her now- but in a couple of years, sure.Then Eddie meets the owner of a speakeasy, Panama Smith.They become close friends and she introduces him in bootlegging of liquor.His war buddy George becomes his partner and Lloyd becomes his lawyer.His girl Jean and Lloyd have something going on with each other, and later they get married.Eddie's business is blooming, until 19 October 1929- the Black Tuesday ruins everything.Eddie loses all his fame and fortune.He starts driving the cab again, and turns to booze.Raoul Walsh' The Roaring Twenties (1939) has got a social message.It tells realistically how these men without work would turn to bootlegging during the prohibition and later lose everything they had.James Cagney, a true tough guy does a memorable job playing Eddie.He was one of the kind, and no one could do it like him.The other tough guy, Humphrey Bogart is really great as George.Bogie was on his way to big stardom, receiving only second billing then.He was known as a bad guy during those times, the hero parts came next decade.Priscilla Lane is brilliant as Jean Sherman, and she could also sing.Gladys George is terrific as Panama Smith.Jeffrey Lynn is really good as Lloyd Hart.The role of Danny Green, one of my favorites, is played by magnificent Frank McHugh.George Meeker plays Masters.John Deering is the narrator.The Roaring Twenties is a really great gangster movie, and the narration brings a documentary feel to it.The ending is highly memorable- highly tragic.The drunken Eddie kills George and gets killed himself by the gangsters on the street.Panama rushes to him and the cop comes to the scene.When the cop asks "Do You know this guy?" she replies: "Yeah, he used to be a big shot".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Roaring Twenties" is a very good piece. I have nothing to add to the comments posted so far. Except... I'd like to point out the "Warner Night at the Movies" part on the DVD.If you're like me, you probably navigate to "Play Movie", or what it's called, in the DVD menu right away. In the case of the WB DVD of "Roaring Twenties", you're in for a treat if you navigate to "Warner Night at the Movies - Play all" instead. (You might want an extra fistful of popcorn :^) That somehow recreates the experience of cinema-going in 1940. You get to see a trailer for the next attraction (Each Dawn I Die), newsreel, three shorts (mini-musical All Girl Revue, mini-comedy The Great Library Misery, Tex Avery cartoon in Technicolor: Thugs with Dirty Mugs, 8/12/8 minutes) and then the real movie, all in a row. Lovely and lovingly done.The shorts are nothing very exceptional, but all listed on IMDb. What thrilled me in this approach is that you don't just watch and think about one movie, as usual, but get a handful of assorted (but incoherent) period material. All in all, I at least felt much more "being there".Googling tells me that Leonard Maltin has hosted more such "Warner Night at the Movies" compositions. This is the first I saw, but I'm already looking forward for more...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cagney and Bogie in this gangster film about Prohibition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart are gangsters in "The Roaring Twenties," a 1939 film also starring Priscilla Lane, Gladys George, Frank McHugh and Jeffrey Lynn. Cagney, Bogart and Lynn are Eddie, George and Lloyd, who all end up in a foxhole right before World War I armistice is declared. Eddie plans on going back to work as an auto mechanic and Lloyd plans to work as an attorney. Once in the real world, Eddie finds there are no jobs for returning vets. He soon goes where the money is, in bootlegging, and hires Lloyd as his attorney. Eventually, robbing another mobster's shipload of high-priced liquor, Eddie runs into George on the ship, and the two join forces. Eventually they become enemies.One night, Eddie spots a young woman, Jean (Lane) in a show - as a teen during the war, she wrote to him; when he met her and saw how young she was, he left her house in a huff. Now several years have passed, and Eddie falls for her. He manages to get her a job in a speakeasy run by his girlfriend, Panama Smith - the implication is that Eddie is sleeping with her but there are no strings. Lloyd and Jean fall in love. Everybody knows it but Eddie.The above are the two plots that move "The Roaring Twenties," which provides some interesting Prohibition history along with the story. Bogart is not yet the big star he would become a year or so later; he plays a mean criminal with no regard for anything or anyone very well. Cagney's great performance garners more sympathy as Eddie, who seems almost a victim of circumstances as well as being unlucky in love. Gladys George's Panama is really in love with Eddie, and her hurt is obvious to the audience. Frank McHugh does a terrific job as Danny, who originally brings Eddie into the cab-driving business. Lynn is fairly bland a Lloyd, which is intentional - he would be just the kind of man the young, traditional Jean would fall for. Lane is an ideal ingénue.Raoul Walsh does a fine job of directing this film, which contains lots of action scenes. Truly an excellent cast in an absorbing Warner Brothers film which more or less closed their era of big gangster movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>gangster era leading to some great movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard for many years about the fact that Warner Bros. released many gangster flicks during the '30s, and how the animation department incorporated the dialect into their cartoons (just listen to Bugs Bunny's accent). But few of these movies are quite so riveting as Raoul Walsh's "The Roaring Twenties".It starts in WWI-era France, where American soldiers Eddie (James Cagney), George (Humphrey Bogart) and Lloyd (Jeffrey Lynn) meet on the battlefield. Returning to New York after the war ends, they try to restart their old lifestyles, but the country has changed: not only has a different person taken Eddie's job in the garage, but a new policy called Prohibition has banned the sale of alcohol. Naturally, this only helps to strengthen the criminals, who sell alcohol in speakeasies. So, with Eddie and George forced into a life of crime, we see that we're in for an intense film. Things take yet another turn when the stock market crashes, plunging the country into the Great Depression.I would say that probably the most interesting character is Jean (Priscilla Lane): the most wholesome young woman of all, she takes a job singing in speakeasies, surrounded by rather seedy people, while in a semi-relationship with Eddie; it's a near 180 from her upbringing.I certainly recommend this movie as one of the best gangster flicks of the era. It really transports you back to the '30s (and even earlier). Check it out. Also starring Gladys George.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It has a memorable finale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are five or six films which I don't consider particularly good, though I like to watch them. "The Roaring Twenties" is one of them. It uses a simple language and the meaning is clear: never should the Americans enter a conflict which is not theirs, because if you do it, this is what will happen to the generation involved in it. The date of the film confirms this propaganda purpose: 1939. Still it is true that the days after the terror of the Great War were crazy days. Wild days. Today the film gives us a rough idea of what were the causes for the roaring twenties and of what it was like. What I enjoy best in this film is the ending. After you've seen this film you may not give it a second thought, but one image stays in your mind: Eddie's (James Cagney) fall. Through the years you may not even remember from where you saw that scene, you may not remember what was it all about, but the image remains. That is what cinema is all about: moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three World War I buddies return from the war, when two of them become bootleggers (JAMES CAGNEY, HUMPHREY BOGART). The third one, JEFFREY LYNN, is a clean-cut war buddy who becomes a lawyer.PRISCILLA LANE does a passable job as a singer in a clip joint and gets to handle some nice oldies with a certain flair--but let's face it, she has those "American as apple pie looks" and appears out of her element in seedy surroundings. GLADYS GEORGE, as a wise-cracking joint owner of the place, is right at home in a tailor-made role.Cagney and Bogart resort to crime during the course of their bootlegging activities, with Bogart getting especially rough with an old Army sergeant (JOE SAWYER) and showing no mercy when it comes to pulling off a crime caper with his handy gun.Bogart gets uneasy with his pal, Cagney, and is soon planning a way to double-cross him. Priscilla Lane has fallen in love at first sight with lawyer Jeffrey Lynn. And Raoul Walsh keeps the tale spinning toward a violent climax, keeping all of the action fast-paced and giving the film a lot of colorful '20s atmosphere that gives it flavor and style.JEFFREY LYNN gives the only wooden performance and PRISCILLA LANE is a bit too bland to play a nightclub singer despite the golden oldies she sings in low-key style. But JAMES CAGNEY elevates the film with a really gutsy performance, especially good in his final scenes with GLADYS GEORGE, when both of them are down on the skids. Their chemistry is evident from the start.For Cagney fans, this is a must see Raoul Walsh film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While there were a lot of gangster films made by Warner Brothers in the 30s and very early 40s, this stands out as perhaps one of the very best. Part of this is due to the pairing of Cagney AND Bogart, as there is so much energy and excellent "thuggish" acting that it's hard to get bored watching it. About the only negative at all is that as Humphrey Bogart was not yet a breakout star, it's rather predictable what will happen in a showdown with Cagney. But despite this, watch the movie. It's got all the ingredients of a fine gangster flick--excellent acting, writing, a breezy pace and the Warner Brother's trademark of both quality and action designed for the common man.</fullReview>

The actors and actresses did their parts very well, and the tough guys acted tough. Of particular interest to me was Gladys George, who radiated a sympathetic beauty, that no one could pass up. She deserved more parts in the movies. The story line was exciting and well mounted. James Cagney and Humphry Bogart, as usual, gave it their very best. It is a must-see movie that all Americans should experience, though it came out over sixty years ago. The Roaring Twenties will remain a classic of gangland adventure and romance as well.

		<fullReview>This film wasn't called "The Roaring Twenties" for nothing. Even though we have seen this plot a thousand times, it is still a great story about three army buddies who follow different paths once World War I is over. James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that they were two of the best actors during the 30's and 40's. I really loved it at the end when Bogie's character of George shows that he was nothing but a coward as Cagney's Eddie was pointing the gun at him as he was about to kill him. The love triangle was okay, but I only saw it as a way of making it softer to attract the female audience. However, this is still a great film that still stands up today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roaring Talent!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The talent in this movie is extremely amazing... Humphrey Bogart is in this film, as well as James Cagney, and a host of others!! I like nostalgia, however, for me, this really is not nostalgia!! The prohibition and paper prosperity era of the 1920's was something which took place in America long before I was even born.. The good old days remind me of baseball games, immigration, ice cream parlors, and many other homespun occurrences which brought on delightfully simple pleasures.. All of these aspects of the old days are merely fondly familiar artifacts which are indicative of a yesteryear with a 20/20 vision!! Often times, we overlook the fact that our nation's overall innocence became a tailor made invitation for gangsters to engage in an egregious chicanery!! Naive Americans fell prey to the felonious antics of nefarious scoundrels!! (The James Cagney &amp; Humphrey Bogart type) The true love cliché was the motivating factor behind everything with regards to the plot for this movie!! The depression became a permanent thorn in the side for the vast majority of Americans, as a result, movies such as "The Roaring Twenties" served as an escapism with a little charisma!! James Cagney has always been synonymous with the 1930's, and the gangster era!! Perenially, James Cagney was associated with being the tough Irish guy who did not just invite trouble into his life, he down and out right solicited it!! Priscilla Lane was believable in the film "The Roaring Twenties", her character enhanced the plot significantly!! Life and death situations were an ephemeral habit in the life of James Cagney's character, and, the boom to bust metamorphosis to this film garnered a dubious familiarity with the movie audience.. This film was definitely entertaining, and James Cagney is classic in this movie!! James Cagney is not just good at playing a gangster, he also knows how to dance too!! I have never seen anyone else dance on the wall before!! "Yankee Doodle Dandy" was a classic film, as were a lot of the gangster movies James Cagney was cast for!! "The Roaring Twenties" is without a doubt one of the most likable Cagney gangster films that falls into the category of Cagney classics!! Humphrey Bogart is terrific as the mob boss, it is just an empirical fact that Humphrey Bogart is an excellent actor!! THUMBS UP!! THAT IS MY VOTE FOR THIS FILM!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I'm lookin' for some excitement, there's a lull in the joint."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart made three films together, each with Cagney receiving top billing. This was the middle film, following 1938's "Angels With Dirty Faces", and just before the same year 1939's "Oklahoma Kid". The movie opens with shellfire over a World War I foxhole, the boys joined by Jeffrey Lynn's character Lloyd Hart. It's April 1918, and post war plans and the news of the coming Prohibition are topics of conversation amid enemy fire.The film does a nice job of tracing the background of Prohibition, making much of the changes that occurred in the country and how difficult it was for returning servicemen to find jobs. Those who turned to bootlegging became part of a vast "criminal army", although in some quarters, the bootlegger was looked upon as a modern crusader and hero. By 1924, booze is big business, and by that time, wartime buddies Eddie Bartlett (Cagney) and George Hally (Bogart) have hooked up - Eddie makes and peddles it, George can get more in a big way. After they hijack a warehouse load, they're in deep and tempers begin to fray, as George resents taking a back seat to Eddie's control.Adding to the tension is an unrequited crush Eddie has on Jean Sherman (Priscilla Lane), first introduced as Eddie's wartime correspondent who views him as her "hero". But as the story progresses, Jean falls in love with Lloyd Hart, the final member of the opening scene foxhole trio who has become Eddie's business lawyer."The Roaring Twenties" doesn't have the intensity of some of Cagney's other gangster films, like "White Heat" or "Public Enemy", but that shouldn't be considered less of a recommendation. The principals are all in top form, including Gladys George as Panama Smith, and the always entertaining Frank McHugh as Bartlett's hometown pal and partner Danny Green. The movie ends on a fitting note; Eddie's fortunes parallel the 1929 stock market crash - he falls off a cliff and keeps falling, until his final confrontation with George ends tragically for both. Panama utters the movie's final line putting Eddie's career into perspective - "He used to be a big shot".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only bought this because it was part of a four DVD boxed set with three Cagney gangster films I wanted in my collection... I'm glad it was included though as it is a great film. Unlike the better known "The Public Enemy" and "White Heat" Cagney doesn't play somebody who is bad from start to finish, instead he is drawn into crime almost accidentally, although once there he enjoys the wealth it brings.The film opens during the First World War with three US soldiers in a crater. After the war they each return home; Lloyd becomes a lawyer, George returns to his saloon and Eddie Bartlett returns to the garage he used to work in only to find that his job has been taken and there is no other work there for him. Somewhat disheartened he goes out of city to meet Jean Sherman, the beautiful woman who had been writing to him while he was fighting in France, only when he gets there he finds that she is a school girl, she wants to keep in touch but he things she is too young.Back in New York Eddie gets a job driving a cab but that goes wrong when a customer asks him to drop off a package at a local club which leads to him getting arrested for breaking the prohibition laws. He protected the woman he was making the delivery so she paid his fine and offered him a job in a more lucrative trade. At first he is just delivering booze but soon realises he can make more money if he makes his own to sell. When going out to collect a late payment he sees Jean again now she is a few years older she is beautiful and Eddie quickly falls for her and arranges for her to work at the club he supplies. Trying to expend his business he approaches a big time racketeer but is refused, not taking no for an answer he hijacks a shipment of booze and is surprised to find his old war buddy George captaining the ship. Soon George is double-crossing his old boss and working for Eddie. Business may be on the up but Jean isn't interested in Eddie, she has fallen for the third of the friends; lawyer Lloyd.The stock market crash and the end of prohibition leaves Eddie without money and all he has left is one taxi cab. After a chance meeting with Jean he finds himself having to confront his old friend George in order to protect Lloyd.The cast is all good, especially James Cagney as Eddie and Humphrey Bogart as the less than pleasant George. The leading ladies, Priscilla Lane as Jean and Gladys George as club owner Panama Smith were also top quality. While there was less action than some other gangster films the story was still interesting, it was also nice to see a leading character who wasn't really a bad person.</fullReview>

Whatever it is your favourite genre in "RT" there's stuff for all of you. Besides, there you are Cagney and Humphrey Bogart, trying' to figure out who is the toughest guy.Along with "Scarface" or "Angels with dirty faces" this is one of the most representative films of gangster cinema...

This movie was made in 1939, which is considered the year that made the most classic movies. Also, this is the best movie featuring James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart. They made a great team. Cagney was water and Bogart was oil. Another great team was Cagney with Gladys George. Too bad they never worked again. Gladys George played a saloon singer. This was her best role. Cagney's other leading lady was Priscilla Lane. Ms. Lane played the girl next door who dumps Cagney and falls for Jeffrey Lynn. Ms. Lane and Mr. Lynn starred in a few movies together in the 1930's. This is their best movie. The supporting cast is superb and the movie moves. It is never dull. Thanks to the director, Raoul Walsh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Roaring Twenties was the third and last film that James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart worked on together. As usual Cagney was the good bad guy and Bogey the bad bad guy. They went out in style with this one. Shortly afterwards Bogey finally got his own A star status with The Maltese Falcon.Cagney, Bogart, and Jeffrey Lynn are three doughboys from World War I who meet just before the Armistice is signed. The plot then focuses on Cagney and his inability to adjust to civilian life. But then Prohibition comes, voted right into the U.S. Constitution, and Cagney sees his opportunities and takes them.In fact all three of them get into the rackets of selling illegal alcoholic spirits and they meet up again later. There stories, individual and combined, are set against the background of the historical events of the 1920s in a nice documentary style with narration by John Deering. There are two prominent female players in the cast also. Priscilla Lane beloved by both Cagney and Lynn and Gladys George who is supposed to be that famous nightclub hostess Texas Guinan with a different name who carries a big old torch for Cagney. Both do a fine job, especially Gladys George the quintessential good time gal with a heart of gold.Writer and critic Mark Hellinger wrote the script and Hellinger in his day was quite the boozer. He knew the bootleg and nightclub scene in New York inside out. Gladys George's character is Texas Guinan, the others are composites of people he knew and dealt with.Raoul Walsh one of the best action directors ever keeps things going at a crisp pace. In a James Cagney movie there ain't no other kind of pace.At the beginning there's some narration saying that in the future people might not believe this era could ever happen. The film was made in 1939 and Prohibition was repealed by another Constitutional Amendment. Now 85 years after it took affect in 1920 The Roaring Twenties has an almost unbelievable quality to it. I'm not sure young people watching it today take it for reality.But believe me, we were that stupid in America. The prime movers behind Prohibition were the Protestant fundamentalists who got the U.S. Constitution changed to fit their particular views. And the Roaring Twenties is an expose of the stupidity that followed. The film is great and should serve as a warning against future meddling with the our Constitution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE ROARING TWENTIES certainly not a classic gangster movie of the thirties of the last century. This fact can be confirmed by the title of the film and the dose of nostalgia that is present in the story. All dramatic changes are presented from the perspective of several protagonists. The story is the rise and fall of organized crime. Changes to the system of values and standards of living of certain groups of society.It was recorded at the end of the decade, when many movie-watchers have already begun to fade memories of the world disappeared with the collapse of the New York Stock Exchange and which is a representation of a carefree, flamboyant life that many of them were enjoying looked fantastic.The Roaring Twenties are not fascinating movie, but the movie is important from a cultural, economic and political context. Acting is not bad. Some actors, like Cagney, were very good. It is interesting to watch Bogart in the role of villain. Gladys Gorge excellently did her and her character is a kind of indication of how the changes affect the system on women in the criminal underworld. Lane and Lynn are the characters of the new system. They are positive and very boring.Deserves a special combination of fiction and documentary footage which the narrator comments on the most important historical events - actions that would later become standard in many similar movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Roaring Twenties is an entertaining prohibition era tale.Three young men meet in the trenches during World War 1. Their paths cross again in the stifling prohibition era and they gang up to become the biggest bootleggers in business.There are catchy one liners nearly every minute. The film is up to its neck in one liners. The actors hardly ever pause for a breath.The acting was a bit phony. Cagney was too cake faced. He used so much make up in this film. His face after his downfall with the black grease on it was a joke. Bogart's role was ill etched. I found it pretty hard to take Bogie as a sneaky psychopath. The sweet Priscilla Lane character makes you ill.But it is an entertaining movie nonetheless. I guess it is a warning against prohibition. It is hilarious that the whole place became gentrified at the end of the film when they removed prohibition, literally crippling the bootleggers overnight.This film does offer the prototype for a gangster movie. Friends who are in an illegal business together, clash of principles, love triangles etc. This film has it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling bootlegging drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, as I was watching this I kept being reminded of BOARDWALK EMPIRE, what with the characters involved in action in the First World War and then returning home to set up a bootlegging outfit during the Prohibition; I'm sure Nucky Thompson even gets a mention at one point. After the set-up, this turns into the James Cagney show once more, with the PUBLIC ENEMY actor putting in a compelling performance as a master criminal whose live revolves around him attempting to juggle romance, business, and his rivals.THE ROARING TWENTIES benefits from an assured supporting role from a youthful Humphrey Bogart and some wonderfully staged scenes, particularly at the impressive climax which must have been akin to watching the climax of De Palma's SCARFACE for audiences of the day. Cagney's performance carefully brings all the quirks and flaws out of his character, and without him this wouldn't have been half as good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Cagney steals the film as Eddie who fought and survived World War I. He returns home to New York City. He gets involved with the bootleggers during prohibition in the roaring twenties. The film shows the rise and fall of a man like Eddie. Humphrey Bogart acts in the film as well. Priscilla Lane and Gladys George play the female love interest. Raoul Walsh directed this film. Even though it was shot in a Hollywood sound stage, the film has a very urban feel to it. James Cagney was terrific as Eddie. He was really a brilliant actor who could break your heart or steal it. He brings depth and dimension to Eddie's character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Cagney gangster movie with Bogie supporting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lloyd Hart (Jeffrey Lynn), Eddie Bartlett (James Cagney) and George Hally (Humphrey Bogart) are war buddies after falling into the same bomb crater. After the end of WWI, Lloyd goes back to practicing law. It's the start of prohibition. Eddie is out of luck without a job and Danny Green offers him his cab. He goes to see his pen pal Jean Sherman (Priscilla Lane) but she turns out to be a school girl. He gets thrown in jail after being tricked into delivering a bottle. Panama Smith (Gladys George) pays the fine to get him out of jail. Eddie soon joins Panama in the business. He becomes successful with a fleet of cabs. He keeps Lloyd as his reluctant lawyer. Then he runs into an older Jean. When he fights another bootlegger, he runs into George who's running liquor for the another guy. George convinces Eddie to join forces.The only problem for this movie is that Bogie doesn't come back until after an hour. So a warning to his fans, this is more a Cagney film. I would have preferred they stay together through the whole movie. That would make any double cross more compelling and any fights more heart breaking. There is singing, and there is gangster violence. It's a nice gangster movie with a couple of big gangster stars.</fullReview>

This film has gained some devotees, showing at museums and revival houses over the past two decades. now it's considered one the best of the Warner's cycle. with the backstage musical Footlight Parade and turn in the masterwork the Public Enemy, this is Cagney at his best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three men (James Cagney, Humphrey Bogart, Jeffrey Lynn) who fought alongside each other in World War I try to make a go of it in 1920s America. Cagney tries to go straight but is pushed into a life of crime as a bootlegger. Bogart doesn't even try! He's rotten and he loves it. Lynn becomes a lawyer but soon finds himself pulled into the business by pal Cagney, while also falling for the girl Cagney's in love with (Priscilla Lane).James Cagney gives one of his finest performances of the '30s. Bogart is a deliciously evil villain. Every scene he's in, he's great. Lane and Lynn are fine but I found myself disliking their characters by the end. But that's probably more to do with my sympathies lying with Cagney. Gladys George is terrific as Panama Smith, a nightclub hostess who holds a torch for Cagney. A first-rate gangster picture like only Warner Bros. could do. Great direction by Raoul Walsh. If you're a fan of any of the stars involved or just a fans of WB gangster pictures in general, you just have to see this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Standard '30s gangster plot buoyed by some special performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to go too much into detail on the plot of the Roaring Twenties - it's pretty standard "gangster rises to the top" fare. The things that made this movie special to me were the performances, two in particular.The most prominent character in the film is Cagney, a streetwise cabbie who's lost his job - and really his place in the world - following World War I. He gets into the bootlegging business more or less by mistake, but then stays in it and determines to make a success of it. It's typical strong Cagney gangster fare.The first of the special performances to me was Humphrey Bogart's. This is a younger Bogart, not yet the gangster with a heart seen in High Sierra or the world-weary Bogie seen in Casablanca and many subsequent films. No, this younger Bogart is cunning, but is mostly a fearsome gun-toter seething with contempt for the world. I imagine he didn't have to go far to find inspiration. Warner Brothers didn't consider him a leading man at this time and had him in a string of mostly low-budget films, including an awful Western musical flick called Swing Your Lady the year before. Adding that he was in a reputedly wildly tempestuous marriage with Mayo Methot at the time, he had a deep well to draw from for the contempt and fire this role called for.The second special performance, and my favorite, is that of Gladys George as Panama. Panama is as tough and smart as any male club owner, a streetwise pitchwoman who doesn't flinch when the bullets fly. On the other hand, she's got a tender heart and a torch that quietly burns for Cagney despite his shortcomings and infatuations with other women. It is one of my favorite female roles of the '30s - it seemed that kind of nuance was generally reserved for the male lead. She has some real powerhouse moments in this film.So, a 9/10 for me - standard '30s gangster plot buoyed by some special performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh, the prohibition era. That time in the United States history when lawmakers were certain that banning the manufacture, transportation and sale of alcohol would improve the country and its degenerated society. However, as The Roaring Twenties shows us, it only worsened the whole situation in many disastrous ways. Eddie, George and Lloyd met during World War I, while they were battling in France. They fought together day by day, until the precious armistice finally let them go back home. They wanted to follow their dreams, but the harsh reality soon struck with a powerful wave of sudden changes and inevitable unemployment issues. The boys had to catch every job opportunity that come knocking on their doors just to make ends meet. Lloyd was in a good position, because he finished law school before the War. George went strictly into the corrupted and illegal sphere of labor. As for Eddie, he tried to work legitimately, but lack of proper perspectives wanted him some place different.After prohibition was enforced in the fall of 1919 people had to find new ways to get booze. This situation created a great chance for Eddie to begin his dodgy business. He started to climb the steps on the ladder of bootlegging, till he became one of the most prominent sources of alcohol in all of New York. This was his time to shine. Everything would've been perfect if it wasn't for the brutal rivalry and envy between him and the two of his War-time friends and racket partners. And if it wasn't for the girl, the young and beautiful Jean, who stood in the way of their union. The movie is brilliantly portrayed in three consecutive parts. The first one sees the boys in France fighting for their country. There they share their dreams and hopes for the future. The second, and the most brutal, part begins at the moment of their return to the USA. The only way to survive is to go into the world of risky businesses and organized crime. The third one opens the final chapter of the story, right after the prohibition law is abolished. This surprising and sudden change drastically leaves Eddie in prison, while George is still running his gang, and Lloyd leads a peaceful life with Jean and their son.As for actors of this genuine crime thriller: James Cagney was already a movie star when the movie premiered and he upheld his position as one; Humphrey Bogart's career certainly got a huge jump-start after his fairly short supporting performance earned many rave reviews; Priscilla Lane played well, but for me Gladys George is the leading, strong female of this picture. She played this sometimes jealous, but deeply sensitive and always helpful, woman - the one that a man can rely on.So, as you might see, the 20's were certainly roaring. Roaring with the rattle of smuggled bottles of alcohol and fired gun shots. Finally, I would like to say that the scene, which really sums up the paradoxical fatality of the prohibition era is the one, where the narrator states that people were basically drinking everywhere (meaning: on the streets, at home, while driving a car) to satisfy their needs. Because, as the history often taught us, nothing tastes as good as a forbidden fruit. The temptation that comes with it may only ruin the society's supposed righteousness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This might be the biggest WB gangster production of the 30's, and have Cagney and Bogart in it, but it is one corny and dated movie with cardboard characters and an inept script. The WWI scenes are ludicrous. After the first hour mark it gets better but not enough. Cagney when annoyed punches people while Bogart draws his gun. This style of filming might have worked in the early 30's but by 1939 seemed outdated, even though I can understand this film marks the end of an era and should be seen with sympathetic and nostalgic eyes. Lane does not belong here, and I couldn't wait for her to leave, which she doesn't since I later find out she is an integral part of the story. Why she is such an attraction as a singer is beyond me, and we get at least 2 musical numbers from her. The shootout at the Italian restaurant is also ridiculous: Cagney and his people go in looking for the foe, wide open, no strategy. This movie however did something for me: after watching the dining scene I went to the kitchen and made me a big plate of spaghetti with extra cheese.</fullReview>

This movie was made just beforethe second world war when Germany was having Nazi beer busts. With Cagney's character we don't see how he ended up broke and Bogart's ended up rich. We just see Cagney get busted as prohibition ends. This was an interesting movie if only for it's tough take on the people of that era.

		<fullReview>THE ROARING TWENTIES is one of the classic gangster films. Although it's a bit slow for the first 15 minutes or so, it picks up a lot once Cagney delivers booze to a speak easy. The beginning sets up the characters personalities so it's important for that, but Walsh stags it a bit too leisurely IMO. Still it is a great crime genre film and holds up better than earlier films such as SCARFACE and LITTLE CAESAR. James Cagney is excellent and Gladys George does a fine job as Panama the woman who loves him no matter what.

		<shortDescription>Classic gangster flick hits all the right notes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The twenties were a very important decade for the United States of America as it was the decade when many of the most important events in the country's history took place. I'm not a big fan of American history, but this particular period is interesting, and The Roaring Twenties; at heart a swansong to the decade and the tradition of gangster flicks is definitely one of the better films set in the twenties. The star and director team behind 1949's masterpiece "White Heat" team up here for the first time and both show the flair that would go on to make White Heat what it is. Cagney's strong persona is expertly captured by Walsh's camera, and even during the film's less interesting moments; this is enough to keep it afloat. The story ties in all the classic gangster film elements including love, business, gunfights, rivalry and the male ego. The plot follows three WWI veterans; one of which becomes a lawyer, another a bootlegger and Cagney runs a Taxi firm. The latter finds a lucrative business, which involves him brewing and selling alcohol, which was illegal at the time under the prohibition act.James Cagney is definitely the star of the film, but bubbling just beneath him is an excellent Humphrey Bogart. Cagney's Angels With Dirty Faces co-star turns in another excellent support turn here, which just hints at the acclaim he would go on to achieve. It's always interesting to see an actor before they really hit the big time, and Bogart's performance is one of the main attractions here. One of the things I loved about the way that the story is executed are the news style bulletins that pop up every now and again to inform the audience of the wider plot developments. These give the film a very retro sort of feel, which also help it in it's bid to remind viewers of the era (at the time of release) that had just gone by. In many ways, this film was ahead of it's time and this is shown by the fact that many modern films, most notably Goodfellas, work from the same plot structure and many of the same ideas. In short, almost every aspect of the film works and the end result is a gangster flick that hasn't been treat badly by the test of time. At times, the plot dwindles a bit and there's a few too many singing scenes; but on the whole, if you like gangster flicks and classic films, you'll like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a disappointment. After a terrific opening 15 minutes or so, this film went downhill fast. However, it is one of the better examples of documentary commentary and footage used in a film to help set the stage/background and tell the story. The documentary portions were very good, purposeful and effective (if slightly hysterical in their well-meaningness). For this, the film cannot be faulted, and this is definitely its strong point.If only the rest of the movie lived up to this aspect, The Roaring Twenties would be a great film. Instead, it is riddled with problems.As a whole, the film was slow and drawn out, and could have used lots of cutting, especially the musical sequences and shootouts.There was too much heavy-handed obviousness in portraying Panama Smith's (Gladys George) love for Eddie Bartlett (James Cagney), even to the point of repeating closeup shots of their hand-holding (then cut to a sad George, with a wistful look on her face) three times within a matter of 20 minutes! We get it, already!!!!I wished that Jeffrey Lynn and Humphrey Bogart had had more screen time. Bogie was in the first 10 minutes, then disappeared until much later in the film. He should have returned somewhat earlier, even for just a moment or two, as I'm sure I was not the only viewer distracted by wondering when Bogie would return to the story. Subsequently, I could not enjoy this part of the film, as I sat there waiting for him to show up again.Frank McHugh's character was much more annoying than amusing this time around, and was mostly superfluous to the action.Both the speakeasy customers and the guys who ran the bootleg liquor operations were too low-key. While the great documentary footage illustrated the industry rather excitingly, the on-screen portrayals of the set-up looked downright boring. I've seen better nightclub brawls in Doris Day films, never mind any others with Cagney or Bogart!Many reviewers seemed to idolize the film's ending. What was so spectacular there? Sure, it was ironic, but it wasn't particularly great by any means. In fact, the ending was copied in 1942's Johnny Eager, with Robert Taylor in the Cagney role and Van Heflin (!) in the Gladys George role. This same ending was much more effective in that film than it is here. And poor Jimmy Cagney didn't even get any `famous last words' to speak in this one. What a rip-off!Bogart's George Hally character was more interesting than Cagney's Eddie Bartlett, yet Cagney's character monopolizes much of the story.Now that I've gotten all that off my chest, I will say that the acting was very good all around, and there are some enjoyable moments to be found (too bad they are few and far between). CAST/PERFORMANCES: Humphrey Bogart did well with is relatively small bad-guy role. I loved his early scenes taking place during the war ? George Hally was obviously a guy with a bone to pick, and a real live wire, and who better to play him than Bogie? James Cagney was good as always, yet I found his Eddie Bartlett character to be a bit annoying. Still his scenes with the ladies were good, especially his drunk scene (with Gladys George) late in the film. He was excellent at playing drunk, especially by the way he held and or moved his head, as though trying extra hard to focus, just like when one is really intoxicated. Excellent! I read in a Cagney biography that he improvised the `Well, is it OK if I honk my horn as I drive by?' line when asking Jean out for a date after many rejections. What a guy!Priscilla Lane was great as Cagney's love interest, Jean Sherman. The juxtaposition between the sultry, adult photo she sent to Cagney in the mail versus her true fresh-faced schoolgirl image was very amusing. (She confesses, `that photo was from a school play.') While only 22 at the time of making this film, Lane gave a strong, versatile performance. See her also in the 4 Daughters series of films with her sisters Lola and Rosemary Lane, plus Claude Rains and Gale Page. You will not be disappointed.Gladys George (Panama Smith) ? A well-written and performed role, George was extremely convincing as the underground hard-nosed yet quite vulnerable Ms. Smith. She played all of her scenes with much heart and realism, and I now would like to track down some more of her work.</fullReview>

Lynn is a lawyer, Cagney a bootlegger, and Bogie plays a gangster. Thru their ups and downs we see the history of the 20s up to the stock market crash. Priscilla Lane has a good role here as the nice girl, but Gladys George is a standout as Panama Smith, the Texas Guinan-like dame who runs a "speak" and ends up on the skids with Cagney. Nicely done film with real sparks flying between Cagney and Bogart. Two of the era's most electric stars work well in this underrated movie. Elisabeth Risdon, Frank McHugh, John Hamilton, Vera Lewis, Paul Kelly, and Joe Sawyer are all familiar faces. Gladys George should have won an Oscar nomination for this one.</fullReview>

Priscilla Lane is perfectly cast as Eddie's teasing Femme Fatale Jean, while Humphrey Bogart is not much more than a window dressing piece of furniture only to be used by Jean to flatten her no longer convenient love triangle. Bogart's big moment comes less than five minutes into this ROARING TWENTIES tale, when he gleefully guns down a German teenager three seconds before an Armistice ends WWI. Like many "Great War" heroes, Sgt. Bartlett is all but forced at gunpoint by the U.S. government into a life of crime. As I heard a couple weeks ago on the Coast-to-Coast overnight news program, American President Hoover had future U.S. WWII generals Eisenhower, Patton, and MacArthur expend this country's leftover supply of poison gas to liquidate thousands of WWI vets (plus their wives and kids) when they came to Washington, DC, to lobby for restoration of their pension "guarantees" which Hoover had embezzled.

		<shortDescription>A Crime Epic ahead of its time ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To understand why the gangster genre is the most emblematic of the 30's, all you have to do is watching "The Roaring Twenties", Raoul Walsh' gangster flick, the first deserving of the epithet 'epic' as it spans almost fifty years, focusing on the highs and lows of Eddie Bartlet, a character that crystallizes all the gangsters' facets with a novelty lying in his three-dimensionality."The Roaring Twenties" was released in 1939, the year that opened the glorious Golden Age of Hollywood (Fleming, Capra, Disney...) and pulled the curtain on the gangster genre. The film is an occasion to explore the myth of the gangster, a figure that deserved a eulogy after having affected American pop-culture, enriching it, with such new icons: Capone, Edward. G. Robinson and vocabulary : bootlegging, speakeasy etc. The film is like the ancestor of Martin Scorsese's "Goodfellas" where we follow the immersion of a man in the criminal world, paralleled with the evolution of the country during a roaring decade.Like the 60's, the 20's had the flashiness, the flamboyance and the gripping documentary-like realism of Scorsese's classic, another thing that makes it so modern.Naturally, only Cagney could have pulled such a magnificent performance, capable of being believable and inspiring your empathy, even by belonging to the wrong side of the law. Contrarly to previous flicks, in "The Roaring Twenties",the man isn't a criminal yet when we meet him in this foxhole with Hally and Hart, respectively played by Humphrey Bogart and Jeffrey Lynn. Cagney is Eddie Bartlet, a garage worker, and whose heroic status as a World War I vet doesn't prevent him from unemployment, he put his life at stakes to find his job taken. From disillusions to disenchantment, he turns into a cab driver whose naivety leads to be arrested with a bottle during the prohibition. He's pulled in the business by an aging manager, Panama Smith, who'd teach him the ropes of business. Gladys George is perfect to an Oscar-worthy level as the only woman who understands Eddie, in a performance that could belong to a movie made today.The admirable modernity of "The Roaring Twenties" isn't just on the acting or storytelling department, it also relies on a fascination paradox as the film is very close to gangster classics yet distant in the same time. Even the Hayes Codes seems to have lost its influence on film-makers, the gangster isn't born a hoodlum, he's not a sociopath, nor an ambitious emigrant. Bartlet is everything but the seminal gangster, he's just a man who didn't get the respect the country owed him. He embodies the contradiction of a Michael Corleone who came as a hero, only to get punched by a corrupt cop while he was protecting his father. Bartlet is obviously a good guy corrupted by the evolution of the society that elevated the gangster to the rank of 'big shot', and "The Roaring Twenties" is the first gangster film to point an accusing finger on society and depict the gangster as a victim of circumstances, as a man who chose to live the American Dream his way, because there was no other alternative.Loaded with this thought provoking honesty, the film focuses on the prohibition period but allows us to go much further and approach the economical consequences of the abolition, and the way the economical crash made everything collapse. "Bonnie and Clyde" would be more explicit but "The Roaring Twenties" doesn't overlook the new type of criminality, more dangerous because unseen, that caused even more troubles than lousy bootlegger, who at least, made people happy. Troubles that would finally end with the War, when America would enlist. The merit of "The Roraring Twenties" is to make a sort of eulogy to the gangster figure who encapsulates all the evolution of American society: an average nobody, who wanted to be a big shot, succeeded for a time and lost everything."The Roaring Twenties" is an exhilarating slice of American life, depicted with an accurate and entertaining style. All the archetypes of the genre are featured, the blonde sensual girl, the night-club, the shoot-outs, the corrupt cops, the chases, the machine guns, the fist fights, revenge ? and an interesting trio representing each possible evolution : a honest and decent man, an unrepentant killer, and in-between, the kind of gangster we 'like' as a character. Prsicilla Lane who looks like a 30's version of Hayden Pannetiere is the little doll who conquers Bartlet's heart and naturally, as if he had to make up for his sins, not only he would let her to his friend but he'd have to prevent Hally from killing the lawyer who 'knows too much'. "The Roaring Twenties" has a touching way to demonstrate that Crime doesn't pay, and not just in terms of money, yet it always has an option for redeeming oneself. A criminal is still a criminal, and since "Angels with Dirty Faces", the redemption is a necessary step of the gangster's arc.But in a way, it's the whole gangster figure and genre, harassed by an unfair Code, that is redeemed. And the last sacrifice, with the same religious resonance than "Angels with Dirty Faces" is absolutely mind-blowing and concludes with an operatic pessimism the journey of the gangster during the 30's, a figure that owned a decade but didn't belong to the new order. Gangsters can either be jailed, killed, or crawl like rats, Cagney, like the greatest antiheroes, like Pechnipah's characters chose to die in a blaze of glory."The Roaring Twenties" is probably one of the least seen gangster classics but it's certainly one of the most insightful, the most modern, and the more I think about it, one of the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lite Heat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After making this gangster flic in 1939 Jimmy Cagney stayed away from the genre throughout the war and immediate post-war years before returning ten years later as Cody Jarret in White Heat. This means that if one were to erase the Strawberry Blondes, Bride Came C.O.D. etc from his cv he'd have two excellent gangster movies back to back. Although he gets top billing he has a great back-up trio in the shape of Bogie and the two diametrically opposed women in his life, Gladys George and Priscilla Lane. Lane, one of the Four Daughters who captivated John Garfield the previous year comes off worse but to be fair she has little to do except sing pleasantly, look wholesome and more or less turn in a prototype Doris Day (who would, of course, achieve stardom at Warners) whilst Gladys George, who would play opposite Bogie again in The Maltese Falcon, turns in a beautifully understated performance as the not-really-that-bad girl who clearly worships Cagney's Eddie Bartlett from afar. Warners were still clinging on to their semi-documentary stories-ripped-from-the-headlines schtick that had proved so profitable so we are treated to a portentous voice-over pitched in suitably dramatic tones that traces key events of the first half of the twentieth century from world war one through prohibition the Stock Market crash etc, a slightly cruder technique than the more polished version perfected by Noel Coward in plays like Cavalcade and This Happy Breed. Not a masterpiece but neither is it chopped liver.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mark Hellinger and Jerry Wald wrote the script for this one, and Raoul Walsh directed. As was so often the case with Walsh, the story matters less than the telling. It's a hackneyed plot about three World War I buddies who return to the States and take what in today's parlance we would call widely divergent career paths. One becomes an upstanding lawyer, the other a bootlegger, the third a cabdriver who falls in with the bootlegger, though he's really not the criminal type. There's the usual good girl (from Mineola) and "bad" girl, a saloon singer who goes by the name of Panama. They had names then! I've known people with some strange names, but I've never known a Panama.As the cabbie, James Cagney is his usual ball of fire. Jeffrey Lynn is like a piece of wood, petrified wood, as the lawyer. Humphrey Bogart's the bootlegger. This is very much Cagney's picture, and Bogart seems none too happy about it. Walsh keeps the action moving, and the montages are wonderfully corny (though not laughable). The movie's approach to the twenties, just a decade past at the time it was made, is to make everything and everyone seem larger than life. There's a romanticizing of everything, from speakeasies to the Charleston, that makes the period come to life with a kind of aching, nostalgic familiarity, as it were a part of all our collective memories, even those of us born much later. Thanks to this movie, it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Roaring Twenties" may be the best gangster movie you never saw. James Cagney is perfect as a good man who's slowly corrupted by the power of the speakeasy racket, then takes a pathetic fall from grace when Prohibition ends and his unrequited love falls for his best friend.Bogart plays his cold-blooded, snarling business partner whose true colors finally show when he's on the receiving end of violence.Love the newsreel-style segues that sometimes link the leaps in time periods and the ending is beautifully shot. It may seem strange to compare this with a 30s gangster film, but Eddie's downfall almost seems Shakespearean in the true tragic hero tradition. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good cast; great ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't enjoy this film as much as Cagney's first big gangster film, The Public Enemy, but it wasn't bad, and what an ending. The Roaring Twenties is a somewhat dull film saved by a good cast. Rather than being an action-packed gangster film, it's unusually psychological. The Bogart and Lynn characters never really change from beginning to end, while Cagney's character goes from good to bad to pitiful. His seemingly true love for Priscilla Lane's Jean is perhaps the most compelling part of the story. Then there's Gladys George as Panama, apparently in love with him. Underneath the gangster film lies a dual story of unrequited love. This is focused on in the last half hour or so of the film, and combined with the famous final scene, the end of the movie is the best part.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blondell's's haircut alone is worth the price of purchase. Cagney is never more alive...playful...bold...captivating...a ball of energy just waiting to explode. It's got everything you need for a night of enjoyment: a multi-story lined plot that moves at an incredible speed...lots of info that never feels like exposition. Dialogue, glorious, snappy verbiage perfectly delivered. Pefectly cast. Perfectly perfect. No silly catch phrases that worm their way into our culture. Gritty, clean with all the comfort of black and white can deliver. I remember the first time I watched it, inches from the screen, frantic wI'd miss something when i had to adjusted the rabbit ears. Gorgeous, luminous and dark to look at. I tip my hat more and more to the Warner's studio. Don't rent it, own it...watch it...over and over again and enjoy it more each time. Almost 70 years old and still standing. Then go out and then do a little research into 1939...buy a few more and your jaw will continue to drop in amazement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very strange movie experience.Its a traditional gangster movie: good guy turns bad but is redeemed ? oh and he incidentally has a love that he's not good enough for.And it features both Cagney and Bogart when both of them were tired of playing gangsters and their manner is tired too. These guys have no pizazz, no life. That makes the next fact heavy: its designed as if it were a documentary both on the times and this fellow's life. It is partly newsreel in fact, with that common voice-over style that even by then had become so distinct.One thing that's unsettling is that there's supposed to be a distinct separation between the time of the movie and the time of the story in the movie. We're supposed to be looking back, from a time of angst to a time of sensual freedom. The problem is that its about 70 years from the time of this, and we miss the jokes, the distance between these two. It was supposed to be a play where the nature of the play-acting was obvious. Its gone now.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say, this is one of the best films of gangsters in the 30's I've ever seen. Sometimes stupid script doesn't hide the terrific performances by James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart. Both play WWI guys who after the war, there lives become different. Cagney becomes a big-shot gangster after becoming a lame taxi driver, only to find himself back again where he started. And Bogart plays a villain in a great form (and before Casablanca no less) who is now against Cagney. Sometimes memorable, but mainly used by performances and a ending that would have inspired Martin Scorsese (and probably did). A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Raoul Walsh directs this often slow paced gangster flick. Three army buddies find their lives and relationship changing dramatically following the second World War. James Cagney is a cabbie that is corrupted by Prohibition and becomes a typical "big shot". Humphrey Bogart is the owner of a saloon/speakeasy and becomes a major bootlegger. Jeffrey Lynn returns to civilian life and becomes a lawyer and eventually falls in love and marries Cagney's love interest Priscilla Lane. The great ending is the most memorable thing about this movie. A very strong cast also features: Gladys George, Frank McHugh and Joe Sawyer. Another M-G-M gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alright I guess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie wasn't as good as I had figured it'd be but then again I watched the colorized copy which was a recipe for disaster but I didn't have any other choice unfortunately. Humphrey Bogart was great in a familiar sleazy role but Cagney was too much of a pushover. Bring me the "White Heat" Cagney please! Not this 'oh I'm not going to kill you because I don't have any proof that it was you that tried to kill me' nonsense. The two leading ladies did a very good job though and were excellent singers. To tell you the truth all the acting was really good which was why it was hard for me to give this an only average rating. At least "Angels with Dirty Faces" gave Cagney's character a little bit of strength but this role was way too wimpy for him to be anywhere close to his best. It's a good movie but will definitely leave you wanting more in the end.Final Analysis:Movies : Maybe, only because classic movies rock on the big screen!DVD Purchase : No, once was enough and they still haven't made it in this format anyways.Rental : Yea, it can't hurt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bottom of the steps, ma!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart both dragged to the electric chair screaming? This cannot be true! It's not true, relax. Only Bogart is dragged to the electric chair in this, screaming and blubbering like a shocking yellowbelly! Cagney on the other hand, is mown down in a hail of bullets on top of a gas cylinder which explodes and sends him spiralling onto the steps of City Hall. "Made it, ma...Bottom of the steps!" as he rolls to the bottom step.Two gangsters meeting a justified end. This sequel to White Heat is not as good as Pubic Enemy, the prequel to this movie.Performances are generally very good but we've seen this sort of thing too many times. How many films have the hero exploding on a gas tower and being blown through the air to land on City Hall steps? Too many to mention. Mediocre fun at best.</fullReview>
