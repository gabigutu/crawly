		<shortDescription>We Are Your Friends has a great story, but it's not the direction the movie chose to follow.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was expecting to detest this movie, and I'm happy to say that I found some enjoyment in We Are Your Friends. I'm not too big on EDM; I love some of it, dislike most of it, but this movie actually painted the genre/scene in an interesting light. They add a human element to the otherwise processed and compressed music, and it's pretty captivating. At least those scenes are. Where the movie fails can be attributed to its title. We Are Your Friends shouldn't have been about friendship or having each others backs or whatever they were trying to go for because that is by far the weakest element of the movie. Zac Efron is great in the lead role, but his friends are complete throwaway characters. I didn't care about any of them. There is one scene near the end where the friend arc almost pays off, but even then it's not worth all the wasted minutes building up these characters when there's a far more interesting story that's going to waste.The story I'm referring to involves Wes Bentley's character James who is a washed up DJ that kind of fell from grace and is now living off royalty checks and he ends up being the person who teaches Cole (Efron) how to make electronic music effective. I really enjoyed Bentley in this role. In fact, the whole trifecta of Efron, Bentley, and Emily Ratajkowski is what made the movie watchable. Bentley being the mentor character who is fighting a lot of inner demons, Efron being the ambitious musician who is hungry for his big break, and Ratajkowski showing off her acting talent as the assistant/girlfriend to Bentley's character who ends up falling for Efron. Even though it sounds like a cliché love triangle, for some reason it works. There's tension between these characters - you care about the friendship between James and Cole, but you also recognize their faults and why Emily's character is torn in her position. They make for some pretty powerful scenes.But again, this potential is muddled underneath a bunch of Hollywood crap. There's a throwaway plot about the gang working for a real estate agency, there's an attempt at a moral to being true to yourself in order to make it big, there is just a bunch of predictable nonsense that clutters this film which is a shame. Believe me, I was not expecting to have any nice things to say about We Are Your Friends, but there is definitely something here. The fact is that the goodness in the movie is a diamond in the rough, and sadly, this diamond isn't worth all the rough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw the film this afternoon. Being A fan of the Genre and lifestyle its based around, I knew what to expect; a generic 'party' film with an interesting story line and enjoyable scenes.Unfortunately, it didn't deliver. I feel like the entire movie was going at 100mph, ensuring plot depth was minimal. I left the theater feeling empty, and as if the story didn't really impact upon me at all or make me think. Like I read in an earlier review, it was very superficial. At the end of the day, It's really just something you go see with a gal to kill some time. I had low standards for the film but yet it still managed to disappoint me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>EDM Music has become a crazy world of drugs, sex and bass drops. Being an avid fan of this genre well before it become a trendy thing to do, I have definitely been a bit disheartened by how kids treat the scene these days. Instead of the focus being on the music, its on being half naked, rolling on E and hooking up with anything with a pulse (that last part is probably optional). This movie shows all of that (of course) but the focus is on doing something MORE with your life. Its about moving people, being memorable and creating from the heart.I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. I smiled and laughed pretty much the entire time. It was quite funny, poking a bit at how ridiculous this "culture" has become but remained true to the spirit of the music. Zac Efron did a really good job at portraying a DJ who really IS all about creating music. All of his "friends" were accurately portrayed because we ALL have that douchey friend, that clueless friend and we know that guy that's just kinda there, hanging out. Wes Bentley was superb as the alcoholic has-been DJ (but come on, its Wes Bentley. He's superb at everything he does). The scenery was spot-on and exciting, taking you on multiple roller-coaster rides of cartoon drug trips, wild dance parties and of course, sexy time. And can I just say, as a women, how much I enjoyed gazing upon Emily Ratajkowski and her glorious boobs?! WHEW! You must take this movie for what it is. You should probably be a fan of EDM music (or at least music in general) to really enjoy this movie. The screening I was at was full of a much older crowd who seemed genuinely confused. "I thought this was a movie about friendship?" Well, it IS. In a crazy world of drugs, sex and bass drops.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not an amazing movie and won't win any awards but I actually liked this much more than I was expecting to.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Are we ever gonna be better than this?!" Cole (Efron) is a DJ trying to make it big, all he needs is "that one track". When he meets James (Bently) a DJ that is willing to mentor him he thinks he finally found what he wants. Cole soon finds out that trying meet the expectations of his friends, hiding his romantic feelings, and working on his music isn't as easy as he was hoping for. I was really not looking forward to this at all. I'm not a big Zac Efron fan, nor am I a fan of this type of house music. That being said, I actually liked this more than I expected to. The movie is a little generic and nothing all that special, but there was just something about it that kept me watching and entertained. Efron actually does a pretty good job of portraying what the character is thinking when he is not speaking and only working his board. This is not an amazing movie and won't win any awards but I actually liked this much more than I was expecting to. If you are into this type of sound you will probably like it much more than I did, if you aren't you still may enjoy this like I did. Overall, a surprise of a movie that I liked more than I expected to. I surprisingly give this a B.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If people suggested you go see "We Are Your Friends", those people are NOT your friends.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You've probably heard the admonition: "Don't peak in high school." Good advice. It's sad to see someone who you can tell was at their coolest and most accomplished in their teens. Take Zac Efron for example. I've come to wonder if, as an actor, he peaked in the "High School Musical" movies. Those productions were mainly inconsequential Disney fluff, but they were fun to watch. Efron has worked steadily ever since (which is more than we can say for most of the other stars from those films) and he has had varying degrees of success with his post-HSM roles (often simply as the brooding hunk). But this is the entertainment business: "What have you done for me lately?" He was miscast as a doctor in the otherwise criminally underrated "Parkland" (2013) and in 2014, he was just annoying in "Neighbors" and in "That Awkward Moment" (which lived up to its title ? more so, if it were renamed in its plural form). 2015 sees Efron continue to strive for cinematic relevance in the drama "We Are Your Friends" (R, 1:36).Contrary to the film's title, the story's mainly about an EDM (electronic dance music) DJ named Cole Carter (Zac Efron), his mentor, James (Wes Bentley), and a love triangle involving James' personal assistant ? slash ? live-in girlfriend, Sophie (Emily Ratajkowski). Sure, Cole has a group of friends, but they're mainly relegated to background roles. Cole lives in the pool house of his buddy Dustin (Jonny Weston) and they hang out with drug-dealing Ollie (Shiloh Fernandez) and quiet, unhappy squirrel (Alex Shaffer). These four San Fernando Valley California buds get together to enjoy "the world's greatest sushi", talk about their dreams and hopes for the future, and party ? a lot. In a half-hearted effort to make bank, all four of them go to work for a suspiciously rich real estate investor (Jon Bernthal), but that move feels to most of the guys more like a step backwards in pursuit of their goals.Throughout the movie, Cole spends a lot of time with his friends, but his pursuit of his dreams and his relationships with James and Sophie occupy the vast majority of the screen time. James is a rich and in-demand EMD DJ who takes Cole under his wing. James is an arrogant alcoholic, but he does give Cole some good advice ? and access to his impressive home studio so Cole can perfect his sound. (Cole's convinced that he just needs one great track to make it big.) Meanwhile, there's a growing sexual tension between Cole and Sophie, who's also unhappy with her life. When Cole and his friends take a trip to a big rave in Las Vegas, where James and Sophie are also headed, certain developments change the equation for some of them. Those characters then have to make decisions that'll change their lives.You know, you can often tell when a studio knows it has a stinker on its hands. The signs include giving it a title which isn't representative of the story, giving the movie little publicity and making drastic changes to the movie poster late in the game. These all apply to this film, as does the suspicious timing of the movie's release. Why release a youth-friendly made-for-summer movie at the very end of the summer (after many teens have already gone back to school) and in a weekend with very little competition in the way of other feature film releases? Put all that together and you have the movie "We Are Your Friends".This movie isn't horrible; it's just bad. The focus is unequally divided between the friends mentioned in the title and what the movie is really about. The four friends are lacking in direction, work ethic and, to some extent, morality and often don't treat each other as you'd expect they would. The performances are serviceable, but uninspired and Ratajkowski's presence in the film seems mainly for the purpose of giving us something pretty to look at. (We see "more" of her than at any point since her role in the uncensored version of the "Blurred Lines" music video.) The movie's subplots are contrived and unnecessary, then the climax of the movie plays out as unrealistic and fairly anti-climactic. The script educates the uninitiated about EDM and has some decent life lessons, but also features lines like, "This is my favorite part. Right before everything begins." What does that even mean ? that it's all downhill from here?!? (Hmmm. Since the quote appears early in this movie, maybe that IS what it means.) Honestly, I hope that Efron has not peaked. I hate to see anyone fall short of their dreams. Efron is good-looking (even though he's getting a little too old for that haircut) and he does have some talent. Besides, when it comes to succeeding in the entertainment industry, there's more than one way to "Bop to the Top". ("High School Musical 4: Class Reunion" anyone?) As for Zefron's 2015 release, one final word of advice: If people suggest that you get together and go see this movie, those are NOT your friends. "C-"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good despite that it bombed...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its no secret this movie bombed in the box office. That didn't stop me from watching it. Zac Efron has done a lot of good movies IMO.I really don't care about the politics of the story. Some say its just a recycled idea. Kids want to be famous, have troubles, guy wants the girl, want to get rich, blah blah blah.I watched this with an open mind and was pretty impressed. The damn soundtrack was on point!! The music was so good that I just kept watching to listen to the music. The story was good and the acting was good as well.For someone to say "Never watch this movie" is absurd to me. Its worth a watch or two. I plan to re-watch it with my wife. (She was sleeping at the time.) The ending of the movie was down right pleasurable and I really connected with the main character at that point.Watch this movie and then judge. Don't ever take someone else's word on a movie until you've watched it. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We are your friends, But We are not a very good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zac Efron is definitely becoming a bigger star than we give credit for, he's choosing some great roles and some very unique ones. But why he chose "we are your friends" is beyond me. When I first heard of the title being made I was kind of excited as we don't have many movies about DJ's. But unfortunately we get a movie more about clichés than we get about DJs themselves. This movie tries so hard to be something original yet falls into place of other clichéd music movies. Lets mark them down.-Talented person starting from the bottom trying to make his way: Check- Finds a talented producer with whom he starts working with: Check- Starts a relationship with a the girl his mentor/producer is dating behind his back: Check- One of the closest friends dies: Check- Finds his sound in the end: CheckAnd so on and so forth. The summary in short is Zac plays a DJ named Cole trying to become bigger and finding his song, along the way he has friends help him out, takes odd jobs and works with a producer to help while having a relationship behind his back. In the end he's given the chance of a lifetime to prove how talented he is. There's not really much going on here, the movie does;t do anything different, You learn bit about DJ culture, and while as a DJ I must admit drugs are a big part of the scene, the movie starts to glorify drugs such as molly and more. And even in one scene when Cole trips on PCP in a very weird yet artistic segment. Now for all the bad that there is there is some good but not enough to save this film. Zac Efron does a good job acting and is practically a saving grace for and otherwise lacklustre film, he does a good job narrating and showing some cool DJ tricks while he's spinning. The other saving grace is probably the music, now again most of the music here is EDM, and as for me I do quite enjoy EDM music, but if you're not a fan there's not much here for you in terms of that. Newcomer director Max Joseph took a chance in trying something new with the DJ culture but didn't exactly bring much here. And it's too bad because Max does have a good eye and great visual aspect, but for why he chose this movie, when it's completely riddled with bad acting, nothing original and overly clichéd film, is beyond me. We are your friends is not a good movie and definitely one I would pass on, it's not good but it isn't horrible. Its more forgettable as there is nothing fresh here all characters are bland including Zac Efron Cole, and there's no redeeming factor to watch this even more than once. "We are your friends" is a movie trying to hard with little vision and lacklustre story. Watch but don't expect much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as horrible as I was expecting, but still not all that good. Very Neutral</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see the movie because I like another Zac Efon vehicle, That Awkward Moment. The Movie is similar as it's about Efron leading a group of men in their early twenties that really need to grow up, but That Awkward Moment was a hilarious comedy, while We Are Your Friends is more of a satire. It's not like that other DJ movie, Eden. Both tell the story about the life of a DJ, but we are Your Friends plays out more like 8- Mile, that tells the beginning of Eminem's climb to the top. Efon's character gives a philosophy on being a DJ that I've seen in other movies about music but never about DJing, which was cool. The movie takes the subject matter seriously, but I feel the movie takes itself too seriously. For the most part its very light hearted but then they attempt to be sophisticated. Maybe this was to explore the full aspect of the scene they live in, but all it did for me was change the vibe too much.But overall, the trailer made We Are Your Friends look like Efron was playing an A-hole while hanging with his A-hole friends doing A- hole things, but the movie itself was much better than that, but not much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>inspiring movie for anybody trying to become somebody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie. I thought it was so inspiring. Maybe I'm in a place in my life where I need some serious hope, but I got it from this movie. It was worth renting for a few reasons but two of the biggest reasons are these two quotations:1. "This is the best part, the best part of anything really, it's the moment before it starts." That one line is riddled with anticipation &amp; hope. Just great.2. "?and if it's real enough, honest enough, &amp; if it's made of everything that's made you, where you come from, who you knew, your history, then you may have a chance at connecting with everyone else &amp; maybe that's your ticket to everything."gives me chills.I honestly watch very few movies where lines, ideas, or overall messages stick with me but this one did in such a positive way. It's all about growing up, working hard, struggling, making mistakes, but picking yourself back up &amp; with all your grit making something of yourself. It's an age old concept but the way they did it stuck with me. The movie was shot beautifully &amp; although I'm not into this kind of music or the lifestyle shown the filmmakers did a good job guiding me through it &amp; connecting it to the overall concept so it can be universally applied to any kind of lifestyle or career choice. And you can't take your eyes off of Efron. Yes he's a dreamboat but he is mesmerizing in this. You root for this beautifully imperfect character just making it happen for himself. Zac - never stop taking interesting roles. You were truly great in this &amp; are hugely talented. I laughed, I cried, &amp; overall just loved the movie. I will be watching this again when I need to be inspired &amp; reminded of the beauty that can come from hard work &amp; pure soul.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel those expecting some mega existential change your life material out of movies miss out on the finer points. Sure, there will be plenty of young people thinking this is a 'party' movie, and Zac Ephron followers will flock to the cinema to see him. Those of us who actually enjoy story telling will be OK with this flick. Sure it wasn't heavy with mystery or intrigue, its a coming of age story of 4 friends trying to live out their dreams. Who doesn't have a story like that. Its about growing past those dreams, building new ones and dealing with the repercussions of the changes in life we make....some times which are thrust upon us. The music is what I liked about this movie. Its not unlike other music related movies where an epiphany occurs for the lead character which makes all the difference in the world. For an easy going movie this was worth the cheap night tickets I bought.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cole Carter (Zac Efron) is an aspiring DJ. He and his friends Mason, Ollie, and Squirrel live in the San Fernando Valley. They struggle to make something out of themselves with the center of the entertainment world just over the hills. They promote a club for one night of the week. Cole is taken with Sophie (Emily Ratajkowski), and finds a mentor in her boyfriend James Reed (Wes Bentley). The four friends start work for Paige (Jon Bernthal) who is in real-estate foreclosures.I root for Zac Efron. I like Zac Efron. This is a bad pick by him. He is probably the only good thing in this movie. His three friends need time to build their friendship. They are never more than superficial characters. Emily Ratajkowski fits the character well in one respect. She's a vapid model trying to be an actress but is actually horrible at acting. The overall sense is a bad superficiality when a darker, deeper tone would have lend some compelling realism to the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For some this might not miss or skip a beat, others might not see this beating at all. And there will be a few who are totally in sync with the beat (down with it so to speak). But the DJ and his friends who all are living their dream (or are they?), have to go on a journey ... out of their comfort zone.Growing up or evolving and following what your destiny may hold for you, may not be a subject matter that attracts a lot of attention, but it does attract at least those who are fans of Mr. Efron. And while this isn't his strongest performance yet, that will not affect his fans. I was (pleasantly) surprised seeing Emily R. in this one. The movie itself does not hold many surprises though ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie called 'We are your friends' is about Cole. He is a beginning DJ who really wants to become famous doing what he loves. Conveniantly he meets James. James is a very popular DJ and takes Cole under his wing, and tries to make a better DJ out of Cole. And that was the main premise of the story.No that I have that out of the way, let's talk about the worst parts of the movie, and then go over to the better parts. One of the worst things in the movie is undoubtedly the directing. This was done by Max Joseph. You may know him from the TV-show called 'Catfish'. He switches styles a lot in the movie. An example of bad directing is early on in the movie, when Cole and his friends try to convince people to go to their party. When the kids start to walk out of the building, the camera starts to shake, without any reason. There are a lot of fast cuts, without any reason. Why? This could have been a OK scene, but they screwed over and made this a very annoying scene from the movie. Luckily it didn't last long. But there were also some well directed scenes, just not a lot, which is pretty sad. Now, the cinematography. This was ugly as well. The scenes weren't pretty at all, there were again some nice scenes, but they are rare. The editing was pretty bad too. For this I have an example too. When James confronts Cole in the bathroom of the stripper club, and Cole lies on the ground. When Cole has put himself against the wall, he changes positions a lot, between cuts. This is due to the bad directing and editing. Now let's move on to a better part of the movie. The music. This was good. I don't really like the music style, but some of it was good. The violence, for what was in the movie, wasn't good. It was ridiculous. Another thing that I dislike is the animated part. When Cole is tripping on some kind of drug. The animation looked bad and the only thing I could think was: 'What in the f*ck is happening?'The acting was also one of the 'better' parts. Zac Efron was good as Cole. Nothing too special. I didn't really like his character, but that is mostly due to the bad writing. Then now the person who saw something in him. James. He was played by Wes Bentley. He was maybe my favorite character. He was the most developed one. James was a successful DJ, but now has become a drunk addict. I know it is cliché, but so are all of the characters of this movie. The person that surprised me the most was Emily, I don't even dare to type her last name. She played Sophie. Sophie is the generic pretty girl of this movie, she doesn't really do anything in the story, except for 'inspiring' the main character, and cause some drama. But Emily was very good. I have seen her in 'Gone Girl', and thought that it was just a one time well acting job, but she has proved, that she is indeed a good actress. The friend group I am going to take as a whole. None of them could act, and were just complete douche bags. You have the aggressive one, the drug dealer, and the one who doesn't really fit it. Like I said, it is all pretty cliché.The script isn't good at all. They tried to be funny, but weren't, they tried to be dramatic, but failed at that too. And the last part was pretty, funny actually. They suddenly kill of a character, and try to make you sad, but they fail at this because they made the character so annoying. He was one of the main friend group. You didn't care at all for any of them, just because they were so goddamn annoying! The story overall was fine, just some weird moments here and there. The ending, was one of the best parts, maybe because the movie overall was pretty boring? But this was also your typical Hollywood ending. Also to come back on the dialogue. Whenever Zac is talking about his DJ stuff, it felt like he didn't know anything about it, and it sounded to me like it was complete nonsense. I don't know anything about that sort of music either, but I just don't think it is true.Overall this is a mediocre movie at it's best. The acting of Wes, Zac and Emily is the only part that keeps this movie moving, the other things are or annoying, or just boring. This isn't a movie I would watch again, but this is also not a movie that you should hate because it exist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great new perspective on the music... and friendship.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amazing how the film exceeds expectations, expecting at most a movie "ok" but is really great. The whole narrative has many virtues, I wonder if you can explain, but the story from one point holds you, I barely saw time pass, the way the issue of music is aborted is excellent, you may find (as well as I thought before seeing): "It's a film about DJ's, music is not important in the story." But no! How long is the music is a "purity" very cool and also reflects the importance with which the protagonist Cole (Zac Efron) is the same art (music). Moreover, the story is not (only) about teens, parties and cruising, as it may seem (at least for the title that the film won in Brazilian territory), the entire trajectory of the four friends during screen time is excellent too. However, I think the biggest plus point is the script, not that it be complex and innovative, but the film sets out to narrate a certain point there, and does so with praise, almost flawless, is almost, I think the only negative point in all this is how some situations are resolved in "easy" way more, are only two situations in which noticed it, but still prevented the note I gave was greater. Zac Efron also (for those who still have some bias) is very good, it can easily "take" the film "back", going all the depth that (I think) was applied to the character. In short: A great film, airtight script, good soundtrack (yeah, forgot to mention that), and some exciting moments until, at the end of "We Are Your Friends" makes a really cool message and fulfills its role, showing a different way of see music.</fullReview>

Too many love scenes way too boring. This movie it's a shame for house music and for the DJ's that play real music. When I see Zach Efron I can only think of musicals! And the whole music from the movie!!Is it David Guetta??Too commercial for what they look through the idea of the movie! All the actors they are acting like it would have been their first movie in their entire career! Hope the writers of this movie will stop to this one. Disappointed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the premiere last night and I don't have many words to say. It's because the movie left me without any impression. I didn't have any emotions during the whole movie except maybe one scene that had me reminded of my ultra experience. Also, the plot is predictable and it's all kind of superficial. A first half an hour was so boring and then I felt it could go up to the better, but no, the rest was the average even though the action have little changed and a bit of drama was dropped, but not enough good scenes to keep me interested. Movie soundtrack could be much, much better, as well. If you need to kill an hour and a half go watch it, but if you want to see some good movie don't. Maybe a little bit of naked Zac would save the day, but that also did't happen.</fullReview>

Apparently California has some sort of white bread "music" called "techno," used primarily for long sessions of aerobic exercise by those who'd rather look "buff" than to learn a skill or hold a job which actually contributes to Society. "Techno" is shown by FRIENDS to be "played" on a combination of wind chimes, power tools, zippers, and other "found" instruments, requiring its "musicians" to spend four or five hours a day running around outside with a clunky beta version of a Walkman dangling from their necks. I've never heard of a Techno counterpart to Ice Cube, Eminem, Madonna, Elvis, or the Beatles. But since America has not won an Olympic Gold Medal in the Marathon event since 1984 (women) or 1976 (men), I think that U.S. Track &amp; Field ought to explore the idea of recruiting Techno "musicians" for slots as U.S. Olympic Marathoners.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No chemistry in the Chemical Generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film about a group of young men partying in the San Fernando valley. A place that is just too far away from where all their dreams can come true in the Hollywood hills. The main character Cole (Zac Efron) has talent and ambition to become a headline DJ, but instead of going to college to learn his art he hangs out with his friends, who are drifting in the party drug scene, until he meets an established artist James Reed (Wes Bentley).This is aspirational movie about having a dream and going for it, and all the obstacles and pitfalls that go with it. There are moments in this film that I liked - when Cole shows a conscience several times as the story unfolds, and James Reed the hedonist selfish mentor self destructing, but the main storyline is one of romance between Cole and Sophie which didn't really get going for me. I felt there was no chemistry between the two of them. That really left the film flat though it does improve towards the end. The art of making music from your laptop is interesting but superficially explored here, and there was a lot to this film that just didn't add up: the friends - Mason, Ollie and Squirrel are quite an odd collection of mates with not a lot in common, and Cole really would be more of computer geek than he appears in this film. Overall I felt disappointed because it didn't get interesting until the end, and by then it was too late to recover. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We Are Your Friends Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cole Carter (Zac Efron) has dreams of gaining notoriety as a Hollywood DJ and also spends his days and nights hanging out with his buddies while working on a track that he hopes will set the world on fire. An opportunity soon comes knocking when he meets James Reed (Wes Bentley), a veteran DJ who takes the younger DJ under his wing. An obstacle later presents itself along his path to success when we starts to have feelings for his mentor's girlfriend which begins to jeopardize his relationship and the future he was destined to have.The title for this one probably should have been "We Are Your 1- Dimensionsional Friends". With a story that is about friends, I didn't really care too much for these ones. There's nothing really new or original here. I found them rather annoying and cliché and that they didn't really add anything to the story but that's inconsequential since the story isn't about them. Now about that story. It is a silly story to begin with but it also seemed to be facing an identity crisis. It didn't know whether it wanted to be a coming-of-age story or a party movie. Unfortunately it did not do either well. I found the party scenes quite dull as they consisted primarily of questionable people dancing in clubs to electronic music. The coming-age-part was slightly better since it contained less of Cole's friends despite it being both cheesy and cliché. The parts where we saw him learning about how to be the best were somewhat captivating despite being something I've seen before thousands of times (i.e. Southpaw) and also despite the fact that Wes Bentley's character felt like a caricature of a common mentor. What I didn't like about this film, other than the friend characters, was the story. I found the first half watchable but it fell apart for me during the second half. Without giving anything away, I'll say that there were a few subplots that I felt were unnecessary to the overall story and I found that things ended a little too nicely which did not make sense to me. For a story about overcoming one's environment and making a name out of one's self, I didn't think it did a good job at explaining how one goes about doing that. I'm not saying that it didn't explain this but rather it did off-screen and through a series of implications. The only thing I liked about this film was the music. I was never a fan of electronic music but it was well done here as it showed a lot of creativity and imagination. I have never been a fan of Zac Efron but he at least made this watchable. If I want to see a young person coming-of-age story, I'd see Paper Towns.Score: 6/10 keithlovesmovies.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Searching for more than momentary gratification using something that demands little else than just that</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Max Joseph's "We Are Your Friends," named after the 2006 techno song by the duo known as Justice, is an intriguing film about a quartet of young adults who know they're too smart to fall prey to society's "9 to 5" lifestyle and decide to try to turn their passion into a profession. The passion in question is DJing and creating electronic dance music (EDM) and using it as a tool to "control" partygoers, in a way. In a key scene in the film, Cole (Zac Efron), our main character, explains to us how many "beats per minute" are used in certain musical genres, and how EDM is special when used at parties because, with a few simple DJ tricks and the right pacing and structure of songs, one can essentially takeover the circulatory system of a person and their entire body just by the way he or she chooses to mix and play the music. It's fascinating insight to how a DJ operates because they are either (a) emptily criticized at parties or (b) taken advantage of more than the barrage of alcohol and mixers present at your average nightclub.But I'm getting ahead of myself here. The film revolves around Cole and his three friends, Dustin (Jonny Weston), Squirrel (Alex Shaffer), and Ollie (Shiloh Fernandez), who live in the San Fernando Valley, aren't enrolled in school, and are trying to find a way to share their love and talent with the world. The four wind up working a job as slickster real estate agents, cold-calling gaggles of people facing foreclosures and collecting commission off of their boss's unethical business practices. And yet, the big time is in their reach, so it seems, when an older DJ named James (Wes Bentley) contacts Cole and becomes his mentor, promising bigger gigs and potentially a spot in the lineup at the upcoming Summerfest. All of this could be corrupted, however, when Cole begins seeing Sophie (Emily Ratajkowski), James's beautiful girlfriend and Cole's desire to continue partying with his friends rather than getting entirely serious about his future.To be frank, I've always detested EDM/rave culture for many reasons that could sustain a whole separate blog post, but writers Max Joseph (of "Catfish" fame) and Meaghan Oppenheimer make a film that explores the culture from all angles, including the ones involving drugs and death (admittedly not to a very impacting extent). DJing and music-creation is a rather innocuous act of self-expression, but when mixed in with large crowds, carefree drug use, copious amounts of alcohol, and teenage hormones, it becomes a hot bed of mistreatment and disrespect to both sexes. Joseph and Oppenheimer show this without becoming too moralistic.This is a film, plain and simple, about a group of young men going through a quarter life crisis (most fully grown adults will sneer at this term, if they haven't already at the plot of this film). We focus on characters that are faced with the decision to either stick with their passion and hope to turn it into a lucrative gig, or keep doing it as a side project and go where easy money can be made (minimum wage jobs, working construction, etc). They choose the former, which bewilders and frustrates their baby boomer parents, who likely settled for the first wage-paying job they could find at their ages and put their happiness in the back of their mind (for a number of reasons other than just momentary income, mind you).With that, "We Are Your Friends" does boast its fair share of shortcomings. For one, I was hoping that this would be a film much like "Spring Breakers," which was specific enough where you could draw main points but also abstract enough where several tangents could be attached to already present themes. Not to mention, that was a film so mesmerizing and hypnotic that it practically sucked you into its world and refused to let you go, even when the credits began rolling. While Brett Pawlak's cinematography is strong, and elevated by Terel Gibson's slick editing, which is partly reliant on quick cuts, large, open shots of characters dancing, and the occasional animated sequence, it doesn't have the same immersive qualities "Spring Breakers" came equipped with. In order to truly captivate the target audience this film is going for, you need to grab them by the collars with language and images they understand and this film doesn't always do that. It's sometimes depressingly linear and routine.The film also bears its fair share of questionable moments, especially the resolution, which comes so quickly it begs an explanation. Meanwhile, Zac Efron, and actor I've defended since his starring role in "17 Again," is as affable as he's ever been, though his supporting cast is largely made up of goofballs who can periodically make an impression, and Joseph's desire to keep things simple works at the same it doesn't in terms of creating a captivating film.With all that on the table, "We Are Your Friends" still has considerable merit. For as popular as EDM currently is, I'm stunned it took this long for a mainstream film to focus on it, and the fact we got a film as attractive and fun as this makes me very happy. The film will speak to a great deal of young people, like myself, who choose to give it the time of day and extract something meaningful from it. It's a story of searching for satisfaction beyond the momentary gratification of life, which, paradoxically, is what DJing, raves, and clubbing is all about. It's best to look at this film as an examination of modern, young adult angst and the fight to make your life worth more than a paycheck than a film about one long party, though I'm not sure I see the target audience for this film extracting that. They might not yet be at that "now what?" stage these characters are currently at.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film tells how a young man with a passion for electronic music, who is mentored by a hugely successful DJ. He learns the trade, makes mistakes and has to decide what he really wants in his life.I can see that you have to be a fan of electronic music to like this film. Many scenes contain electronic music, and these scenes are long. Fortunately, I like electronic music so I enjoyed it a lot. Zac Efron's character works hard to produce electronic music that is different from the rest, and his mentor is so kind to give him encouragement and advice to head towards success. Along the way, he has to make some serious life choices. It is encouraging that he made choices with integrity and honesty, which balances out the other acts he commit in the course of the film. The party scenes are uplifting, vibrant and colourful. They really capture the essence of parties. The DJ's house is so beautiful as well. The visuals are great to watch. I enjoyed watching "We Are Your Friends".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "We Are Your Friends", starring Zac Efron-Neighbors, 17 Again; Wes Bentley-The Hunger Games, Jonah Hex; Emily Ratajkowski-Entourage, Gone Girl and Jon Bernthal-Fury, The Walking Dead_tv.This movie is about a group of young 20 year olds that are growing up and trying to decide how to make their fame and fortune. Zac is wanting to be a DJ, using his expertise in mixing and playing electronic music at clubs and party's to make a career for himself. He meets a professional DJ, Wes, and Wes' girlfriend, Emily. Zac falls for Emily, which complicates things with him and Wes-it's hard to ask for advise on a career when you are sleeping with that person's girlfriend. While Zac is trying to become famous, he works part time for Jon at a real estate company. And that pretty much sums up the movie. It's rated "PG-13" for language, drug &amp; alcohol use and sexual content- including partial nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 36 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD. I don't think I would rent it, either. If you want to see it, wait until it comes to cable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another "Party Movie Of The Year" wannabe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another weekend, another review and this time we are rocking into the theater for yet another youthful drama. Zac Efron leads the cast in the latest film about partying and friendship, in hopes of entertaining the masses in what looks to be some half-baked movie. Yet Hollywood can sometimes surprise you with a masterpiece that will hold a place in your own hall of fame. What is the verdict with this movie? Well sit back, relax and read my thoughts on Max Joseph's We Are Your Friends. The plot of the movie, according to the trailers, centers on Cole an aspiring D.J. in the San Fernando Valley who longs to make his mark. His idealistic, and mostly deadbeat, friends "work" to find a means of making money to move up to bigger and better things, perhaps resulting to less legal manners to do so. Fortune smiles on Cole when another DJ named James (Wes Bentley) offer him opportunities that could set him up for success. But these opportunities, as well as a cute woman named Sophie (Emily Ratajkowski) may be more than he bargained for. What chaos can ensue?Does this plot sound familiar? Well it should, because We Are Your Friends picks up the same carbon copy teenage drama plot that millions fall in love. Predictable doesn't describe how easy it was to pick apart the plot and know what was going to happen next. Much of the tale, as well as the dialog, focused on very shallow qualities that our modern age could relate to, primarily living for the moment via the use of drugs, booze, and careless sex. The "love" aspect in the film is rather simplistic, greatly diluted by the partying scenes and almost nonexistent until the end of the movie. Amidst the sea of very selfish and irresponsible motives, the team managed to add a few good morals to the film, such as working hard and selflessness towards others. It was just a shame that so much of this was rushed, so that they could maximize more of the party atmosphere. This brings me to my next point, the cinematography.We are your friends is all about making you feel you are partying, much of the 90 minutes dedicated to portraying modern social life? at least in the LA region. Loud raves filled with many young extras jamming to electronic music are the primary settings of this film. I felt they did a nice job dropping you into various party styles that help give you some social culture education, immersing you in all the aspects they have. Unfortunately this meant glorifying drugs, alcohol, and recreational sex as the true means of having fun. I only hope the consequences they showed at the end get through to the main audience, but with how much fun they made partying on drugs, can't say that will be the case. I'll admit I did enjoy the artistic direction they took for one drug scene, where the visual styles pop out, but otherwise it was not an impressive display. The best parts of the entire cinema for me though were showing the DJ process, getting glimpses on how the music I enjoy so much is synthesized and brought to life. In addition to glorifying the party lifestyle, this film also likes to focus on the body?a lot. Many of the extras and our two leading actors are very hot, sexy, or whatever descriptive term you want to use. Efron has plenty of moments in skin tight, muscle- emphasizing shirts that are shed to show off his body. If you're like some of my friends, you'll give this movie a ten for this feature alone. Guys don't worry; the directors have given you plenty of female anatomy to appreciate as well. Emily alone is very gorgeous to look at, but they have casted enough extras in skimpy clothing, and sometimes none, to appeal to your natural urges. Either way, this movie is sure to get some people "excited" and plays well to appeal to the shallow side of things. The best and final thing for me of this movie though is the soundtrack. Since this is a movie about an aspiring DJ, you can guess the movie is filled with tracks of electronic dance music. Fans of this genre will be tapping their toes as the music plays through the theater speakers, bass booming in full strength until the rest of the sounds became integrated into the mix. I admit I was boogying to many of tracks they created for this film. While some of the tracks are a little disorganized, I loved the integration of the music into the scenes and how the song matched the tone of the scene. However, if you find this kind of music simply earsplitting noise, then you need to avoid this movie for this point alone. Let's face it; this movie is certainly not the best on the block. With a very unoriginal plot, focus on the superficial qualities of life, and lack of award winning dialog there is very little that makes this worthy of the theater. In fact, this movie would have made for a good after school special if I'm being honest. However, the movie gets points for a gorgeous cast and awesome soundtrack. Thus, I recommend you wait out for this one to come to Netflix. My scores are:Drama/Music/Romance: 6.5 Movie Overall: 5.0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Embarrassing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start out by saying I love EDM. I've spent my entire life(as far back as I can remember) loving techno, house, dance, drum and bass etc etc. my first techno experience and first tape I ever owned was the Mortal Kombat soundtrack! Yes you laugh but forget that it's mortal kombat and listen to it. THE best techno of the time!This movie was not about edm. It was not about the experience of a rave or festival. Which honestly isn't what annoyed me. I could've really enjoyed a compelling story told within the world and culture of electronic music.My problem with this ridiculous movie is that it is nothing more than an 80's coming of age story Cliché. Ahh yes kids, sit back as we watch the white male and his white male friends as they experience growing pains, have minor set backs, get the girl and of course win the day all while looking like an Abercrombie and Fitch catalog circa 2001.Though I thoroughly understand that Hollywood will learn nothing from this bomb of a movie I do need to applaud my peers for not bothering with this joke of a film. As hard as it tried to appeal to what Hollywood believes we are..drunken, Instagram obsessed degenerates..okay we kinda are but we don't need to see it on the big screen! Even with all that..we still know crap when it's trying to be forced fed to us! HENCE We Are Your Friends: 1.8 million gross.Should you see it. Why I do believe I've answered that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zach Efron plays Cole Carter, a small-time local California DJ struggling to find his way into the upper echelons of the EDM scene. His friend group serve as his anchors, although ultimately their different paths don't really mesh with Cole's own dreams and goals (this all culminates in a pivotal scene near the end of the film). He unwittingly catches a big break at a local club where he is noticed by James (Wes Bentley) a once-great DJ who has become bitter and jaded. His wealth and industry connections continue to make him relevant, however. Seeing promise in Cole James takes him under his wing. Through James Cole is introduced to Sophie, who he is immediately taken with. Cue the typical romantic love triangle sub- plot conflict. To this film's credit it plays it better than most movies of this type. The film's music does it quite the credit in complementing its scenes. I'm not a fan of EDM admittedly, and I still managed to be engaged. Wes Bentley really steals the show here in my opinion; he gives the only truly good performance in this film. "We Are Your Friends" doesn't break any new ground, nor is it trying to. It's simply playing to its own rhythm and its up to you if you whether or not you want to follow along. Recommended for anyone into/interested in electronic music.</fullReview>

I had heard that it had received some mixed reviews so that kept me away from it but after seeing it I really enjoyed the movie. I thought the beginning was great and Zac Efron really nailed his character, as well as his friend group. The music was suburb throughout the entire movie, definitely the best part of the movie. The middle kinda got lost in the plot and leading up to the death of squirrel it felt like the movie itself was lost. But after his death I thought the movie picked back up and the ending in my opinion was really good.

		<fullReview>This movie will not get in the top 250 for sure. It will also not be spoken about too much. It is not one of the greatest pieces ever presented and it will not blow your mind. However, it is not as bad as some people have said it to be. Sure, it has many flaws and many overlooked mistakes, but after I saw it I didn't think that it was a waste of my time and if someone wanted me to recommend a relaxing movie I would not be ashamed to name this one. "We are your friends" has some interesting viewpoints that show the importance of friendship. Sadly those moments are rare and for a movie called "We Are Your Friends" we get to see way more screen time of a pseudo-love story than friendships but it definitely has its moments. Zac Efron has had better performances but if you don't mind spending some of your time watching a somewhat fun, somewhat insightful movie you won't mind his role. Another point that is touched on in the movie is creativity. I know, I know, a cliché and yet it is presented in an interesting way, but you have to see the movie to find out. The movie could have definitely been written better and played better and yet it is worth its time. If you have nothing to do and want to watch something other than the regular superhero movie, this could be your thing.</fullReview>

It's a simply film that is able to attract most film lovers, if your into romance, documentary's or action movies your'll probably like this film. It's the story of a boy (Zac Efron) who DJ's at small local gig's that are organized by his friends. A famous Dj see's that he has talent and helps him get a huge concert. But during this there is cheating, death, fighting and Zac and his friends find their place in the world.

		<fullReview>***My review doesn't mention REAL spoilers, I just didn't want to upset anyone.*** I went into this movie with a closed minded view of the EDM culture, from my own personal experiences,and I was extremely surprised. It wasn't just about the sex, drugs, and EDM. It was about the climb! The movie made me rethink my own life style. With Zac Efrons character, I know so many people could relate to the struggles and the hustle of everyday life and just making it. I think the movie really gives a whole-hearted experience to the viewer. Everyone goes through conflicts with friends but when you are trying to climb the ladder of success sometimes we can't relate to the struggles of our friends. This was definitely one of the movies that I sat back and watched. Wanting more in the end. The cast was perfect for their roles and I wish it would of grossed more in the box office, but truthfully I never even saw a trailer. I would definitely put this in my top 10 just for the soundtrack alone. Next to Trainspotting and 1999 Human Traffic. Because they are all about a group of friends, causing mischief and mayhem but in the end staying together for better or for worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blew Away Expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to start off by saying that I know this film did not do well in the box office or in many other reviews, and I can see certain points about it being a superficial story, however right there is where the negatives stop for me with this movie. Contrary to what a lot of critics are saying about this film being one dimensional, I found it to be completely the opposite. This movie totally caught me off guard by adding layer after layer of subtle reach-backs and nods to itself, and the EDM industry as a whole.Firstly, the idea for the film (a talented kid hoping to one day become a successful with EDM, coming from essentially nothing) caught my interest right away, due to the specific focus on electronic music, which I really connect with, and the film did not disappoint in that regard. The soundtrack was on point with a lot of great songs being mixed in with a ton of new music made just for the film. In that regard I found the movie to be genius, as the soundtrack acted as a persistent metaphor of what EDM music is. This was an extremely cool feature, and was just one of the layers that impressed me with this filmNow in regards to the story, it did start off a little slowly, and the introduction of characters was a little sloppy; however the unique filming style and artistic merit that accompanied the introduction took my mind off critiquing this initial letdown. From then onwards the film builds slowly into an incredibly emotional climax that gave me goosebumps. For me this films had everything: grit, romance, intriguing characters, a great score, subtle yet powerful moments where the film reached back to past scenes that supported the story, and some very emotional moments, concluding with a banger of a final scene before cutting to credits. I know this film gets ripped on a lot, but that ultimately just lowers expectations and offer greater potential for these expectations to be proved wrong. All in all if you are looking for an entertaining way to spend a few hours, We Are Your Friends will provide you with exactly that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reminiscent to movies like 1990s 'PUMP UP THE VOLUME'!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'WE ARE YOUR FRIENDS': Four Stars (Out of Five)Low-budget drama flick; about a 23-year-old aspiring DJ, trying to make it in the San Fernando Valley music scene. It was directed by first-time feature filmmaker Max Joseph; and it was written by Joseph, Meghan Oppenheimer and Richard Silverman (all first-time feature scriptwriters). The movie stars Zac Efron, Wes Bentley, Emily Ratajkowski, Jonny Weston, Shiloh Fernandez and Alex Shaffer. I think it's a pretty interesting look at the electronic dance music scene, in California. Efron plays Cole Carter; a 23-year-old that desperately wants to become a successful DJ. He lives in San Fernando Valley, with his friend Mason (Weston). Mason also acts as Cole's producer. He and their other friends, Ollie (Fernandez) and Squirrel (Shaffer), spend a lot of their time promoting Cole; at the local college campus. Things take a serious turn, when Cole meets an older veteran DJ, named James Reed (Bentley); who takes Cole under his wing. Things become especially complicated, when Cole falls for James's girlfriend, Sophie (Ratajkowski).The movie only made a modest profit at the Box Office, and it got only mixed reviews from critics. I really like it though. It has a cult classic feel to it; reminiscent to movies like 1990s 'PUMP UP THE VOLUME'. It's well directed and written, and there's a really memorable animated drug sequence in it. The performances are all decent; especially Efron, in the lead. Definitely worth seeing.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/EuKmXpjFt-k</fullReview>

It's better you go there thinking this film will be okay, and be surprised than thinking it will be amazing and it's just okay. if that makes sense. The one thing that got me in this film, was how I really wanted to go to the gym and work out, run and listen to music. But that's about it. It's about friendship and forbidden love wish I usually like, but I wasn't sure where they were going with everything in this film. Words to describe the film: DJ, Music, Friendship, drugs, booze, workout, artsy. I give it 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie "We Are Your Friends" tells the story of Cole and his three friends who live in San Fernando Valley. Cole the protagonist wants to become a big DJ. Cole meets James in a Club who is already a famous DJ. He becomes his mentor and tries to teach him how to create the one big track which will start his big career. The movie summarized is about music (EDM), parties, love and "to get better than this".The story is simple and casual, but the cinematography is in my opinion excellent. It feels like you are with them. You are a part of the movie. The songs are well chosen and are very catchy. The summer, the parties and the music in the movie makes my wish for summer unstoppable.I can totally understand that the movie is not for everybody. It is a movie for the younger generation which like the "new" electronic sounds. It is unfortunate that the movie was a flop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A snapshot of valley youth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Came into this movie with zero expectations; barely knowing what it was about and came out very pleasantly surprised.This is a California Valley "lost youth" movie with the DJ scene and LA's bright lights as a background. Its strength is to focus on a tight, well rounded group of characters and all the actors, including Effron, deliver good to strong performances.The end is particularly good. Without spoiling it makes you go through the emotional roller-coaster very well. If you have any passing interest in Cali, DJs... or Emilia Ratajkowski who's just beautiful as usual, this is a good movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A much, much better film than what I ever anticipated. This is a perfectly acceptable film that is in no way represented by what the trailer makes it out to be, especially in its message and ideas. All in all it is a respectable debut from director Max Joseph even though it definitely circles around some very generic territory.Fundametally what the movie does really well is having an organic integration of characters, locations and music. It does understand what its place is, it has noble intentions more or less and so manages to really shape out the characters and give them all a heart felt arch and a beat on screen. That is more than many movies manage to do. Of course a lot of that work is undermined by the fact that many characters are clichés to the point of exhaustion and some decisions and actions they take are absolutely preposterous.Still, I really dug some of the development, especially the relation between Wes Bentely and Zac Efron. It could have really been a dull, boring and uninteresting, but thanks to some committed work from both of them, you end up investing more than you think and it surprised me by the end how much I actually, kind of cared. Moreover the film is shot pretty well, it has a decent music choices that maybe could have been better with a bigger budget and the whole DJing thing is developed really interesting from a visual stand point, unfortunately it never really works 100% and there are multiple moments where you don't really care, but for the most part it was an inventive way of presenting DJing visually.The movie is just brought down by clichés, clichéd characters and a little narrative chaos. There are some story lines that really have no place and could have been replaced by some more intricate narrative for our three main characters rather than the simple, basic storyline they are given.All in all this is a kind of fun time, it only needed some more energy and a little less overall for it to be a good music picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't stop thinking about this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked it! Even Zac Efron, as a man roughly the same age as him, I hate to like him, but he's hard to hate in this one. It was beautifully shot. It's a movie surrounding the digital music scene. There's parties, drugs, music, and extremely beautiful women. "I love it here". The whole movie builds (albeit slowly at some points) towards the ending pretty nicely. Wes Bentley is one of the best at playing those characters you love to hate. Him and Zac have a very genuine relationship., in fact the whole movie is very genuine to me.Emily Ratajkowski though.... I mean, she's literal perfection. They actually make me want to "roll" in Vegas. I can't imagine what that life would be like being from a small Canadian town. Maybe that's why I enjoyed it so much. I got to see what it would be like to do things people think you're not supposed to. Seeing the pitfalls and triumphs of the ride was pretty amazing. Any rating below a 7 is a crime, how many story lines are 100% organic, give me this over another Spider-Man reboot any day...Pretty pumped for the Spider-Man reboots TBH.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw many comments telling it is killing the DJ Scene... in fact it's not true. Not as much as films about hard rock star who only look like junkies who cannot play music without the help of poison (drugs, alcohol, smoke, etc...), in fact this film is good for that reason, It's real life. Just comes out with a good song, get to know the good people and your career start ! Also, in this film you see that theses DJ are the new rockstars, they can put on a lot of a show, and the good ones, know their music.Zac Efron stars in this film with the criminally underrated Wes Bentley (American Beauty, American Horror Story). and they both make for a good pair. You also have the chick with the big boobs, i don't remember her name but i can tell you one thing. Max Joseph from the show Catfish direct a good movie that should be seen for what it is... a film about what the DJ scene is all about and how to become that ultimate star. Cool cameo by a few DJ like Nicky Romero and Alesso... i also suspect that the guy Wes Bentley represent is Deadmau5 who did not come with a good hit in over 10 years and still believe he is the big thing because he is on every big show, even if his performances are horrible to worse !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you go into the theaters thinking that this movie is mostly about partying then you will be disappointed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is mostly focused on these 4 guys in their mid 20s trying to get their lives together without the help of education. It is about more than just the parties, drinking, and sex. You have to take the time to actually open up your mind and pay attention to the small details to really understand this movie. If you want to see a movie strictly about partying go watch "Project X". There is a few things you can think about after watching the movie and one of which is "How far are people willing to go for money" , "How hard it is to make it in the big leagues without school", and "What do people with money spend their times doing". These questions all focus on one particular character. After you finish watching the movie you will see. I strongly recommend this movie to everyone!

		<shortDescription>Its heart is in the right place</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found the music mostly uninspiring until the climactic scene, which I thought worked well enough but was not incredible. It's artist/performer-focused and not some kind of true biopic, so it will tend to suffer as nearly all fictional music films: You have to pull a hit out of your hat (or somewhere else) by the end. However, that can't excuse the rest of the soundtrack.Poor character development. Little in the way of back stories or situations to instill empathy. Just in a rush to make its story points. Thinking back, there were few quiet moments of ordinary realism or struggles outside of the painfully-transparent hip style and the hustle to "make it" that rolls in like a freight train from the opening frames. The slant of slacker sheltered suburbanite desiring to leave the nest rather than a real struggling artist didn't help matters. A Trainspotting-style film that actually dwells more on the DJing &amp; nightlife and maybe less on the drugs, pubs, and crime is a great idea. Of course, that movie is titled literally off a DJ reference (trying to figure out the track the DJ is playing and steal his set list, essentially), but goes off more on a very hard drug tangent, though it worked effectively in that film. Here the drug use is lower-down but is reoccurring as a means of a story arc and that can be used for altering the vibe in various scenes. The drugs arc execution, to be fair, is strait and honest about this particular crowd the main character is with and does not get too preachy too soon. However, let me reiterate this again: Trainspotting, a film titled after a DJ culture term but that instead mostly dealt with hard drug culture, had KILLER music. I cannot imagine anyone wanting to buy the soundtrack to We Are Your Friends? and it is trying to be more about the music, the guy behind the decks, and the nightlife than Trainspotting was.You need a lot of personality, personalities, and great dialog to pull that approach off. We Are Your Friends falls far short. Even the jokes are just mildly funny. The predictability that results from the drugs theme, though its emphasis is reversed from Trainspotting, is unavoidable, and even worse, without the emotional investment in the other characters, it doesn't pay off like it could have and needed to make this a good film. Though I can't stand Larry Clark movies, a little more of Kids (especially if they were still intent on lacing drugs throughout the story... pun!), especially in the first act, would have been useful. I do not mean in terms of making it a more dominant and disturbing part of everything, or throwing in essentially prurient kiddie porn type stuff, but trading the breaking of the fourth wall main character narrating to us instead for an audience-as-voyeur or faux documentary style might have worked better. This would also allow the mundane &amp; poignant moments to learn about these characters and develop an attachment. There are some realistic scenes throughout, such as watching companions get through security into a big festival. How to justify showing only 3 seconds of a festival stage is beyond me. There's little attempt to draw the audience into their world in that section. It did nail certain types of promoters, though, and slightly touched-on the club scene behind the scenes. It also rightfully explored the scams and hustles even outside nightlife promoting in the ordinary world seemingly-respectable people often engage in. It gets some of the DJ "star" industry right and how success tends to happen nowadays by way of producing, though it fails to mention the issue of ghost producing or the favoritism growing towards "hot chicks" who gain instant fame at the decks at disproportionate rates to their numbers actually out there in the wild ? i.e. though they make up less than 5% of all DJs or producers, something like 10-20% of bookings now are ladies, and none of them except in the gay circuit or the hip hop turntablism genre see less than stunningly-gorgeous ladies "making it" now. The famous DJ character in this movie, brings the lead character to a party with such privileged talent, but I digress. There were many times where it seemed a real DJ had advised them, but then it goes on about synced heart rates to control a crowd. I imagine they probably teach nonsense like that to celebrities-turned-DJs at whatever tutoring sessions or schools they apparently enroll in.It's All Gone Pete Tong or Trainspotting this is not. We Are Your Friends is mostly a predictable, blown opportunity, but it had its moments. I giggled a few times. There were a few insights. It's not all tongue-in-cheek on one extreme or too euphoric and preachy on the other. Though it never rises to any major heights, I was expecting worse. It knew more of what it spoke than some other flicks on the subject, even if its execution never quite brought it all together to move me. Can you imagine moments as inspiring as Before Sunrise/Sunset or the camaraderie from great buddy movies in something like this? Little of that is present here. Yet I do not feel a strong resentment or want for my 90-something minutes back. I appreciated the lackluster attempt and the heart. It's possible studio execs in Europe literally just decided to cash in on the scene and arbitrarily chose a cheap script on the subject that was being tossed around, and the director just wasn't ready to harvest this. I can't blame the director for taking his break, and having more releases of this kind of movie isn't such a bad thing. It's not as if it's been tried as much as rom-coms or creature horror. I probably just spent an hour writing this review. Maybe I just don't value my time that much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We Are Your Friends</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We Are Your Friends is the first feature film from writer and director Max Joseph, and stars Zac Efron as Cole, an aspiring young DJ whose life in the San Fernando Valley consists of occasional gigs, a miserable job and spending time with his troublesome friends. But when a chance encounter with a popular and successful DJ, played by Wes Bentley, opens up his eyes and mind to a different world and better opportunities, his loyalties are soon tested. Not only to his friends, but his new mentor, whose girlfriend soon finds affection from and companionship in Cole. There's not an awful lot of depth in We Are Your Friends, but it works on the strength of Efron, Bentley and Emily Ratajkowski, who make for an involving trio whose chemistry compensates for some unfortunate turns in the story. Efron and Ratajkowski are particularly good, and have such vibrant chemistry that it's missed when ventures into Cole's job in real estate sidelines the most involving aspects of a story that's very much a 21st Century take on A Star is Born. But it stumbles in a final act that forces Cole into a moment of truth, undercutting the dramatic potential that was building between him and his friends. The music is good, I should add, but the beat doesn't have enough heart to make this movie anything more than diverting. This said, Efron continues to show just how smart and capable he is as an actor, although what probably seemed like a good commercial project has bombed something awful on the domestic market.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"We Are Your Friends" Movie Group Review There have been times where I have felt like I have wasted my money and time on seeing a movie. This was not the case when seeing "We Are Your Friends." This movie should acquire 3.5 out of 5 stars for their excellent music choice and well organized plot. Any viewer could follow the plot easily, yet it was still complex enough to not get boring. I would suggest this movie to any viewer who enjoys EDM (Electronic Dance Music) and somewhat of an action movie. This is a movie that makes one question the society we live in and points out the daily events of everyone who tries to build a successful lifestyle, but ends up having setbacks.From the previews that were advertised, "We Are Your Friends" looked scattered and without a set plot. After seeing a preview like that, not many people would have wanted to spend the money on seeing it or even take time out of their busy schedules. Surprisingly, this movie had other plans. This is a movie that is filled with drama, romance, and music. The main character, Cole Carter (played by Zac Efron), is a simple young man who has a passion for music, but in specific, making electronic music. Due to not having a college degree and a set job, Cole is forced to make his living out of playing random "gigs" at nightclubs. All this changed when Cole met another DJ who took him under his wing and tried to help him build up his music skills. Everything was going smoothly until Cole chose selfishness over loyalty and has relations with his new friend and mentors girlfriend, ending his friendship with the other DJ. Cole is then forced to make a living for himself, going back to playing his night gigs. One night, as he and his close set of friends were partying, his friend ended up using drugs and alcohol and he wound up dead. WIth this tragedy upon Cole and his friends, he is then faced to make a choice to continue to live the way he is living, or make something better out of himself. With the memory of his friend and his treasured DJing skills, Cole ends up making his one big hit track. Not only that, Cole ends up realizing that there is so much more to his life than what he has been settling for. Seeing "We Are Your Friends" was well worth the time and money spent. I would definitely go see this again and would recommend it to all my friends who enjoy electronic music, a love story, and somewhat of an action movie. This movie should acquire 3.5 out of 5 stars for their music choice and well organized plot. The movie makes one realize that no matter what is put in their path of success, with determination, they can battle through their setbacks. Everyone has the chance to make themselves better, when a person takes that chance, that is when they build success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Speaking Through Rhythm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We Are Your Friends mainly explores today's youth about how vapid and shallow their lifestyle is and also their passion towards it. It focuses on a DJ trying to leave his old grind with his friends while also trying to transcend his career. The film's remarkable feat is how it never sugarcoats the bitterness of their reality and the consequences of conforming it so. It doesn't add up a lot of narrative depth, but it does get its themes clear. Otherwise, the film's style speak so much of the story, brimming up its own narrative rhythm and the fascination towards it. There could have been more in We Are Your Friends, but it's still an interesting film to explore at this form.The movie has two focuses; one concerns Cole and his friends attending parties, promote it to other teens and earning money from loaning to get to fulfill their dream of running away for bigger opportunities. The other is an interaction with an old DJ helping Cole to improve his talent while also getting strung by a love triangle with his girlfriend. The former is kind of a commentary of how youth are living in the facade of their actually meaningless lifestyle, while the latter is just a predictable love story that becomes a backdrop of the main character's inspiration. They both work well, even if they aren't quite deep, but there is something more interesting behind these stories that could actually be vital in subtext.The movie doesn't stray from the darkness of their reality, and that makes it compelling. But the heart is truly earned if it explained what makes it so special for them. The director's style speaks much of that appealing side. The editing is brisk, following the same beat as the music. It also explains the DJ work in some interesting ways, though some claim it's not accurate, but it doesn't quite matter since the core belongs somewhere else. The acting is compelling; with Zac Efron carrying well with this flawed character and Wes Bentley backs him up charmingly.We Are Your Friends isn't quite subtle and what lead to the climax is rather contrived than anything else, but what the movie got is understanding the pleasure and the negative results of their actions. And it's an interesting outlook overall, and the film mostly manifested the element of it; from the style to their bitter circumstances, the movie works. It can be predictable at some points, but what matters in the end is seriously the rhythm of what the film is taking you into.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of We Are Your Friends</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We Are Your Friends (my latest review) is about prospective DJ Cole Carter. His friends as they say, are just secondary pawns. Liberating itself as part Tony Manero escapade, part 8 Mile, and sprinkled with a little fairy dust from The Wolf of Wall Street, this is a film that's somewhat inferior to everything just mentioned. That in my mind, secretes its place among the many releases in the last dash, August scrap heap.Notwithstanding, the music here is completely bumpin, the sun shines intensely, and beautiful women seem to grow on trees. "Friends" with its plot threads subjugating as dangling loose ends, sticks to its persona as an L.A. snob story (not sob story). Every character is of a certain class, every scene is a party (full of sex, laced joints, and plenty of eurodance cuts), and everything the next day is a reckless hangover. The one saving grace: Two appealing actors by the names of Wes Bentley and Zac Efron. They give burying performances and in the world of music mixing, one of their characters is the mentor and the other is the student. Their kinship as veritable tug of war, kept me somewhat interested. Otherwise, things sort of end when they end. Oh and did I mention this vehicle has the audacity to hint at the hope of a sequel (by the time the final credits roll)? I kept thinking to myself, would that actually work?Referencing the alleyways of San Fernando and masquerading Los Angeles as a modern day Munich (Ecstasy and flashing, neon lights can't lie), We Are Your Friends chronicles one Cole Carter (Efron). He's an aspiring deejay, a man who's got the music in him (as Kiki Dee would say). He can take one track, promote variations on said track, and have any inebriated partygoer dancing till the break of day. Here's the problem though: He doesn't make very much money via this craft. And to supplicate his own income, Carter dabbles in phony real estate dealings (he's also accompanied by three of his buddies who pose as a low rent entourage). A chance meeting with a spin doctor higher up on the food chain (DJ James Reed played by Wes Bentley), sets him straight. He can polish up his technique, wreck the turntables at Summerfest (an all-out musical fiesta), and get his sorry butt out of quote unquote, "the Valley". While all this is going on, he has a thing for Reed's saucy, pseudo-like girlfriend (Sophie played by Emily Ratajkowski).Random things to look for when taking in a viewing of We Are Your Friends: 1. A visual palate akin to something out of a Vitamin C music video. 2. Lots of giddy, techno music riffs. I wanted to get up and dance but was afraid to do so (I probably could have being that I was the only one in the theater). 3. A swift education from the filmmakers on the aspects of BPM (an urban definition for "beats per minute"). 4. Finally, a scene in which a death occurs (at a party) in the form of a drug overdose. What I'm curious about is why the person handing out the pills didn't get busted. I mean it was his fricken house!Anyway, in my lifetime I've never seen a cinematic endeavor pertaining to the art of DJing. And in truth, I never would have thought that it could be made into an interesting enough component to carry a film. But darn it if "Friends" doesn't take itself way too seriously. That was probably what was needed. Max Joseph (he shoots mostly documentaries and shorts) directs in a hyperkinetic style. He's flash with a little bit of stash. He uses every nickelodeon technique in the book including a PCP trip sequence as animation fantastique. When his lead player (Efron's Carter) is out on his own or his role in a two-part character study arises, the proceedings have a responsibility to them, a blossoming. When Carter trades dialogue with his nitwit buddies (in the form of actors Shiloh Fernandez, Alex Shaffer, and Jonny Weston), We Are Your Friends becomes immature and immaterial. Basically, Saturday Night Fever turns into Saturday Night Cleaver. Ugh!In conclusion, we all know what the month of August means. It's that time when movies scrape the bottom of the barrel. In fairness, there have been some exceptions to the rule (The Sixth Sense comes to mind) and some hardcore stinkers to boot (1998's 54, ouch). We Are Your Friends fits somewhere in the middle. Bottom line: "Friends" shouldn't let "friends" pay ten bucks to see the movie I've just reviewed. "Friends" should just tell "friends" to wait for it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to put this - so what?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cole (Zac Efron) lives in the San Fernando Valley, hangs out with his three best friends, and is a would-be DJ (once upon a time this meant playing records, nowadays it seems to mean fiddling about with sound files on a laptop). He falls in with wealthy but living on his reputation DJ James (Wes Bentley), who drinks too much, and falls for James' personal assistant and girlfriend Sophie (Emily Ratajkowski). Stuff happens, but not very much of it, and life lessons get learned. I think.To be frank, this wasn't really my kind of movie but, since it seemed infinitely preferable to Straight Outta Compton, I went to see it. I'm still not sure what the point of it was. Zac Efron impresses as an actor even when the part isn't up to much ? he certainly has some chops, which one never really suspected in his teen heartthrob days. Wes Bentley is always good, and Emily Ratajkowski shows great promise and cleavage. One of Cole's friends is annoying and the other two are forgettable. Drugs are consumed. The dead end friends go nowhere very much. And there is a musical number at the end (I say "music", it's one of those techno things which barely qualifies as music by my definition) which actually works well, and I found myself understanding its appeal, if not actually liking it.And I came out of the cinema thinking nothing very much at all. The slight appreciation I had for the small changes in Cole during the last half hour compensated almost exactly for the complete absence of interest in what had gone before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exactly what I expected it would be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, like many of the more recent reviews, definitely disagree with the ratings that "We Are Your Friends" has been receiving. I am a fan of EDM in general and if for nothing else, the music in this movie was everything I hoped for. As someone who is not familiar with the finer points of DJing, the explanation of the techniques was interesting, and made me think about the other music that I enjoy in the genre.I thought the plot was representative of what it should have been. I see reviews stating that for the title of the movie, there should have been more scenes focusing on the group of friends and their relationships, but I think what they did was enough. I do disagree with using their friendships as the title, but you can't judge a book by the cover. As with any group of young adults, you hang out when you can, but you aren't always together due to living life, and this movie represented that idea. Especially when someone is trying to "make it big" you are going to follow someone who has the ability to help you live up to your dreams and that's what Efron's character did. As far as the friends go, the only thing I truly desired was additional background behind the beginnings of their friendships.I also liked the acting. As someone who has always been a fan of Zac Efron, I thought that his role was well played, and contrary to the vast number of people who still see him as being in High School Musical, I think he is really growing as an actor and beginning to hit a stride that the industry can get behind. Wes Bentley played an alcoholic, has-been fabulously. Ratajkowski was beautiful as ever, but there was truly nothing special about her performance. The rest of the group of friends did fine jobs, but again, nothing spectacular. And finally, Bernthal plays that role as the crook disguised as a business man better than the vast majority of the industry and this movie was no exception.Where I have issues with this movie is the long lasting feeling that some movies give you when you leave the theater. Movies that I would rate higher than this, I think about days after seeing the movie and remember finer points about the movie and how subtle actions or lack thereof change the way I personally feel while watching the movie. I liked the movie, thought the music was great, but when it comes down to it, my reaction to it stopped when I left. There was no additional thinking necessary. It gave you all the information, and then just left you to enjoy the movie for what it was, which is good, but definitely not worthy of a higher rating.I think that if this was a story directly replaying what had happened with a huge artist (say Hardwell or Aoki) and not just a fictional DJ that people would be all over it, but as it stands, I liked it. Don't be turned off by the negative Nancy's that have reviewed this previously, go see it and form your own conclusions about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No spoilers but just to say loved the film. My other half was dreading watching it as he hates dance music but at the end he said he really enjoyed it. Definitely worth a watch :) Especially good if you love dance music, good story behind it too. Love it Would watch again :) Trying to write enough to get review listed but don't want to give anything away. It is a film that was enjoyed by everyone today. I will even be getting it on DVD. It even bought tears to my eyes a couple of times and I'm not the overly emotional sort normally. It has inspired me to go get some decks and make some tunes!!! It was actually my other half that told me to write a good review as he was worried people would judge without seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WAYF - A love/friendship story about achieving your dream.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They start off showing us what its like to be unknown. They have their little thing going on in the valley but they want more.Director Max Joseph gives this movie an emotional ride with dramatic and heartpumpin' moments. The balance of drama and happiness is what made me really like this movie and going into this movie gives you the impression of expectations, you think you know what will happen when you enter the cinema cause frankly it feels predictable, but Max Joseph and Meagan Oppenheimer really proves you wrong. The story's ending unfolds really strong and the some of the character goes through a great change that is really pleasing to watch while others doesn't, which also really served the story.It's hard to go into this movie without expecting the cliché element which tends to be in movies like these, but at least Max Joseph and the great actors that we're cast proved me wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average but forgettable! 4/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: I'm really in two minds about this film because I didn't really find it entertaining but I stuck with it, mainly because I wanted to see were it was going. I'm not really into "electronic" music so the whole soundtrack became a bit tedious after a while but the director introduced different elements, which made it watchable. Zac Efron plays an 23 year old, aspiring DJ (Cole Carter), in San Fernando Valley, who lives with his best friend Mason (Jonny Weston). They hold parties with there best friends Ollie (Shiloh Fernández) and Squirrel (Alex Shaffer), on a regular basis but they only make a little profit, which doesn't go that far. Whilst Djing at a night club, Cole gets chatting with an older DJ, James (Wes Bentley), who eventually becomes his mentor and teaches him the in's and out of producing in his lavish studio. They soon build a trusting relationship with each other and Cole takes out James girlfriend, Sophie (Emily Ratajkowski), who he falls head over heels for. After spending a passionate night together, James finds out about there relationship, which breaks his friendship with Cole. After losing his best friend, Squirrel, he pursues his career in producing music and he puts together the perfect record, using natural sounds. He then rebuilds his relationship with James and he headlines a major event, were he debuts his record and rocks the crowd. The director added some emotional elements to make it seem like it wasn't your regular American "spoilt youths" type of movie but it still turned out like it. As I'm coming from a Djing background, I could relate to a lot of the concept but I'm used to playing on the underground scene, not to a bunch of rich kids in sunny California. The acting was average and the storyline became a bit predictable after a while. I don't really know what message the director was trying to get across but he done the smart thing by putting Zac Efron in the lead because I doubt that it would have made a profit without him plastered all over the poster. In all, it's a watchable movie but I was left feeling a bit empty when it finished. Average!Round-Up: Zac Efron, 28, has been starring in some decent movies lately but I'm yet to see him prove that he can be taken seriously as a major actor. After a successful career in the High School Musical franchise, he first turned to cinema in 2007, in Hairspray. He then took the lead in Me and Orson Welles in 2008 but when he came out with 17 Again in 2009, his career took a turn for the better and he was able to put his High School Musical days, firmly behind him. With another Bad Neighbours in development along with a movie alongside Robert DeNiro called Dirty Grandpa, due to be released, he certainly has a lot to look forward to. His name has also been linked to the remake of Baywatch, which is perfect casting but I'm still waiting for an Oscar winning performance. This is the first major movie directed by Max Joseph, who made this movie from personal experiences. If your not in that scene and your not interested in the music, I personally can't see anyone finding this movie entertaining, so it's not for all audiences.Budget: $2million Worldwide Gross: $9.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/music/romance movies starring Zac Efron, Wes Bentley, Emily Ratajkowski, Jonny Weston and Shiloh Fernandez. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We Are Your FriendsThe reason EDM DJs wear headphones is so they don't have to listen to their own annoying music.Conversely, the spinner in this drama thinks his music is actually original.Struggling dance music DJ Cole (Zac Efron) catches the eye of a legendary beat-maker (Wes Bentley), who takes the aping amateur under his wing and encourages him to branch out.Immersed in his mentor's drug addled lifestyle, Cole starts using and disconnects from his friends. It's not until he sleeps with his icon's girlfriend does Cole begin to see his tutor's controlling nature.Despite its astute dissection of the misunderstood genre as well as some truly eye-catching visual techniques, We Are Your Friends lacks direction, believable dialogue and relatable characters.Not to mention its after-school special plot twist involving an overdose makes the life lessons learned seem utterly contrived.Furthermore, not all deaths at EDM concerts are overdoses ? some are suicides.

		<shortDescription>An excruciatingly long cocktail of party music, drugs and booze culture.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We Are Your Friends is an excruciatingly long cocktail of party music, drugs and booze culture. Some will wonder how this description could be boring but when the characters in the film are this obnoxious or dully conceived it becomes interminable, even at ninety odd minutes. The film is developed by French company StudioCanal who have hired first time director Max Joseph to helm the film and write the screenplay with Meaghan Oppenheimer. Joseph is an MTV recruit who worked on the television show Catfish. In both its form and content, the film is putrid and adolescent. The pacing is glacial for a revved up film about partying and life in the fast lane and the only major stylistic touches implemented involve the bombastic music, montage images and a gimmicky trip scene involving splashes of animation?whereas the rest of the film is blandly textured with dull white sterile tones. The screenplay preferences the party scenes well before the plot, which is comprised of undernourished story lines, pinched from other films. Adding in how unlikable the characters are and it is an insufferable and sometimes repugnant clunker.If the film has any purpose it is to prove that actor Zac Efron has left his Disney roots far behind, having started his career in High School Musical. He has shown some promise before in films like Me and Orson Welles (2008). But his part here asks little of him in terms of facial expressions and emotion. It doesn't help that his character Cole, a wannabe DJ living away from home who is trying to make it in California, associates himself with the worst kind of people. His friends are Entourage-like bro dudes?misogynistic creeps?one of whom (played by Jonny Weston) is covered in tattoos and fittingly wears a hat backwards labelled "Lowlife". To ask us to sympathise with these yahoos and root for their success is asking far too much. They're an unlikable and grotesque bunch, who only serve to strengthen the stereotype that young men are solely interested in partying, getting wasted and talking about sex. Their ambitions are low, so why should we care? These layabouts are employed by James (Wes Bentley) to bring girls to a nightclub. It is there that Cole meets Sophie (model turned actress Emily Ratajkowski, from Robin Thicke's Blurred Lines video and recently Gone Girl) who isn't interested in tabling with them. Cole wakes up after a night of partying in the home of James and it turns out?wait for it? that Sophie is James's secretary and girlfriend. Meanwhile, James and Cole become friends and after he listens to Cole's DJ tracks, he tries to encourage his creativity and provide him with work.The cliché story lines are as such: the temptation to date the boss's girlfriend, a Wolf of Wall Street-like subplot involving working for a shonky guy (Jon Bernthal) who preys on people who have their homes foreclosed by the banks and Cole's quest to make the ultimate music track because he believes that you only need one to be a success as a DJ. It's extremely dull because Cole is a flatly written character with no backstory, except the vague impression he's fallen out with his parents. Sophie is a slightly more sympathetic as she has been forced to work as a secretary since she can no longer afford to attend college. However, she is also treated as a submissive prisoner to both James and the film's dedication to making Cole an honourable white knight who will save her from mistreatment. But We Are Your Friends won't be winning awards for feminism. It frequently contradicts itself in the worst ways. There are no other female characters worth mentioning because they're not treated as people but background decoration to be ogled at by the film's lingering camera within slow-motion scenes. Similarly, in- between its scenes of debauchery, the film pretentiously comments on individualism and the American Dream. Would you believe the characters realise there might be more to life than merely partying? The third act houses a particularly stupid sequence where Cole develops a music track by recording the sounds around him, and compliments this with a useless coda?just in case any aspiring DJs silly enough to watch the film?about only needing one track to succeed in life. Who knew that Democracy and the free world were founded so that people like Cole could live out their dreams of becoming a successful DJ? Max Joseph himself had a single idea?a trashy and poorly scripted film?and it's emerged in terrible fashion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A DJ's Life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We Are Your Friends (2015): Dir: Max Joseph / Cast: Zac Efron, Emily Ratajkowski, Wes Bentley, Jonny Weston, Shiloh Fernandez: Title symbolizes the connection where music binds the disc jockey to the audiences. Zac Efron plays DJ Cole Carter whose ambition is to be a famous DJ. He hangs out with his friends who are mostly drug peddlers but desires more out of life. Wes Bentley plays James Reed, a washed out DJ living off past success and spending his days hungover after a night of heavy drinking and clubbing. He takes Cole under his wing but is critical that he find his own nitch as oppose to drawing completely on influence. Emily Ratajkowski plays Sophie, James's girlfriend and it is obvious that Cole will go after the forbidden fruit and engage with her sexually thus destroying any hopes career wise he had through James. Those into the DJ lifestyle will best understand this film. Director Max Joseph cannot avoid the clichés but he is aided by stunning visual moments such as a drug trip where paintings seems to come to life. Efron fares well as someone yearning for more out of life and despising the short cuts demonstrated through a real estate job. Bentley as James as seen his peak pass him by and is slowly just going with the motions. Ratajkowski as Sophie is drained from the emotional toils of a relationship with James and seeks adventure with Cole. He grows further apart from his friends who are either a bad influence or are failing in their own pursuits. Major box office bomb is better than reputation displays with a showcase of DJ life and the struggles to connect with reality. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie overall!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely loved the movie it is so fluid in the story and everything, for me as a young student the feelings that &#x131; felt while i am watching are the feelings that i am familiar with as &#x131; mention the film is fluid i do not want to give a spoiler but the movie gets exciting more in the end,Zac Efron played well in his role and other actors too, i felt surprised after i saw this kind of true acting i was not expecting that in a music based movie but it is good. the movie also touches the art of a Dj makes and it amazed me to see being a Dj is not that easy as it told. so if you need a conclusion its an overall good movie to watch and also movie seemed like 10 minutes to me so go see it! you wont regret a minute.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you like EDM you will like this movie even it's only for the music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie the night it came into theaters and i must say it entartained me just the way i expected it to. It gave me about the same feeling as project x did. Yes it does not have a very complicated storyline but the acting is good and so is the filming. Now to come back to the title of this review, music makes certain parts of a movie much more intense just like "see you again" did in ff7. So did the music in we are your friends it made me feel like i was actually there and ready to party. And i think that that is what this movie is all about it should make you feel good and tell a good story and that is what it does.The movie gets a lot of hate comments from people who say DJ'ing isn't that easy and it takes a lot of talent. I personally don't think you should look a this movie that way. But I guess that's what you get when you make a movie about something everyone seems to be doing these days.I always say that every movie that gets a 6 or higher on IMDb is worth watching, and as far as i am concerned is this movie worth watching so it at least should get a 6. I should also say that this movie is much better with a very good sound system so you should see it in a cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spot on!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For years, i've been writing a movie about EDM and it's culture but I was never satisfied with it. After seeing "We Are Your Friends" I'm happy to say I can finally let go of the idea because it has been done so well in this movie, I couldn't possibly top it. I'm SUPER surprised about the reviews thus far upon it's release because this movie had it all. We follow a group of "friends"; a drug dealing actor, a hard head, a free liver and a hungry unsatisfied DJ (Zac Efron). When Cole, efron's character meets a famous DJ (Wes Bentley) he is drugged and taken under his wing to learn how to make "real" music using natural sounds instead of artificial synthesizers. I don't know the first thing about Dj'ing but I do know I was almost out of my seat at the party scene when Cole explains the science behind Dj'ing and how to move a crowd. The most moved by his music was Sophia(Emily Ratajkowski) which made for an entertaining three way love affair which was NOT overdone or harped on thought the film. When one of the friends dies, Cole unlike his other two pals decides to quit the money hungry job and stick with his passion for music. By the end he finally makes real art, reflecting himself and everyone at the festival, including Wes Bentley's character digs it. He even add libs a line during his performance that his recently departed friend said, "are we ever gonna be better than this?" And if we're talking about this film, the answer is no. It's that good. So forget the reviews and go see this movie NOW! .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Short review (awful)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is horrible ... It is an insult to producers and people who like movies. (I can say from experience as a producer). DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. It is completely useless and it just shows things that do not need to be shown. The acting is less than stellar (horrible), the plot is horrible, the "DJing" is NOT DJing and the only reason you should watch this is if you are younger than Zac Efron and consider him attractive. If you like DJ's or EDM in any way DO NOT WATCH THIS because it gives an inaccurate view of what DJ's do. Cole (the main character) says that all you need to be a DJ is a laptop, A LITTLE BIT OF TALENT, and a track and you are done. Completely untrue and poorly written. I guess it could be attractive to people who don't know anything about EDM or DJ's. Poorly written, executed, poor acting, poor knowledge from the producers and writers about THE MOVIES TOPIC and all around not watchable . The movie is also filed with bad clichés and soooo much product placement. F-----</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just got back from seeing it with my friend and we are in awe and reading these other comments make me confused on how people don't see the beauty in this film. The movie shows deeper meaning than what meets the eye, a lot of symbolism is used throughout. I have had the same favorite movie for years and this one just made it to the top! I recommend every one to see it and I'm sorry if I'm raising your expectations too much but this is my opinion and it was beautifully written and acted out. The music and cinematography is amazing and sets the whole movie perfectly. Im downloading the soundtrack while I'm typing and can't get over this amazing work!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People that write bad reviews for this movie, obviously wouldn't know a good film if it slapped them in the face :) This movie is more than about partying, EDM, or DJ-ing. It's about coming of age and things we go through in life. This movie hit home for me. I felt like I could relate to it and I feel that's what makes a great movie. Not only is the music original and awesome, the acting was great and kept me intrigued through till the end. I literally was dancing in my seat. I brought my boyfriend who isn't a huge movie go-re and he loved it as well.I give it an A++++ :-)</fullReview>
