		<shortDescription>Two forces of nature - Marilyn and Niagara Falls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beauty abounds in "Niagara," a 1953 film starring Marilyn Monroe, Joseph Cotten, and Jean Peters. There's the beauty and power of Niagara Falls, spectacularly displayed throughout the movie, and the beauty of Marilyn Monroe, who is gorgeous in Technicolor. Monroe is the unhappy wife of the unstable George Loomis, played by an appropriately seedy Joseph Cotten. It's not clear whether or not Marilyn drove him to his present state, but he's wound pretty tight. Monroe and her lover plan George's demise via the falls. Jean Peters and Max Showalter are a vacationing couple who become more involved than they want to, Peters bearing the acting burden of the film. The casting is great (although the Peters role originally was supposed to go to Anne Baxter). Peters' wholesome prettiness is in sharp contrast to Monroe's va-va-va-voom.Having grown up near the Falls, it was both interesting and enjoyable to see them featured. And, as we all know who've been there, the Canadian side, where this movie was filmed, is far more beautiful. Given today's security problems, I loved the scene where Monroe intended to walk across to the American side to avoid being questioned while in a car.I've seen candid photos of Marilyn Monroe taken around the time of filming, and she was surely at the peak of her beauty and sensuality. Though I've always felt her very careful enunciation detracted from her dramatic acting, she's very good as the cheating wife. It's funny to read occasionally that the physical standard of beauty is thinner today - her figure, like the rest of her, is fabulous, shown off in a variety of clothing by Dorothy Jeakins, who was a prominent costumer on Broadway and in film.There's really not much to the story of "Niagara." It's a standard tale of love, betrayal, and murder set against a magnificent backdrop and given spark by spirited performances. Well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific movie that does not get the attention it deserves.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The look and atmosphere in this film is so vivid that even viewed on TV it makes you feel as if you have been to Niagara Falls sometime in the early 1950s. The plot takes a deceptively leisurely pace but it builds to a gripping climax. It is worth the viewer's time &amp; effort to stick with it to the end. Marilyn Monroe is radiantly treacherous &amp; her performance is subtle and bears close watching beyond her obvious attractiveness. She should get a lot more credit for this picture than I've seen others give her. Joseph Cotten balances between being menacing &amp; getting our pity &amp; sympathy. Not all the performances are terrific but this movie is a gem that rewards the effort to stick with it to the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Color, gleaming surfaces, dark interiors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Niagara is one of those wonders who came out of the dream factory of the fifties and still manage to leave deep impressions in fresh viewers. Technically it is simply perfect: the story is like in a film noir, but Niagara is anything but «noir»! This is a true color movie with high artistic and aesthetic value. The best possible use was made of the location; it is an idealized place for honeymooners, with gleaming surfaces, gaudy colors and happy faces. The viewers see the postcard-image of the place ? it's the era of President Eisenhower, renowned for its uplifting moral integrity, right? But behind the surfaces are dark rooms, depression, madness and scheming thoughts. Innocuous facades conceal quarrels, discontent and eventually murder. And in its midst roars the waterfall, at once beautiful and menacing. The message of the movie is conveyed largely through pictures, the location not the screenplay is the story.The actors are part of the location. As far as I can remember there are hardly any close ups. Marilyn Monroe looks feverish and disturbed throughout, she elicits compassion rather than arousing sexual desires. Joseph Cotten is very good in the role of her confused and deranged husband. His mental condition seems to stem from war experiences (although in the movie this is treated as a kind of a side remark, its being mentioned is worth remembering, it happens seldom enough). To the disturbed couple are added a «normal» couple and an older, «seasoned» couple (very good, sensible performances by Lurene Tuttle and Don Wilson). The cast aptly represents the chances and pitfalls of life and human relations as behind them water flows down the river and falls over the edge.Niagara shows a highly artistic approach to a specific place and uses symbols in the way of earlier black and white movies. I can highly recommend it to everyone. It is a pity that the potential of the technical means of this kind of widescreen color movies was not explored further in that direction, creating a direct link between the style of film noir and that of «film couleur». The wet asphalt in the early morning light is just unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atmospheric thriller set in breathtaking surroundings.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I think Marilyn Monroe suited comedies better, this somewhat hitchcockian thriller is nevertheless a convincing demonstration of her more serious acting abilities, and also one of the finest films she starred in."Niagara" introduces Monroe as a seductive, wily wife wanting to get rid of her jealous husband (a very good Joseph Cotten). Her lover, an awfully small and stereotypical role, is played by Richard Allan.Funnily enough, it seems that it's Jean Peters who has the film's biggest part. As the innocent honeymooner, her character is clearly designed as a contrast to Monroe. The breathtaking surroundings of the Niagara Falls are a significant supplement to the film's atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular views of the Falls and Marilyn...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marilyn Monroe in one of her earlier roles showed she had promise as a dramatic actress that was never fully realized on screen. We all know she was fine in comedies but she acquits herself well in the role of a young wife anxious to rid herself of her jealous, mentally unstable husband (Joseph Cotten) and plots with her lover to do so. The lovers are spotted by another honeymooner (Jean Peters) who is drawn into the plot by circumstances beyond her control.Jean Peters is excellent as "the other woman", smart and strong-willed and able to cope with the unstable husband when she has to. Joseph Cotten by this time had played several stressed, shell-shocked veterans and does his usual fine job here. Marilyn is garbed in her most revealing wardrobe and makes the sluttish housewife a real and pitiful being by the time she confronts her husband in the bell tower.Atmospheric film noir type of story is well photographed for maximum effect among the famous Falls. With swirling mists, choppy waters, bell tower ringing ominously, and murderous intent--it's makes an absorbing, fast-moving melodrama that is chillingly effective and at the same time enjoyable to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Cotten and sexy Monroe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joseph Cotten was an outstanding actor whose talents have been terribly under-appreciated. He is great in this movie as an abusive husband. The very sexy Marilyn Monroe is his wife, who is having an affair with another man. They meet a pair of young newlyweds on their honeymoon. Max Showalter as the young husband is one of the most annoying characters I've ever seen. Jean Peters as his bride does the unthinkable, managing to look almost as beautiful as Marilyn herself.This is a suspenseful and entertaining movie, which makes great use of the scenery surrounding Niagara Falls.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Noir Goes Over The Falls: Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:I adore Film Noir, as huge as my collection is, I just threw this away. Sadly, Showalter and Monroe the one two punch of awful. Showalter ruined two other Noirs; he is like that neighbor next door that sells insurance that only comes when you are really busy. You keep trying to get rid of him and he doesn't take a hint. The most annoying actor of the 50s with that eternal highly medicated happiness only found in the severely brain damaged. Look, Marilyn was gorgeous but she could never act. The only good shot is from behind of her walking away; whenever Marilyn speaks it is painful. Billy Wilder said it took hundreds of takes to get one passable scene out of her in Some Like It Hot. Can you tell here? The movie is a disaster. Monroe and Showalter stink it up big time. It is so slow with lots of shots of the falls; yes, they are pretty we get it, move on, could we? It starts so slowly with Cotton being set up by a slinky, bad acting bimbo, forgive me. She is so awful here; Hathaway must not have had the patience Wilder had. The first half an hour nothing happens; when we finally get to the murder of Marilyn's lover, it is off camera, like the film needed more boredom. The Canadian detective is more wooden than a redwood, like Mr. Spock, the Canadian years, awful. Cotten is fine, he gives his usual great acting performance but he is surrounded by bad actors and the script goes nowhere slowly. After Cotton kills Marilyn's lover, he stalks her half heartedly, finally kills her then goes back to apologize to her after she is dead. How weird is that? This is the script; do not believe the raving reviews. I have a huge collection of Noirs, I just cannot have it in my collection. Showalter is so bad even worse than Marilyn who at least you can stare at; the worst actor in the 50s. The script has Cotten stealing a boat without checking how much gas is in it; the most improbable events occur next. I cannot tell you how bad this is, boring, poorly acted and the writing is even worse. Sorry Marilyn fans, Wilder got good performances out of her in Some Like It Hot and Asphalt Jungle; she is just awful here. She has a habit of over-expressing with her eyebrows that is unintentionally comic. A Dreadful Attempt At Noir</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marilyn: a fountain of charm, and a cyclone of beauty!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood's glamor doll, Marilyn Monroe, was blonde and beautiful... We heard her speak in that tiny tinkle voice...She was our angel, the sweet angel of sex, and the sugar of sex came up from her like a resonance of sound in the clearest grain of a violin... She was a perfect creation reached to the horizon of our mind, a fountain of charm, a cyclone of beauty, a sexual oven whose fire may rarely have been lit..."Niagara" is her first starring films and she was a presence in it... She knew how to enter every scene with the full aura of an out man-killer wearing suits fitted so tightly as to make every walk a miracle...She gives a twisting and winding performance... A 'veiled look' would come into her eyes when thinking of her adulterous lover that makes the audience hate her while admiring every possible curve revealing her tight dresses, caught with excellent taste by Hathaway... She was more vivid with commitment, just interesting enough to be fascinating... Even her wiggle walks down a long street in a beige-colored suit (a modern miracle of the designer's art) were highly seductive...The film makes full use of the breathtaking locations as of the grandeur of Marilyn... She plays a sexy wife plotting to murder her obsessed husband... We must admit that the scenic effects (a natural wonder of beauty and majesty), superbly photographed in Technicolor, are the main attraction... Nevertheless the intriguing murder mystery heightens the drama making it a strong combination of menace ... Joseph Cotten's intelligent face and resonant voice are used effectively in this tale of infidelity and greed... Comedy relief, from the happy honeymooners, Casy Adams and Jean Peters with these lines: "Why don't you ever get a dress like that?"//"Well, she sure got her an armful of groceries."We hear Marilyn singing only one song (too important in the plot) called "Kiss" - a song enough to turn her husband crazy...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots To Look At And Admire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The great scenery and colors of Niagara Falls, two very attractive female leads, and an interesting story all add up to a very good rating for this classic film. The DVD offers a very nice print: sharp, with color restoration that makes it look great. Niagara Falls never looked better (and I live just 25 miles away), and either did Marilyn Monroe or Jean Peters.Everyone knows about Monroe's beauty (and, I think, underrated acting talents) but Peters was a beautiful woman with a great body, herself. She apparently fascinated billionaire Howard Hughes, too, since he married her.) It's the men in here who are goofy: Cotten and his whining and mental illness; Casey Adams with his nerd-ish personality and Adams' boss Don Wilson, who is even more of a cornball.This crime story is a suspenseful film with several twists and turns and segments that keep you on the edge of your seat. It's film noir material even though it's color which might disqualify it for some purists.The only weak points of the story were some very implausible circumstances (i.e. Peters going into Joseph Cotten's room right after he acted crazy and was someone obviously to leave alone; having a boat "hijacked" in plain daylight, etc.)As someone who has lived in Western New York for almost 60 years, it was interesting to see the aerial shots on the Canadian side and see the skyline of Niagara Falls and, in the distance, Buffalo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, Engaging Hitchcockian Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented "Niagara" for two reasons: one, the obvious reason to see Marilyn Monroe in such a unique role for her, and two, I always liked the idea of a side character (in this case, Jean Peters) getting inadvertently swept up in the intrigue of the main characters (Monroe and Joseph Cotten here). It's rare that the supporting characters of a film are integrated so well into the plot. Usually, they disappear or are seen less of as the plot progresses. (eg: the inexorable quirky friend of a leading lady in far too many thrillers) But I digress.The plot is fairly simple, or so it seems. Polly and Ray Cutler (Peters and Max Showalter) are a young couple heading to Niagara Falls for a delayed honeymoon. Upon their arrival, they meet Rose and George Loomis (Monroe and Cotten), who are over-staying in their time in the Cutlers reserved cabin. Though Polly and Ray agree to stay in a nearby cabin, that is not the last they see of the Loomis's, a strange couple indeed. One day, Polly sees Rose passionately kissing another man (Richard Allan). Then, the sly Rose angers her husband by playing a seemingly reminiscent song on a record player a few other couples are dancing to, pushing George to destroying the record in his hands. It becomes apparent that something far more than infidelity is going on, and without giving away too many of the plot twists, murder ensues.One of the things I really loved about this movie was how timeless it was. The actors, or at least Monroe and Cotten, may be familiar actors of the time, but this movie could be done at any time, and seem appropriate. And speaking of actors, the acting in this movie, for the most part anyway, is wonderful. Monroe, needless to say, was flawless, and I loved every second she was on the screen. Joseph Cotten, as he did in Hitchcock's "Shadow of a Doubt," has the ability of being very intimidating, almost brooding, and was terrific. Jean Peters gives an Oscar-worthy performance. She's very realistic, and impeccably likable. She manages to almost steal the movie from Monroe. I'm sorry to say Max Showalter was, well, really quite flat. The worst of the lot. Good thing he wasn't in a large role, though he still is one of the stars of the film. In supporting roles, Denis O'Dea gave a typical detective role as Inspector Sharkey, popping in once in a while. Richard Allan had little to do as Rose's lover Patrick. Showing up later in the film were Don Wilson and Lurene Tuttle as Ray's boss and the boss's wife, at Niagara Falls to vacation with the Cutlers. Both were excellent, though their roles were somewhat small. I liked the addition of their characters. The chemistry between all the characters is terrific, particularly in the scene where Polly is bandaging George's hand after he breaks the record. The two of them have many scenes together, and I loved how Peters and Cotten interacted with one another. Showalter seemed consistently nervous around Monroe, while on the topic of spouse-switching, so to speak.Overall, "Niagara" is very engaging. There is a good deal of action, especially towards the end. The chase scene through the bell tower was suspenseful, and the climax on the falls was absolutely wonderful. Polly proved herself to be very tough and a quick-thinker, and, throughout the rest of the movie, I liked how she didn't turn to Ray every time a problem arose. (Which made the final confronation between only her and the other character so much fun, because no one could save Polly but herself.) I think that's why I liked her character so much. Though, one thing to note, is the sort of silly-looking moment during the scene towards the end of the movie when George is pursuing Polly along the Falls (muted besides the sound of rushing water) and she slips and breaks through the wooden banister. It was a startling scene (I honestly thought she'd fall) but sort of funny, the way the movie sped up quickly to make it look to sudden. Oh well, blame it on technical abilities.I definitely recommend this film, not just for Hitchcock fans and Monroe fans, but for anyone, even if you don't like older films. This one is a classic, but at the same time, feels as if it could have been made only twenty years ago, not almost fifty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Works Pretty Well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This works pretty well, especially when you consider that for it to be effective, Marilyn Monroe had to do some actual acting. The story is fairly simple, without too many surprises, yet it's effective, and leads to some good suspense. The setting in Niagara Falls is worked into the story in several ways, and is used to good effect.The film-noir type story makes an interesting contrast with the sights and sounds of the falls, with the grim story playing out against a backdrop of interesting and often beautiful scenery. The plot also makes good use of several of the distinctive features of the falls and the surrounding town. Monroe works as the bored, scheming wife, and Joseph Cotten is always effective in this kind of role. Jean Peters is really good as the innocent friend. Casey Adams's character comes off as kind of a goofus, but that's what he is supposed to be. Things move along at a good pace, and the tension is built up well. There's a lot to like for anyone who enjoys suspense/thrillers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a formulaic Hollywood endeavour in the 1950s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Film-Noir shot in Technicolor and stars Marilyn Monroe as the femme fatale, NIAGARA kick-starts a banner year for Monroe in 1953, with two even bigger splashes following in the same year, GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES and HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE, she would become one of the most bankable actress of her time, a sex symbol, an eternal icon.The phenomenal Niagara Falls are maximally deployed through director Henry Hathaway's (TRUE GRIT 1969) efforts, the awe-inspiring scenery, not merely serves as a locale in the film, where our protagonists, two couple, George and Rose Loomis (Cotten and Monroe) and Ray and Polly Cutler (Showalter and Peters) frequently visit (where an off-screen murder takes place), but also functions as a metaphor of George's final doom (from the opening scenes) and a perfect template for the final engaging cliff-hanger.The story is not as convoluted as other film-noir exemplars, Rose is determined to get rid of her jaded husband George, so she plots with her young lover Patrick (Allan) to dispatch him and make it look like an accident near the Falls. While Ray and Polly are wide-eyed honeymooners involved with the plan by happenstance. Rose's plan goes awry with a twist of revealing who is the one being murdered? Thanks to a lame plot-hole which allows the survivor to send the same signal to confuse our comprehension. Only within 5 minutes, the truth will reveal itself, and the film changes its orbit to a standard thriller with a vengeful heart, finally, a man must pay the price of killing the woman he loves.It is interesting for viewers to buy the prerequisite that Monroe plays a heartless schemer, well, she pulls off a certain degree of credibility in the course, which is poles apart from her most well-known screen image, yet, we haven't seen too much wit in her murder plan, neither is her prowess in choosing a right muscle to accomplish the job. When the scale being tipped, she fits more dutifully in the victim niche, where she runs away from a man who is resolute in taking her life. Albeit an unsatisfactory character-building, Monroe takes on every opportunity to parade her appeal, a deadly poison will lead any man to his ruination. When she hums the enchanting theme song KISS (written by Lionel Newman and Haven Gillespie), no man can resist that tantalisation.Jean Peters, is set as the antithetical good girl against Monroe's dangerous attraction, a beauty with no thorns, demure, warmhearted and courageous, a perfect wife (as Howard Hughes would prove that) marries to a rather unappealing man Ray, who is gregarious but wanting any personalities. As if the picture was sending a double-standard message: for a man, even you are as ordinary as Ray, you still can marry a girl like Polly, while, for a woman as gorgeous as Polly, you should settle for a man like Ray, he is a complete dull but at least he is bankable. That leaves a bitter taste, the so-called Hollywood-ian brainwashing of gender inequality.Otherwise, it is an acceptable flick, the vision of the Falls alone can be pleasantly overwhelming, in addition to Monroe's unique magnetism, although a stroke of bathos is rendered charmlessly when she is no longer in the picture. When the boat weighs anchor, its destination is predestined, so is the life or death payoff of the two characters aboard, a formulaic endeavour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marilyn Monroe's Walk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slightly psychotic Joseph Cotten (as George Loomis) shares a Niagara Falls honeymoon cabin with luscious Marilyn Monroe (as Rose Loomis); but, he fears she is tramping around. Indeed, Ms. Monroe is sneaking out to swap spit with hunky Richard Allan (as Ted Patrick). The two are plotting to kill Mr. Cotten, but he has other plans. Complicating matters are the couple next door, Jean Peters and Max "Casey Adams" Showalter (as Polly and Ray Cutler). The two non-newlywed couples become involved in life or death struggles with both passion, and the elements? The four leading players have a lot of individual "chemistry", but do not really mix well, on screen; and, their uninteresting characters lack depth. The swing in Monroe's backyard provides Niagara Falls with stiff competition for attention - and, both overpower the story. Still, the movie has something to offer. Both Monroe and "Niagara" are lavish and lovely, as colorfully photographed by Joe MacDonald and directed by Henry Hathaway. With her next two films, Monroe found her way as an actress, and ended 1953 as "Quigley Publications" #1 female draw at the box office.****** Niagara (1/21/53) Henry Hathaway ~ Marilyn Monroe, Joseph Cotten, Jean Peters</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thriller at the Falls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Henry Hathaway and shot on location in Niagara Falls, this film noir features Marilyn Monroe giving a fine dramatic performance alongside the stellar Joseph Cotten, who is the brooding husband suffering from "battle fatigue". The other couple are Casey Adams, a gee-whiz guy on his honeymoon, and Jean Peters, who becomes entangled in the conflict between the two main characters - Cotten and Monroe.The sounds of the Falls, the fast-flowing Niagara River, the mists and rainbows give a strong sense of location to the film. Setting a thriller in Niagara Falls is a project that would titillate many an ambitious director and Henry Hathaway deserves full credit for pulling it off.As with film noir, there are victims and survivors and much tension leading up to a climax that makes maximum use of the location.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A steamily melodramatic Noir film with an unforgettable role by Marilyn Monroe and gorgeous scenarios</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thrilling and intriguing film in which the high water mark in suspense . For sheer power , for sheer magnetism , the show Marilyn Monroe puts on is as electric and as spectacular as Niagara itself . As two couples are visiting Niagara Falls , as Rose (Marilyn Monroe's walk across some cobblestones holds the record for the longest walk in cinema history - 116 feet of film) and George Loomis (Joseph Cotten as a mentally disturbed war veteran) are vacationing in a bungalow at Niagara Falls. Their relationship is getting worse and worse , as she is a sexpot honeymooner scheming to murder his husband . They met the Cuttlers, spending a late honeymoon in the next bungalow . By accident, Polly Cuttler (Jean Peters got the role of Polly Cutler after Anne Baxter withdrew ; after her withdrawal, the film was reworked to highlight Marilyn Monroe) is aware that Rose has a lover , and tensions between one spouse and her husband reach the level of killing .Suspense/thriller film dealing with two couples vacationing at famous location called Nigara Falls . Tension from the opening game going on until ending and never lets up , being for Noir genre aficionados . This is a tremendously exciting story of a heartless , lusting bitch and his dark plans along with a happy marriage who take a late holiday and become involved into a twisted scheme . It begins as a slow-moving intrigue but follows to surprise us with dark characters , strong supporting work , solid plot and in suspenseful style . Director Hathaway demonstrates his skills to heighten narrative tension and shoot suspense so exhilarating it made adrenalin run . Here he directs efficiently Marilyn and with strong screen presence by Joseph Cotten and Jean Peters . Marilyn Monroe is awesome in a bombshell role , she is a raging torrent of emotion that even nature can't control . Even though she had a starring role , Marilyn Monroe as a mean Femme Fatale , was still under contract to 20th Century-Fox as a stock actor at a fixed salary, so she actually made less money than her make-up man did . Glamorously photographed in glimmer Technicolor by Joseph MacDonald showing breathtaking outdoors from Niagara Falls . This well-paced in cracking style flick was well written and produced by Charles Brackett ; being compellingly directed by Henry Hathaway , here he usually works very well , taking a firm grip on the emotion and suspense . Hathaway himself was only even nominated for an Oscar , but his movies themselves are testimony his ability on suspense , drama and action . He does the human touch and full of insight that accompanied him during most of his films and the story develops pleasantly in a large frame with an interesting plot and fully adjusted to the requirements of the action . Hathaway had a reputation as being difficult on actors, but some stars as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe benefited under his direction , such as ¨Niagara¨. Henry was a craftsman who had a long career from the 30s with successful films , and especially Westerns , as ¨Brigham Young¨ and ¨Raw Hide¨ . In his 60s Hathaway still got the vigour to make some fiery movies as ¨From Hell to Texas¨, ¨How the West was won¨, ¨Nevada Smith¨, and ¨Shoot out¨ . He was an expert on Western genre as he proved in ¨True grit¨ , ¨Five card stud¨ , ¨Nevada Smith¨ ,¨How the West was won¨ , ¨Rawhide¨ , ¨Brigham Young¨ , ¨Buffalo Stampede¨, ¨Garden of evil¨ and ¨The sons of Katie Elder¨. ¨Niagara¨ rating : Very good Noir film that will appeal to Marilyn Monroe and Joseph Cotten fans . Worthwatching for Hathaway's superbly crafted realization and sensational exteriors .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More To Niagara Than The Falls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like watching Niagara because it gives one a chance to see the place before it became a mini Las Vegas. No doubt that legalized gambling on the Canadian side has certainly given the place a prosperity it hadn't known before when it was just dependent on honeymoon tourism. Still both sides have a quaint look that sad to say is gone forever.If the town has changed, Marilyn Monroe and one of the great natural wonders of the world remain the same. Marilyn is half of two couples vacationing at the Falls. Marilyn and Joseph Cotten are trying to regain some romance, at least that's Cotten's intention. In the meantime Casey Adams and Jean Peters have won a trip there from his company because he thought up a prize winning ad campaign to sell the breakfast cereal he works for.Fate brings these two couples together, one a happy couple and one a most unhappy one. It seems that Marilyn has a whole other agenda involving Cotten and Peters becomes innocently involved when Marilyn's plan doesn't work.If you remember how in Duel In The Sun Cotten and his brother Gregory Peck were both involved in competition for sex kitten Jennifer Jones. In Niagara, Cotten has won the sex kitten, the sexiest woman of the Fifties some say and it's certainly not brought him any happiness. His portrayal of a beaten man, married to a tramp ranks as some of his best work.As for Marilyn Monroe, Darryl Zanuck brought her along quite carefully and she certainly attracted attention in All About Eve and The Asphalt Jungle. But no doubt that her role as the hard hearted stone goddess married to Joseph Cotten was her breakout role. There was nothing but star parts for her after this.So for a chance to see an unglitzed Niagara Falls and the statuesque beauty that was Marilyn Monroe, don't miss Niagara.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a good movie for Monroe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised to see how positive the reviews for this movie were.There is some entertainment value here. The Niagara scenes are pleasant and the plot is good enough to provide interest. And seeing the early Monroe and how the gimmicky exploitation of her sexuality is used in the context of the sexual standards of the time was interesting.But by modern standards this is a poor movie. As has been noted in several of the posts above Max Showalter's portrayal of Jean Peters husband and Monroe's performance are weird over the top performances which would be more appropriate in a comedy, but here they are juxtaposed with serious performances by Cotton and Peters and the result is not a good mix. And also as noted in some of the previous posts and by my fifteen year old daughter who watched the film for the first time tonight the addition of the Don Wilson character was unnecessary and just adds one more clownish performance to what seems to be an attempt to make a serious movie.Monroe was deservedly an Icon. But real success for Monroe would come from movies designed to take advantage of her skills instead of putting her in movies like this where her particular skills don't contribute to the movie except for the entertainment value added by watching the Monroe character.I think the original casting of the movie with Bancroft and Jean Peters might have greatly improved this film although, the long term commercial value of the film obviously would have been much less without Monroe in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Niagara (1953)"Well she sure got herself an armful of groceries."If there as any noir film that holds it noir gloom even though shot largely in daylight, not in a city, and in vivid color, Niagara is it. There are a handful of color noir films, not including some from the 1970s and later that get swept into the category in an expansive but not always helpful way (Chinatown, for one). But this is the real deal, and it's not a perfect film by any means, but it's also a neglected movie, valuable for it's unique feel, for the terrific night scenes it does have, and for the Niagara Falls, which Hitchcock was probably jealous of. There are lots of Hitchcock parallels--famous landmark for a setting, stereotypes played both ways, calm before the disaster, undisguised back projection and its confession of open artifice, innocents caught in a murderous world--but it it's better to see what this movie has on its own terms.One thing Niagara has is Marilyn Monroe playing Rose Loomis. Monroe the actress is forced (or reinforced) into her recurring role as helpless siren, but she also shows off as the actress she always was, not brilliant, but very effective and smart. The disdain she has in a momentary sneer as she rolls over the second time in bed in her first scene is the first of a thousand good examples--listen to her in the shower backlit, or watch her at the souvenir shop, or on the phone. With a number of adjustments, her role here could have created a paradigm for the two-faced femme-fatale in the 1950s--her coy chill, her thinly disguised greed, her human failings. We never mind sympathizing with a criminal when she is going down at the end if she has earlier shown her complexity and vulnerability. Joseph Cotten is a problem. He's a terrific actor, but he's not the most beguiling of lead men, nor the sexiest. Wells probably had him figured out best in Citizen Kane and The Magnificent Ambersons, and Hitchcock used him beautifully in Shadow of a Doubt, all three movies from a decade earlier. Cukor didn't utilize Cotten's innate likability very well in Gaslight but he tried. Here, Hathaway doesn't really have charm as an option, because Cotten's role as George Loomis is endlessly miserable and self-pitying. Playing against his grain leaves us a little uncomfortable, and the film a little awkward.As usual with films of this type, there are small things that loom large. After getting soaked on purpose in the spray of the falls at the start of the film (and announcing his desire to find his independence), Cotten, as George Loomis, steps to one side to avoid the spray of a little sprinkler along the sidewalk. There is something here about a man who is making choices, who wants his life to be big but little things are getting in the way. The outdoor dancing scene is an idealized but really delicious view of "youth culture" as the big band era is about to shift to all out rock and roll (remember, it's 1952 when filmed). Monroe even gets to sing a little, and though the camera goes too static here (and elsewhere), the color and dramatic lighting compensate.If there is one thing that drags the film down it's the clumsy script by Charles Brackett, who has some great scripts to his credit. This one is not only badly written in spots, but also improbable in several key scenes. Singlehandedly, it keeps Niagara falling. Right behind is the hyperbolic acting of the other male lead, the cheery Casey Adams playing the painfully sexist Ray Cutler. It's tough to watch (though even more excessive is the barrel of laughs in Don Wilson playing a goofy executive), and so you wait it out and gather up the plot. Jean Peters playing the good, well adjusted Polly Cutler is at first a small cliché, but her role grows, and grows on you, so by the dramatic end you are "stuck on her" the way she says Cotten is stuck on Monroe, and she makes up for a lot slack elsewhere. The contrast of the two couples--the Monroe/Cotten dysfunctional disaster waiting to happen and the too perfect cheery Adams/Peters pair--is at the serious core to the movie. The high drama, taking place as both a murder gone wrong and as the falls itself, with its scenery and fabulous tourist machinery, hooks us all along, capping it with the final sweep down the river toward the falls (and over it). Cotten warns earlier in the movie's key metaphoric speech. "Let me tell you something. You're young, you're in love. Well I'll give you a warning. Don't let it get out of hand like those falls out there. Up above, did you ever see the river up above the falls? It's calm and easy. You throw in a log it just floats around. Let it move a little further down and it get going fast. It hits some rocks and, in a minute it's in the lower rapids, and nothing in the world including God himself I suppose can keep it from going over the edge. It just goes."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sensual, unforgettable Monroe. Made her a star.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best projects Marilyn was associated with. I didn't like Niagara the first time i saw it, because i thought Marilyn was only good for comedy. But this role as the sensual, unfaithful wife of Joseph Cotton's (superbly performed) troubled war veteran is one of her most memorable roles. Pleanty of indelible Marilyn images come from here: Marilyn lying seemingly naked with legs apart under bed in hotel room, purple dress standing against cabin in grammophone scene, and the entire grammophone scene. Pleanty of location shooting made good use of the beautiful location, and the motif of the song the lovers sing to each other is a beautiful touch. The suspense develops well, but i suppose it depends on what you're expecting. I found it a great sensual thriller, but this movie lives and dies with Monroe. She is captivating in every scene, and looks stunning. The belltower climax of the movie is very fine indeed, one of the best scenes she ever played in. Nods to director Hathaway for camera placement in this scene.Best line:(Monroe has just done a sensual walk to the grammophone and had them put it on, then had a virtual standing orgasm listening to it, and spent an entire minute of close-up singing along to it, and the happy-go-lucky honeymooner character says to her)Honeymooner: You seem to really like this song, Mrs Loomis."Marilyn: "There isn't any other song," she says. But its all in her face - it always was. One of the best moments in her career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Natural Scenery Is Terrific</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Certainly, Niagara Falls provides some spectacular images. And the sound of huge amounts of water hurling over the edge amplifies the majesty of the natural scenery. But the script's story seems uninspired.A discordant couple: George Loomis (Joseph Cotten), and his wife, Rose (Marilyn Monroe), are staying at a tourist lodge near the falls. The two do not get along. Rose has a younger suitor on the sly. Meanwhile, another lodge couple unintentionally become involved in George and Rose's situation.The story is rather simple. But important events take place off-camera. These plot omissions may result in some confusion as to what is going on.A big problem in this film is the miscasting. That Marilyn Monroe would marry someone as old and thoroughly unpleasant as the Joseph Cotten character is not credible. Yet, with a more appropriate partner, the film's plot, as is, would not work. Either the script's plot needed to be rewritten, or actors other than Monroe and Cotten should have been cast.Further, there's not much back-story here. If we had known a little more about Rose and her husband, maybe we could better identify with them. As is, it's hard to get interested in their marital problems. Both the plot and the characters needed a little more development.Characters spend a lot of time walking around: up and down stairs, on sidewalks, along wooden bridges. Some of this no doubt is deliberate to showcase Monroe's curvy figure. But there are times when all that walking around comes across as plot filler.The Ray Cutler character (Max Showalter) is an irritating person. I think the problem, again, is in the script characterization. The film's ending has some good suspense, though it's the result of a contrived plot point.The outdoor visuals are by far the best element of this film. I would not have minded if the director had thrown the film's script over the falls, and just given us a tour of that magnificent natural wonder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" He Forgot To Ask Marilyn For Her Autograph "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a predilection for this Marilyn Monroe film noir movie. Being filmed on location on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls, the studio hired local actors, carpenters, etc, to work for them. My father knew a sign painter who made the required signs needed. Being aware that the new sensational blonde star would soon show-up, he was extremely surprised when being introduced to a very demure, polite and genuinely sweet young girl, not the stuck-up, demanding big Hollywood star he had anticipated. He was so taken aback by her loveliness, he completely forgot to ask for an autograph. The film itself is a lovely snapshot of the 1950s and the Niagara Falls area is captured gloriously in Technicolor. The acting is adequate for this dark suspenseful story about a honeymoon couple becoming mixed up with a woman planning on murdering her obsessive husband, and the film utilizes it's location very well. Veteran actor Joseph Cotten plays Monroe's neurotic husband, Jean Peters and Casey Adams play the young honeymooners. The highlight of course is Marilyn Monroe and she delivers a fine performance as the cheating, murderous wife. This is a very interesting early Monroe movie, well worth a look for the nostalgic feel of a past era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of those slight films that is nice to look at. MARILYN MONROE and Joseph COTTON are a dysfunctional couple and things get complicated when they run into a happy all American couple (the lovely JEAN PETERS and well er ..... MAX SHOWALTER :) ) at a hotel beside the Niagara falls. The homely PETERS and SHOWALTER are a nice foil to the wild MONROE and COTTON.MONROE's voluptuous and bovine body is overemphasized. The makers tried too hard to make her a femme fatale. She is too hammy and in the process I ended up liking PETERS who was more natural. Frankly, PETERS and COTTON made this film watchable. I don't know what was the deal with SHOWALTER. This guy should not have been allowed to act after 1949. Hohoho! Frankly, there should have been a law against fruity guys like SHOWALTER appearing in crime thrillers :) .We get a good look around and of the Niagara falls. There is too much light in many of the scenes and this sort of cinematography is probably not perfect for a dark thriller like NIAGARA. There is some half-baked dialog in the beginning about the NIAGARA falls and freedom. But none of the characters are that well developed. PETERS character was way too one dimensional. Her interactions with COTTON were too platonic.The film never really rises above a certain level. I did not find it to be too suspenseful. But still a decent watch because of the Technicolor visuals and the fact that it is only around 80 minutes long.(6/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Exotic Milieus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Niagara is a post-noir film directed by the Hollywood director, famous for his westerns, Henry Hathaway. The film stars the biggest star of Hollywood, Marilyn Monroe with the talented Joseph Cotten - co-starring Jean Peters who starred in another film-noir at the same year, Pickup on South Street by Samuel Fuller. Niagara is a very interesting film, for many reasons; it might just be Marilyn's greatest performance and the most different one. It's also quite odd to see a film-noir by a 'western' director and Niagara might just be, if not the first, one of the first film-noirs in color.Film-noir is one of the most controversial issues in the history of cinema. Some state it's a genre of its own, for some it's a sub genre, a movement or just a word to describe a certain era (40's) or style of cinematography and narrative. The very first film-noir was made in 1940 Stranger of the 3rd Floor by Boris Ingster starring Peter Lorre. Film-noir was a very short-term era of cinema, it's usually considered to have lasted one decade the 40's. But obviously they still kept making them in the early 50's; Billy Wilder's Sunset Blvd. (1950), Samuel Fuller's Pickup on South Street (1953), Alfred Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train (1951) and Orson Welles' Touch of Evil (1958). Niagara most certainly is not a genre-film, it's not pure film-noir and that's why I'd like to categorize it as post-noir. But it does too have some of the common features of noir; femme fatale, moral complexity, stripes of shadows and exotic milieus.Film-noirs were usually in black-and-white, only a few people dared to shoot them in color. The expressionistic cinematography brilliantly achieved the cynicism and dark atmosphere. But I think that Niagara quite well succeed in the expressionistic style - the murder scene is the greatest example. Expressionism in cinema is usually considered to be black-and-white, but it can just as easily be in color - as Roger Corman has proved in The Masque of Red Death (1964).The plot of Niagara is very easy and typical for its genre. A crooked woman is planning to get rid of her husband in hope of a better man. When she becomes acquainted with a recently married couple, things start getting mixed up. The role of the femme fatale was a very untypical one for Marilyn. Today she is most well known for her silly, cute, naive blonde roles (Some Like It Hot, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, How to Marry a Millionaire etc.) but in Niagara she plays this immoral, scheming, evil woman - the typical film-noir femme fatale! I thought Niagara was a very good film. It's a post-noir, romantic adventure thriller. It doesn't have much depth in it, but it works very well as an entertaining film. For all of us interested into the history of cinema Niagara is of course also a treat. It's a landmark in Marilyn Monroe's career, an interesting choice for Hathaway and a different kind of post-noir. The landscapes of Niagara are breathtaking and the scenes shot near the falls are gorgeous - it adds a documentary-like emotion to the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>more tragic melodrama than film-noir, but when it's good it crackles with classic cinematic moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Niagra is set against the backdrop of the obvious: lots of waterfalls, sometimes with it being pretty (rainbows and at night the light purple coloring over the waterfalls), and other times the danger of the rapids, and at the campground nearby where one married couple is newlywed and very happy, and the other... not so much. It's a tale of greed-sex-murder, and in cool 50's Technicolor (the Fox DVD does a great job restoring it to the point that it almost looks like it could have been shot yesterday), and with a couple of great performances. I say a 'couple' since not all of the acting is great here, and there is some predictability when it comes up in the final reel. But for the most part, director Henry Hathaway keeps the suspense fired up and the characterizations strong from Brackett and company's screenplay.Immediately one has to flash to Marilyn Monroe since she has top billing and is the star of the film. When she first appears she's under covers in bed (presumably actually nude), and when she struts out in the night in a tight dress and buzzes along to a romantic diddy on the record player, it's about as sexy as they come. She has real screen presence, but when called upon, as here in a few key scenes, she can act as well. This is good since her co-star, Joseph Cotten, is one of the best actors of his time period, and is (frankly) given a deeper character with George than Monroe with Rose, since he's the one that's been duped by the philanders ex-waitress wife of his, and who plots George's murder with her lover. George isn't really a bad guy, just mixed up, and when he becomes the 'villain' of the story in the last act, desperate as he is to get away from everything, we feel sorry for him. Yet, the look on Rose's face when she sees the corpse at the morgue is priceless.The two leads are fantastic together, whether sharing the screen or not, and Hathaway's direction is crisp and clear and with some psychological edge, such as the stairway sequence where George catches up to Rose and chases her up a stairwell up to the bell-tower Rose asked her lover to chime when the "deed" was done at the waterfall (watch those cutaways to the bells, not ringing, just standing still). But the film is a little hampered by its supporting players. Jean Peters is good- albeit better in Pickup on South Street, she still carries her own ground when she needs to- but other actors like Showalter and O'Dea are less successful here with thinner characters. Whenever the 'happy' married couple was on screen I wanted it to get back to George and Rose, who are infinitely more interesting as a tragic color-noir couple on the edge.It's certainly a must if you're a fan of the stars, or for those few who follow whatever Henry Hathaway did in his career, and it's got some amazing cinematography (not just the waterfalls but little things, like when Rose is looking out at George from his window and then closes the blinds, herself in mostly darkness). No masterpiece, but definitely worth your hour and a half.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heading for a Fall(s)...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Entertaining, watchable Technicolour noir showcasing the emergent Marilyn Monroe alongside dependable Joseph Cotton against the spectacular backdrop of Niagara Falls, an obvious metaphor for the teeming passions at play here.As I've said before on these pages, I do prefer my noir black, as it were, but the lurid Technicolour employed by director Hathaway was probably justified to highlight the natural wonder that is Niagara Falls as well as Ms Monroe's scarlet-coloured lipstick. The noir trademarks are pretty much all in there somewhere, not only most obviously in the plotting, very sub - "The Postman Always Rings Twice" and "Double Indemnity" to name the two most obvious predecessors of a sensual, alluring bored wife using her younger lover to bump off her older, besotted husband, but we also get plenty of mirror-reflection shots and shots against the background slats of window blinds and extravagant long-perspective shots of the "little people" here playing out their rather sordid little lives in the bigger world.The film starts with Cotton's Loomis character, a Korean vet with a can't-believe-his-luck "trophy-wife" in the form of the long-since disenchanted but still highly-charged form of Monroe, moping his ill-fortune by the falls before returning to the awakening Monroe, heavily made-up even in bed. In fact these early images of Monroe, firstly obviously naked under the sheets and a little later putting on her stockings tell us all we need to know about her character - in their few reluctant embraces you can almost imagine her looking at her watch a la Jane Fonda in the much later Klute.The plot then sees the introduction of a bright pair of delayed but still loved-up honeymooners here for the Niagara experience but whose paths, particularly Jean Peters as the young wife cross fatefully with the warring Loomises.Director Hathaway keeps the plot moving and the exterior work highlighting the Falls are a rare treat, especially for the likes of myself who got to visit Niagara only a few years ago. He delivers two particularly effective scenes - Monroe's sexually-charged gramophone scene in the candiest-pink of dresses and later her demise in long-shot on the stairs of the carillon tower, whose eerie bell-ringing throughout adds a further disquieting dimension to proceedings. he big climax on the Falls was coming from a mile off and isn't altogether convincing in its depiction but there's no denying Cotton &amp; Peters earned any "dirty money" bonus for getting good and soaked on-set.Which takes us to the acting. Monroe certainly makes a big impact with her striking beauty with clothing to match, but she does often act as if she's just finished an "Actor's Studio" class and looks at times like Betty Boop made flesh teetering around on high heels, almost bursting out of her clothes. Her lips almost never cover her teeth throughout so that she seems to be forever pouting. Better is old man Cotton, who superbly projects his hopeless dependence on his young wife even as he is blind to her extra-marital infidelities. Of the young honeymooners, Max Showalters is altogether too college-boy gauche and lightweight as the boss' pet but Jean Peters is very good indeed as his young wife embroiled against her will in the machinations of both the murderous plots of the warring Loomises.On the whole a well-turned little thriller, perhaps lacking that tang of originality to elevate it to the upper echelons of truly memorable thrillers. That said Monroe's stunning appearance and the acting of Cotton and Peters certainly take it out of the ordinary and don't quickly leave the memory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marilyn does serious quite well, thank you very much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It surprises me very much that studio execs viewed Marilyn Monroe's more serious work as a disaster and transformed her into a comedic foil, because seeing her here as a trash-talking, scheming femme fatale is a delight. Niagara may be a fairly standard Hitchcock knock-off, but Monroe's fantastic dark turn and the precise essaying of the doomed and destructive relationship between her and the husband she's plotting to kill elevates this deceptively complex character piece into something quite enjoyable.While the film is padded with enough extended shots of the titular Falls to almost allow it to double as an advertisement for potential tourists (it kind of works, actually... the scenery is beautiful), the atmospheric flourishes add immeasurably to Niagara's successful execution. The scenes in the bell tower are lifted straight from Hitchcock's story boards, but the extended shots of the rusting, silent bells are used very effectively as tension-builders. It is small touches like these that help the Film Noir 101 story transcend its rather generic plot outline and allow this film to revel in style, ultimately augmenting it with elements that add up to a memorable experience.Of course, the main selling point for most Monroe vehicles is the presence of the star herself, and Marilyn is as stunning here as you're likely to ever see her. Her performance doesn't require much, but she easily holds her own while surrounded by far more experienced actors, and, as always, she is impossible to take your eyes off of. Perhaps predictably, the big misstep here is her a cappella musical number, which seems like an obvious ploy to advertise her minor singing career. There's a reason we remember Marilyn for her films, not her records, and that reason is almost painfully displayed during this awkward sequence. But, even if her pipes aren't quite a match with her magnetic screen presence, there's something rather sweet about the childlike innocence of her mediocre singing.In fact, one could almost view this scene as rather important in the development of her character. Though we see her cheating on her husband and engineering his demise, her Rose Loomis remains a sympathetic character, and when you consider how much vulnerability scurries though in her portrayal of this would-be murderess, it's hard not to surmise that Monroe's potential as a serious actress may have been grossly overlooked.If Monroe steals the show, it isn't because Joseph Cotton isn't trying. His performance as Rose's defeated husband is as powerful and nuanced as anything you'll find from the era, and like Monroe, Cotton wrings every bit of sympathy he can from the plight of this poor soul. His love for Rose, despite his knowledge of her infidelity and suspicion that she may not care for him at all anymore, is a tragedy of almost Shakespearean proportions, so much so that it may be a mistake to file this one away in the Noir sub-genre.The honeymooning couple who become entangled in George and Rose's web of deception and deviance are a banal presence, but ultimately important to the story, as they represent what the doomed couple must have been like before circumstance and familiarity stripped the passion and zest from their union. Jean Peters does excellent things with the material, and she is by far the more important character in the scheme of the tale, so we're thankful that her screen time is more substantial than that of the witless soul playing her husband, who sets a high bar for doofuses worldwide.When these two worlds collide, we end up with a fascinating study of corrupted love, and a film that makes the most of its setting and its stars. Niagara is certainly one of the least famous entries in Marilyn's filmography, but it's definitely worth a serious look, and I'd place her performance here quite high on her "best of" list. This modest little thriller delivers a lot more than it seems capable of, and the surprising density of the end result leaves a lasting impression.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The beautiful plunging Niagara falls take second billing to the sexy figure of Marilyn Monroe, in this moody colour noir drama. Marilyn is Rose Loomis, the buxom wife of neurotic Joseph Cotten, who schemes with her lover to kill him. The early scenes in this film are remarkable in their sensuality and tension, with poor old Joe about to boil over in his motel room with a naked Marilyn between the sheets! Jean Peters plays one-half of a honeymooning couple who befriend the pair, with bad results. Peters also looks gorgeous and shows off her best assets in this beautifully filmed Technicolour noir. Marriage isn't shown in a very good light in this film, with the honeymoon facade stripped bare. Even by 1950's standards, Peters' husband is a total w'nker! Very interesting themes here. Pity that the film shifts tones abruptly to chase thriller in the second half, with the hunt for the killer less interesting than the slow-burn early scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marilyn as femme fatale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock never used Marilyn Monroe as one of his famous Hitchcock blondes. If he had they probably would have made a movie much like Niagara. Henry Hathaway directed this film but it definitely has a Hitchcock feel to it. It's certainly not the typical Marilyn Monroe film. Here Marilyn gets to show off some serious acting chops as she plays a femme fatale.While Monroe, as per usual, commands most of the attention it could be argued that the more important role in the film actually belongs to Jean Peters. Peters plays Polly Cutler who, with her husband Ray, is taking a delayed honeymoon to Niagara Falls. When the young couple arrives they find that the cabin they have reserved is still occupied by another couple, George and Rose Loomis, so the Cutlers end up staying in another cabin nearby. The two couples will soon see their fates intertwine in rather dramatic fashion. It is obvious right away that there are serious problems in the Loomis marriage. George, played by Joseph Cotten, seems to be rather unstable. The much younger Rose, played by Monroe, wants out of the relationship. In fact we soon learn she plans to have her husband killed and run off with a young lover who we never really see or know that much about. The Cutlers are determined to mind their own business and enjoy their honeymoon but they will be swept up in everything that is swirling around them.While Monroe does very well with her role and of course looks spectacular Peters matches her stride for stride. The story mostly unfolds from Polly's perspective and Peters creates a very sympathetic, compelling central character. Monroe's the femme fatale, Peters is the innocent and beautiful girl you fall in love with. So Monroe is terrific. Peters is terrific. Cotten is as well. Unfortunately there is one actor whose performance leaves much to be desired. Max Showalter plays Polly's husband Ray as a total goofball. The way he delivers his lines, the constant silly facial expressions, the shameless mugging for the camera...none of it works. The filmmakers dropped a clown into what is otherwise a tense, atmospheric thriller and the character sticks out like a sore thumb. Showalter's performance distracts and definitely detracts from the overall experience. But all in all the good outweighs the bad with this film. There's plenty of suspense, some moments of great tension and even a big action scene tossed in. The acting performances, with the one notable exception, are excellent and the film always looks terrific. The falls and all the surrounding scenery are shot beautifully. And if Niagara Falls aren't enough of a natural wonder for you there's Marilyn too. It's not a perfect film but as Hitchcock Lite it works well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>but this film is also an interesting set-piece, showing us vintage 1953. What makes this film different is that Monroe actually gets to act, and she certainly can.Joseph Cotten is the husband, recently released from a psychiatric hospital, and falling from favor with adulterous Monroe. Jean Peters and Casey Adams portray the young honeymoon couple, the Cutlers. Casey Adams is comic relief ("Get out the fire-hose!"; he pants, while watching Monroe in her classic, red satin dress.) Younger viewers may recall him as the grandfather from that Molly Ringwald film; "Sixteen Candles". Always a great character actor. That aside, this film qualifies as a classic of its time.Niagara Falls provides the ominous backdrop. The cinematography is interesting, and cloudy Technicolor- so accurately reflecting the rose-colored patina: The Rainbow Cabins, Marilyn's red dress, her green silk scarf in the bell tower.All are haunting images. We do not see many visual films like this today. There is too much emphasis on action, rather than thought. Monroe is indelible, from the early scene where she first walks off with her jangly bracelet and sky blue suit 2 sizes too small. It was said in many biographies that she felt close to the character of Rose, having lived a similar, transient life. How she brings the alienation and cold-blooded desire to life is pure Monroe. No one else could have done it.</fullReview>

She succeeded in this 1953 film.Unhappily married to Joseph Cotten, the two are at the famous falls where Monroe plots with her lover to kill Cotten.Jean Peters and Richard Allan (who also went under the name of Max Showalter) are a married couple who befriend the two.They try to comfort Monroe when they all think that Cotten is dead. Monroe soon realizes that the plot has gone awry and that her lover is instead dead. Cotten has gone totally insane by her actions and plots her demise. The chilling scene where Monroe meets her end is done extremely well as the chimes ring. The latter was supposed to signify the death of Cotten by her lover.Cotten fleeing with Jean Peters, in the boat by the Falls, is done in an exciting, ambitious way. The end is marvelously staged. ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marilyn and her secret lover have a signal: if lover successfully knocks off Marilyn's edgy "hubby," lover will have the bell tower play their favorite song.Well, the song's played, and Marilyn shows aural recognition and relief.Yet when she goes to identify the dead body, lo and behold, it's not hubbie on that slab but lover! Now, just how'd that song get played? Either lover-man sent out a premature signal or his corpse did.This little plotting discrepancy apparently was hoped to be overlooked; still, many a mystery fan will pick it up, and it doesn't help bolster the so-so plot.Monroe's makeup and costumes are striking here, and she becomes a luminous image--the kind that made her a legendary icon. The rest of the capable cast does the best the script can provide.Niagra's tourist trade undoubtedly doubled after this film's release.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought Niagara was very well done. Towards the end, it will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat. My only complaint about the movie is that Marilyn and Joseph Cotten seem extremely mismatched to me. I dunno, maybe that's why they had such problems.:)Regardless, this is definitely a good one to add to your Marilyn collection.4 1/2 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who says that Marilyn can't act?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well Marilyn is again wonderful as Rose Loomis. She was beautiful with her perfect clothes and she was certainly at her best. Sadly she didn't have the real main-part. This part was for Jean Peters who acted well, but the have the presence the way Marilyn have. Marilyn only have the wink and the screen is on fire. But Marilyn has also other things. Oh, yes she can act. The story was maybe a little bit predictable but the performances of Joseph Cotten &amp; Marilyn Monroe were superb!But the partner of Jean Peters in the film didn't act that well, he was unbelievable. He was not bad, but it could been better.The story goes about a woman (Monroe) who fall in love with someone but she is already married with Cotten. So Cotten has to die... but then Peters and her husband come along and the film really begins.RATING: 8/10 or *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of Marilyn Monroe's Better Pictures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like - WOW!!... Marilyn Monroe has never looked hotter than she does in Niagara. Man, Monroe just sizzles in this flick, especially in her hot-pink dress.This 1953 Thriller offers great fun for the viewer on a variety of levels.(1) Film Noir themes abound (albeit in Technicolor).(2) Oodles of location shooting around Niagara Falls.(3) And, best of all, Freudian Symbolism runs amok.Monroe plays Rose Loomis, an unbelievably ripe femme fatale.Niagara's twisted tale of greed and infidelity has the tantalizing Rose devilishly plotting (with her handsome toy-boy) the murder of her emotionally unstable husband, George. And, what better way to do him in, then a quick, hard push over, into the roaring Falls.Adding to Niagara's thrills - Director Henry Hathaway does an excellent job of squeezing the most out of the spectacular scenery around Niagara Falls.If you're a Marilyn Monroe fan, then you're sure to enjoy this seductively wicked flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Too bad. They can't play it for you now, Rose."Niagra failed to get me very interested from the very start, so you might as well know now that this won't be a very enthusiastic review. I sort of drifted through most of it, only paying attention enough to know what was going on. It's not a bad film, but I doubt I'll see it again.It takes place near Niagara Falls, as Marilyn Monroe plays an unfaithful and treacherous wife who plans to have her husband killed. A visiting couple on their honeymoon gets unknowingly mixed up in the plot, and the plan falls apart in a way that ends up putting nearly everyone in danger.This was my first Monroe movie, and while she was certainly beautiful, I found my eyes drawn to her co-star Jean Peters much more often. She stole the movie, as far as I'm concerned. I'd say that discovering her made the movie worth my time, I'm certainly going to check out more of her work.Other than that, I found Niagara to be a pretty forgettable thriller set in a very beautiful place, and even the gorgeous surroundings aren't really taken advantage of on the screen. Some movies just don't catch a person's interest, for whatever reason, and Niagara is the most recent example of that, for me.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tensions rise between two honeymooning couples at Niagara Falls,when Polly Cutler (Jean Peters) spots her next door neighbour at the Hotel, Rose Loomis(Marilyn Monroe) cheating on her aggressive husband George (Joseph Cotten).Soon Polly learns that Rose and her secret lover are planning to kill off George. Hitchcockian type Thriller never reaches the levels it should, filmed in vivid colour and on breathtaking locations, but still with all the Noir visuals, it lacks any tension due mainly to bland performances from all and sundry, Monroe "acting" like she was in a Wilder farce does not help proceedings pouting and wiggling her hips through most of her scenes,which is fine in another film but not here and it only serves to distract and take away from the final product.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fresh figs, best physic anybody ever had!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a good example of the writing talent of the producer, Charles Bracket, who previously had been Billy Wilder's writing partner (and producer). Walter Reisch, who co-wrote Ninotchka with the team, is Brackett's co-writer, along with Ricard Breen, who wrote the original Dragnet series.The music by Sol Kaplan is excellent. I'm surprised he's not better known. There is also great use made of the songs played by the bell tower. Of course Niagara Falls is a honeymoon spot, so we hear "Oh Promise Me" as the Cutlers are pulling into town, and later "Be My Love" used ironically. People have already mentioned "Kiss" and the ways it's played by the bells - and how that makes for a rather confusing plot point.The cast is marvelous and the setting is used in an outstanding manner. The film really pulls you in and makes you care about the characters. When it reaches the last half hour or so, it really has you hooked, and you're really along for the ride.It's hard to say who's the best performer in the film; Monroe is perfect in the only lead "siren" part she ever played. Cotten is great as the poor, sad, battle-fatigued husband who you really sympathize with, despite his having completely neurotic responses to almost any situation. Jean Peters is also outstanding as Polly, not a false note in the whole performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was interesting as we had just visited Niagara Falls this past summer for the first time, years after moving from NY and having never visited as a resident. As such, the scenery and the night light shots were nice. The movie progressed nicely, even if you ignored Showalter's highly annoying constantly grinning character. He is the true definition of a sappy dope. Unfortunately, about halfway through, my wife and I were able to predict almost every scene, and especially every aspect of the aquatic escape attempt. Not a terrible movie, but not a classic either. On a funny note, we watched the Anderson Tapes right after this, and who has a bit part in that movie, but doofy Max Showalter, still sporting the goofy grin 17 years later!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Portent Of Vertigo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Niagara" is a thoroughly enjoyable crime thriller which was made in vivid Technicolor and directed very capably by Henry Hathaway. The spectacular setting for the action with its crashing waterfalls, beautiful rainbows and rising mists and sprays, provides great visual impact and a stunning backdrop for the events which are played out nearby. The relatively unrushed pace of the piece is also successful in contributing both to its rather ominous atmosphere and the tension that it gradually generates.Many people will, no doubt, experience a certain sense of deja vu as they watch some passages in this movie as it contains a number of similarities to Alfred Hitchcock's "Vertigo". The most striking ones are the presence of a blonde femme fatale, an obsessed male, the significance of bell towers to the plots and the prominent use of some very memorable location shots. The positions in which the dead bodies in the bell towers lie is also virtually identical. The fact that "Niagara" predated "Vertigo" by some years, leads to the view that Hitchcock must have been profoundly influenced by many of the elements of Hathaway's movie.When Ray and Polly Cutler (Max Showalter and Jean Peters) go to Niagara Falls for their much delayed honeymoon, they find the cabin they booked is still occupied because the previous occupants had failed to vacate the property on time. Rose Loomis (Marilyn Monroe) explains to the motel manager that her husband (a veteran of the Korean War who'd recently been in hospital being treated for the effects of battle fatigue) is too unwell to move immediately. The Cutlers agree, in the circumstances, to move into the cabin next door. When Rose tells them that she's going shopping, they do a little sightseeing and when Polly is posing for a photograph near one of the Falls, she sees Rose in a passionate embrace with a young man.In the evening when some people are dancing outside the cabins, Rose asks them to play her favourite song called "Kiss" and when it's played she joins the Cutlers outside their cabin and dreamily sings along with the song which clearly means a lot to her. The mood changes rapidly, however, when her furious husband, Gearge (Joseph Cotton), rushes out of his cabin, grabs the record and smashes it, cutting his hand in the process. Polly goes with George to his cabin and bandages his injured hand. He's very bitter and tells her that Rose is a tramp and that it was because of her that he lost his farm and volunteered for duty in Korea. After Ray arrives at the cabin, Gearge gradually becomes increasingly angry and distressed because he's convinced that Rose is having an affair. His behaviour becomes progressively more irrational and after he starts smashing some of the furniture about, the couple leave.Rose and her lover Patrick (Richard Allan) subsequently conspire to murder George but when events take an unexpected turn, Rose, Patrick and George all suffer as a consequence.The Cutlers are a happy, optimistic and conventional couple who act as a strong counterpoint to the Loomises whose relationship is poisoned by Rose's treachery and provocation and George's volatility and jealousy. Marilyn Monroe and Joseph Cotton give creditable performances and Jean Peters is particularly good as the well meaning Polly who adapts so well to the various difficult positions that she finds herself in."Niagara" is a rather light confection, containing no particular plot complexities and not much character information or development. Patrick's character and the dynamic between him and Rose are both left completely unexplored. What the movie lacks in substance, however, is more than made up for by the entertaining way in which the plot unfolds, some excellent cinematography and the magnificent views of the Falls.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marilyn Monroe as Fab Femme Fatale in Tense Hitchcockian Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Henry Hathaway from a script by Billy Wilder's frequent collaborator Charles Brackett (who produced, too), Walter Reisch, and Richard Breen, NIAGARA is a dark thriller, except in appearance. Director of Photography Joe McDonald, best known for his films noir, shot the gorgeous Niagara Falls locations in dazzling Technicolor, while still making atmospheric, suspenseful use of shadows and light. Even more dazzling is Marilyn Monroe in one of her earliest star vehicles, sultry and slippery in one of her last femme fatale roles before GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES showed the world Monroe's funny side.Despite the happy cliché of Niagara Falls being a honeymooners' paradise, NIAGARA The Movie is moody from the start as edgy George Loomis (Joseph Cotten) wanders around the Canadian side of the falls at dawn, feeling insignificant. He's a war veteran freshly released from an Army hospital, where he was treated for PTSD, or as they called it back then, "battle fatigue." He's also got a sexpot wife, Rose (Monroe), so you'd think George's life isn't that bad. :-) Ah, but Rose has thorns: a secret lover and a plot to kill George and make it look like suicide. Fate brings the Loomises together with Polly and Ray Cutler (Jean Peters and Casey Adams). Polly and Ray are at the falls for their late honeymoon, long delayed by eager-beaver Ray's demanding job as a cereal executive. Despite bringing books, Ray promises, "It'll be as good as a regular honeymoon." "It should be better," Polly replies teasingly. "I've got my union card now." They laugh and snuggle, and that's one of the few happy moments Polly and Ray have together before the Loomises make their honeymoon into a living hell.Things get creepy, starting with small inconveniences, like our lovebirds settling for a cabin with a so-so view because Rose and the unwell George are still in the cabin Polly and Ray were supposed to have. While the Cutlers enjoy their tour of the falls, Polly spies Rose making out with her hunky hottie (Richard Allan, who serves mostly as tasty eye candy). At an outdoor party that evening, Polly all but misses a romantic moment watching the falls' light show with Ray because she's bandaging George's hand after he cuts himself breaking Rose's favorite romantic record in a rage. Rose just sits there and smirks. (Reminded me of the toga party scene in ANIMAL HOUSE when, out of nowhere, John Belushi busts up folkie Stephen Bishop's guitar, then gives it back to him with a deadpan "Sorry." :-)) Our sympathetic honeymooners get fed up as they're reluctantly pulled deeper into the Loomises' problems, not realizing Rose is setting them up as witnesses to George's increasingly shaky mental state, all the better to make his eventual death look like suicide. Like that's not enough, Ray's ridiculously jolly boss, Mr. Kettering (Don Wilson, from Jack Benny's various shows) and his wife (Lurene Tuttle) show up, eager to sightsee with the Cutlers and schmooze with Ray about giving him a raise because of his prize-winning shredded wheat promotion idea, turning the honeymoon into a busman's holiday. Oy! By now, Polly and Ray have been through the wringer because of those loony Loomises, so I had to smile and sympathize with Ray being, to quote the HIGH NOON theme song, "torn 'twixt love and duty," sincerely wanting to take care of his distraught bride, yet reluctant to nix an opportunity to score a raise that would improve their life together in myriad ways. If the 1953 economy was anything like today's economy, I can't blame Polly for agreeing to include face time with the boss as part of their honeymoon itinerary! Peters and Adams make an appealing couple, sweet with a touch of insouciant playfulness. The peripatetic Ray clearly means well and loves Polly. Heck, he doesn't even show any serious lust for the luscious Rose; he just makes good-natured wisecracks about her to Polly, and vice-versa. FTM, I liked how Polly never acted catty or jealous around Rose. Now that's self-confidence! :-) As the calculating, manipulative Rose, Monroe smolders like nobody's business, driving men mad with her careless come-hither air and her curves in, as George grouses, a dress "cut down so low in front, you can see her kneecaps." La Monroe even gets to sing "Kiss" (no, not the Prince song), that love song Rose and her secret sweetie like so much. It'll come back to haunt her later, but I don't want to give away the nifty twists! I'll only say that Alfred Hitchcock would have been proud to call the bell tower scene his own (though with his taste in women, I imagine Hitch would have picked a cooler, more subtle blonde than Monroe :-)). After that, the film drifts into PERILS OF PAULINE territory, but by then I cared enough about the characters to see how it all worked out.Cotten is at once terrifying and heartbreaking as Rose's emotionally scarred fool for love/lust, a hard-luck guy who can't seem to get out of his own way. We learn a lot about Rose and George's relationship in little scenes and throwaway lines, like George admitting he re-enlisted in the Army to show Rose he was still just as able as any young stud. Then there's the couple's short-lived jubilance the day after that literally record-breaking fight. The Loomises laugh and kiss, Rose under the covers in bed, George on top of her with the blanket between them (this was the '50s, after all :-)), talking about all the fun they'll have when they hit Chicago. "Georgie, this is quite a change," Rose purrs. "What brought this on?" George smiles. "You know what." He gives her a long kiss. "When we have a fight and make up that way, I never want to leave your side." Ooh, hot make-up sex -- a bit daring for a studio film of that era, no? :-) All told, NIAGARA is good, dark, tawdry fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fine film starring Marilyn Monroe and Niagara Falls! Wow, this still looks good and if it wasn't for the fact that Max Showalter's character so annoys me, I'd be giving this an even higher score. Shame too because Jean Peters, as his wife completely acts him off the screen, even if she does needlessly loose her skirt on the boat only to be wearing what looks like a pair of shorts underneath! Back to the plot. Actually there is not much of a story, all fairly simple but beautifully done in fantastic surroundings. Is there a film that has better used its location? Great attention to the technical details too, the buses, the lifts, the cubicles and all the paraphernalia around the falls. Were those walkways for real? There are noirish moments, particularly in the bell tower, which reminds me, I kept thinking 'Vertigo' and it can't have just been the bells. The colour, maybe and the music, although it's not Herrmann of course. Anyway, if you like 'Vertigo', you'll like this; if you like Monroe, you'll like this; if you like movies, you'll love this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is possibly one of Marilyn's best dramatic efforts on film. She plays a believable and even sympathetic woman whose unfaithfulness to her husband (Joseph Cotten) precipitates a grave event of murderous proportions.Jean Peters is the true star of Niagara, playing a strong newlywed who is capable of overcoming the obtuseness of her social-climbing husband and oblivious police detectives, herself getting to the bottom of the danger all around her. The depiction of 1950s Niagara Falls reminds us of how simple and quaint it all was back then. Not the permanent carnival it is today. The Dominion of Canada is depicted as the true British Commonwealth state it was back then and those antiquated Ontario Provincial Police cruisers and uniforms are a hoot to see, having gone through some other peculiar changes these many years later.Don Wilson, of Jack Benny fame, appears in the latter half of the film and provides comic relief to the intrigue surrounding sweet Norma Jean and Joey Cotten. This is just a great Marilyn Monroe film and the majesty of Niagara just adds to the radiance!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marilyn as Femme Fatale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is not the best film noir movie, but NIAGARA is one of the most interesting ones, because of a casting decision. Aside from her performance in DON'T BOTHER TO KNOCK, Marilyn Monroe never played negative types. Even Loralie Lee in GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDS is really in love with her fiancé - she just is aware that in a world run by men a woman has to be ready to take advantages of whatever she has to protect herself or prepare for her old age. In DON'T BOTHER TO KNOCK the fear and chaos she creates is due to mental problems - she is not responsible. But that's not the case in NIAGARA. In no other film did Marilyn show a vicious streak.Here she is the typical bombshell, tied in a loveless marriage to ailing, cranky Joseph Cotton. Marilyn seems to go in two directions with Cotton - either she ignores him, or she humiliates him. Witness the scene where she plays the suggestive music, and does a sexy, provocative dance for the other denizens of the motel that she and Cotton are staying in. It turns out that she and her lover plan to lure Cotton into an isolated spot, and stage an accident leading to his drowning in the great Falls. The plan, however, goes totally awry, and Marilyn is not certain who is dead, and what the police may or may not know.She has some excellent moments in the film - when she has to identify the corpse and collapses. When she starts getting "hang-up" calls at the Hospital. There is also great juxtaposition of the tension in Marilyn's performance, and the seeming gaiety felt by most of the tourists around her.Cotton is moody and suspicious as the film continues, but also helpless and somewhat sympathetic. He has been compared by another writer for his role here and for that of "Uncle Charlie" in SHADOW OF A DOUBT", but "Charlie" was far more vicious and greedy, killing women for their money. Here it is Cotton's George Loomis who is the marked target - not Monroe's Rose Loomis.Instead of concentrating on the actor playing the lover of Marilyn, the third figure is Jean Peters as Polly Cutler, who is determined to try to make her honeymoon a success, but is drawn into the tragedy of the Loomis marriage. She does well in a thankless part, for wicked women (like wicked men) are more fascinating than their nicer counterparts. But she does get her share of terror too - up to the conclusion when lives and problems are effortlessly swept away by powers beyond mortal men's abilities to control. For all it's flaws as a small production, it is a good film, and helps prove that Marilyn Monroe was a potentially great actress.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The false likeness of a dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film that Jacques Rivette writing for Cahiers described as "a pure article of sex and Technicolor". Yes, from afar this is the Hollywood dream of cinema; the promise of sexual danger (here personified by a sultry Marilyn Monroe dripping with the wet fantasy we invest her), the magical backdrops in which to escape, the immoral cruelties of noir eventually set straight.But, but, so much more, while building on precisely the immaculate surface that Hollywood was propped against. The false likeness of that dream.Hathaway may had been a journeyman for most of his career, here though he exhibits an intuitive propensity for where cinema would take these stories, and how later filmmakers would invest them with collective nightmares of the mind.The opening image is a dead giveaway; a man (the hapless schmuck as we soon find out) standing before the vastness of the Niagara falls, as he wonders what instinct or fate brought him there. And a little later it's the newlyweds exchanging kisses on the deck of a tour boat, which Hathaway cuts with the imposing enormity of the falling waters.More portents and omens; a bell ringing from the distance fateful news of the dream coming true. Ringing again later as reminder of the dream having turned to nightmare. Faces obscuring themselves in the dark, usually by closing blinds. The first we see of Marilyn she is the sexed-up movie doll, with red lipstick and flowing blonde hair. The second time, she is the silhouette of a woman sitting on a bed, literally without face, with her features bathed in shadow.Better yet, the wonderful folding. One couple, the happy-go-lucky newlywed on their honeymoon, coming to live in the bungalow where the romance of the other couple withers away in bickering and frustration. A room 'intended for them'! One woman becoming seduced by the image of the other, the mischievous femme fatale. We see her speak on the same phone as the other did earlier, looking on the same mirror (where the second time we can see in a little corner the reflection of the man brought down by the first woman). And of course, this man assuming the identity of another, grasping at the chance to start life anew.And the visitation upon all the various schemes by the karmic forces of noir, where desires spawned in the mind eventually, inescapably manifest in the physical world. Here it's twofold the stage of that visitation, both high places. One is a bell tower, the man-made structure in which the poor schmuck who could've been free to start life anew returns and is literally locked in by desire. The other is, of course, the Falls, where balance is restored.So we return to the Falls in the end, this time charged with meanings. About life as the quiet river that inadvertently gives way to the rapids and the violent fall ("which nothing can stop"), about love as the same. And about cinema, as characters marvel from behind the blinds of the bungalow overlooking the falls, lit in colorful hues for the night and quite a spectacle.All this is subtle enough, inconspicuous, that if we simply follow the story we may be inclined to think it's another ordinary riffing on a Double Indemnity scheme. But if we follow the false likeness of that story, the reflected image? This is where Vertigo begins, a studied composition to this early sketch. Miss this at your cost.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Henry Hathaway has directed a melodrama involving a perfectly normal honeymooning couple (Peters and Showalter) trying to help a troubled couple (Cotton and Monroe) of the kind that marriage counselors call unstable and unsatisfactory.Cotton has just been released from some kind of booby hatch and we take his obsessive paranoia about his wife's fidelity as symptomatic, but in fact he's quite right. Monroe has a lover. They plan to murder Cotton and take off for Chicago.Monroe and her paramour use a vapid pop song that they arrange to have played by the bells in the campanile as a signal for them to meet and fornicate like two aardvarks in heat. The insipid love song may have been meant for public release, maybe sung by Patti Page or someone, but it never leaves the ground. "It's the ONLY song," breathes Monroe. If that were the case the end of civilization would be at hand.But if the song flops, Monroe does not. Hathaway and the studio have lavished as much attention on her as her lover has. She's dressed in startling vermilion dresses, she's festooned with diamonds, and her lips are a glistening scarlet that might blind a companion in a dark room. When she delivers a line her upper lip droops for a second over her lower, as if getting ready to do something entirely on its own.She wears spaghetti shoes. She wears false eyelashes, make up, and that polished lipstick. She wears it in the shower. She wears it while lying unconscious on a hospital bed. And when she walks away from the camera, the shot lingers forever on her undulating rear.Peters and Showalter are anxious to help the tortured couple but Peters discovers some shadowy nooks in the others' marriage and when she tries to tell her husband she dissolves into hysterical gibberish so that an irritated Max tells her to "Stop it now; it was all just a bad dream!" The last third of the picture is more kinetic. There are lots of pursuits, always upward. Frightened people climb rickety wooden staircases that seem to meander through the dripping rocks. People are trapped in stone grottoes, left hanging to small rocks in the St. Lawrence River. And way high up in the campanile, the bells provide silent witness to murder.It's Marilyn Monroe's picture all the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Niagara is a Technicolor film noir. The plot is simply not strong enough to be tense or give it an air of mystery.Director Henry Hathaway is left with making the most of the location, Niagara Falls and starlet Marilyn Monroe in various sultry costumes to make the movie mesmerising. Apart from that the rest of the film is poor and is certainly far from being even be rated as good never mind a classic.Polly and Ray Cutler (Jean Peters and Max Showalter) are newly-weds on a delayed honeymoon to Niagara Falls. They meet meet Rose and George Loomis (Marily Monroe and Joseph Cotten) who are still in the Cutlers reserved cabin, it seems George is a bit brittle and neurotic. It is stated that he has been depressed because of his experience in the war.Polly and Ray stay in a nearby cabin and when venturing to the falls Polly sees Rose kissing another man. It seems Rose is plotting to get rid of her husband in Niagara Falls, make it look like an accident or suicide and run off with the younger man. Pretty soon a body is found and Rose collapses in grief and shock but is George really dead?Cotten tries to do his best with his limited characterisation. A man who suffering from mental stress and knows that his wife is cheating on him and maybe plotting to bump him off. Jean Peters does look sexy when she is allowed to but you just feel that this film had the ingredients to be an interesting and intriguing film in the hands of Alfred Hitchcock armed with a better screenplay. Instead we are left with a cack-handed movie with few thrills.</fullReview>

One of the first full blown depictions of the hyper-curvaceous, iridescent lipglossy and figure-huggingly clothed Marilyn Monroe persona that became standard. The expert use of the wonderful Niagara Falls backdrop to the story. The unsettling(poor) performances of Max Showalter and Don Wilson. But pace cadillacmax@msn.com , the thought that was most insistent to this elderly male reviewer throughout was ? Boy, would I love to be on a honeymoon with this Jean Peters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . John Wayne told NIAGARA's Cabbie, Harry Carey, Jr., on the set of BIG JAKE. Co-starring in a Wayne vehicle was NOT like driving around with Jerry Seinfeld, or even NIAGARA's Marilyn Monroe. Movie buff Leonard Maltin elicits this anecdote from the gray-bearded actor during an eight-minute-long 2005 interview entitled, THE JOHN WAYNE STOCK COMPANY: HARRY CAREY, JR. Of course, the problem with Wayne's comment is fairly obvious. He and Carey were NOT co-starring in a summer stock revival of THE WIZARD OF OZ. Instead, Carey had let his hair grow out all scraggly to play the doomed bad guy in BIG JAKE, Junior's first villainous movie part (after a career of playing Cabbies--as in NIAGARA--or other minor functions). That makes Wayne's dig tantamount to Dennis Rodman yelling out "Airball!" as his teammate Michael Jordan is about to release a free throw that could clinch Game Seven of the NBA Finals for their Chicago Bulls squad. Or Jordan Spieth shouting "Mashed Potatoes!" as Tiger Woods addresses the ceremonial first tee shot at the Masters. Or Condominium Rice screaming "You lie!" as George W. Bush spins a web around Yellow Uranium during an Address to a Joint Session of Congress. Or Butch Cassidy commanding "Jump!" as the Sundance Kid nears the edge of a cliff. The point that Matlin's highlighting in his editing of this interview is that normally a movie cast views themselves as teammates--NOT hecklers, trying to goad their cast mates over NIAGARA Falls without a barrel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Gushing Greats?Marilyn Monroe and Niagara Falls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Famous Film for the Falls and Marilyn Monroe. Director Henry Hathaway showed Periods of Brilliance in a Long Career, Highlighted by a String of Film-Noir's in the Mid-Forties. Here He shows No Restraint in Highlighting two of Nature's Natural Wonders.He spends Equal Enthusiasm showcasing the crashing waterfalls and the curvaceous Monroe in Close-Ups and Long Walking Shots. With both He succeeds in capturing the Undeniable Truth of the Spectacular.This is one of the few Film-Noir Filmed in Technicolor. The Cinematography of Joe MacDonald, no stranger to the Genre, makes it work. The sharp angles and the shadows have much more contrast in B&amp;W but are here Displayed Distinctively and Effectively.The Weakness of the Film is in a rather Standard Script and a couple of Irritating Performances that are so Grating and Over-the-Top that One Wonders how the Director handled His Obligation to let it stand. Max Showalter as a White-Bread-Middle-Class Husband and Don Wilson in a Cartoonish Cringe-Inducement.But Marilyn and Niagara Falls will not be Denied Their Due as Natural Wonders. Joseph Cotton Hot Tempered as MM's Neurotic and Over the Hill Husband tries as He may to capture the attention of the Audience is a Futile Effort, Drowned by all the Gushing Water and Marilyn's Gushing, Overwhelming, Seductive Sensuality.Overall, Jean Peters is a Fabulous Fulcrum to the Film's Grander Elements, manages to impress with it's Calmness and Straight-Laced Appeal. Not much Complexity in the Characterizations or Plot, the Film is an Above Average Display of Two Things that are Anything but Average. Niagara Falls and Marilyn Monroe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the annals of films worth watching for their location photography, 'Niagara' ranks right up there, I'd say in the top ten for sure. It's also a safe bet to say that Niagara Falls has never been as well used as the setting for a film as it is here. And on top of that, 'Niagara' is a good little thriller, very much in the Hitchcock vein; the director, Henry Hathaway, almost seems to be making a point by saying (figuratively), "Hitchcock isn't the only one who can make a Hitchcock film." One more thing in its favor is that 'Niagara' is an early Marilyn Monroe starring vehicle, and it's not hard to imagine the impact she must have had on audiences back in 1953. She definitely lives up to the hype. If you can take your eyes off her physical attributes long enough to notice, Monroe actually delivers a fine performance. But that's sometimes easier said than done; she has on the reddest red lipstick I've ever seen in my life. Monroe's character is killed somewhere after the halfway point which indicates her skyrocketing fame may have been more responsible for her landing top billing than the part itself. Jean Peters, the other female lead, actually has a bigger role and more screen time. Joseph Cotten plays Monroe's pitiful husband, a 'woe-is-me, how do I keep up with this keg of dynamite in a dress I'm married to' neurotic bundle of nerves. So 'Niagara', while owing to Hitchcock, is also very much like other feverish fifties melodramas dealing with cheating wives/husbands and the comeuppance they inevitably incur. Even with the spectacular scenery of the waterfalls and use of locations around them, 'Niagara' never feels like a travelogue or a commercial for the then-popular tourist site. I think it's because of the underlying tension that permeates the film, and because bad things happen here. The naive fifties cheerfulness of the backdrop and supporting characters serve to create a contrast with the murderous feelings of betrayal and jealousy and loneliness that drive Cotten's character. (Ironically, he is the one who is supposed to be murdered in a plot concocted by Monroe and her new boyfriend.) Things work their way to an appropriately heated climax in a boat (hey, you KNEW someone at some point was going to die going over the falls, didn't you?) and there you have it. 'Niagara,' while no classic, is very much worth watching and a fine early vehicle for Marilyn Monroe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monroe sizzles, Cotten seethes, the Falls enchant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This nifty thriller represented one of Hathaway's few forays into noir (he was largely known for Westerns). It was unusual for noir in being filmed in shimmering Technicolor rather than the pallet of grays, blacks, and whites more commonly associated with the genre, but then, given the resort setting, this was almost inescapable.The storyline is straightforward: an amiable Midwestern couple, the Cutlers, Polly and Ray (Jean Peters and Max Showalter, billed as Casey Adams) arrive at the Falls to find the cabin they've reserved is occupied by another, more fractious couple: the Loomises. George (Joseph Cotten), the husband of the latter couple, could be nicknamed "Gloomy Loomy" given his downcast and cynical demeanor; we learn that he spent time in a psychiatric hospital for war veterans. His ravishing and none-too-faithful wife, Rose (Marilyn Monroe) provides ample reason for his suspicions. Turns out she's been two-timing George with a man who looks like the textbook illustration of a smooth gigolo (Richard Allan) and she and loverboy are planning something most foul for George.But Polly, the distaff half of the Cutler twosome, has witnessed some of the hanky- panky, and when Rose and her lover's nefarious plans run into trouble, Polly finds herself caught between a vengeful husband and a scared-out-of-her-wits wife. The suspense arises from Polly-in-peril and her efforts to extricate herself from another couple's troubles.Monroe is excellent in one of her few villainous roles in a non-comedy, and Cotten is riveting as the troubled, betrayed husband bent on revenge. His voice-over during an insomniac late-night/early-morning walk by the Falls at the start of the film is almost worth the price of admission alone. And the Falls? They never looked more beautiful- or deadly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Splendid film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this on television when I was a kid. I found a copy on DVD the other day and grabbed it because I'm sure it will be a collectors edition. For me, this is a real part of my life. I grew up just a stones throw from where they shot the film and know many of the buildings and locations they used. It is a time capsule of the city which is now entirely changed. As for the film itself, I always enjoyed it for several reasons. One, the famous 'long walk' in which Marilyn walks away from the camera toward the falls. For starters, as she turns, and when she is faced away from the other couple, she gives that wicked smile assuming her husband has been murdered. Secondly, that shot of her walking away from the camera made her famous - or more notably, her backside became famous. The whole premise of the film comes together when she is asked to identify her husband's body,, but goes into a dead faint when the sheet is pulled back to reveal it is her lover on the slab. The famous murder scene in the bell tower is also great. Very film noir, with shadows and only knowing, not seeing,, what is happening to her until she falls into frame. All in all a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even "The Niagara" Falls For Marilyn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As radiant as pure sunshine, and as yummy as a cherry-flavoured lollipop (shlurp!), blond eye-candy, Marilyn Monroe (straight out of a 1950s dream factory) played dissatisfied wife, Rose Loomis, of the emotionally unstable hubby, George, played by the decidedly seedy actor, Joseph Cotten.From the very beginning it's never made clear whether it was Rose who was actually responsible for driving George to his present state, but, boy-oh-boy, this looney-tune was wound up pretty tight and Rose wasn't helping matters much.As we soon discover, Rose, and her hot, secret lover-boy, Patrick, have cleverly (so they think) planned out George's demise via a one-way ticket straight over the falls, without a life-jacket (of course).In this intriguing, Technicolor film of betrayal and murder, Marilyn Monroe is so absolutely gorgeous, seductive and voluptuous. The camera immediately falls, head-over-heels, in love with her (like I did) every time she comes into view. And, as an added bonus, Monroe actually puts in a pretty good performance, competently tackling a dramatic role for a nice change of pace.Having actually spent an entire summer visiting near Niagara Falls some years ago, I was really quite delighted to see the falls, in all of its pulsing grandeur, so prominently featured in this film. Niagara was, of course, filmed on the Canadian side of the falls, which is far more awesome and beautiful than that of the US side. But, all the same, the excellent location camera work in Niagara certainly added to the overall thrills.All-in-all, Niagara was a film well-worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good film noir with fine performances by the actors, including Marilyn Monroe. However, it is yet another film with "dumb victims." They wind up in perilous situations caused by a lack of common sense like climbing stairs leading to no exit and confronting a killer who has another opportunity to kill once more. Scenery is gorgeous. Some of the dialog is corny. Joseph Cotten's performance mirrors his performance in Shadow Of A Doubt. Police are shown to be incompetent. Escapes are not plausible in the ways shown. Suspend belief and enjoy the movie. The movie length is slightly longer than those of the 1940's and 1950's. Movie is made in color, instead of the usual black and white, but Niagra Falls and the rainbows should be seen in color.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I fell for MM too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This superb Technicolor noir from 1952 is a real eyeopener for viewers who only know MM as a breathy musical or comedy star. MM's drama roles of this early period are well worth finding, especially also DON'T BOTHER TO KNOCK and even LADIES OF THE CHORUS from 1948. However NIAGARA is a star vehicle that delivers in glorious Technicolor and serious scare. One daylight fright with Joseph Cotton is genuine enough to get an audience off their seats, and all through MM gives as strong a performance as Cotten and gorgeous Jean Peters. Only Max Showalter as the Honeymoon Husband is tedious and obvious. Wonderful location footage and spectacular eerie tone is evident and appealing only with some lame back projected footage in key moments to yank the viewer away from the tense drama. Viewers will also think of CAPE FEAR in certain moments. The use of chimes and the song KISS is very effective and the alarming scenes in the tower, especially the stairway are seen again in VERTIGO. Any film that can pre flag those two films from the late 50s as this 1952 Fox production does is deserving of the discovery/classic status NIAGARA has. Monroe clearly nude in bed under a sheet in her opening scene is a real crowd pleaser.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie that made Marilyn Monroe a star lets her play a darker role (but equally sexy). She plays a woman on honeymoon who plots to kill her husband...but he's also cooking something up. The rushing torrent of Niagara Falls is nothing compared to the tension going on between these two. "Niagara" isn't a great movie, but it's an enjoyable one. There are a few shots of Monroe on which guys probably spent eternity obsessing. Henry Hathaway manages to create a clever, suspenseful picture that will probably make you want to take a trip to the famous waterfall (but only the Canadian side; I understand that the US side is trashed). Worth seeing.Yeah, those WERE some fine shots of Marilyn Monroe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic film noir with awesome visuals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All Marilyn Monroe fans need this flick in their collection. To me, she's never been better than this. Her scheming, crafty, gorgeous young wife radiates sexiness and treachery with every move, expression and word she makes or speaks. Her body language is impeccable and pitch-perfect in servicing her portrayal. This is a woman who has always known how stunning she is and automatically uses her beauty to her advantage in all circumstances. In fact this movie, as fine as it is, loses a lot of steam after her final scene. It's a nice touch that she can always easily and routinely manipulate the world around her, but in a physical, life-or-death situation she's totally helpless.There are a few significant loose ends in this flick: What's the significance to George and Rose of the song "Kiss"? Why does Rose want George dead? Is it his life insurance policy or just sadism on Rose's part? Or is she an insatiable control freak who only wants to see how far she can manipulate her young stud into doing her bidding? All these questions are left to the audience's imagination, which greatly heightens the intrigue and mystery of Rose. The cinematography, the writing, the intense use of imagery employing the awe-inspiring Canadian side of Niagara Falls and the other actors are all right on the money from start to finish. It ends up being Jean Peters's movie, since she's the main character and heroine and she does a fine job. Marilyn's Rose is in fact a supporting role, but she adds so much to the proceedings that she effortlessly dominates the film in her every moment of screen time.Marilyn was famous for her comedic roles, but I preferred this part that presented her sinister side, which never got enough credit. Similarly, her part in "The Asphalt Jungle" is an excellent, albeit very brief, example of what her acting capabilities really were. She could've added some of the greatest femme fatale characters of all time to her repertoire, and "Niagara" is a tantalizing glimpse of her potential in that direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...though I was expecting black and white. Could have been kind of noir that way. Marilyn plays a sufficiently bad woman in this one.Marilyn looks beautiful as the scheming wife; she fills the screen when she is on it, although Jean Peters as a sensible newlywed is beautiful and natural in her role. Her husband, whoever he is, is nauseating and overacts like a child, especially in the earlier scenes, but improves somewhat. Joseph Cotton is good as the tortured and chilling husband of Marilyn's character. And of course it all takes place at a motel of cabins overlooking Niagara Falls.Overall not a bad suspense film of the era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nail-Biter Even Without Marilyn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marilyn hype aside, this is quite a good thriller. The sheer drama of the falls merge strikingly into the story as a whole. Some of the camera angles really showcase the waters in their crashing majesty, a sinister backdrop to the shadowy events. Then too, I hope TCF gave poor Jean Peters hazard pay for the way she gets doused around in that little boat. No glamour girl there. I expect the movie's overall quality is due to director Hathaway, long one of Hollywood's most underrated movie makers. Catch, for example, that marvelous overhead shot in the bell tower of Marilyn lying dead. It's a composition worthy of the best of Welles. Also, I kept watching for process shots, Hollywood's usual expedient when dealing with difficult action set-ups. The only one I could spot in that long river sequence is Peters on the rock awaiting rescue. To me, that's quite a feat of expert movie-making.Nothing special about the storyline itself. Faithless wife Monroe two-times her unbalanced husband Cotten who then stalks her amid the touristy Niagara setting. In fact, Cotten gets to do a lot of sinister lurking around. On the other hand, wholesome newly-weds Showalter and Peters make a charming, non-sappy contrast to the other couple-- and I'm not surprised that in real life, the notorious love-'em and leave-'em Howard Hughes ended up marrying the no-nonsense Peters. My only gripe is with the ever-exultant Don Wilson. He was such a good pitch-man on TV, but here it's like he's trying to sell us his glad-handing role instead of acting it out.Anyway, the movie remains more than simply Marilyn's breakthrough role-- good as she is-- and can stand on its own as an expert scenic thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Niagara</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Henry Hathaway ("Kiss of Death"; "Call Northside 777") directed this melodrama (beautifully shot by Joseph MacDonald; a memorable strangulation scene in a bell tower a definite highlight) with a flashy part for Marilyn Monroe to further establish her sexpot magnetism set in an equally lush setting of the Niagara Falls, has a somewhat suspenseful plot featuring a pretty exciting conclusion. Monroe is the wife of a miserable down-on-his-luck failure (Joseph Cotten, in a complex performance), plotting with her hunk lover to dispose of him over Niagara Falls as complications ensue. The lovely raven haired beauty Jean Peters (Pickup on South Street) and always excitable Max Showalter are a happy-go-lucky yuppie couple who arrive to Niagara Falls on a honeymoon, prepared to meet the boss of a cereal business welcoming them to his company (thanks to a successful pitch Showalter wooed the boss over), getting inadvertently pulled into Monroe and Cotten's tawdry state of affairs. Monroe thinks she has rid herself of Cotton, but things don't go according to plan with Peters' own life possibly in danger, not of any fault of her own. While Monroe captures your attention with relative ease, Peters certainly isn't tough on the eyes and has just as strong a part as the film's star attraction. Showalter smiles wide and remains lively, even when upset (and that is because he wants Monroe and her drama out of their lives), but doesn't factor in the meat of the plot as much as Cotten who I felt had the most interesting part of the film. Cotten's character is troubled, wounded, and holding on to his peace of mind by a slender thread, his burden mainly due to his inability to please such an alluring wife, perfectly aware that her luscious figure gains the attention of everyone around her. Red lipstick and Marilyn Monroe were an unbeatable combination. Hathaway and company milk the Falls location for all its worth, quite a nice backdrop for such a trashy plot regarding Monroe wanting her grouchy hubby dead so she could move onto Chicago to meet up with her younger man, as developments involving revenge and the desire to "remain dead" also factoring into the story.</fullReview>

Marilyn Monroe deserves special praise for her performance, with this film she got to show her critics that she was so much more than the glamorous comic blonde.In Niagara she proves she can be a really good dramatic actress and is brilliant playing a bad girl.Recently married couple Polly and Ray Cutler(Jean Peters and Max Showalter)are looking forward to their honeymoon in the beautiful surroundings of Niagara Falls.Staying at a fall side motel,the couple meet the stunning and sultry Rose Loomis(Marilyn Monroe)who persuades them her older husband George(Joseph Cotten)is a violent and disturbed man.The truth is actually more shocking,Rose is plotting to kill him so she can run away with her younger lover who will do the actual killing.Rose is bored,blinkered and selfish, unable to see that George loves her more than anything else in the world.One day on a Niagara falls tour Polly sees Rose kissing the other man and she becomes suspicious. Later George disappears and a body washes up on the riverbank.Marilyn gives one of her best performances and makes Rose Loomis one of cinemas most memorable femme fatales leading her husband and lover to certain doom.A strong atmosphere hangs over the film and breathtaking photography of the falls just makes you want to get on the next Maid Of The Mist boat tour as soon as possible.If you're a fan of Noir films then you should try and find a copy of this as soon as possible.Niagara is an intriguing mix of sex,murder and desire that is truly a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertainment in the Hitchcock tradition.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few films truly deserve to be called "Hitchcockian." "Niagara" is one of them. It's got all the hallmarks of The Master: a tight script where every action and line of dialog builds upon the next, duplicitous characters, suspense, humor, a glamorous leading lady, and a story played out against a landmark backdrop. Henry Hathaway even beat Hitchcock to a couple of tricks: killing off a leading lady long before the end (Psycho), assuming another person's identity (North by Northwest among others). Even the final shot, of the couple (in this case, only one member) huddled under blankets after being pulled from the water, predates the final shot in "Torn Curtain." "Niagara" is well-written, well-acted (with maybe the exception of Casey Adams, who's a bit over-emphatic), and well-executed. Niagara Falls is nicely woven into the storyline throughout the film. The script makes use of all the scenic attractions, and cleverly contrives a climax at the top of The Falls. Great performances by Marilyn Monroe (in a rare case of playing an unsympathetic character), Joseph Cotten (as a neurotic misfit, arguably one of his best roles), and Jean Peters (a beacon of normalcy among all the insane goings-on). Overall, "Niagara" is concise, entertaining and highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Your average "Double Indemnity" type of movie that has the added advantage of featuring two of the world most stunning and breathtaking natural wonders: Niagara Falls and Marilyn Monroe.26 year-old Rose Loomis, Marilyn Monroe, has been cheating behind her 47 year-old husband's George, Joseph Cotton, back by secretly having a hot and heavy affair with tall dark and handsome Patrick, Richard Allan. It's when young newlyweds Ray &amp; Polly Cutler, Max Showalter &amp; Jean Peters, show up at the motel room where the Loomis' are staying that Roses' plans to do in her husband, with the help of her boyfriend "Pat", starts to go sour. It turns out that the motel room that the Loomis' are staying at has been rented out to Ray &amp; Polly which has Rose's diabolical plans for George's unfortunate "accident" put on hold until she can convince the Cutlers that he's both crazy and suicidal. This would make George's upcoming accident, by jumping to his death off Niagara Falls, look more believable.As things turn out Pat's attempt to murder George-by throwing him off the falls-backfires with Pat not George ending up as fish-bate! It's when Rose is brought into the Niagara Fall County Morgue to identify her "husband's"-who in fact is her boyfriend Pat-body that she realized he actually survived her and Pat's attempt to murder him! Not only did George survive but he's now mad as hell in what his two-timing wife Rose had planned for him and is out for revenge! In him being declared legally dead George has the advantage to do what he want's in getting even with Rose by no one ever suspecting him, in the fact that he's dead, of murdering her. But there's only one catch! George was seen by Polly Cutler when he was breaking into her motel room looking for cash, to get him across to the USA side of the falls, who can vouch to the police that he's actually alive!Both the sexy Miss Monroe and the majestic Niagara Falls-with the movie filmed in glorious Technicolor- makes you forget just how mundane the film's screenplay really is. In fact what should have been the highlight of the movie in Pat's attempt to throw George off the falls, with him instead of George getting crushed to death, was completely cut out! This made it a bit confusing, until you figured out that it happened off screen, in realizing if Roses' plan to off her husband actually succeeded!***SPOILERS*** The movie's exciting ending did in fact, like Rose &amp; Pat planned, have George go under the waves or rocks of the falls but it was by then too late for both his wife and her lover to benefit from it.</fullReview>

Rose Loomis is a tramp, and a dangerous one, but Monroe for my money is just giving us a caricature of a tramp, all self-conscious sex- pottedness with way too much lip action when she sings. Just to recap: George Loomis (Cotton) is a loser, without the kind of lusty stamina that could keep happy his younger, lush and scheming wife, Rose (Monroe). They're staying at the Rainbow Cabins, right on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls. Then Polly and Ray Cutler (Peters and Casey) check in for a second honeymoon. It's not long before Polly and we realize Rose has a young, handsome lover. If Rose has her way, George Loomis might not be with us for much longer. And all the while a lot of water keeps crashing over the Falls. We're in for double crosses, murderous twists, desperate escapes and lots of what must be glue-on lipstick for Monroe's kisser. (It's bright red, thick and glossy, and she never gets a speck on her teeth or a smear on her pillow.). Of course, there's a reason the movie was named after Niagara Falls and it just might be that George Loomis has better survival instincts that we were led to believe. There are bits and pieces of interesting scenes, but bits and pieces of old Hitchcock do not a Hitchcock movie make. For me, Monroe has almost always been little more than a collection of curves and breathy sighs, a style-less singer and an extremely limited actress. Her great talent was in having that rare ability to reach an audience through the camera and make us forget there's a camera at all. She was one of Hollywood's great artificial creations, who was blessed mysteriously with genuine star dazzle. In Niagara, however, she's scarcely more than an Eagle Scout's naughty dream. She's not a good enough actress (or even a bad enough one) to be a first-rate femme fatale. It's Jean Peters who lends Niagara what quality and fascination it carries. After the set-up of the scheme, in fact, the less we see of Monroe the better the story becomes. For the last third of the movie, we don't see her at all, and that's when the movie starts developing some real B-movie quality. Niagara was made as a vehicle for Monroe, but, for me, she hasn't the skills to bring it off. The oddness of Monroe dominating her scenes and Peters dominating hers makes for a discombobulating story balance. Let's not forget Denis O'Dea as Inspector Starkey. He was an Irish actor with a fine stage reputation who made a number of British and Hollywood films, usually as smart, reserved police detectives. One of his best roles was in Carol Reed's Odd Man Out. O'Dea played a police inspector who was relentless in his pursuit of the wounded Johnny McQueen (James Mason), but sympathetic toward Kathleen Sullivan (Kathleen Ryan), the woman who loves McQueen and is determined to help him escape. It's a fine movie with one of Mason's great performances. Niagara is sort of fun to watch. The twists of fate, jealousy and retribution are almost always satisfying. Jean Peters gives a smart, sympathetic performance, and there's this strange, artificial creation of breasts, lipstick and sleepy eyelids to look at.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George and Rose Loomis (Joseph Cotten/Marilyn Monroe) are a miserable couple holed up in a resort by Niagara Falls. He's suspicious and neurotic, and she's doing everything she can to help it along by cheating on him. Another couple, Ray and Polly Cutler (the "proto-awful couple;" whom the script requires as witnesses and pawns) arrive at the resort also. They are composed of a dreadful husband (Max Showalter, perfectly cast for his cringe-inducing goofus/gung-ho/letch qualities), and his pretty, smarter wife (Jean Peters). Cutler is a company stooge who is capable of ignoring awe (the Falls) as he filters his entire world through industry terms (he's in cereal) and an interest in the Grand Tetons (Monroes, Peters). He laughs inanely over just about anything. They are pulled into the Loomis' problems, then some intrigue.The Cutlers are superseded about halfway through the movie by a third couple, the "hyper-awful couple;" composed of Cutler's boss, Mr. Kettering (his type is the "grotesque capitalist;" played broadly, already a source of embarrassment in 1953) and his wife. So, 3/4 of the couples constituents are crass and whitebread. Movies in the 50s often supplied these types - the Cutlers and the Ketterings would have to be distant relations of the grating McIlhennys in David Lean's Summertime. The hyper-awful couple is there to normalize the proto-awful couple and make them seem sympathetic.Niagara, in parts, is at least as good as middle-grade Hitchcock. It's not as psychologically deep as something like Vertigo, but the Falls are used as a surrogate for passion (both love and hate), and confusion (mist). If Monroe had fallen off the bell tower (er, carillon) the similarity would be obvious. Was Hitch borrowing from this when he dreamt up Roger Thornhill's adventure atop Mount Rushmore; Madeleine and her bell tower? Both North by Northwest and Vertigo came years later. The plot is small but intriguing. I won't give anything away here, the final setpiece lacks forward momentum and suspense. Rose's plight isn't easily integrated into the films psychology or plot. The car as a means to subdue and invade nature is getting explored at the exact moment the culture is doing likewise. The Cutlers are a post-war couple flying high on America's newfound middle-class wealth, and corporate/industrial superiority. The print has been cleaned but the camera exposure is off the black end of the scale in day-lit scenes, and muddy. I wish it had been filmed in some sort of widescreen process. Joseph Cotten is seen building a model car from the era of The Magnificent Ambersons, another Cotten movie. Monroe wears a fuchsia dress, as she will in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent little thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Niagara is not often mentioned in discussions about the great classics, and that's not really surprising as this one does fall slightly short of the mark; though it's still an excellent thriller. As the title suggests, the main location is Niagara Falls, and it makes for a great place to set the movie. The Falls themselves make for a beautiful location, and they're well used with the plot also. The thing I liked most about the plot of this movie is that it's tightly wound and always focuses on the main characters and the central plot idea; there's not an ounce of fat on it! The plot focuses on George and Rose Loomis. They're having a honeymoon at Niagara Falls, but it soon becomes apparent that their relationship isn't exactly rosy. Polly and Ray Cutler soon turn up, also on a honeymoon and meet the couple. Polly, by chance, later spies Mrs Loomis with another man and thereafter trouble erupts between Mr and Mrs Loomis. However, nobody suspects that the real intention between Mrs Loomis and her lover is to murder Mr Loomis in the falls...Director Henry Hathaway manages to keep things interesting for the duration of the film. This is thanks in part to the engaging story and interesting characters, and also due to the great performances from the four central actors. Marilyn Monroe is obviously the standout as the manipulative leading lady; this film is often noted for the fact that it's a different sort of role for her and she plays it well (actually should have done more like this). The great Joseph Cotten stars opposite her and delivers another sinister performance. Jean Peters surprises in her role and does excellent, while Max Showalter stands out the least but still gives a good performance. The film is often said to be part of the film noir style; I wouldn't call it such myself as it's in colour and I'm a purist, but it certainly has some noir styling's. Director Henry Hathaway manages to create some great set pieces, especially in the final third of the film; a chase through a bell tower is superbly executed, while the nail biting climax on the falls is very well done. Overall this is an excellent and too often neglected classic and I can certainly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While spending their vacation at the Niagara Falls, a beautifully sinister wife and her gigolo lover plot to murder her husband, who became mentally disturbed in the Korean War, and a honeymooning young couple unintentionally gets involved in the plan.A somewhat drearily melodramatic and frequently risible narrative turns out to be an astonishing film noir thriller by sheer brilliance of the professionals involved. The suspense is carefully portioned scene by scene to reach rather a fine climax; the masterful cinematography stylishly emphasizes the opposition of its anti-hero and anti-heroine; the odd couple of two rather repellent characters are excellently acted by Cotten and Monroe (her unexpected casting for a cruel role surprisingly hit the bull's eye); and the breathtaking use of the Niagara location is throughout a treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I prefer the Falls, you may prefer Monroe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I almost always avoid watching films starring Marilyn Monroe. I'm of the school that believes that "never has someone with so little talent gone so far". The one exception I make is watching "Niagara" just about every time it shows up on TCM. Even as a child, this was a favorite movie of mine, after having seen it (almost certainly) on "Saturday Night At The Movies".But I don't watch the melodramatic thriller / film noir for Monroe. I watch it for Niagara. As I child I lived a couple of hours drive from Niagara, so every couple of years the family would hop in the car and head for a day or two at the Falls. And, because much of this film was shot on location, it gives you a real sense of what mostly the Canadian side of the Falls was like in the early and mid-1950s. About the only thing inaccurately depicted was how short the lines would be to go into attractions such as Maid Of The Mist or the tunnels behind the Canadian Falls. The color photography is stunning, and is as much an historical record of Niagara Falls at that time as you'll find.Of course, the movie -- directed by Henry Hathaway -- is pretty good, too! :-) It stars Marilyn Monroe and Joseph Cotten. The best acting here is done by Cotton (a "real" actor), but of course, all eyes are on Monroe (and, at this stage of her career, this was her first truly standout role.The film sets up nicely, with a rather innocent couple (Max Showalter and Jean Peters) checking in at some tourist cabins overlooking the falls for their delayed honeymoon. There they meet George and Rose Loomis (Cotten and Monroe), and discover that she's racy and he's a tad off his rocker (evidently due to WWII). Monroe is having an affair, and the plan is for her boyfriend to kill Cotton in the Niagara River, and then run away to Chicago. Only things get reversed, and Cotton goes on a rampage. It's all very nicely plotted out and acted. Cotton ends up strangling Monroe (for whom the audience has no sympathy), and this is one of the most dramatically filmed scenes in the move. Then -- although this part is a little fantastic -- Cotton and Peters end up on a boat on the river above the falls, and are heading toward the brink in an exciting climax. Kudos to Cotten and Peters, as well as to Showalter, who is great as the sorta likable-goofy husband. And an oddball treat is seeing Don Wilson (from Jack Benny's series) as a shredded wheat executive (what a cornball!).This was a pretty racy film for its time, and Monroe plays the tramp brilliantly...some might say it was type-casting. Just watch her in scenes when she is walking away hurriedly...or rather watch her curves. Does anyone really walk like that????? And so, this film has something for everyone. The tremendous scenic beauty of the Falls, probably never photographed this well before or since. Strong acting by Cotton and Peters. The dumb-blonde beauty of Marilyn Monroe, and don't misunderstand me -- in the camera lens she was a real beauty.Well worth the watching, and it may well deserve a spot on your DVD shelf.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As long as you can believe that Marilyn Monroe would be married to Joseph Cotten, it's a very good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As my summary suggests, the basic premise of the film is that sexy and sultry Marilyn Monroe is married to nice but extremely ordinary Joseph Cotten. Now I know that Marilyn's character is supposed to be a slut who cheats on her husband,...but Joseph Cotten?! Aside from the odd casting, the film is exceptional in several ways. First, in the restored DVD version, the movie is breathtakingly beautiful. No other film I can think of has such amazing cinematography of the falls--or any natural wonder. The richness of the colors, the well-integrated scenes that look as if poor Jean Peters is clinging to a rock in order to avoid death and the great camera angles and composition are just amazing--even by today's standards. Second, the plot is unusual and for once, the film didn't remind me of other films--it was unique.On the negative side, there were a few things about the film (other than the casting) that were difficult to believe. The way that Peters took to Cotten and Monroe so quickly wasn't at all believable and Peters' husband seemed too stupid at times. But, these are minor complaints and the film is, overall, very exciting and worth seeing--nearly meriting an 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monroe, as dangerous force of nature, rivals the Falls themselves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Picturesque Niagara Falls, the honeymoon capital of the world, comes in two pieces: The American and the Canadian. Recent but not fresh newlyweds Jean Peters and Max Showalter (here, as Casey Adams) cross the border into Niagara Falls, Ontario on a delayed trip he won from his job. His prize-winning promotion was a turkey stuffed with shredded wheat, so small wonder he's more enthralled by the sight of the cereal's flagship factory across the river back in the states than in the majesty of the great, roaring cataracts.But the cabin the belated honeymooners had reserved hasn't yet been emptied of Marilyn Monroe and her "unwell," older husband Joseph Cotten. Obligingly, Peters and Showalter take another one, with a less spectacular view. But later that evening, Monroe and Cotten put on a spectacle of marital discord right in the middle of the motor court that trumps the sights of both the cereal plant and even of the falls. Unwillingly, Peters and Showalter become drawn into an eddy as lethal as any out in the whirling rapids themselves ? especially once Peters espies, in the Cave of the Winds, Monroe in a clinch with a hunk who decidedly is not Cotten. From then on, Niagara turns into cat-and-mouse game of adultery and murder....Had Hathaway kept his arc of tension more taut, Niagara might have been extraordinary. But the buffoonish Showalter is miscast, lending an untoward antic note, one amplified by the quite unnecessary arrival of his boss, complete with wife in tow (Don Wilson and Lurene Tuttle). Documentary and promotional material intrudes as well. Barely a tourist-trap goes neglected, from the Maid of the Mist to the carillon in the bell tower to the Cave of the Winds. And so Niagara joins that subset of mid-1950s movies that, with the democratization of travel and the pervasiveness of Technicolor photography, were in part turned into big and glamorous postcards boosting tourism to the locales where they were filmed (Dangerous Mission and I Died A Thousand Times come to mind).Deployed as a ditzy sexpot, in both walk-ons and starring roles, throughout most of her (brief) career, Monroe had another, possibly more powerful side. Though her husband (Joseph Cotten) is supposedly the mentally unbalanced half of the couple, Marilyn Monroe comes across as disturbingly ? dangerously ? unstable. It's the same kind of riveting unbalance that she projected the year before in Don't Bother To Knock, potent and unpredictable. And without her coloring outside the lines of how her character was sketched ? the conventionally duplicitous younger wife ? Henry Hathaway's Niagara wouldn't be half so absorbing. And in fact when she leaves the screen for good, and when the movie resorts to the high-adventure peril of approaching the brink of the falls, most of our interest has already left, as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marilyn and Niagara Falls: worth numerous "second looks"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this film a countless number of times and fall deeper and deeper in love with it every time I see it. This film was made in the early 1950's, 1953 to be exact and was one of the first chances for Marilyn Monroe's acting talents to blaze forth. In this film even though she receives "star billing" she is really only a supporting actress, appearing in only 3/4th's of the film. Still, I suppose the real reason people went to see this film was because she appears in it; the real star of the film is Niagara Falls itself. It must have really been something to be able to see this film on a wide screen in a old fashioned movie palace. The sweeping panoramic shots of the grandeur and majesty of Niagara Falls always manage to take my breath away...and yet I'm only seeing it on a 16" television set.The story itself is albeit a hokey one, but the stars they were able to get to play the roles really make this film worth numerous glances, if only to catch subtle nuances of movement and/or character depth. Joseph Cotton was the only "achieved" star at the time of this film's release and his portrayal of the wildly unpredictable George Loomis is enough to send chills up the spine of unsuspecting film buffs everywhere. But still, it is Marilyn Monroe who is this film's anchor. Her mysterious spell is cast from the first frame she appears in to the last. The scene where she sings "Kiss" while wearing that tight red dress is probably my all time favorite moment out of all her films (along with the "diamonds are a girls best friend" number from Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and "runnin' wild" from Some Like It Hot).This film is a worthy addition to the by-then fading "film noir" genre, even though it is shot in bright, vivid Technicolor (I assume). Even though, I'd love to see this in stark black and white if just to get the real "film noir" feeling of it all.My rating: 3 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>spoilers possiblyNiagara (1953) Dir. Henry Hathaway with Marilyn Monroe, Joseph Cotton, Jean Peters, Max Showalter. Monroe &amp; Cotton couple with serious marital problems after two years who are staying in a honeymoon cottage in Niagara Falls, Canada. Cotten may think they are there to rekindle their relationship, but Marilyn is meeting secretly with her lover and they are plotting to murder him. Jean Peters and Max Showalter are another couple on a delayed honeymoon who by default are entwined in the intrigue and are entertaining. Great juxtaposition in the cinematography between the beauty and the ominous power of Niagara Falls which looms over the film. The falls and there heavy rush of water provide a tangible impression that events are in motion, un-stoppable, and the results will be inevitable. The more traditional Noir archetypes of dark shadows thrown by window blinds and shutters are equally effective here when shot in color. Marilyn as the gorgeous femme fatale is an inferno, driving her neurotic husband insane with both the innuendo of her denial of intimate affections and indications of infidelity causing rages of jealousy.The film acts also as almost a seamless travelogue for Niagara Falls as the two couples visit all the tourist highlights of note. Its probably one the best of the color Film Noir. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Niagra Falls, so often a place of honeymoon love is the setting for this engrossing thriller directed as tight as a ducks bottom by the brilliant Henry Hathaway. With fabulous performances by Joseph Cotton, Marilyn Monroe and the classic beauty that is Jean Peters; the plot may be a simple one of an unfaithful wife scheming against her husband, thus garnering peril ire from the jealously unstable man, but it reaches high peaks regardless.Hathaway and cinematographer Joseph MacDonald breathtakingly weave the splendid location into the unfolding story. Something that simultaneously brings out the sensual beauty of the two lovely ladies whilst also keeping the sense of danger a constant factor. Now that the film has a had a restoration done to it, the Technicolour photography has a broody sheen to it, thus enhancing the mood, and Monroe's sensuality, within the piece. Peters, in what is the tougher part, doesn't let her character become secondary to Monroe's {even more impressive given Monroe's fine work and Hathaway's lingering usage of her}, so much so that when the edge of the seat finale arrives we the audience are fully involved. While Cotten as the tortured husband to Monroe's adulterous wife nails the duality of the character with maximum impact.Nature's power and raw human emotion comes crashing together in this early 50s little gem. 8/10</fullReview>

Anne Baxter was hired to play the part Jean Peters eventually played, but she became pregnant. Peters replaced Baxter and Monroe was hired for the role of the sexy wife (intended for Jean Peters.) Having seen Miss Peters in PICK-UP ON SOUTH STREET (with Dick Widmark), there's no doubt the actress could have done a tremendous job with Marilyn's part. The picture, nontheless, is full of suspense and director Henry Hathaway gives us some fabulous panoramic views of the falls. Marilyn is okay in this one, and Cotten does his best, but it is Jean Peters - in the less enticing role of the newlywed - that looks the most beautiful and does the greatest acting job on this one. Try to catch it on one of the classic film channels. It's worth seeing!</fullReview>

I agree all the actors were quite good and it was refreshing to see Monroe do more than her campy breathless delivery. I would submit that the Technicolor was fabulous. The scenery being majestic and incredibly powerful, was spellbinding. A lot of the scenes' compositions were astonishing and ageless--obviously this film influenced many who would come later. The scenes in the tower were ultra-noir--very dramatic with sharp camera angles, strong shadows but also a kaleidoscope of mesmerizing colors. The pounding sound of the falls, the reoccurring theme of the song along with the bell ringing added much to the film.All in all, I was totally taken in by the visuals and felt Hathaway did a great job, in fact, as good as Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blonde Bombshell ? a phrase that, to most of the world, defines one of Hollywood's greatest ever stars. A star that, despite a life cut short, remains one of the most famous and adored women ever. The actress I'm talking about can only be Marilyn Monroe. This 1953 thriller was one of her first major films and it's one that, along with "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" from the same year, solidified her status as one of the worlds most recognised and most exciting young stars. But "Niagara" is not a film that many would immediately associate with Monroe. A brilliant comedienne with timing second to none, yes. A beautiful woman photographed more than any other, yes. A brilliant dramatic actress with one of the most naturalistic and believable styles of the era? Surely not. But after watching this movie, that is a title that Monroe can claim to her list of other talents. Yes, her critics need to take note because ? shock of all shock, Marilyn Monroe can actually act ? incredibly well, as it happens."Niagara" is lush thriller with several stylistic tendencies leaning towards Film Noire, but it's not quite dark enough to be considered true Noire. Monroe leads as Rose Loomis, a beautiful yet deadly femme fatal who, bored with her husband, attempts to have him murdered. Her new lover (Played by Richard Allan) is her accomplice. Things start getting complicated when two newlyweds arrive on their Honeymoon, and through a series of events the tables turn on Loomis until her eventual demise. Monroe stars opposite Joseph Cotton, who plays her husband George. Whilst not as immediately hard hitting as Monroe, he turns in an excellent performance as the downtrodden and disturbed ex-Soldier, adding a gritty realism which is an integral part of the film's success. Jean Peters also plays beautifully as the curious newlywed looking for the truth, one that nobody, even her own husband, believes until it's too late. Max Showalter is one of the films few problems. Stiff and unconvincing, he does little to bring his character to life ? the film seems to go on around him, with or without him. Aside from this mediocre performance, the movies cast is right on the money. The stars seem to have a good chemistry together on screen ? particularly Richard Allen and Marilyn Monroe, who play their sordid love affair scenes down to a fine art. Despite the strong cast, this is very much Monroe's show ? but, considering the film was written specifically with her in mind as a star vehicle this was perhaps always going to be the case. Never the less, her performance is pure class from start to finish. There are several scenes in which she has to convey meaning and emotion with nothing but a facial expression. Faced with this challenge, many lesser actors would come across somehow contrived and unbelievable, but Marilyn's naturalistic performance shines through and there's nothing contrived about anything she does. She also looks at her most stunning, and her sheer ability to light up the screen and captivate the audience is reason enough to see the film.Even aside from Monroe, "Niagara" is a beautiful film. It's lush settings and lighting add a whole new layer to the film. The moody lighting is pure Film Noire and it fits in which the sizzling and tension filled dramatics of the plot incredibly well. Although very much a product of it's era, "Niagara" survives the tests of time very well, and it's tension and appeal are still relevant for contemporary audiences. It's sad that Monroe's career took such a drastic turn for Comedy and that most of the world will know her simply as the Blonde Bombshell and Hollywood Glamour Girl. Because, as she makes abundantly clear in this film, she was a powerhouse of dramatic acting. Who knows what more she could have achieved if only she'd had the right roles to fulfil her talents. "Niagara" is a beautifully woven film with lush visuals and excellence from it's cast (with an unfortunate couple bum performances). A classic suspense filled Drama with plenty going for it and very little holding it back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monroe Excels as a Very Bad Wife in a Torrential Noir Thriller in Technicolor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michelle Williams' empathetic impression of Marilyn Monroe in Simon Curtis's recent "My Week with Marilyn" piqued my interest in looking again at the defining moment in the screen legend's career. It turns out that one of her most surprisingly effective performances can be found in this 1953 potboiler which director Henry Hathaway turned into a feverish Technicolor noir thriller. Co-written by Charles Brackett, Walter Reisch and Richard L. Breen, it is definitely overripe melodrama played to the hilt, but what impresses nearly sixty years later is Monroe's atypical turn as a dark-hearted femme fatale. Known primarily for her innocent na?fs often in comedy vehicles, she is mesmerizing as Rose Loomis, a wanton wife who can't wait to get rid of her mentally unstable husband. Whether writhing under the bed sheets in the nude or showing off her voluptuous figure in form-fitting outfits, Monroe epitomizes carnality in a way that sizzles as much now as it did during the more strait-laced Eisenhower era.However, beyond the obvious, she plays a character far more clever than she was ever allowed on screen and is able to imbue her with the trademark Monroe vulnerability without ever compromising Rose's vile motives. Even though Monroe is indisputably the star of the movie, she is not the film's key protagonist. That role belongs to Howard Hughes's future wife, Jean Peters, a normally sultry actress whose own glamour has been tamped down to provide a more explicit contrast to Monroe. Peters plays Polly Cutler, the young, observant wife of an aspiring breakfast cereal executive who has brought them to Niagara Falls for a delayed honeymoon. Their paths cross with Rose and her husband George at the Rainbow Cabins. It's clear from the outset that Rose and George are having marital problems, and the Cutlers don't want to get involved. But through various circumstances, they get ensnared in Rose's subtle plan to destroy her husband and escape with her young lover.As the plot twists, George's obsession with Rose proves too powerful for the illicit lovers, and the inevitable complications ensue, all against the dramatic backdrop of the torrential falls. In a precipitous drop from "Citizen Kane" and "The Third Man", Joseph Cotten does what he can with his single-minded character since there isn't much nuance presented in George's motives or actions. Peters handles a tough role with a sharp, refreshing intelligence, but Casey Adams (later known by his real name Max Showalter) is embarrassingly over-the-top as her clueless husband. Regardless, between Hathaway's sure hand in maintaining the suspense elements and Joe MacDonald's stunning camera-work capturing the glory that was Technicolor and the power of the falls, this is solid entertainment elevated by Monroe's charismatic, inimitable presence. The 2006 DVD includes a fine full-frame print transfer and includes a brief restoration demonstration, a gallery of 21 stills, and the original theatrical trailer (which is strangely in black-and-white).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film deserves better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's missing in my mind is this movie wasn't an Alfred Hitchcock movie. But maybe AH wouldn't have done "Dial M for Murder" (1954) if he did this one. Who knows? Also, I read elsewhere that this film was edited heavily, so maybe we're really missing a true classic here.Certainly, Marilyn Monroe is fabulous in her role as Rose Loomis, a beautiful, attractive woman, but one whose morals are questionable and is a sociopath. The film isn't written as a star vehicle for her, but her performance just draws the viewer in and then grips the viewer. She was a great actress in addition to her beauty and sex appeal. I think her portrayal really puts the noir in film noir in this movie.Where it falls down somewhat is the portrayal of the Ketterings and the Cutlers after they enter the film. Certainly, it's an off-beat contrast to the Loomises, but I wish they played their roles in a more straight fashion than as comedy.Henry Hathaway was a pretty good director, but with the right cast and direction, this movie could have been an all-time classic. If someone found the deleted film and put together a collaborative Director's Cut version, it would be interesting watching.I boosted the movie to an 8 because of two of nature's greatest phenomena -- Niagara and Marilyn Monroe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>terrific movie, it reminded me of Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My father bought me the Marilyn Monroe collection on DVD and like I said lately I've been getting into Marilyn movies. Lucky enough, this collection has the essentials that I needed for Marilyn. Niagara turned out to be a fantastic movie and guess what? Marilyn actually could really act and have a normal voice. She didn't do her typical ditzy blonde act which was a nice turn of events.This is actually a dark thriller with some interesting twists in each scene. Marilyn and her husband are on vacation in Niagara Falls, they also meet a couple who they befriend and Marilyn convinces them that her husband is not only ill but also crazy. But she actually intends to murder him and run off with her lover. But things take an interesting turn when Marilyn faints at the sight of an unknown corpse.This is a terrific thriller that I really enjoyed and is one of my new favorite Monroe flicks. I would highly recommend this movie, especially for those thriller lovers out there. It reminded me a lot of a Hitchcock high suspense thriller movie and I will not forget it and will definitely watch it again.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Homage to Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On seeing this movie a second time I recognized a few things borrowed from the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcockm, as an obvious homage to the man. The first is the scene of Marilyn laying on the bed in the dark. The body in repose that expresses the lethargy of an evil heart is right out of the beginning scene in "Shadow of a Doubt," in which Joseph Cotton is the one on the bed. Having Cotton in this one as well confirms a connection between the two films. Also, the shots of the flashy shoes as a way of identify or misidentifying the characters is right out of "Strangers on a Train." Both of these were filmed before "Niagra." What surprised me, is that I thought the chase up the bell tower stairs was taken from "Vertigo" but that was filmed five years later. Maybe this was Hitchcock's homage to this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The evil side of Marilyn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being from Buffalo, Niagara Falls is only about 25 miles away, so I've always been rather fond of this movie. Marilyn Monroe, in one of her first significant roles, shows some range as the sexy but evil Rose, plotting to kill her mentally unstable husband. The plot is somewhat outlandish and Marilyn overacts a bit, but it's all great fun. Joseph Cotten is solid as Rose's husband and Casey Adams and Jean Peters are well cast as the honeymooning couple who are unwittingly caught up in the proceedings. Peters does a particularly good job as Polly Cutler. She's beautiful and brainy and, in my opinion, outshines Marilyn (in this movie, at least) with her performance. Too bad she more or less quit acting after marrying Howard Hughes. Also fun to watch are some great scenes of Niagara Falls when it truly was one of the world's premiere tourist attractions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the role for which Marilyn Monroe won the Photoplay Gold Medal Award for Best Actress of the year, an award which doubtless helped to secure the 20th Century Fox movie's top-grossing domestic income for 1952-53 of over $6 million. But actually, MM is not in the movie all that much. Not that it matters, because, if anything, her frequent absences give added zest to the scenes in which she does appear. Nor does it matter that her co-star is Joseph Cotten, an actor's actor certainly, but a man with little charisma. Hathaway and the studio wanted James Mason, but he was unavailable. As a second banana lead male, Casey Adams was reasonably but not overly personable and this suited his role as a go-getting but somewhat lackluster company man who didn't seem to deserve a spicy wife like Jean Peters. And as for Jean Peters himself ? helped no end by director Henry Hathaway who took no nonsense from his cast and actually placed her in real danger ? she gave the performance of her life as the imperiled heroine. Yes, although he could work equally well in the confines of the studio, director Henry Hathaway preferred location work and was renowned for his ability to get the best effects from moody natural locations. He really excelled himself with Niagara. No matter how any times you see this movie, and how familiar you become with its plot, it always comes across with enormous power and charisma.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Hitchcockian Film Not Actually Made by Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the 1950s crime dramas were usually shot in black-and-white, even though colour was increasingly being used for other genres such as Westerns or romantic dramas. The adjective in the term "film noir" derives as much from the "dark" monochrome photography of such films as from the "dark" deeds which make up their plots. "Niagara", however, is an exception, a fifties crime thriller which was filmed in Technicolor. A young married couple, Ray and Polly Cutler, arrive on holiday at Niagara Falls, where they meet another couple, George and Rose Loomis. Although the Cutlers seem idyllically happy, the Loomises obviously have a very troubled marriage. The attractive young Rose seems friendly and affable, but her much older husband is jealous, depressive and bad- tempered. Moreover, it soon becomes clear that his jealousy is well- founded. While sightseeing, Polly sees Rose passionately kissing a good- looking young man. Before long the Cutlers find themselves caught up in a drama of passion, murder and revenge. "Niagara" was clearly influenced by the work of Alfred Hitchcock. Indeed, when I first saw it I would have taken it for a Hitchcock film were it not for the words "Directed by Henry Hathaway" in the opening credits. There is the use of an iconic setting, with Hathaway using Niagara Falls in the same way as Hitchcock had already used the Albert Hall, the Forth Bridge, Westminster Cathedral, and the Statue of Liberty and was later to use Mount Rushmore in "North by North-West". There is the use of a prominent landmark building, with the carillon bell tower on the Canadian side of the falls playing a key role in the film. There is the use of a piece of music, with the use of Rose's "special song" paralleling that of "The Merry Widow Waltz" in "Shadow of a Doubt", a film which also starred Joseph Cotten. There is the "heroine in peril" sequence, in this case the cliff-hanger near the end in which Polly struggles to avoid being swept over the falls. And then there is the use of a classic "Hitchcock Blonde". Marilyn Monroe never actually made a film for the Master, probably because after this she never made another suspense thriller of the sort that Hitchcock specialised in, working more in comedies and musicals like her other two hits of 1953, "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" and "How to Marry a Millionaire". There is, however, a difference between most of Hitchcock's blondes and the character played by Monroe here. The characters played for Hitchcock by the likes of Joan Fontaine, Ingrid Bergman or Grace Kelly were generally virtuous heroines, whereas Rose Loomis is the sultry femme fatale, more akin to the characters played by the likes of Lizabeth Scott and Gloria Grahame in classic noirs.The weak link in the acting is Max Showalter (here billed as Casey Adams) who makes Ray Cutler particularly dull and uncharismatic. Fortunately, however, Ray only plays a relatively minor role, and the other three leads are all good. There is an obvious contrast between Monroe and the brunette Jean Peters as Polly, Monroe being flirtatious and seductive whereas Peters, equally attractive if not even more so, is quiet and demure. I have always thought it was a pity that she did not make more films before her acting career ended with her marriage to Howard Hughes. As for Monroe, this was the first film in which she was given first billing and the one which elevated her to star status. Although George Loomis ends up killing two people, he is very different to Uncle Charlie, the murderous psychopath played by Cotten in "Shadow of a Doubt". He can be seen as a man more sinned against than sinning, the victim of the treachery of Rose and her lover Patrick. Yet even Rose is not shown as wholly evil. She too can be seen as a victim, in her case of the failure of a marriage to an older man with a history of mental instability (we learn that he has recently been discharged from an Army mental hospital) whom she can no longer love. There is an ironic contrast between the miserable, doomed marriage of the Loomises and the happiness of the Cutlers.Hathaway's imaginative sympathy with his characters, even the villainous ones, is another link with the work of Hitchcock, who had an abiding interest in the psychology of evil. Men like Uncle Charlie, Bruno in "Strangers on a Train" and Norman Bates in "Psycho" may be deranged or evil killers, but Hitchcock is concerned not just to show them as they are but to show how and why they became that way. In its humanity, as well as in its techniques, "Niagara" is perhaps the most Hitchcockian film not actually made by Hitchcock. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really powerful, with two forces of nature: Monroe and Niagara. As she ecstatically croons "Kiss," in tight close up that lets us see a little of her bright red, low-cut dress, Monroe's Rose--great name--is truly as phenomenal as Niagara. We know that she is thinking of her lover--earlier in the film there is a shot of them kissing, mist-covered, near one of the falls. Her longing is so intense that she seems vulnerable and we can almost feel it in our own bodies. This is super melodrama and quite irresistible. Interesting contrast between the wholesome young couple, Jean Peters and Casey Adams, from Iowa (or Ohio?) and the spectacularly mismatched and dysfunctional couple played by Monroe and Cotten. Even for melodrama, the final meeting of Peters and Cotten on the boat strains credibility, but is satisfying in the way that it reiterates the unlikely bond that has formed between them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dangerously voluptuous girl must die in Niagara</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marilyn Monroe's first color movie,Niagara, attracts me at first sight. Because in this movie, she portrays a dangerously voluptuous girl, Rose Loomis. In contrast, her husband George Loomis(Joseph Cotten) shows us his unstable circumstances.I think her destiny was to die. Because she was so attractive, so voluptuous and so luscious that the rest of the people weren't ready to receive her charm.One thing I want to know is about her salary at that time. I heard that her salary was less than her make up artist during filming Niagara. I wish it wasn't true. If i were the director of Niagara, I would have been willing to pay her at least 1 million dollars. I think that it's not undue payment, come to think of her charm.Anyway, I think George had an unpredictably mercurial temperament and Rose doesn't have an understandable attractions to the others. Those two characteristics are definitely annihilated Mr &amp; Mrs Loomis' life. Also we can predict Mr &amp; Mrs Lommis' destiny. It was totally predictable by their dispositions.Whoever has watched this movie, could felt that Niagara was a very suspenseful movie. And Rose runaway from George at that scene, she wears a black suit. What does that mean? May be she must die. In western society, the visitors who goes to the funeral must wear a black suit. right?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, this seems like the kind of film Sir Alfred Hitchcock could have directed. Basically the main reason I wanted to see this film, and probably everyone remembers it, is because of the beautiful Marilyn Monroe. This was the film that people took more notice of her, and she became a star, and not long after she did The Seven Year Itch and brilliant Some Like It Hot. Anyway, she plays Rose Loomis, wife of the wily George Loomis (Joseph Cotten) who gets stressed pretty easily. On vacation in Niagra Falls, Polly Cutler (Jean Peters) and Ray Cutler (Max Showalter, as Casey Adams) find out that Rose's husband disappears, when he's actually spying his wife's affair with Patrick (Richard Allan). Soon enough, a man is found dead, and the police believe it to be Mr. Loomis, but it's actually Patrick. So now the Cutlers are forced to try and solve the mystery, help Rose, and i ends with the husband killing Rose and falling down Niagra Falls. Also starring Denis O'Dea as Inspector Starkey. You can really notice Marilyn's gorgeous figure in this film, with her curvy bum and wonderful breasts. Marilyn Monroe was number 39 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, she was number 6 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, she was number 3 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols (she could have been number 1), and she was number 11 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons.

		<shortDescription>Many consider this Monroe's best dramatic performance, on a beautifully restored print on DVD.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Part of the "diamond collection" of Marilyn Monroe's movies, "Niagara" was filmed in beautiful Technicolor, and incorporates the wonderful Niagara Falls itself into the story. The DVD includes a short "extra" which shows the comparison of the "before" and "after", and allows the viewer to appreciate the results of the print restoration process. At just around 90 minutes, this is an interesting movie that shows a side of Monroe we rarely saw. Somewhat of a "film noir."SPOILERS FOLLOW. Marilyn and her older husband (he found her in a dance hall) are at Niagara supposedly for a second honeymoon, but she is up to something sinister. She has a young lover she sneaks out to see and together they hatch a plan to kill her husband. He is supposed to go over the falls and, after the deed is done, her boyfriend would alert her by having the local bell tower play her favorite song. She hears the song, she reports her husband missing, a body is found along the rocks just past the falls, her husbands shoes go unclaimed where they are exchanged for boots at the falls, she goes to the morgue to identify him, and goes into shock. Turns out her husband turned the tables on the boyfriend, who ended up dead over the falls. After she leaves the hospital he stalks and kills her, and attempting to get to the USA side by stolen boat, bypassing checkpoints looking for him, the boat runs out of fuel and he goes over the falls to his death.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why does this wonderful film have such a small (though charmingly represented, the rest of you!) cult following? Not only is it an exceptional noir that manages to visually translate into gorgeously gaudy technicolor (only other example, 1945's "Leave Her to Heaven"), but it's Marilyn's one moment, and a finely acted one, of being an integral part of genuinely thrilling cinema. Think of the story telling, so unusual for slick journeyman dullard Henry Hathaway, how Hitchcockianly things progress without any obvious evidence of copying the master, likely because with all these perfect elements Hathaway just couldn't go wrong. The monstrous beauty of those falls affects every aspect of the plot, from the characters' psychology (those midwestern hicks being such splendid pivots, and won't their honeymoon accounts make them the cocktail party stars for years to come?) to murderous convenience, then the falls themselves just take over in the breathtaking finale, in a thundering horror that shows just what happens to those who, however accidently, trifle with them. I love this movie. I think I rated it, before starting and hurriedly, four stars but, while rethinking in the course of writing this, I hereby proclaim it a five. It's no critical favorite thus not for people of acquired cinematic tastes because you have the professionally astute to give you your guidelines, but for gut level lovers of movies, this could become a yearly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth Watching for the Pink Dress</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Niagara (1953)*** (out of 4)A honeymooning couple (Jean Peters, Max Showalter) arrive at Niagara Falls for some fun and relaxation but this doesn't happen when they meet another couple there. The adulterous wife (Marilyn Monroe) tells them that her husband (Joseph Cotten) is crazy and is likely to hurt himself. What she might really be hiding is that her and her lover plan on killing him but make it look like suicide but the husband might have a few of his own plans. NIAGARA is a pretty interesting little film that isn't a complete success but I think there are enough good moments to where you can overlook some of the silliness in the plot. I think the film manages to be entertaining thanks in large part to a terrific cast but also some beautiful locations that would have stole the show had it not been for an unforgettable pink dress. The movie is basically a big free for all on whether the husband will kill the wife or if she will kill him first. As the honeymooning couple rightfully puts it they're both off their rockers. I thought Cotten and Monroe both did a terrific job with their roles and it's certainly one of the best things I've seen from Monroe. She's very believable in her part and I enjoyed the way the film used her beauty as not just a marketing ploy but as something real and beneficial to the story. There are several early scenes where they like showing her without as much clothing as they can possibly get away with but the real sparks comes during a sequence where she's wearing this pink dress, which will certainly have your tongue on the floor. Monroe pulls off the sexiness very well but she handles the rest of the role without issues. Cotten has always been one of the most underrated actors in the history of cinema and he too offers up another terrific part. I really thought he played crazy extremely well and he also managed to make you feel sorry for it (as much as one can for someone married to Monroe). Peters is also extremely good in her role and I didn't mind Showalter too much either, although the screenplay makes him go a tad bit too over-the-top at times. The Technicolor really shows off all the locations very well and the cinematography is nice too. The ending is a tad bit old-fashioned and doesn't work as well as it could have but everything leading up to it is very satisfactory and this includes a very good sequence inside a clock tower.</fullReview>

Watching it, I couldn't comprehend why so-and-so was doing this and why such-and-such did that.If you want to see a Marilyn Monroe film, try "The Seven Year Itch", "Some Like It Hot" or "The Misfits". Heck, most of her films (as many as I've seen at least) are better than this.You kind of have to understand that at this point in her career, Monroe was just starting to get real recognition (this is debatable, however). She was contractually obligated to make so many films, and this was one of them.It wasn't a high point in her career for me.</fullReview>

While all eyes were supposed to be on Marilyn in this movie, I couldn't keep mine off from Jean Peters, especially during the final sequence when she gets caught in the boat with Joseph Cotton as it careens down the Niagara River out of control and heading for the falls.

		<shortDescription>Is this the first film to try and compete with TV?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is not that much that I can add to what has already been stated. The script is nothing special - competent but hardly outstanding. The cast, at the time of filming, contained only one star name - and Joseph Cotton's films of late were nothing great. The two rising starlets had ability and visual appeal - noticed by the business - but their names would only pull in paying customers a year or two after this film was released.Despite all of that just look at all of the people who have taken the time to comment on this film. It is memorable. It is significant. It simply must have something special. I can only assume that the film-makers were responding to the new challenge from TV. Why make the effort and pay extra to see a film if there was plenty of free(ish) entertainment laid on at home? The film-makers decided to lay on the visual spectacle in order to provide the draw. They clearly succeeded this with this one.Scenery had been important in films before - particularly in Westerns - but this is the first film that I can think of where it was central. It was not just a travelogue, although that aspect of it must have appealed to the audience, especially those living more than 500 miles from Niagara and it gave a close up view that postcards or books could not match. It would have been a "trip of a lifetime" to go there before cheap jet flights made such a trip attainable for most people. The formula seems to have been successful and has been repeated ever since.(Someone commented that the story a bit less elevated than one would expect of the "Eisenhower era" - but the film was released in February 1953, just a few weeks after Eisenhower was inaugurated. The outdoor location shots look as if they were done in September 1952 (not too crowded but the trees are still green). I suspect that all the studio filming was completed by the time of election. By the time all of the editing and distribution issues had been settled Eisenhower had arrived - and had no impact on the film!)</fullReview>

George goes missing and Rose is hospitalized from the shock. The Cutlers move into the cabin. George surprises a half-asleep Mrs. Cutler. Later at the bottom of the Falls, he tells her that he killed Ted in self-defense and now wants to disappear as a dead man.There are two stars in this movie. It's the power of Niagara Falls and the attraction of Marilyn Monroe. In another age, Monroe would have dined out as a noir femme fatale. She is magnetic on screen. She is convincing as a woman who could drive men crazy and Joesph Cotten embodies that madness. Every men turn their heads when she walks in and the camera focuses on her mercilessly. Jean Peters is a beauty in her own rights but she is downright plain Jane in her presence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average thriller in a superb setting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recap: A young couple, Polly and Ray, are spending a short honey moon in Niagara Falls find that their cabin is already occupied by another couple. That couple are not so happy, though. The woman, Rose, is notoriously unfaithful and the husband George is both jealous and aggressive. What George doesn't know is that Rose is plotting with her new beau to have him "disappear" in an accident. George doesn't die though, instead it is the beau that dies. But while everyone thinks he is dead, he returns to have is revenge. Polly sees him, but no one, not even her husband believes her.Comments: A thriller, possibly more famous because of Marilyn Monroe stars in it, than what it manages on its own. It is pretty short, and the set up takes up much of the time, so when the really exciting parts come, there isn't much time left. Actually there are only a few moments that have some suspense in them at all.The characters don't help either. All but three of them are acted way over the top. One is the Inspector and he has a very small role. The other two are the two ladies, Monroe as the scheming Rose, and Jean Peters as the only normal character in the movie. What disturbs me most is that Polly's husband don't believes her and treats her like she is insane, at least initially.Can't really believe the high rating the movie has received, and I don't really agree with it. It wasn't bad, but nothing I will remember for long.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie ever about the falls? (rental)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie brings a lot more than its cover: If you think, it's only a Marilyn movie, well, she is sharing the spotlight with other characters and as it's a mid 50s movie, she hasn't reached yet the late years when she was truly amazing. However, it's interesting to notice she embodies a "Femme Fatale", proving one more time that she was totally versatile and not limited to the naive happy blonde girl. So, there's another story here outside Marilyn that features a young couple and I found them really great. They had good chemistry and following their adventures was interesting as well. Next, the iconic location of the falls is greatly used. It's not only a postcard moment or a simple background because this place acts like a protagonist. In other words, if the movie would have been shot everywhere else, it couldn't have told the same story. What's particularly cool as is that the characters vacation in the Canadian part and as they do the American attractions, we really enjoy all the views and we don't miss anything. At last, this is a "old" movie which allows us to see a different time and in my opinion, a better one. Look at the cars, look at the fashion, you can see that the society had higher standard than now. And to push the nail, the climax is about a full action moment and the result is incredible and maybe better than all the actual CGI special effects! In conclusion, it's a terrific thriller in a splendid location with a talented cast!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie is absolutely NOT a murder mystery. it's just a plain old story about a girl who plans to murder her age-old husband for a younger man. this movie doesn't really belong to monroe, as she plays a minimum part.Still, it wasn;t all bad...good for timepass, not a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a mixed bag</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Niagara" is truly problematic film, with many pros and cons.First the pros. The cinematography is truly spectacular. The falls themselves are really the star of the movie, which looks like it was subsidized by the Niagara Falls Chamber of Commerce. The plot is an intriguing one - wife and lover plot to kill wife's husband, who winds up killing the lover instead. Joseph Cotten's presence benefits any movie he stars in. Many of the scenes are shot with a compositional style reminiscent of Hitchcock.Then the cons. Max Showalter, as other users have said, has got to be one of the most irritating screen presences ever. He simply cannot act, and that phony plastic smile makes you grit your teeth. Monroe is nothing to write home about either; she was never a good actress, except in cartoonish farces like "Some Like it Hot." Then are the plot turns that defy believability. Toward the start Cotten's character barges into a noisy party, grabs a record off a phonograph, cuts his hand in breaking it, and then storms off. Jean Peter's character goes for a first aid kit and follows him into his room to tend to his hand. Would anyone in their right mind follow someone into his room after such a display of uncontrollable violence? So it's a mixed bag. Worth a see despite its shortcomings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remarkable film in many ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike most noir films of the period, this was filmed in color, probably so that we could see travelogue-like scenes of Niagara Falls. It is worthy of Hitchcock as a thriller, although it was directed by Henry Hathaway. It may well be the only film in which Marilyn Monroe does something that could be called acting. Its only flaw is the grating performance of Max Showalter/Casey Adams as Ray Cutler, who goes through most of the film with a goofy grin on his face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw this on TV. Pathetic attempt to imitate the master of suspense (and his witty, double-entendre dialog). Monroe is hot...but can she act? Yes -- if you think that lip-trembling is acting. The only highlight in the entire film is Jean Peters, who does a wonderful job as Polly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is what films in the '50s were like...? Keep them</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nowadays you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a stodgy, fussy film critic who, yearning for the Golden Age of films, whines endlessly about vapid summer blockbusters that solely depend on eye-candy. It's great to know that vapid blockbusters plagued that age of film as well.Such is the case with "Niagara", an astonishingly suspenseless film noir where the eye candy in this case is Marilyn Monroe playing a bored femme fatale out to bump off George Loomis, her funeral dirge of a husband.This murder plot draws the Cutlers, a vacationing couple. She's a meek little mouse, and he's that worst type of nerd- the one who brays his jokes out loud because he thinks he's clever. He also subjugates his wife by convincing her that she's batspit crazy whenever the need arises- which it does in this film.Yes- Marilyn Monroe is very attractive. Yes- Niagara Falls is beautiful. But the PACING of this film is INTERMINABLE. We're never given a reason to give a fig about the Cutlers or the Loomises, and any time that could be used for character development is squandered on training the camera on Ms. Monroe as she performs the most mundane of activities.And just when we get sick of Annoying Braying Nerd, the film gives us... ANOTHER Annoying Braying Nerd. But larger. And LOUDER.My first warning of this film's stinkitude occurred when Gerd Oswald was listed in the credits as assistant director. Who is Gerd Oswald, you ask? Only the director of "Agent for H.A.R.M.", a crappy James Bond knock-off which was lampooned on "Mystery Science Theatre 3000". This quip of Michael J. Nelson's easily applies to "Niagara": "Gerd your oswalds; it's gonna be a rough one." 3 out of... No. No, there's too many positive reviews for this film. Folks, you can resume drooling over Marilyn once you've learned to call a spade a spade. 1/10.I'm gonna go wash out this "classic" with a healthy dose of "Sleepaway Camp". And I'll be the better for it.</fullReview>

Good location shots and all the old cars made the film that much better for me. Good performances by all, worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Niagara is a bad film. Marilyn Monroe is horrible and the entire cast as well. This film when not supposed to be funny is laughable and many of the scenes are just so bad it isn´t even funny. I am sorry to say this I like many of Marilyn Monroe films but this film is horrible. To see this film recieved 6.9/10 on the IMDB is beyond me. 2/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Niagara' is bad. It's probably the *best* of the three Marilyn Monroe films I have seen, so you can imagine what I actually think of her. It starts off good but falls behind as time goes on.I don't normally agree on statements made by other reviewers of Monroe movies, but I will agree on one thing and only one thing: the setting is perfect only because Niagara Falls is a beautiful place to visit. There, I've said it.Back to the film, the beginning caught my eye so I continued to watch, but then I realized that it had turned into nothing but a Marilyn flick (forget about the other actors...what other actors?); something of which I did not want to see. I still watched it only to regret my decision.The characters, even the one of which I'm supposed to sympathize with, are so not likeable. All of the actors are dull and seem as if they are on sedatives. Perhaps I should have slipped a few also. It's like they have nothing to work with. Who was the director again? Oh yeah, it was Henry Hathaway. Shame on you, Henry!The writing, the plot, everything has fallen through the cracks by the end of 'Niagara.' The peak of the so-called thriller doesn't amount to much and I can do nothing but smile when it has finally ended. So, the setting is pretty and appropriate, the actors and characters aren't entertaining, and it's basically a Monroe film in which everyone raves about but I complain about.PS - Marilyn Monroe could never act!</fullReview>
