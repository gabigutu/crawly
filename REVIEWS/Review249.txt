		<shortDescription>A raucous buddy comedy? and stuff.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure this film is going to divide audiences, in the same way that "Kingsman" did.It's 1977 Los Angeles. Star Wars has premiered. Disco is in full swing. And porn star Misty Mountains has just died (spectacularly). It's pretty disturbing then that dodgy licensed private investigator Holland March (Ryan Gosling) has been hired two days later to find Misty by the slightly kooky Mrs Glenn (Lois Smith, the equally kooky doctor in "Minority Report") who saw her through the windows of Misty's home. Never one to turn down a pay check, Holland takes the case and the trail leads him to search for a missing girl called Amelia (Margaret Qualley). This leads him right into the substantial fists of the 'heavy for hire' Jackson Healey (Russell Crowe), who's been hired by Amelia NOT to be found. But it's clear that Amelia is at the centre of a tornado of intrigue, since her mother Judith (Kim Basinger) is head of the Justice department and there are some heavies from New York and Detroit looking for Amelia too.As the film's tag-line admits "The Nice Guys" are "far from nice", and this is a sort of bromance buddy movie of the likes of "Lethal Weapon". (And that comparison is 100% valid since - and I honestly discovered this after I wrote that - director Shane Black ("Iron Man 3") got into cinema by writing the screenplay for the original "Lethal Weapon" back in 1987). But "The Nice Guys" has an edge that those films of the 80's couldn't have got away with. Subtle it ain't. There is a lot of violence, a bit of 70's porn and some fruity language that sensitive viewers may find offensive. (All in all, it's a bit of a surprise that it got away with a '15' certificate in the UK).But it's also insanely funny at times. Some of the sight gags are laugh out loud material (and I don't tend to act on that often in a packed cinema). You might recall in "Diamond's Are Forever" that a Vegas hood tosses Plenty O' Toole out of Bond's hotel window. "Good Shot" quips Bond. "I didn't know there was a pool down there" responds the hoodlum. The basics of this scene are given a fresh and wonderfully gory rework that is truly memorable.Gosling and Crowe have great chemistry together (although the degree of acting required by Crowe is debatable: he looks and acts like he seems to in most media interviews!) Some of their dialogue appears distinctly ad-libbed, which shows how comfortable they were with the roles. And Matt Bomer and Beau Knapp make memorably crazed villains. A role that unfortunately does irritate is Qualley's: the character of Amelia is supposed to be a bit crazed, but her speaking part is 120% off the scale.The acting star of the show though is young Australian Angourie Rice as Holland's morally-centred and bright daughter Holly, who steals just about every scene she's in. A young lady to watch for the future.1970's LA is nicely realised, with nice little subliminal drop-in shots: a Jaws 2 poster; Tower Records; the original Hollywood Tower Hotel. And the film naturally attracts some banging' 70's tunes to the soundtrack, with Al Green peerless over the closing titles.But it's not perfect. The plot is quite impenetrable (I'm still unclear exactly what the relationship between Misty and Amelia was). And Black's screenplay (written with Anthony Bagarozzi) over-eggs the pudding of the final showdown scene. But while it won't be to everyone's tastes, I thought it was a blast from beginning to end: a guilty pleasure of bad taste that begs for a sequel. I would go to see the Gosling/Crowe show again. One of the most entertaining films of the year so far.Please visit http://bob-the-movie-man.com to see the graphical version of this review and provide feedback on your views. (Thanks).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupidity as an Art of Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Nice Guys represents the buddy movie genre at its best. Shane Black is a excellent director and a brilliant writer. He knows how to create hilarious characters and how to put them in absurd scenes ? absurd in a comic way. The gags are all unexpected; I was constantly asking myself "What the hell is going on?", and then burst into laughter. The plot could seem weird at the beginning, but it's not the main point in this movie, it is only used to create a context to the jokes. People in the theater couldn't stop laughing. There is a new and original joke every two minutes. Russell Crowe plays his part very well, but Ryan Gosling's performance is already cult. All is in the look in his eyes, and that stupid expression on his face. Two stupid and impulsive men in an outrageous world full of porn stars and guns, fighting for...money. And truth, of course. Always the old truth about some kind of conspiracy (the only weakness in the movie). Hopefully, Shane Black doesn't insist too much on that and concentrates himself on the constant jokes. I guarantee you, you will laugh a lot. I know I've just watched an excellent movie when I feel sad during the credits, because it's already over. And then, it's just pure happiness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A witty, neo-noir caper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having divided cinema-goers after entering blockbuster territory with Iron Man 3, it's refreshing for Shane Black to return to the big screen with a much smaller scale film in the form of The Nice Guys. Starring Russell Crowe as hired enforcer Jackson Healy and Ryan Gosling as private eye Holland March, the plot involves the two attempting to find a missing girl named Amelia and uncover why several men are trying to kill her, with the pair soon find themselves caught up in a plot much bigger than either of them had originally anticipated. Functioning essentially as a 'buddy movie' which plays out as a neo-noir, The Nice Guys is a genre pairing that works beautifully thanks to the central performances and Black's script which is equal parts hilarious and clever.Set in 1977 Los Angeles, The Nice Guys cleverly cements itself within the period that the story takes place by referencing actual events. With the city being plagued by smog throughout the 1970s, car companies were urged to attach catalytic converters to their newer vehicles in an attempt to reduce pollution, and it's these facts that Black chooses to revolve his narrative around, as well as the growth of the porn industry and institutional corruption. Each of these components work in tandem to create a story which understands it's time period much better than the recent X- Men: Apocalypse, making it feel entirely necessary rather than a narrative gimmick, and allows Black to fully showcase his talents as a writer by utilising a historic period in such an effective way.No matter how effective this setting is, it wouldn't be nearly as enjoyable had it not been for the characters that inhabit it. Jackson Healy and Holland March may occupy familiar territory within a buddy movie, but Black's witty dialogue and fantastic performances from his leading men ensure that the film's protagonists never feel stale. Crowe and Gosling prove to be one of the best double acts in recent years, with the former giving his best performance in almost a decade and the latter displaying the full range of his comedic talents after dabbling with comedy in The Big Short and Crazy, Stupid, Love. Together, their characters exist as a flawed odd couple who manage to bring out the best in each other ? a trope of the buddy movie ? yet the way in which Black presents both them and their budding friendship/partnership is completely believable and hilarious.It's this hilarity that is present throughout the clever narrative that elevates The Nice Guys above recent buddy movies such as Ride Along, proving that films of this genre can have brains and humour instead of just the latter. Mixing slapstick with physical comedy and witty dialogue, Black has created a film which should appeal to a wide variety of people no matter what tickles their funny bone, and do so while telling an often complex tale of corruption in 1970s LA. It's this mix of comedic stylings that provides levity to some of the more violent scenes featured within the film and Black makes sure that the jokes are never too quippy or predictable at any point.Unpredictability may be a dirty word in Hollywood yet here, it greatly helps the film in terms of both the humour and the plot. As good and as funny as the two leads are, it's Angourie Rice that steals many of the best lines as March's daughter, Holly, which may very well be the most surprising aspect of the film. Though only thirteen, Holly is presented as being much more efficient than her father and often exists as his guiding light when his problem with alcohol gets the better of him, and as a young actress, Rice displays an incredible amount of composure amongst two of Hollywood's leading men. Plot wise, there's several twists and turns within the narrative that allows the audience to discover things as the characters do, which aids the mystery within the plot and ensures that each revelation is met with surprise from both those on screen and in the cinema.If there's one flaw to be found within The Nice Guys, however, it does also relate to the plot. While Black's script is clever, there are times when viewers may get a little bit lost as the investigation unfolds. This is partly due to Black's reluctance to include exposition heavy scenes which is, for the most part, a smart technique but one that can be troublesome in a film such as this. Filmmakers should never rely too much on exposition in order to tell a compelling story ? I'm looking at you, Nolan ? but if it is used wisely and incorporated subtly, it can be a great help when connecting the dots that make up the plot. A scene towards the end of the film that reveals the big picture to the characters and the audience does feature exposition that doesn't feel too heavy handed, proving that Black is capable of providing information through dialogue that sounds natural.Thankfully, the scene in question brings viewers up to speed before the thrilling, and often explosive, finale at the Los Angles Auto Show which provides a satisfying conclusion to the events that preceded it. With a new Predator on the cards for Black in the very near future, it's a pleasure to see him deliver a smaller film before he returns to blockbuster territory and reminds us all just how enjoyable a night at the cinema can be.A comedy with brains, Black's latest benefits from a superb script and great performances from Crowe, Gosling, and it's secondary cast members. When it comes to value for money this summer, you'll be hard pressed to find a film that can offer it quite like The Nice Guys does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Nice Guys is written and directed by Shane Black and stars Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe as two detectives who try to solve a case regarding a missing girl and the death of a porn actress in Los Angeles during the 70s.I'm a big Shane Black fan ever since my childhood, with Lethal Weapon being one of my all-time favorites. After that I followed his career, and I have to say, he is a really great writer/director. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is another great movie which he wrote and directed which some might argue it brought Robert Downey Jr. back in the center of the attention, and before the whole Marvel business started. Black is great at writing buddy comedies with crime and mystery touches and The Nice Guys is one of his best works to date.First of all, the two main actors, Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling, have an amazing on-screen chemistry. Crowe plays Jackson Healy, a by-the-book though guy enforcer type who you call when want to have someone taken care of. Crowe is now over 50 in real life, his age is starting to show, but he embraces that completely in this film. He is a little overweight and some of the action scenes he pulls might not look that believable, but he is absolutely perfect in this role. Ryan Gosling took a break from the more silent type roles (Drive, Place Beyond the Bines) which were becoming a bit too much for me and instead takes a comedic turn in this movie. He has some of the funniest lines, he gets in the craziest situations and yet there's also a dark side to him, having some drinking problems and at the same time trying to raise his daughter (Angouire Rice), who is wise beyond her years.The story itself is not the most original and unique, it doesn't really break new ground and you can solve the mystery on your own while watching the movie. As soon as one character was introduced, I immediately put the clues together. But that's okay, it doesn't really need to do all those things. We were not promised some original concept or never before seen plot, we were promised an action comedy that offers two great characters and a very clever script.What I truly love about this movie is how simple it actually is. It's not part of a huge franchise, it's not a CGI fest, there are no superheroes, there are no flying cars, we just follow two guys trying to solve a mystery. It really goes back to the 80-90s era, when we had some great action-comedies like the Lethal Weapon franchise or Beverly Hills Cop. It's a nice breath of fresh air with some clever dialogue, noir elements, good action and two perfect stars in the main roles. The Nice Guys is a nice surprise and it deserves a 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Nice Guys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll admit that I am unfamiliar with most of Shane Black's original works, watching The Nice Guys made me want to go back and take a look at his earlier films. The characters were well written, even better cast, and fit well with the theme of the film. There was rare a dull moment, it seemed I was either enjoying the dark comedic tone, or getting engaged in the plot. While the first two thirds of the film seemed excellent, the writers set themselves up for a fantastic finish, but were unable to capitalize on that potential. The script seemed to suddenly turn very basic, with things "falling" into place almost too miraculously to be true. I never felt like I had truly been given an ending worthy of a classic detective story, but the fast pace of the film and humor was enough to make it very enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Really liked this movie,all the way up until shortly after the one hour mark. Than it just took a 180 turn for the worse,and ended up getting really really stupid.Which was quite annoying.In the beginning it was funny and charming and full of good quips back and forth, between the two leads.Some of the situations was a bit over the top,but you could live with em,cause the rest of the movie held up fine. But than comes the one hour mark,and things start going down hill. Up until now,Russel has been the smart one and Ryan was the dorky drunk guy. But than suddenly they both turn into dumb and dumber.And that just ruined it for me.After that I lost total interest in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matching Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling in this awkward partnership actually works out very well, they are very true to their character, both a bit off in their own way, but together they really are the nice guys :)It is the funniest film I have seen in a long time and it really deserves a lot of credit for keeping a good story and not just relying on slap-stick humor, it has both subtle and loud comedy, it has action and something going on all the time, but above all it has timing and precision in the way it delivers the story and how the characters handle the different situations.Location, seating &amp; time: Kinopal?et, Lyngby, Denmark - Bio 3, row 9 seat 3 &amp; 5 - 27.06.2016 at 19.00</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tad disappointing given the fantastic trailers (which spoiled the film a little), but still a lot of fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'70s detective movie starring Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe, directed by Kiss Kiss Bang Bang's Shane Black. It is a ton of fun. There's definitely something missing that I'm not quite able to put my finger on - it really feels like it should be an all-time classic, but ends up falling short. There's some weaknesses in the script, like Black isn't quite able to make his themes work entirely. It has so much great stuff in it, though. The two leads are ace, both giving near-career best performances. Angourie Rice is also excellent as Gosling's teenage daughter. They do fail to establish a great antagonist, though bad guys Matt Bomer, Keith David and Beau Knapp are all memorable. Others who will remain nameless aren't as good. The film is very funny, thankfully, with Crowe and Gosling bouncing off each other nicely. It is true most of the best bits were given away in the film's two trailers. If you haven't seen them, you might enjoy this even more than I did. I'd definitely recommend it either way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shane Black doing what he excels at the most and doing it at the very best: "The Nice Guys" is funny, smart, action packed, violent, irreverent, thrilling and entertaining all at the same time without ever having tonal shift problems, it molds so many elements into one cohesive package that will give you a blast at the cinema and won't alienate you even with the sudden appearance of a giant talking bug in a car.What has to be addressed immediately is the fact that if there was ever a prize for best on-screen chemistry for 2016 the race is already over, Crowe and Gosling light up the frame with an overwhelming energy, this is something we haven't seen in quite some time. Their job might be overlooked and discounted by some, but this is nothing short of genius, the way in which these two actors bring to life this story is illuminating, their timing, their banter, their personal dynamic, it is all in the brilliant script, but what the two of them do is elevate it to levels that I think not even Shane Black could have ever imagined. I mean they just had to look at each other for me to curl up laughing stupid. They don't have a false beat. And when you try to look back and think of who was better as soon as you point to one, you feel like you've made the wrong choice. Crowe's stoicism is played to perfection and when he boils up it pays off incredibly. Then there's Gosling who is recently on a roll; he was a highlight of "The Big Short" and showed comedic chops I didn't know he had, then comes this film and if there was ever any doubt of his comedic timing believe me is dead. The way he moves is enough to make you marvel and laugh at what he's doing, he has multiple moments of physical comedy that had me rolling on the floor, not to mention his witty, smart-ass dialogue that he nails.And we aren't even halfway done with the cast yet, everybody in this film not only is cast perfectly, but kills it. Kim Basinger's casting as a callback to "L.A. Confidential" is a great choice, but then getting into the more important characters: Matt Bomer is terrifying as the cold blooded killer and it is so important to be so if you want to give the audience catharsis when the final showdown happens. It is great to see Keith David again on screen in this kind of supporting character role that he always, unequivocally shines in, he is truly one of the bests in my opinion, there isn't wrong he can do. Finally Angourie Rice is a revelation, she steels the movie from Crowe and Gosling so well it feels like this movie is about the three of them together.Now, all of these actors get the chance to do such amazingly inspired work thanks to Shane Black. His screenplay presents us to a group of characters that are brilliantly well written and developed and tied into a plot that is absorbing and crazy. I don't know if this film is better written or directed because the two crafts combine seamlessly in this picture. There are so many moving elements and Black keeps up with all of them without ever leaving the audience behind or making them loose interest. moreover the way the setting is used is breathtaking and I mean that literally. He makes these characters move through Los Angeles and between a million easter eggs that I'm sure I missed half of, the locations give the film a whole other level of fascination, it has one of the best party scenes in recent memory. The greatness lies in the fact that story and setting feed each other and couldn't be taken apart, bringing to life a visual feast for the eyes that is grounded in story and character.And there's still much to talk about: soundtrack, action and fight scenes, pace, cinematography, sound, all of these elements deserve a paragraph on their own. The excellence of filmaking in display here is in my opinion really remarkable. Does it have faults? Or course: it can occasionally digress into 70s visual extravaganza just for the sake of it, the plot is thrilling and all, yet come to really think of it, unfortunately, it comes apart slightly too easily, but these are all details that have to be addressed, yet they did not take away from the overall experience which is one of the funniest and most thrilling rides of the year that I cannot wait to check out again in the theater with a bunch of friend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American Public - definitely a "Razzie" Worst Picture contender</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers ahead. This flagship of 2016 summer movies is a steaming, nut-filled turd that will irredeemably poison two precious hours of your life.Russell Crowe headlines in the role of an archetype, sleaze-bag private-eye, but in his physical condition, he can only be cast as a character actor (Read: he doesn't get the girl). Indeed, there IS no girl, no heroine. Crowe looks like he's gained 200 pounds since "A Beautiful Mind," all of it around his waist, a sawed-off, bloated shadow of his former movie star persona. Crowe's bloodshot, watery eyes are suspended in a sagging brassiere of flesh (a tip o' the hat to Norman Mailer, who described Eugene McCarthy thusly in his 1968 presidential campaign), and he just looks like poop-on-a-stick. His barroom, gravely voice betrays his recent years of over-indulged intimacy with alcohol. Second-Banana Ryan Gosling behaves throughout pic like a barely pubescent teen who's stoned from his first doobie. These two seem like they can barely stand each other; there is zero chemistry between them in this dweeby, pre-teen fantasy of a buddy-flick."The Nice Guys" has no discernible goal except for Crowe and Gosling to rescue from a mob hit an obscure damsel named Amelia (the McGuffin of the film) who has less than five minutes of unremarkable screen time and who inexplicably gets shot to death half-way through the film, thereby removing any motivation for Crowe's and Gosling's further antics and gratuitous shootouts. If this synopsis of the "story" makes absolutely no sense to you, then you've gotten the gist of this aimless, nonsensical P.O.S.When I get tricked into seeing a film like this (the TV trailer was masterfully edited out of the very few humorous moments there were in pic), I feel like I never want to see another new movie ever again. Pic was so artlessly written and somnambulistically acted that you find yourself rooting for the black hats to finish these two unappetizing, unsympathetic morons off as quickly as possible. If you're looking for something better to do this summer than seeing "The Nice Guys," try sticking pins in your eyes. That would beat this stink-bomb in spades. Beware of the gushing reviews of pic. I think that the IMDb voting has been stuffed with for-hire reviewers who have sold their souls pimping this garbage. Jus' sayin'....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Laugh Out Loud Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Nice Guys is pretty much a buddy cop comedy, except instead of cops, they're a private investigator and a contract tough guy who find themselves both looking for the same girl, who's gotten herself wrapped up in political and pornographic intrigue. While there are a number of action sequences, The Nice Guys is focused more on delivering humour and jokes based around a couple of reasonably well-developed characters and a mystery that's a little absurd and off- the-wall.The comedy on offer here is quality stuff. The Nice Guys isn't just the latest Apatow or Rogen production that seems to just recycle jokes from other movies. Many of the jokes are well- thought out and some of them are actually clever. There's also a number of more slapstick moments, but none of them come as hammy, including the sight of Ryan Gosling fumbling with his gun and cigarette while sat in a cubicle. The comedy can be a little dark at times though, so if you like lighter laughs, The Nice Guys probably isn't your kind of movie. On that note, I was quite surprised at the amount of violence, gore, and nudity in play. Thankfully it's only gratuitous when it needs to be (which in this movie basically means for comedic effect). People do die, sometimes gruesomely, and there are a lot of boobs and constant talk of sex and pornography, sometimes from kids. Again if these kinds of things offend your soft heart, avoid The Nice Guys.Talking of kids in this movie, one of the earliest lines refers to how kids these days know too much and act too grown up. This is a subtle theme of the entire movie. The line in question refers to a thirteen year old girl who chats up a guy three times her age for some weed, and another scene has a kid on a bike talking about his big dick, but more prominently is Angourie Rice who plays Holly, the PI's daughter, and shows a massive amount of maturity in every scene, often showing up her father in smarts. I would love to see a sequel set a number of years ahead where we follow a grown up Holly continuing her father's work.The father himself, Holland March, is Ryan Gosling on top form. Most of the roles I'd seen him play were super serious ones, and his mumbling, tortured personas, while fantastic, started to grate. Here he is completely different. He's a silly, fumbling idiot a lot of the time, and provides the most laughs. His sense of comedy timing is perfect, and his slapstick antics are flat-out hilarious. That's not to mean that he plays the fool. In a lesser actors hands, that's exactly how March's character would have come across, but Gosling manages to balance all the over-the-top comedy with something a bit more grounded. While he shows a lot of signs of idiocy, he also shows some intelligence that helps us believe his role as a father and detective. Unfortunately I can't level the same praise on Russell Crowe who I can't decide whether he phoned it in for the paycheck, or tried too hard. When it comes to comedy, Crowe is Gosling's opposite; almost entirely unfunny, even when his lines do a lot of the legwork for him. He's not a complete failure, but he looks awkward and uncomfortable more times than he doesn't. Margaret Qualley as the missing girl is also a bit of a swing and a miss. Her hysteric lunacy comes off more as a hormonal teenager shouting things she doesn't really mean, than a girl who believes fully in her claims and is determined for the world to know what she does. Thankfully there's Keith David, Matt Bomer, and Beau Knapp who more than make up for her in the supporting side of things.I never really laugh out loud when I'm by myself, especially in the cinema, but The Nice Guys had me chuckling heartily with alarming frequency. It's not a perfect movie, not even a perfect comedy, but it's right up there amongst the best comedies, for certain. I found it hilarious, and that's all that really mattered. I give it a solid 8/10 and would recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Movie I've seen in years and I LOVE these guys!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailer alone sold me; Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling playing goofball 1970's detectives? I'm in! I should have stayed out. This is only the second movie in like 20 years that I've wanted to walk out on but we had friends present and I didn't want to make a scene (turns out they would have left with me). Ten minutes into this movie will tell you that this in not screwball comedy, it isn't a detective thriller and it isn't a throwback look at the crazy 70's. It could have been any of the three and been successful but the writer(s) couldn't make up their minds which way to go and you're left in a painful limbo where (1) the movie isn't funny (2) there's no suspenseful plot like a real detective movie and (3) you suddenly remember you taped several far more interesting things at home. The writing shows signs of being done by several different people who weren't talking to each other and wrote at different times. Such a shame.....the acting was actually pretty good. Don't waste your time:Run away from this dog!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film belongs in the trash with the writers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good idea for a enjoyable movie, too bad the writers do not have anything but a limited garbage vocabulary. No wonder you hear such trash language from society these days. What we see and hear influences our behavior. Guess the writers would like there 13 yr. old children to talk like this and be in those circumstances. Way to go, great role models. Obviously Crowe and Gosling have a garbage consciousness. Why do popular people always seem to do what is trendy instead of what is correct. Young audiences that view these type of films like to emulate the characters to be popular. Actors, writers, producers,etc, can bury their heads in the sand and pretend that their products have no bearing on the morals of society for the sake of profits, but they need to look intelligently at what they are producing. The era of truly great films is rapidly drawing to a regretful close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leaves a lot to be desired</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am trying to process everything I seen in "The Nice Guys." I think I am supposed to like it. At least that is what the critics have told me. However, I just cannot get into it. I am very "meh" about the whole film. I just did not find the movie that interesting. Shane Black and Anthony Bagarozzi's screenplay is just not filled with any compelling characters. I did not hate them. I just feel like they are not characters that I would want to see in multiple films. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling have fun with their roles and you can tell in every scene that they are in together. They play off of each other very well. However, they are not Riggs and Murtaugh. They are more like the Sam's Choice version of them. Angourie Rice, Matt Bomer, Keith David, Margaret Qualley and Kim Basinger rounds out the cast. If you are a fan of Shane Black's work, then you should check out "The Nice Guys." This is starting to become a trend where, for every two movies I see, the third I will not be impressed with. Sadly, "Nice Guys" was this week's recipient.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really do not know the reason of existence of this movie!! One of this moments you want to log in, to save everyone's else time. One of the stupidest movies ever seen. No reason of watching. I saw it because of the actors .. and wasted every minute of the movie. The plot.. stupid.. The funny part .. stupid. Trying to find some more lines to describe my waste of time in order to enter IMDb review laws .. But i cannot .. Such a pity about my time. If you have enough free time to waste go for a walk .. or even better take your neighbors dog for a walk. I didn't like anything in this movie. Cannot understand either the good reviews either the good rating in IMDb. Maybe i am the weird guy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't review a lot, and all of my reviews mention that I am easily impressed. I like movies like Last Action Hero or similar that tanked with critics.But this one ... this one I gave up on. I can't explain it, it was just bad to watch. You get thrown into a situation, people form bonds instantly, minors are suddenly super detectives and undercover agents ... this movie gives you so many set variables that you feel like you don't need to see anything evolve. I had no connection to anyone, I could not find any humor in it, despite it throwing it in my face. The whole time I thought "what am I watching here??"I am patient and I am easily pleased, but this movie made me walk out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Many reasons why I gave this movie 1 out of 10 stars:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1. My wife and I would have left after 10 minutes, had we not driven the other couple, who may never get to choose another movie for us to see, again.2. It wasn't worth the $12 (senior) price of admission.3. I hate movies where 2 buffoons cannot be hit by automatic weapons fire, yet the same gunman can take out the people who (to their own benefit) are written out of the script with one bullet.4. Ryan Gossling is a bad drunk, whose 13 year old daughter chauffeurs him around LA in a vintage Mercedes convertible, and talks about rim jobs. He survives more multistory falls than he deserves. He has the 9 lives of Bond, without any of the character needed, or warranted to preserve his life.5. How the hell did Russell Crowe take this part? He must be at the tale end of his career. How much weight did he gain to play this awful role.6. Way too much violence, and while the humor was good, I marveled at what kind of drugs the adults in front of us were on. Even the most moronic lines were hysterical to them.7. The daughter, cute Cybil Sheppard like looks for this 13 year old, watching pornos with the star of the porn flick? Is this what Hollywood has deteriorated to? The theater, a 16 plex, on a Saturday night at 7 was dead. Maybe that's because there's nothing good coming out of Hollywood.8. The premise, which is finally revealed about 75% of the way through the movie, why Amelia was being sought, was intended for na?ve supplicants of Kardashian voyeurism. So thin, as to not be credible to anyone with even a micro cephalic brain. No wonder the rest of the world is scratching their heads, looking at what being President of this formerly great nation has deteriorated to.9. Apart from the gratuitous violence, there is also gratuitous destruction of many late 70's era vehicles. Gossling and Crowe had a choice, these cars didn't. ATTENTION -- Classic car owners: Don't sell your cars to studios without reading the script too! It must have hurt to see these formerly well-cared for vehicles destroyed with a few key strokes from the screenwriter.10. I can't think of anything for #10, therefore the movie gets a one * from me (but I don't think that you can give zero stars ? 'cause I would have if I could have). I don't write reviews often, and I am not bulemic. Nice Guys has left me with a very bad taste in my mouth, that I can't get rid of, and so felt compelled to try to stick some fingers down my throat (literally), by typing this.If you need a really good laugh, rent Animal House, or American Pie. Watch some old episodes of MASH, or Frasier, or Friends, or Cheers, or Big Bang, but don't waste your time on this flick.</fullReview>

The slow slide down the toilet began when the 13 year old daughter gets corrected when she refers to a rim-job and ended with the writers keen comedic sense with the over-use of ". . . and stuff" WoW!!! Genius!I wonder, really wonder how hard-up Russel Crowe was to take this part. I wonder how many hours Ryan Gosling watched Dean Martin/Jerry Lewis' shtick to get his part.

		<shortDescription>Painfully Bad and Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally rented this film because of the good reviews that it had gotten. Lots of praise for the chemistry between the leads and it being a throwback to the good ol' buddy cop/PI movies of past. Wow! What a disappointment. One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Painfully unfunny, the film's plot is barely discernible and the story is just plain boring. Russell Crowe is still an actor I love (extra pounds and all) and he's the best thing about this movie because he basically plays the straight man and isn't trying to be a clown like Gossling is. I didn't care about anybody in this film. And, I'm tired of Hollywood glamorizing sexually precocious youngsters. Here, the 13 year-old daughter or Gossling's character is made out to be more mature than her idiot father. He's anti-porn and wonders what's happening with young people but the daughter is cool and has frank discussions about sex with porn actresses. Awful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Ravishing, Rambunctious &amp; Rollicking Ride That's As Thrilling As It Is Amusing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the writer-director of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, The Nice Guys is another ravishing, rambunctious &amp; rollicking ride that's full of laugh-out-loud moments, captures the magical vibe of the 1970s with finesse, balances the elements of comedy &amp; thriller in a seamless fashion, and is further bolstered by charismatic performances from Russell Crowe &amp; Ryan Gosling.Taking place in Los Angeles around 1977, The Nice Guys tells the story of a private detective who's hired to investigate the apparent suicide of a famous porn star. The trail leads him to a young girl who hires an enforcer to keep him off her. But when she goes missing, the two detectives team up to find her, only to later discover that the whole plot is far more complicated than they imagined.Written &amp; directed by Shane Black, the film brims with plenty of style, is downright witty &amp; makes excellent use of its resources for the most part. The first half is a laughter riot and presents Black at his best but the second half fizzles out of energy after a while plus the big reveal unfortunately isn't as rewarding as expected. Nevertheless, the narrative stays funny &amp; thoroughly entertaining.The 1970s atmosphere is brought to life with vibrancy, thanks to its outstanding production design, fitting costumes &amp; numerous pop-culture references. Cinematography also adds more richness to the story with its energetic camera-work &amp; exquisite use of bright colour palette. The first half is brilliantly paced but it all goes downhill in the next half. And the music further evokes the 1970s feel with its selected tracks.Coming to the acting department, The Nice Guys features a colourful cast in Russell Crowe, Ryan Gosling, Angourie Rice, Matt Bomer, Margaret Qualley &amp; Kim Basinger, with both Crowe &amp; Gosling stealing the show although Rice gets to have her own moments as well and does a commendable job in her given role. Crowe &amp; Gosling do chip in with strong inputs separately but their chemistry is even better and makes the whole experience all the more enriching.On an overall scale, The Nice Guys had all the ingredients to finish as one of the finest examples of its genre(s) but it just misses out on boarding that train, thanks to its less-refined second half that simply fails to live up to the expectations set by its previous act. It still bears all the hallmarks of a Shane Black feature, and is an incessantly fun, endlessly groovy &amp; powerfully alluring cinema that promises an equally thrilling &amp; amusing ride to all its viewers and delivers it in sufficient doses. Definitely worth your time &amp; money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I didn't find it as funny as others</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Critics and audiences alike have rated this movie and some of my friends really liked it, but I was disappointed. At one level, it's a retread of action comedy buddy films like "Lethal Weapon" which is not surprising since director and co-writer Shane Black penned the original "Lethal Weapon" in 1987. But clearly, three decades later, he feels that the humour has to be more absurd (interviewing mermaids?) and the violence has to be more visceral (choking a dying man?) and this is a combination which sat uneasily with me in spite of a sharp, wise-cracking script. Of course, as the eponymous private eyes of seedy 1977 Los Angeles, burly Russell Crowe, as the violent Jackson Healy, and slimline Ryan Gosling, as the more sensitive Holland March, have great chemistry and are very watchable, but some of the female roles - especially Kim Bassinger (remember her in "LA Confidential" with Crowe) and young Angourie Rice (an impressive film debut) - are more surprising delights.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wait. This was labelled as a comedy? When was it funny?Fine. I laughed maybe twice in two hours. And I suppose I recognized their brand of humor, I just didn't find 98% of it humorous.It seems Director, Co-Writer Shane Black really nailed the 1970s, but failed to make it wildly interesting. The movie wasn't bad, per se, it just was there. Something to watch and hope for something more exciting to happen?and stuff.A real "hit"man for hire and a greedy, subpar P.I. team up to kinda find a girl, but are more interested in solving the string of murders surrounding said damsel in distress. Or so, they think she is. Oh, and the smart, sassy daughter of the P.I. tags along because?movie.True, I am a Russell Crowe fan and not at all a Ryan Gosling follower, but the chemistry between the two was good and it did look like they put a lot of effort into this. I just kept thinking: the movie wants to be so much more than it is. It wanted to be a less serious L.A. Confidential, which, not coincidentally, also starred Russell Crowe and Kim Basinger.I guess if you'd like to see the tongue-in-cheek version of highly superior L.A. Confidential, this is for you. Otherwise, it's just there.***Final thoughts: Speaking of a less-serious L.A. Confidential, just watch Kiss Kiss Bang Bang which was like this but, again, far superior.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Nice Guys is just not working the way they intended it to</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You begin watching "The Nice Guys" and even in the first few scenes, you realize that there's something very wrong with this movie. As you continue to watch, you quickly realize that the awkwardness that reeks from every scene is supposed to be humor. At some point, I was asking myself if this movie isn't some sort of social experiment. Like they purposely create a disgustingly bad comedy movie, surround it with hype through an interesting trailer and their shill army, and then carefully measure the generated income. But then I realized we are way past that point. These sort of experiments had to be proved a success long time ago because now we are getting a steady stream of low quality content that producers know is going to sell thanks to this modern way of marketing. Thus, the conclusion that must be drawn is even more disappointing. The conclusion is that the producers of this movie haven't made it as bad as it is deliberately, it's just that this is their potential. This is what they have to show with that budget and those actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just terrible. Woeful script, terrible over acting, stupid premises that just needed to be accepted.Where to start? How about with Little Miss Sunshine. Go watch the first 5 minutes of it. In the first 5 minutes all the central characters are introduced, they are flawed but special... immediately you bond with them and care what happens to them. You are on board.Then watch this piece of dodo. In the first 5 minutes we are introduced to many of the main characters. We immediately could not care less about them as there is nothing alluring or special about them. Ryan Gosling is funny when he is simply trying to be cheeky and cute. When he is doing it in an understated way. In this movie, he is doing slapstick and its hopeless. Russel seems to think because Mel Gibson did action and comedy he can too. He can't. Just not funny. At all. Like, as funny as an abortion not funny.Oh woe is me the ridiculous scenes where 500 bullets are sprayed from a machine gun and they hit everywhere around the hero but miss the hero. Just tripe. Not funny. Not clever. Barely watchable. I watched it 3 days ago yet forget how it ended - perhaps its a self defense mechanism from my brain seeking to erase this terrible experience from my memory... or maybe the movie is just that forgettable</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...i mean after all, he's the guy who wrote and directed "kiss kiss bang bang"! he also wrote "lethal weapon 1 + 2" and "the last boy scout"...so by default one might think "here's a guy who knows his way around a buddy-action-comedy", right? so how did this happen? 90% of the time the humor/writing is flat and feels forced. the story feels aimless but is pretty transparent at the same time. what little chemistry there is between the main protagonists feels weak and trivial. the characters in general are boring and one dimensional.ryan gosling's character is "dumb".angourie rice's character is "bratty".kim basinger is "evil".margaret qualley is..."sleepy"? the only character i liked was russell crowe's. i mean there's not much happening with his character...no real arch or anything. he's just a mean but kind of likable badass. and the character is "working" mostly because crowe is the right guy for the part.one of the biggest flaws of this movie is that ryan gosling is simply miscast in this role. he's just not a funny actor. i have rarely seen more cringe inducing, awkward "comedy performances" in a single movie.it's really too bad...i can think of many actors that would have been a better match to play gosling's character and could maybe even do "something" with those bad lines and silly performances.the ending of the movie is totally pointless and random. it's just there as a last reminder that you just wasted 2 hours of your life with a movie that you have basically seen many times before. except this time people just couldn't be bothered to put any effort in.do yourself a favor and re-watch "kiss kiss bang bang" instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nice Movie. But not a great one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Was i hyped to see another California Noir written and directed by Shane Black? HELL YES.As a huge fan of his earlier film 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang', the idea of Black making another movie in the same vein filled me with anticipation. But while TNG hits most of the same notes as KKBB, in every single area it just lacks the same magic of the earlier film. In the end, i enjoyed it, but didn't love it. It starts with the casting and performances. Crowe and Gosling are good but lack the chemistry of Kilmer and Downey Jr. Crowe plays it fairly straight, as a stoic tough guy reminiscent of his character in LA Confidential. Gosling's performance is well....odd. He goes back and forth from hard boiled PI to zany broad physical comedian. Tonally, its just an odd performance. And along for the ride is his daughter, an all too precocious and worldly beyond her years 10 year old girl. Whilst her performance is OK, she really isn't needed and seems to act as a dramatic device when she is kidnapped or held at gunpoint by the bad guys. Also, the 'femme fatale', that is the girl they're chasing, happens to be a shrill, supremely annoying teenager with no redeeming qualities. When she meets her demise, i watched with almost glee. The sparkling, razor sharp dialogue of KKBB is also lacking. There are some genuinely funny Shane Black-esque lines, but they're few and far between, and it helps when you have Robert Downey Jr to deliver them. The story was altogether a bit too convoluted and messy, and i didn't really get a clear picture of the villain's motivations. The climactic shootout was also rather uninspiring and the ending rather unsatisfying. As a total package, TNG feels a little slapdash and lazy in its execution. Look, despite my criticism i did genuinely enjoy the film. But for me it was impossible not to compare it to KKBB, and note that in every single area, this was an inferior film. Definitely worth a watch, but i was expecting so much more.</fullReview>

If she ordered to kill her daughter, then why did she even hire the 2 misfit detectives to protect the daughter and possibly mess up her plan? On the other hand, if the GM CEO was the real mastermind, that would mean he hired the the hit-man. Then why would his bodyguards fight against the hit-man? And why would the mother continue to partner with the CEO despite killing of her daughter? Because the issue is the center plot of the movie, not having it resolved leaves us with just 3 people running around and risking their lives for no reason, and therefore a resulting mediocre movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've noticed some criticism around this film, people judging it poor, stupid, dull, whatever. But after seeing it's good rates from users and meta critics here, I went to the movies. I guarantee it was the best comedy I saw in the last years, can't even understand how people can not find it funny. The plot is good too, no doubt. I put it in the same kind with "The Big Lebowski", both with a not too worried kind of humor. I think that for those ones used to big plot twists or impossible/inscrutable situations which we see a lot on nowadays comedy scripts, maybe this one'll be a bit too simple (however it has it's own amount of unbelievable action scenes). The plot goes around one very truthful and smart situation on government illegal intervention in some matters, from the point of view of a idiotic investigator, who couldn't imagine the proportions one simple case of murder would get. I'd recommend it for those who can appreciate a uncompromised comedy, as it's not focused on investigation itself, nor in maintaining the seriousness that this matter could demand. Worth seeing, that's for sure. As a comedy, I give it a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Nice Guys" has some trouble finding its footing in the earlier scenes, but it becomes incredibly entertaining once it goes completely off the rails. When your story is about two shady characters trying to solve the murder of a porn star in the 1970s, I want everything in the movie to be ugly and slightly disturbing. Shane Black (of "Lethal Weapon" fame) has certainly managed that, particularly the current Russell Crowe is just perfect for a role like this. The plot is also slightly more interesting and unpredictable than in an average action movie, this movie has enough unexpected deaths to make you genuinely worry about the protagonists. Particularly for Angourie Rice, who just steals every scene she's in. The thing I loved most though is the incredibly dark comedy Black puts in throughout. It's not forced, it's not shocking for the sake of being shocking, it's just there because it's funny and it fits the rest of the movie so well. "The Nice Guys" is one of the funniest movies I've seen all year, infinitely rewatchable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was waiting for this movie to come out for a long time. With two of my favorite actors in it, I expected it to be a good laugh and quality movie. But to be honest, after five minutes in the movie I started to be skeptical and nothing changed later. With a kid being one of the lead characters in the film and cheap toilet and dick jokes, it felt that this is a movie for teenagers. And when I saw a professional killer with a machine gun who can never hit any of the characters and always aims wrongly, I was counting minutes for it to end. I was very disappointed and this film is below any average film you stumble upon. I recently re-watched Starsky &amp; Hutch (2004) and, in my opinion, there was much more tasteful humor, action and story than in this hopeless try to combine different genres.</fullReview>

I am in utter disbelief that IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic gave this lazy, stupid, evil movie funny decent ratings. Seriously, it's horrible. Some movie company execs must have spent a lot of money padding the pockets of critics and/or setting up a campaign to write fake reviews on websites. It is very possible to make a film that is satiric, offensive AND funny. This movie is brutal with its cheaply constructed slapstick humor, its pedophilia-humor and its contempt for women.

		<shortDescription>Hilarious! Lethal Weapon Meets Miami Vice Meets That's 70 Show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this trailer months ago and from the minute I first saw it I knew I was going to see this film. I knew I was going to love this film. I knew I was going to buy this film so I could watch it over and over again. I can count on one hand the number of times I felt that way just about a trailer. I'm writing this post to tell you that I was right. It was awesome!Now I did admit earlier that I see all Ryan Gosling films, but let me be clear, that is not the only reason I saw this film. I saw this film because I also enjoy Russell Crowe, love buddy cop films, thought the plot/script looked hilarious, and I mean just watch the trailer&#x1f600;The Nice Guys is about muscle-man PI Jackson Healy (Crowe) who ends up working with a drunk P.I. Holland March (Gosling) to learn the truth behind the death of the famous porn star, Misty Mountains. The case is made more complicated by March's precocious daughter Holly (Angourie Rice) and the realization that the government is involved in a cover-up and it all comes down to finding a young girl, Amelia.It's Lethal Weapon meets The Man From UNCLE meets Miami VIce meets That 70's Show meets its own unique style.It is obvious that Crowe is the action and Gosling is the comedy, but that does not mean they switch roles every once in awhile. It is a screwball comedy about two guys that really don't know what they're doing, and yet, cannot seem to stop. They keep tripping over clues and colliding into bad guys until they finally figure it all out.Admittedly there are some slow parts, I was hoping it would be consistently funny (like The Man From UNCLE remake), but it lagged in places. However, in terms of the comedy and overall enjoyment of the film I'd still give it an A (just perhaps on the lower end of the scale).What makes this film so funny is that during the parts that didn't lag, it was non-stop/back-to- back/can't-catch-your-breath funny. It's all about the little things. Such as March's drunkenness falling down a hill and stumbling onto a dead body, or March chasing after a bad guy only to smack into a car door that pushes him into another car hood that makes him trip onto the bad guy. The police work is a gamble and the violence is more lucky shots.For example: March and Healy are held at gunpoint by a "bad guy" (I'm avoiding spoilers), so March's daughter comes in and pours the coffee pot onto the "bad guy". Nothing happens, because Holly thought it would be hot coffee, but it had been sitting there for a while. Next the "bad guy" goes to take a step toward March and Healy only to trip on the cold coffee spill around their feet and fall, knocking themselves out.Somehow everything works out in their favor. Even though it is completely ridiculous you can't help but love it, because the film makes no apologizes and gives fair warning that it is ridiculous. That's part of its charm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Nice Guys was a movie which showed great potential. Crowe and Gosling work well together even with a dire script. The plot was at best very mediocre and many of the gags were predictable. This was a terrible let down to the film. What also didn't help was that it wasn't the clearest in terms of story lines. I will never tire of watching Crowe beat someone up but alas a great movie it does not make! The main protagonist who was being sought was also dull and to be quite frank it was one of the better parts of the movie when she got shot. The Nice Guys also tries too hard and there are echoes of such great movies like Kick Ass and Boogie Nights, which are never really pulled off in this film. It's not the worst movie you'll ever see but in my opinion I wouldn't rush to see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having, for reasons best known to himself, allowed his weight to balloon to Jackie Gleason proportions and contriving to resemble him facially, Russell Crowe elects to give us his Ralph Kramden crossed with Papa's Delicate Condition. It starts off very ho-hum with both leads somewhat at sea but gradually it becomes more watchable especially whenever Angouri Rice is on screen and effortlessly stealing every scene that isn't nailed down and even those that are. There's a passing nod to Chinatown in the idea of corrupt business interests albeit the main thrust appears to be an attempt to bring off a buddy-buddy movie that is only partially successful. Overall it's a passable diversion if light- years short of others in the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great American film with no American stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So we have the quintessential LA crime drama, starring two Australians and a Canadian...at this point, why don't we just admit that whole 1776 thing was just a fit of temper? Here's a riddle: Who is 15 and steals every scene from Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling? A: Angourie Rice. Who? Yeah, the kid who plays Ryan's daughter. Yet another Australian with a perfect American accent, this time only 15 years old. To say that she is perfect in the role is to understate things wildly. Unless she self-destructs, I think we're getting a preview of the premier actress of the next 20-30 years.As for the plot, it's a throwaway, so no point in wasting brain cells on it. But the interplay between Crowe and Gosling--and yes, also Rice--is excellent. They left the door open for a sequel, and as long as Rice is along for the ride, I'm in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Nice Guys is another perfect example of why Hollywood needs writers who have never seen a damn movie, ever. To begin with it's a period piece when there is really no reason why it needs to be set in the 70s. Change it to the present and nothing changes.So the formula is this: make zero sense, have groovy 70s tunes, add something about porno and child porno, throw in lots of stupid and gratuitous violence, have a stupid buddy thing going on, and try to hit upon as many clichs in the genre as possible in the allotted time. The shoot-outs were just dumb. At one point a huge palm tree is felled by machine gun fire yet nobody is hit. I gave up caring about the story after ten minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The trailer was so much better than the film. Incoherent plot, mumbling dialogue from Ryan Gosling and barely there acting from Russell Crowe. These two actors are capable of so much more and it is a shame the way they stumbled through this rubbish. I should have asked for my money back, but I doubt if anyone would listen. Stay away from this junk and look for a movie with some acting, a plot, and actors who care about the movie they are in. The actress who plays Ryan Goslings daughter ( Angourie Rice) stole the whole show. Watch out for her in future, she is going to be a star. I guess I am getting old and jaded, but movies lately seem to have gone off an artistic cliff. Special FX, car chases, CGI and shock tactics seem to have replaced story lines and acting. Look at the King's Speech, no aliens, no CGI, no car chases, just a good human story and good acting. I suppose the majority of viewers are more interested in visual stimulation than a real story so this will do well, alas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I should have been on high alert when the studio changed the trailer. the second one was better. the story is two guys looking for a missing girl. Russell is a tough guy and Ryan is a detective. I know what the screen writer was going for-laughs-unfortunately these two aren't comedians and can't deliver funny lines. they have absolutely no chemistry together. Ryan has a young daughter who is thrown into the mix, and in many instances the atmosphere is inappropriate for her age group. I guess that is supposed to be funny. I enjoy these guys very much as actors, so I was disappointed. I realize movies are subjective and I notice the 8+ rating. I also noticed that if this is a success there will be a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most surprising films in years!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a start i can't believe that I missed this film in the cinema and am I now regretting that decision considering how unbelievably good this film is. The main reason for me to take a look at this film months after it had been in cinemas is the two main leads, Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling. Both of which are amazing actors and are just fantastic in there respective roles in the film, they play of one another in the film so well it really shows that both actors genuinely get on with each other. As for other actors they are all great however there is one who in my opinion rises above even Crowe and Gosling and that is the character of Holly March played by Angourie Rice. She is brilliant in every scene she is in whether it be insulting her father or giving advice for a con, this actress has great potential to go on a do great things. Turning our attention away from the cast and to the story and director, both roles which where filled by Shane Black. Once again this very talented director has hit it out of the park, the script is absolutely brilliant and there is never a dull moment in this film. Whether it be the banter between Holland and his daughter or to Jackson the lines that the actors deliver are amazing and perfectly timed, especially Hollands random quotes about Adolf Hitler. As well as the script that Shane Black helped to write the directing in this film is simply unique and brilliantly stylised, it probably really helped Black to write and direct this film. I would like to mention that "people" these days say Hollywood isn't making original films anymore and that only franchise films will be made. However a film like The Nice Guys is original and was made and unfortunately from what the box office results are know body bothered to go and see it, I know I'm guilty of that as well. This really makes me sad and it is also sad for this film because it 100% deserves a sequel but will probably never get it. There are some films around that have conned their way to multiple sequels without any of them being any good...divergent..cough.....Finally I would like to say that this film in my opinion is the best of 2016 so far, this film is such a surprise you will not be disappointed if you see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fast-paced, intelligent and laugh-out-loud comedy thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Long before the term 'bromance' was coined, 80's and 90's action cinema was treating audiences to buddy movies, stories centred around a crime that would pull two opposite side of the spectrum together, causing them to disagree and bicker before finally learning that team-work is key. While desperate TV stations are attempting to re-boot various famous titles from this era with usually awful results, writer/director Shane Black is still around to remind us what made these movies so great to begin with. After all, he was behind some of the best of them - Lethal Weapon (1987) and The Last Boy Scout (1991) - and he's proving there's still plenty of life in the genre yet with The Nice Guys, one of the funniest films so far this year.Naturally, a convoluted plot brings together the two heroes of the 70s-set story. One is a grizzled fists-for-hire, Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe), who pays his bills by warning grown men who should know better to stay away from underage girls, traditionally with a knuckle- duster to the face. The other is Holland March (Ryan Gosling), a terrible private investigator who takes jobs from dementia-ridden old ladies who pay him to find the missing husband often resting behind them in an urn above the fireplace. His precocious daughter Holly (Angourie Rice) may also be a lot brighter than him. Despite their flaws, Healy and March are 'nice guys', and when their paths cross searching for a missing porn star, they decide to get to the bottom of a strange sequence of events because it's simply the right thing to do.There's a conspiracy-laden plot to keep things ticking along, and Black has fun trying to unravel it along with our heroes. The film begins with a young boy finding his father's porn stash and sneaking a peak at centrefold Misty Mountains (Murielle Telio), before a car crashes off the road and into his backyard. Lo and behold, the driver is Misty, and the kid covers up her naked body as she dies. March is put on the case by the actress's aunt, and is soon on the tail of young runaway Amelia Kuttner (The Leftovers' Margaret Qualley), who is somehow caught up in all this mess. Only Amelia doesn't want to be found, so she pays Healy to get March off her back. Of course, the deliberately implausible story that brings our two heroes together - and what comes after - is simply an excuse for Crowe and Gosling to exercise their sparkling chemistry.I've never seen Russell Crowe appear to be having so much fun as he does here, and he shows off some impressive comedy chops as the lovable lug who will always put himself in harms way to protect the vulnerable. Even more surprising is Gosling, an actor who hasn't really capitalised on the promise of his iconic role in Drive (2011), but who embraces the goofy scumbag-ness of his inept but endearingly well-meaning single father, a man we first meet inadvertently slashing his own wrist open while trying to routinely break in through a window. Yet the biggest plaudits go to Shane Black himself who, after a blip with Iron Man 3 (2013), is back to his Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005) best. He delivers a fast-paced, intelligent and laugh-out-loud comedy thriller, with one or two genuine shocks thrown in for good measure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I saw this on a whim, and truthfully I was more than pleasantly surprised. The story was reminiscent of the Cohen brothers' best work. It has all the elements of a great comedy from good one liners and incredible sarcasm, to standard physical comedy and slapstick. Ryan Gosling was at the top of his game as a cowardly dead beat yet clever PI, and Crowe shines as a charming thug. The backdrop of the 70s porn scene works so well with the movie since it gives us something even more sleazy than the main characters themselves. The dialogue is so clever at times I wondered if it wasn't being add libbed. Good luck choosing a best quote with so many to choose from.</fullReview>

The characters were depicted by the leading actors in an amazing way. I really liked Russell Crowe that showed some of his comedy talents that were apparent already but I think that this was the first time I really enjoyed him in such a movie. Ryan Gosling was better than I expected, not that he's not a good actor but I was afraid that Crowe would overshadow him, which did not happen in the end. A really nice movie to watch, from another time with really nice costumes and overall a nice approach. Would really recommend for a relaxing evening with some laughs. The only downside was the plausibility of some things that happened in the movie that could be avoided keeping it more realistic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."The Nice Guys" (2016) is sometimes hilariously funny, sometimes to much focused on unnecessary things, but always entertaining. Script by Shane Black was good, not original, but good for what it is. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling have great chemistry together and interaction between these two really work. Action scenes were good and almost always darkly funny - very funny actually. Now there are some unfocused plot elements that prevented me to giving this truly entertaining movie higher score, nevertheless if you like "Lethal Weapon" series, you should definitely watch "The Nice Guys".Overall, "The Nice Guys" is good, fun entertainment. Seeing Kim Basinger and Russell Crowe together again on screen (even for a short time) since classical "L.A. Confidential" was very pleasant - they have some great chemistry together on screen which is simply hard to explain. Still, not everything worked in "The Nice Guys" superbly well, nevertheless this is a fun entertainment with far more positive then negative.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not sure into which category to put this movie. I am aware that they were trying hard for the film to be funny but for me it was only on several occasions. Thriller elements were kinda good but far from real action/thriller movies. As for the drama elements - it can be discussed as there is a personal drama going on with one girl in the film. So, combining all the genres into the film... you get not a bad movie but not much interesting either. I must say that Russell and Ryan were really good in the roles. But the little girl - Angourie stole the film. I think she was really awesome and believable. Kim, on the other hand, seemed absent even when she was talking.Must say also that half way through the film, I could not really get why or who or what is going on with missing girl Amelia. And the whole dead porn star M M thing was kinda ... weird. But I do confess that the whole porn industry of the late 70's thing was kinda cool. Not bad, but it was not brilliant either for me. I rate it seven.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film tells the story of a private detective and a street thug, who teams up to investigate the disappearance of a porn star. The deeper they dig, the dangerous it gets."The Nice Guys" is a powerful draw as it has two strong and popular leaking men. The two guys have vet different personalities, and they team up reluctantly for money. Ryan Gosling's character provides much comic relief through many many mishaps. The plot is somewhat intriguing, but it doesn't engage me or thrill me. Maybe it is because I don't quite agree with the portrayal of the young daughter, who does a lot of age inappropriate things. Even though she is smart and brave, I wish she could just have a bit of childish innocence. Overall, It is an alright film, but I don't think there is nothing particularly memorable about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.I had high expectations on this movie. Ryan Gosling and Russel Crowe in a criminal detective story that oozes all the little things that made the 70's the 70's. I have to bow down to the fact that the production and acting is in place, almost perfectly. After the end, the expectations missed the target. Yes, I am disappointed. There is humour, there is class, there is a solid performed story and acting. I just think that the total crew behind this film should have twisted something into this movie, for them to discover. Shane Black and Anthony Bagarozi had a story to tell, and wrote it well. Shane Black had the heavy army of actors to switch on to the picture. Can a director with great cast fail even so? Yes. Did Shane Black that? No. He delivered, plain and simple. Could have squeezed the cast much more. Some scenes is little light in comparison to the depth of the story. David Buckley and John Ottman has done a tremendous job regarding the music! Throwing in Kiss and other known stars to be discovered throughout the movie. Entertaining! To the point. Was the movie bad? No. It could have been a lot better. Now I am settling with a good movie, for my entertainment perspective.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Very well made and is top notch speaking of the time the story is related to. Music, commercials, clothes... everything is in place. Very well made, indeed! Splendid! - The actors : Splendid! (One word that I use now and then.) - Entertainment : The high class of subtle humour and situations becoming both extreme and odd (a detective having his 13 year old girl as a tail?) creates entertainment. - Age : 15. Nudity, sex and violence. (And Ryan Gosling speaking to a gigantic bumble bee.)6,4 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment. 6 Nice production. Good movie.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Likable buddy-cop slapstick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following on from directing the superhero sequel Iron Man 3, The Nice Guys provides a typical buddy-cop comedy with two mismatched misfits ? the nihilistic world-weary enforcer Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) and the ditzy rookie private investigator Holland March (Ryan Gosling). Set in the smoke-filled world of the 1970s Los Angeles porn industry, The Nice Guys provides a comic take on the sleazy world.Jackson initially targets, then teams up with Holland and the comedy is derived from the chalk-and-cheese characters working together on a case involving the suspicious death of porn star Misty Mountains and the disappearance of the daughter of a Department of Justice official. Alongside them for a lot of the film is the daughter of Holland March which provides some comic back-and-forths but mostly awkwardness in having a minor involved in adult industry setting.The Nice Guys is at its best when it takes advantage of the comic chemistry between Crowe and Gosling, a scene involving the fumbling gun while trying to keep the cubicle door open- unfortunately spoiled in the trailer- is a particular highlight. Throughout, Gosling's hitherto undiscovered talent of physical comedy is on display here.That said, the plot was incoherent and I didn't buy into the story at all, however the film was salvaged by the several belly laughs provided throughout.</fullReview>

Having a child actress get a role like that is really something else. Crowe and Gosling made an incredible team together. Overall, much more memorable than I initially expected and I'm surprised that it seems there isn't more hype or talk about this.

And a few of the characters are downright annoying.The good part is, it's still a fun movie. Russell Crowe as a streetwise, knuckle-crunching, mercenary bad guy really works. And Ryan Gosling plays an entirely believable not-overly-bright private detective. The interaction between those two was the show. Most of the other stuff got in the way.The soundtrack was wonderful and all of the mid-70s trivia was just perfect.The end of the film - with the detectives teaming up in a new co. seems to set the stage for a "Nice Guys" franchise I guess. If that's really the case, the producers need to get some better writers for the next episode if they expect this formula to work again. But this first time out was a lot of fun.</fullReview>

I think he's probably a little like me, big movie fan, probably a fan of real good westerns. And also, Ryan Gosling. His good looks have overshadowed how good an actor, and how much range he has. So you put those two together and I bookmarked this movie about 11 months before its release. And it didn't fall short of expectations. The pace is great, the dialogue is great, and the leads have great chemistry and "do the script its due" Gosling as a broken alcoholic single father, juxtaposed by Crowe's hit-man with feelings is an uplifting duo. Matt Bohmer is great casting for a bad guy. The face that guy has an evilness to it.I'll just finish this with a thank you for those involved for making an true to genre original story where no one drops the ball at any part. I'm giving this an 8 cause its isn't The Thin Red Line, or LOTR, but like I said I felt very satisfied. Gosling's stache is a little corny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Nice Guys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My appreciation for screenwriter Shane Black dates back to the year 1987, when he wrote Lethal Weapon. Almost 20 years later, he impressed me with the brilliant Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, his debut as a director. Since then, he has written and directed projects such as Iron Man 3 and the TV pilot Edge, which despite being entertaining, weren't able to reach that exuberant energy and chaotic narrative style which starts being diffuse, in order to later earn focus with an amazing elegance and precision. His most recent film as a director and co- screenwriter, The Nice Guys, attempted to duplicate the magic of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, but it fell short due to some questionable dramatic decisions and an excessively indulgent sense of humor which rarely harmonizes with the "serious" subjects of the film. Nevertheless, The Nice Guys managed to keep me entertained and interested, despite not reaching my expectations. To start with, it counts with two excellent actors with a perfect chemistry with each other as a pair of "losers" who work in the most sordid strata of Los ngeles in 1977, even though with big differences in their particular motivations and professional ethics. That generates a likable interaction in which Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe exploit their respective abilities to find new angles in the friendship/antagonism between their characters, making their scenes together feel natural and credible. And I also have to mention the young actress Angourie Rice, who also makes a very good work in her role; and even though there are occasions in which her character doesn't feel very credible, it isn't her fault, but the screenplay's, because it places her in highly improbable situations, where the plot can advance only through ridiculous coincidences which reveal the laziness from co-screenwriters Black and Anthony Bagarozzi. Thinking about it well, that applies to all the characters; instead of designing some creative method to save the detectives or the girl from a sure death, or find a new clue which contributes to the investigation, Black and Bagarozzi prefer the answer to magically fall from heaven. That's what I liked the least in The Nice Guys; its tendency to solve everything with a joke in order to hide its lack of ideas. I'm complaining very much, but, as I previously said, The Nice Guys held my attention without the slightest glimpse of boredom, because the story is interesting and Black's direction is visually interesting, but without neglecting the substance. Completing the "retro-noir" puzzle, we find actors such as Matt Bomer, Keith David, Gil Gerard and Kim Basinger in brief, but full of personality, roles. And, after all, that's what helps us to overcome the cons of The Nice Guys to some point: a honest and naughty personality personality at first sight, but with multiple character studies below its surface. That's Black's specialty, and that's why I will keep expecting his future movies with interest. But I hope he brings more care to his next screenplay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nice Guys is a film you can enjoy but does not satisfy. Crowe &amp; Gosling are really good in their roles but I felt we needed to know more about there characters and lives. The virtually alcoholic private investigator (Gosling) with a 13 yr old daughter. I was left puzzled : Why was he virtually alcoholic? Why did his house burn down? What happened to his wife? Why is he such a loser? You know even less about Crowes character. Which is a shame as they both worked well together and it makes it interesting being set in 1977One is searching for Amelia (Gosling)The other is paid by Amelia (Crowe) to stop people searching for her. The first half of the film is good. Why are people searching for Amelia, including some who intend to kill her. But for me, the second half of the film was ruined by a pretty stupid plot, which I will summarise as follows. Amelias mother (Basinger) is head of justice department. She (Basinger) is in cahoots with car manufacturers to cover up excessive pollution from their cars.Amelia outraged makes a 'porn film' that exposes all of this. She intends it to shown at the 1977 car expo to reveal all the dastardly dealings. Basinger is having everyone involved in the film killed, including her daughter Amelia and all copies of the film destroyed. I know it's pretty stupid. Which is a shame because Crowe and Gosling did such a good job. There are plenty of laughs, you start the film with high expectations, But 'Nice Guys' doesn't know if its a comedy, a thriller or a film with a serious message. So ends up a disappointing 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After gifting us the original team up of Riggs and Murtaugh in 1987's Lethal Weapon (as screenwriter) and combining the services of Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer in the fantastic 2005 cult hit Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (as writer and director), Iron Man 3 director Shane Black has now added the successful team up of one time pin up boy Ryan Gosling and the increasingly gruff Russell Crowe to his resume in the fun, colourful and Coen Brothers like The Nice Guys.A 70's set dark comedy with inklings of a pulp like detective tale that involves everything from pornographic actresses, blue faced goons, talking bees and Ryan Gosling on a toilet, The Nice Guys weaves a quite complicated tale of mysteries, murders and questionable investigating work into a film that at its core often fly's and sometimes fails off the back of Shane Black's witty scripting work, the fantastic use of the 70's landscape and most importantly, the winning combination of the inventive pairing of Crowe and Gosling.Clearly relishing the opportunity to play each other's foils, Gosling and Crowe are the best they've been in years here and while Gosling has shown his comedic chops in films like The Big Short and Crazy, Stupid, Love, Black un-tap's a fun side to Crowe we haven't really seen before even though some could claim ventures like The Good Year and Mystery, Alaska tried to show off a lighter side to the phone throwing adopted Australian. The Nice Guys is Crowe's best work in sometime and it's likely his future roles will try to harness his lighter persona that works so well here, even though Gosling steals most of the films best singular moments.Speaking of stealing, young Australian actress Angourie Rice who was first seen in the worth checking out These Final Hours makes a huge impact to The Nice Guys fortunes with a fantastically judged turn as the wise beyond her years daughter of Gosling's often bumbling Holland March, Holly, and considering it's no mean feat to outplay two Hollywood heavyweights, Rice could well be "the next big thing".A sharp, fun and engaging mixture of comedy and mystery with a healthy dosage of violence, The Nice Guys isn't ground-breaking stuff and some of the potential jokes within the film sadly fall flat but as whole this energetic and colourful vehicle driven by Black's wit, Gosling and Crowe's fine pairing and Rice's star making turn, this is easily one of the year's easiest to like cinematic diversions.3 ? swimming Nixon's out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I seem to be one of the few people that didn't think that Shane Black's directorial debut "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" was the amazing, underrated film that so many others had it pegged as. In fact, I thought it was t=rather mediocre. With that said, when I first saw the initial trailer for "The Nice Guys" I thought it looked fantastic and couldn't wait to send the link to as many of my friends as I could. I wasn't disappointed.While not all the jokes necessarily landed with me, I can't deny that the majority of them had me laughing aloud in the cinema. The plot was entertaining and the stellar cast had me hooked from the outset and, while the plot was absurd and larger than life, that just added to the charming tone of the film and made the roller coaster even more fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shane Black (the Lethal Weapon series, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Last Action Hero) wrote (with Anthony Bagarozzi) and directed this combination thunder and hilarious spoof of a tow guy crime film and wisely chose Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling to be the pair du jour to pull of this zany and entertaining film.A mismatched pair of private eyes investigate the apparent suicide of a porn star in 1970s Los Angeles. Jackson Healey (Russell Crowe) is a fixer who fixes things with his fists. Holland March (Ryan Gosling) is a cop who following his wife's death became a drunk, a sometimes-present father to his very bright daughter Holly (Angourie Rice). He would become a P.I. who takes on weird cases. He is currently working for a woman (Lois Smith) who wants him to prove that her niece a porn actress (Murielle Telio) is alive when everyone knows she died recently. His investigation takes him to a girl named Amelia Margaret Quailey) who avoids him. She then hires Healey to tell him to leave her alone which he does. But later some guys go to Healey and want to know where Amelia is. When he handles them, he asks March to help him find Amelia. They learn that Amelia's boyfriend, a filmmaker, was killed and his house was burned down along with the film. They later learn the Porn star's producer is also dead. So what is going on?.a complex plot to show the world a film about corruption and greed. It is always surprising when directors and costumers go to such extremes to recreate a period (the 1970s Los Angeles) and yet allow such oversights as the au courante five o'clock facial hair that would never have been around so ubiquitously during that time. Now that the porn industry is everyday news that portion holds no secrets, but in the 1970s? But those are small issues in a film that keeps us entertained from the first scene through an hilarious men's restroom scene (Ryan Gosling is extraordinarily funny) to the last expected explosion/bang-bang close. Kick back and just prepare for some belly laughs. Adult themes throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unexpected and thoroughly entertained retro comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It all began from this year's Oscars, I saw this pair for the first time and I knew its their film promotion strategy. So I went to look for the full details and I thought I'll end up as another silly comedy like 'Daddy's Home'. That's why I did not bother to check it out its teaser and trailer, but now I feel terrible for my crappy judgement. Because this was an awesome movie, definitely not just in the comedy category, but overall one of the best films of the year and it should be in everybody's top ten or twenty and nothing less.It is a retro type film that takes place in the late 70s, LA. Where two private investigators unlikely come together to probe a mysteriously reappeared porn star from the dead as what her aunt says. But later that connects with another high profile missing girl case and so with all the leads, these two goes the length risking their lives to solve it. The remaining story reveals whether they succeed or end up as the losers.It was from the director of 'Iron Man 3' who wrote it keeping in mind as a television series, but later turned into this beautiful comedy. The first thing is I loved the Ryan and Russell's performances. They totally nailed it, especially Ryan Gosling in many comedy scenes. I think I laughed a lot and better after a long time. That's a surprise, you know, I did not think they can do comedies, but they're beyond all the praising words.It's not just two of them, there is a mini 'Nancy Drew Reporter' kind of character. A teen girl joins them in the investigation and her part as well had a great impact on the narration. You would think you can predict the story, but it is a well written screenplay with many twists. Everybody did their job so well, even the two hours did not look too long, but went very quick. The cast, crew, production, all must return for a sequel and I hope it will happen very soon. A must see film, but for the grown ups only.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An enforcer who always gets his job done pairs up with a lousy alcoholic detective to locate a government official's daughter. What seems to be a simple job turns out very convoluted as they accidentally discover something sinister is at large.With such a basic and tired premise, The Nice Guys managed to hit all the highs and the lows of a buddy cop movie. Both Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling handled all their given materials perfectly. Angourie Rice also did an excellent job portraying Ryan Gosling's character daughter who snoops around her dad's job. She didn't overtake the two main characters, but she also got a chance to shine. There are multiple laugh out loud moments and some decent action portrayed (and some nudity), and the movie managed to also score a nice emotional touch to the characters. There may have been some played out tropes and old movie tricks, but with clever dialogues and top-notch delivery, you wouldn't mind getting past through all of it and have some genuine, tear-inducing laughs.Definitely one of an excellent buddy cop movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice movie Guys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely loved it. And how can't you love it? Shane's Black new work brings enthusiasm. Two completely different male characters are cooperating to find a missing girl. ''The Nice Guys'', two bizarre and outlandish guys and a half of a woman (March's daughter) are searching for the gone girl and sooner or later they'll realize that&nbsp;a conspiracy scheme is behind everything. First of all, Shane's Black script is gorgeous, with excellent humor, zero clichs, and the proper action. The whole vintage style and scenery, plus the great characters, renders the film quite special. But I think it's all about the humor. The film is not inherently a comedy, but mostly due to these special characters the joking is astonishing and thus it's tending to a comedy. Shane Black knows how to set a maneuverable plot, thus making the film intriguing, with itself- examinations and conclusions in the end. But the film's highlight is beyond a doubt the protagonist duo. Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling have an amazing ''buddy'' chemistry. Especially, the second's one performance is incredible. As a big Ryan's fan, I didn't expect anything less from him, but the truth is that it's the first time he performed an entire comedy interpretation. The outcome? He is simply delightful. His role reminds me himself in real life. So what if the years go passing by, Russel Crowe is still great, despite the extra weight. The action-comedy movies is a famous genre with few successful attempts, though. The Nice Guys could be definitely considered as, a diamond of this genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Nice Guys is a hilarious action-comedy film starring the unlikely duo of Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling, and they really don't make them like this any more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In The Nice Guys, Ryan Gosling plays Holland March, a private investigator/swindler/single father. Russell Crowe plays Jackson Healy, a self- employed enforcer who will just about beat up anyone for money. Their lives cross when Amelia (Margaret Qualley), a girl they've both been tracking goes missing. The two join forces to try and find her, as they cross bad-guys and uncover a larger conspiracy, all while forming a friendship that their otherwise clashing personalities wouldn't allow.The story of the film is it's weakest point, but only because it seems overly complicated. There's a dead porn-star, a missing girl tied to that scene, government conspiracies, shady gangsters and so on. It's not hard to follow, however a more basic story would have served the film better, as there are some plot points in the film that leave you with questions that need not have been asked. There are also some very coincidental plot points added to serve the purpose of the story, which were quite obvious and took you out of the film a bit.Story aside, it's the characters and the performances that really shine. Crowe and Gosling form a mismatched pair, on paper and on screen. However the dynamic between the two appears very natural, bringing out the best performances out of each actor. Not only that, they're very funny, when alone and together on the screen. The supporting cast of colorful characters are all great as well, with Angourie Rice, who plays March's daughter Holly stealing the show.Shane Black deserves all the credit in the world for writing and directing such a fun film, the like of which has universal appeal, with lots of action, humour, twists and turns. It's a throwback to buddy-cop movies like Lethal Weapon, which is no surprise considering Shane Black wrote that film as well. He's also nailed the look, tone and pacing of the film, with its 70's era setting and neo-noir feel.While The Nice Guys won't ever achieve the classic status of a film like Lethal Weapon (which set the bar back in 1987), it will take you back there, providing you with all the same elements that made that film and others like it great. Where the film faults in its story, it makes up for in its excellent characters, performances, action and humour, offering you a highly entertaining and funny viewing experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has a little bit emptiness to it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Crime is supposed to be an engaging platter. Unfortunately The Nice Guys doesn't score high in the riveting department. It goes really light at times where the call of the hour is to depict tangibility, au contraire, goes full savage where we could have lived without. There is an element of surprise at most places where you feel the flick's true flair working magic for it. But then there are times when it simply falls flat.DIRECTION OF THE NICE GUYS There is a certain unpredictability about Shane Black's direction which makes his style of film-making undoubtedly unique. Grinding humour into serious situations is something that he uses immensely. However, it wasn't the real genre that forms the basis of the tale. It's the 1970 LA crime scene that does. It takes two booming industries in the backdrop to narrate its telling tale ? porn and automotive, and tries to bank on a bigger government conspiracy to cloud its offense.To top it all, we have Ryan Gosling to do us the honours. His Holland March is a rare character with qualities of fun, subtlety and disgust all written in a single leaflet. He showcases a rare finesse that makes his character the most admired one. Contrasting his character is a grimmer Jackson Healy portrayed by Russell Crowe who is kind of okay in his shoes. Both make an unusual pair who aren't really nice and yet so, as they try to figure out the mystery of the missing girl. But do they have the chemistry that we wanted? The answer is no! WEIRD EMPTINESS AND DISCONNECT The plot is well written as it unfurls slowly into precarious trenches of foul play. The Nice Guys is pretty dark suggestive of Shane's magnificent style again. But the movie tried to sell itself on humour in the trailers which was actually kind of belying. All the laughs that the trailers packed in were the only ones the movie had. You constantly feel there is something missing and you could taste the hollow as connections don't really connect you.Melodramatic substance is fairly missing, something Shane isn't really a fan of, I surmise. So, you can't take anything seriously, or expect to feel for any losses. Frames get gashed at unpredictable junctures which question the editing of the movie profusely. Yes, the editing isn't that great.However, there are two things that are constantly working for The Nice Guys ? The plot and Ryan Gosling! Remember at the end The Nice Guys isn't a fun movie. It is serious stuff just metamorphosed into fun by some Shane spices.Read all my reviews here: http://straightfromamovie.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AViolent Screwball Bromance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a bromance bashed up with an action film and whipped into a kind of armed screwball comedy. It stars damned slowly because the critical parts are so far apart, but thereafter it moves along in sprightly fashion, syncopated to much gunfire (the great shootout is the most delightfully non-lethal since 'The Grand Budapest Hotel'). Ryan Gosling paly a professional, licensed private eye who, despite his ineptitude, is rather snooty toward Russel Crowe whose roles is that of muscle-for-hire with occasional heart of gold. After the latter whacks the hell out of the former, clinically breaking his arm in the process, they begin to come to an understanding and find they're on, like it or not, the same side of the same absurdly complicated case. Slam-bang: lots of fisticuffs, a couple of killings, enough blood and plenty of mindless fun. Ryan Gosling is especially good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nice Guys resembled a Pulp Fiction type of vintage. Russel Crowe and Ryan Gossling suavely portrayed super sleuths. Angourie Rice delivered the role of female sidekick. Kim Basinger played another overly-controlling female character. Margaret Qualley acted as the rebellious one. Clever quips brought out the relationships among the cast. Costumes and dresses from a by-gone era, like Yaya DaCosta's dress in the climax, gave the scenes an authentic look. A soundtrack of hit musical throwbacks helped set the ambiance. Dramatic plot-twists kept the pace of the movie at par with murder mystery movies while the script integrated humor to lighten the premise. The result created a detective comedy for mature audiences!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sexy, violent and funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I seem to have spent a large part of the last few years devouring late 60s and 70s cult, exploitation and giallo and finding the cinema of today less and less appealing. Generally speaking it is the current trend towards aiming movie product at young teens that seems to have created the giant gap. To compound the problem, for me, so called 'adult' films seem to have to be 'serious' films and dealing with certain 'important issues'. All well and good but I can't be alone in wanting a little action without apology and humour without worrying if someone might get upset. So, much the same way as I have enjoyed box sets of TV shows like Life On Mars and Ashes To Ashes, I very much enjoyed this. The magic devise adopted by the TV production company was to set the series in the past and thereby get round the whole politically correct business and this film set in 1977 Los Angeles does the same. Russell Crowe is fine as the ruthless, almost humourless hard man and Ryan Gosling particularly effective as his 'partner'. Amazingly for a US film the kids are great and Angourie Rice a revelation. She didn't put a fourteen year old foot wrong and helped enormously in making this retro comic neo noir work so well. Sexy, violent and funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to The Nice Guys and boy am I glad I saw it before it stopped being shown. It's glorious.It's just great watching. Comedies are usually good fun (assuming they're quality comedies and/or don't star Melissa McCarthy), but The Nice Guys carries with it the aura of the funk, the sex, and the mystery ? bringing everything to the max. It's in-your-face in its ridiculous aesthetic, or simply its whole shtick, but perhaps what it does best is use quality comedy writing and acting to carry across a lot of stupid comedy, but not always straight into your schnoz comedy ? as a lot of the jokes are down to clever writing and are a little more subtle. However, the best laughs in the film explode into your face, like the blood spurting out of March's (Ryan Gosling) wrist and rotting corpses are thrown around. But although the film is full of stupid jokes, it is not totally stupid; as it revolves around a gripping plot that works wonders for the movie ? keeping it going at all times. Therefore it is forgiven in the occasional moments where scenes are dragged on for slightly longer than necessary. Occasional.The soundtrack also helps The Nice Guys, as it's all funky-ass beats to fit the time period ? although it's unfortunate the Chili Peppers didn't come up because it was calling for it. Of course, the boobs also help. And although Russell Crowe's American accent is a little awkward, he and Ryan Gosling are a great pair for who are two deeper than you might think characters in March and Healey. Other cast members like Angourie Rice are also impressive in the film, and she, in particular, may help Milo to get along with child actors a little more (and no, Milo is not a pervert, he just doesn't like child actors, and her performance was good so it could prove to him they're not all bad).In conclusion, from the very start I knew what I was in for with The Nice Guys. Stupid, fairly obscene, and really enjoyable watchin'. It could stand up as a classic comedy of this decade, even, and is the best new film I've seen this year so far. If you get a chance, watch this film. You probably won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gosling and Crowe make for a great duo in this Shane Black directed sleeper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Nice Guys" is written and directed by Shane Black, and is a send up of 1970's detective movies, but with a unique humor all of its own. Set in Los Angeles, 1977, Ryan Gosling plays private dick Holland March. He's not much of a detective, and accepts jobs from senile clients, extorting them for extra money. But eventually, a case he's on is connected with the disappearance of Amelia Kutner (Margaret Quailey), a girl who doesn't want to be found. Amelia hires Jackson Healey, an enforcer (Russell Crowe) to stop the P.I., but the two eventually team up when they have a feeling there's more to the situation than meets the eye. Especially when it potentially involves the murder of a fading porn starlet.Starting off, the period details in "The Nice Guys" is fantastic, accurately capturing the 70'e with it's production design, art direction and choice of music. Black, and his co-writer Anthony Bagarozzi, take special care to make the whole film have a tremendous sense of fun, while also juggling a serious plot to do with cover-ups, conspiracies, and a dozen murders. Gosling is the foil to Crowe's smarmy straight man, and the two play off each-other with great aplomb. They wouldn't be together under any other circumstances, but they're stuck with each other, and that's where most of the humor comes from.Another excellent character is Holland's daughter Holly (Angourie Rice), who's cunning intellect and sense of right and wrong help anchor in her sometimes reckless father. Rice's acting and characterization make for a child performance that seems realistic, but also likable and endearing. The plot was engaging from beginning to end, and I never found it predictable. There was a bit of a lull in the pacing near the middle when a character reveals a hidden truth that sets up the third act (no spoilers), but otherwise the pacing was excellent, and every line of dialogue was well thought out, and never without purpose."The Nice Guys" is a movie that I've been looking forward to since I first saw the hilarious trailers, and it lived up to the hype it's gotten. It's a shame that it hasn't made much of a return at the box office, raking in only $5 million in profits, and having to compete with massive brand name blockbusters (Captain America, Warcraft, The Conjuring), but I'm certain it'll secure itself in history as a future cult classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Nice Guys is a great crime/comedy film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Nice Guys was directed by Shane black (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Iron man 3) and stars Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling who are both private eyes during the 1970's in Los Angeles. The plot synopsis of this film is that both characters are a mismatched pair of private eyes who investigate the apparent suicide of a fading porn star in 1970s Los Angeles.The film is great due to its both funny and charismatic two leading roles, The Nice Guys pays homage to many other buddy cop films such as Lethal Weapon. The setting of the film which is in 1970's LA gives the film a retro postcard version of LA during this era, Black captures this version of LA through a very bright and vibrant use of Mise en Scene and lighting. Right from the offset you can tell the films soundtrack has been handpicked perfectly and if you are a huge fan of 70's music then you will most likely want to purchase this great soundtrack after watching the film.Now onto the acting and the films characters. Both Crowe and Gosling give good performances, especially in terms of how to execute comedy as the two characters and actors completely bounce off each other and their relationship is what most holds the film together. I found both actors in this film very funny and being from the U.K. I am usually skeptical before seeing a Hollywood comedy as the humour is different but i did find myself laughing throughout the film, although some gags went over my head. All in all you could not have Crowe's brutish character without Gosling's clumsy and hopeless character and Shane Black did a great job at bringing these two characters together.The plot of the film is quite complex and in the end it did pay off and I was satisfied in the end. The narrative deals with murder, mystery and it also takes so twists and turns, it very much reminded me of a comedy version of Chinatown and it is evident to see that The Nice Guys is heavily influenced by Film Noir and Neo Noir which is one of my favorite genres of cinema.Now on to some of the issues that the film has. I found that some of the jokes and gags were too much and that they should not have been played on so much but other than that I did find most of the film funny. It seems that with a film dealing with subjects such as porn and nudity that having a child in the midst of all this activity is basically a green light to show as much naked women as they want as it appears as 'child friendly', I know the child is placed in these situations due to Gosling's clumsy parenting choices as he feels out of touch with his daughter since his wife died but I found that involving the child in most of the action in the film seemed rather pointless and out of place in a crime/ mystery film and for this reason The Nice Guys felt too child friendly and maybe even it is fair to say too self aware of itself.overall I would rate The Nice Guys 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Nice Guys" is a very amusing detective story set in the stylish 1970ies with a mischievous detective duo, who has more luck than brains, and a touch of porn and violence.Ryan Gosling, who played the personification of coolness in "Drive", now shows his humorous side by playing the over-the-hill private investigator Holland March, a single father who doesn't mind looking for people who he knows are already dead just for the sake of earning some money, a laxity that more than once has brought trouble upon him and one of those situations also makes him cross paths with Russell Crowe's character Jackson Healy, a rather moody, professional thug who likes letting his fists speak for himself and who else would be more suitable for the role than the notoriously choleric Russell Crowe?So together they form a duo as a new case forces them to cooperate and from that moment on they literally stumble upon one trace leading to another and evermore get themselves entangled in the snares of a big political conspiracy which of course surpasses their skills by far and the way in which they nevertheless manage to gain the upper hand gives cause for very comedic moments and memorable lines. The story may be confusing at first but in the end everything adds up convincingly, only the conventional finale is a letdown so to speak.What, to me, makes the movie stand out is the fact that the duo is actually a trio if you count March's daughter, the very smart, cheeky Holly, superbly played by A. Rice, she plays a very active part in the movie and often demonstrates a higher level of maturity than those two guys together.I'm very optimistic that this won't be the last case of "The Nice Guys" we'll see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed The Nice Guys. I think it's a solid hit with a miss of a title. That plus the lack of marketing kept a lot of people from seeing it -- Which is a shame, because this is one of the best of it's kind I've seen in a while. The leads were great. All the side characters had great parts. It was very funny, had plenty of action and character, clipped along at a decent pace and had an interesting plot -- although a little forced at the end. I'm considering watching it a second time because it had all kinds of small, subtle gems dropped in and I'm sure I missed some the first time.

		<shortDescription>Shane Black Remains the Master of Buddy Cop Comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a basic level The Nice Guys works like any buddy cop movie. Great action, well developed characters and a decent story to hold it altogether. But just like Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, the real strength of The Nice Guys is how Shane Black is able to both mock the clichs in the action genre, many of which he helped to create in films like Lethal Weapon, whilst paying homage to all the action tropes that made the genre what it is today.Russell Crowe plays Jackson Healey, a tough enforcer whose work mostly includes freelance work of beating up someone for whoever's willing to pay. He has considered becoming a licensed private investigator, as he wants to give real help to some clients, but he doesn't want to pay for the licence. He's a nice guy, but he's not that Nice. Then there's Ryan Gosling as Holland March, who is a licensed investigator and father to a thirteen year old girl. He spends most of his time accepting cases from old people with dementia paying him to find their recently deceased spouses, constantly screwing up and spending most of his time trying to drown himself in Bourbon. Even his daughter calls him a bad person. After one old lady with bad eyesight hires him to find her niece, who is a porn star who had recently died in a car crash. Thinking the job is easy money to just confirm the girl is dead, March takes the case. But he quickly discovers the girl could be alive. This causes him to cross paths with Healey, who is hired to burst in to March's home to threaten him and get him to drop the case. Before leaving he casually asks March a few questions about his life as a private investigator and how he's able to afford such a nice place on an investigators salary, before calmly breaking his wrist and leaving. It's a good tone setter for their relationship for the rest of the film. But Healey quickly realises the case was bigger than he thought it was and wanting to be a "nice guy" decides to work with March and solve the case. Very quickly they fall in to a case filled with 70's pornography and government conspiracies. It's part Boogie Nights, part Chinatown and all tied together with Shane Blacks tongue and cheek charm. Similar to Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, one of the films greatest strengths comes from the charismatic leads of Crowe and Gosling as the mismatched duo investigating the case. Crowe delivers all his lines in a great deadpan style, whilst Gosling goes out of his usual element, giving up his usual macho man image in order to play a Buster Keaton style slapstick performance. Sometimes they seem like the smartest guys in the room, chasing obscure leads and coming up with good results. Then at other's they seem like a pair of idiots getting by on pure luck alone, such as one scene where Gosling accidentally stumbles down a hill and ends up discovering a dead body. They are both screw ups, but they screw up in such charming ways that we can't help but to continue rooting for them. The film is also able to avoid the annoying clich used in films like War of the Worlds or Commando where the child ends up serving no role in the film other than being a victim and a plot device. Instead March's daughter is written with the same charm and depth as both March and Healey. Angourie Rice also pulls of a great performance working very well with all the other actors in the film.Shane Black both wrote and directed the film and he definitely plays to all of his greatest strengths through the films mixture of great comedic timing and sharp dialogue. He also works in all the clichs that you'd expect from his work, even managing to fit in one scene at the end randomly set at Christmas (since it just wouldn't be a Shane Black film without a little festivity). Ultimately it's a film that keeps you laughing throughout and by the end it leaves you wanting more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>?.and not only that, but if they're smart, they'd be filming it already. Plenty of violence, lots of laughter and excellent chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe. I'll tell you, I'm not really a Russell Crowe fan, but he was perfect for this role. I heard people, as they were leaving, saying things about hoping there'd be another one with The Nice Guys before too long. Personally I think there is going to be a market for a series of them. It was that good. The daughter, Holly, played by Angourie Rice, was a tad on the precocious side but in the grand scheme of things, it worked rather well. This is reminiscent of good detective films from the past with a modern slant and these tough detectives, with their history and issues are sheer entertainment. Crowe showing a vicious side as well as a tender side is the epitome of the tough cop-type and Gosling, trying to be father, find another drink and still earn money detecting is a hoot. Bring on another one. And soon!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Shane Black (Lethal Weapon and LW2) proves an action genre writer, given a good script and top actors, can bring life to a story surrounding a couple of bumbling private eyes (Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling). Set in the 1970's, the costumes (Kym Barrett) and environment (Danielle Berman, Richard Brigand and David Utlfey) provide Crowe and Gosling all the leeway they need to take their crazy loose cannon characters across the LA landscape in search of Amelia (Margaret Qualley - The Leftovers), with little Holly (Angourie Rice) as the grown-up of the trio. While initially hard to believe Crowe (with a mature body) and the sexy Gosling in such nutty roles, they quickly and easily pull you into their kooky topsy-turvy world, even when the storyline goes to far or gets off track. Matt Bomer (American Horror Story) gives a fun cameo, and Kim Basinger is a glow in her many soft-lit appearances. "The Nice Guys" isn't brain surgery. However, it is filled with many good on liners, a fun script, great costumes, goofy best-bud-banter and a lot of heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe star in the neo noir comedy The Nice Guys, which follows the investigation of two independent investigators working together to uncover a case within the 1970s Los Angles porn industry. I have never seen to actors work so well in a a buddy action like this before, and they are just so cool to watch together. Directed by Shane Black the Nice Guys provides a solid good time at the cinema for viewers with entertaining action, intriguing narrative, and enjoyable humour.So as said before, both Gosling and Crowe are absolutely great together with there different personalities that just work and you can even imagine them being a real team. Especially Crowe is really cool and bad ass which would make you honoured to know him. Gosling pulls of a great typical 70s figure with the support of great costumes although his character is an moron but he accepts that.At the heart of it is also Gosling's daughter (in the film) who provides more significance than first thought in a non annoying way, and does not try to bring a moral loving side to the narrative.Although the narrative does grab the audience, there is no real direction where you think its going, and it's not always clear what is going on the whole time.Then there is also the comedy which is entertaining and will tickle audiences but may not make you laugh out loud. I'm not really the best judge of comedy, so I can't really say how funny it is, but it is enjoyable.So in the end, The Nice Guys is very enjoyable and fun to watch, but may not be for everyone. It is more unique then other buddy action comedies like Rush Hour, 2 Guns, or The Others Guys. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thrilling mix of slapstick comedy, action mayhem and '70s extravaganza, with lead characters who are completely devoid of any equanimity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is 1977 in Los Angeles. The music is funky, the sky is smog-ridden, corruption is rampant, and pornography is as thriving as the automotive industry. Private investigator Holland March (Ryan Gosling) is hired to investigate the apparent suicide of a famous porn star named Misty Mountains. The trail leads him looking for a missing Amelia Kuttner (Margaret Qualley), the daughter of the Chief Head Justice. Meanwhile, Amelia, who doesn't wish to be found, hires a burly enforcer Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) to keep March out of her tail. As Amelia suddenly vanishes, the wild goose chase for her intensifies, and several parties of interest are thrown into the mix. Caught in the middle of a killing spree, Jackson and Holland, along with his persistent daughter Holly (Angourie Rice), are forced to team up as they uncover a shocking conspiracy linked with higher ranks of the government.Shane Black effectively hits the audience's spot by creating hilarious characters and putting them in awkward situations. The hapless nature of the duo adds to their likability. Jackson, and most definitely, Holland don't have the skillset of James Bond or Jason Bourne, making them stumble their way through each location and rely on dumb luck as coincidences turn into clues and mishaps turn into leads. The plot, however, could have used more editing, especially in the starting and closing parts where the story gets a bit shambolic. Indeed, The Nice Guys can be a confusing film that each found clue sends the plot to an entirely new direction, and events only start making sense toward the end. Black could have easily spun his film as a crime thriller, which would have served the general plot better. However, his intention here is not to make a point about government conspiracies; rather, he wants the audience to focus more on the comedic detours of the characters. For that reason, this film fares better as a comedy than a mystery.This film won't work without the fantastic chemistry and dynamic energy that we get from its leads. Jackson (Crowe) is the more rational and grounded guy, whereas Holland (Gosling) is the accident-prone, world's worst detective that holds them down. They don't strike as caricatures for there is a duality in their study; deep-down, these are damaged persons. Holland struggles in his profession and at the same time fails in responsible parenting, and Jackson is world-weary and exhausted of living an amoral life. Crowe does not play an upfront fancy character, but he deliver good comedic talents surprising for a first-timer in the comedy genre. Yes, his IMDb profile clearly states that Mr. Russell Crowe has not done comedy up until now. His stone-faced reactions to Holland's mishaps caps off the impact of each comedic scene. On the other hand, although we've recently seen Gosling's comedic chops in The Big Short, here, he sheds all his vanity and delivers an impeccable performance, from pained squeals to lost breath gags. His relationship with his thirteen year old daughter Holly is also an interesting study. Holly is well aware of her father's shortcomings but accepts him for who he is and acts as the self-appointed brains of the group. She is that rare kid who had to grow up fast but at the same time retain her pristine beliefs. Young actress Rice holds the heart of the film and deserves every right to be on the main poster with the two leads.The Nice Guys is gloriously violent yet still raucously funny. Mixing these two elements ? violence and comedy ? is a tricky task especially in a neo-noir setting (unless you're homeschooled by Quentin Tarantino). Black expertly directs classic action sequences (fistfights, shootouts, car chases, building drops) and stuffs them with a stream of verbal and physical gags to look adorably desperate. With a gaudy production that pays homage to the glitz and glamour of the '70s ? hippie fashion, boogie music, vintage cars, and even lesbian mermaids (if that's, you know, your thing) ?, this film is a lovely mess I can't wait to revisit. For once, I am not moaning over the idea of The Nicer Guys roaring down the freeway.Full review: http://www.filmpolicereviews.com/reviews/the-nice-guys</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Pairing Hampered By Weak Script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think one either likes this movie quite well or feels like it was a much larger opportunity missed. For this viewer it was the latter. As the movie began I felt it had promise especially because Russell Crowe was likable slug Nick Nolte type and I liked his character. The film has a definite film noir nod, but it's a late 70's period buddy crime flick to be more precise. It does try to inject continuous comedy, but none of it is knee-slapping funny as it's more of a low-key, fairly constant, comedy. The story is pretty lame which is the main (only) problem. A young woman, Amelia Kuttner, whose mother is the head of the justice department (Kim Bassinger playing Judith Kuttner) seeks to reveal her mom is corrupt in letting the Big 3 auto makers off the hook for pollution. Think that doesn't sound stupid, well the vehicle to reveal all this malfeasance is an "art house porn" flick staring the daughter. The inane reason for this was to shame the mother and get the maximum exposure only a porn movie could get? This is all while the porn industry in LA starts having mysterious deaths, including the top star, the top director, and this art house porn ,wanna be, director, With the last one the Amelia Kuttner film aimed at her mother's corruption goes missing. This is, basically, the mystery our two needy private eyes must unravel: find Amelia and the film. Oh, and stay alive since death seems to swirl around lately. Speaking of the twosome, I also like Ryan Gosling's acting and the character he plays. I found the young lady playing his daughter quite talented in her role. However, I do still get a bit uncomfortable seeing an impressionable youth in the middle of quite a bit of depravity being depicted. Since her dad (Gosling) is a bit of drunk she actually looks more after him than he does her. So I guess it serves that purpose, but I'm still a bit uncomfortable.Well, this is, in my opinion, a weak buddy movie from a director who is known to be capable of better. Maybe he did as much as he could given the story since - as stated earlier: the story is weak. A viewer could do worse for an evening's entertainment. Make sure your expectations aren't too high and the film is still watchable. I know because I appropriately lowered mine and kept watching. It is a good pairing of two quite different actors, also at very different points in their careers, allowing them to create two interesting disparate fun characters. I just felt the story did the characters potential more of a disservice than a benefit. This pairing could have yielded much better given the right script. One last note to casting director, though both Kim Bassinger and Matt Bomer have a kind of star power, she is plain wrong, plus terrible, here and he is way too opposite the type of a hit man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique Plot,Clich characters &amp; a Few Memorable Scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't really excited about this movie cause comedies aren't always that funny to have comedy as their genre but this movie had pretty good jokes and a few very funny moments and a nice story that is original.Well the whole story was original and since the movie takes place in the 70s it tried to put on the 70s kind of vibe in the movie. About the characters,I didn't really like it cause it was the same exact kind of characters we see in every crime-action movie,which made the movie pretty predictable,but I can't blame that cause people like that kind of thing (but I don't think anyone would mind a new set of characters for gang movies). To me the casting and the chemistry wasn't that good that I would remember the movie for it's unique cast.The movie had some short scenes with fast cuts and some scenes that seemed really pointless (not many thought) which made me think it was a first time directing for it's director (Shane Black) but when I found he's a pretty experimented directer I changed my mind,well it's an independent film but we've had better indie directors.As a whole it won't be a waste of time to watch it since it's less than 2 hours (so yaaaay!) It has some good jokes in it but still I think it's not enough for a 1h 50m movie.I watched it and enjoyed some of it's scene but at the end when I thought about it,it didn't have anything special...but it's a clean movie with some weird pointless scenes that last less than 3 seconds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shane Black is Back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll admit, the trailers for this film weren't promising. It seemed to depict another set of two good actors making fools of themselves in a raunchy, uninspired popcorn flick. I was sincerely hoping that this wasn't true, as Shane Black is a great writer/director and it would be a shame if he ever stepped down to that level. I'm happy to say he has not. 'The Nice Guys' is a fun and stylish action comedy that presents 1977 in much the same way that Richard Linklater's 'Everybody Wants Some!!' portrayed 1980: surreal, aesthetically pleasing, and a rocking soundtrack to top it off. And let's not forget the surprisingly hilarious duo of Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling. The dynamic between these two leads (who also serve as narrators) is fantastic; there is great chemistry and comedic timing from both. They are helped out by the young Angourie Rice, who is talented for her age and manages not to play the usual annoying, whining and damsel-in- distress daughter that one would expect from such a movie (though this is also due to the writers making sure she didn't have that sort of role to begin with). The rest of the cast is average, but their roles are all so minor it really doesn't matter: Kim Basinger, Matt Bomer and Margaret Qualley to name a few. I'd say the best thing about this film is that you can tell it was written by the same guy who wrote 'Lethal Weapon'. For me that's an incredibly good thing, as that happens to be my favorite action movie of all time. The humor in both films is not slapstick per se; I grinned while watching 'The Nice Guys' more than I laughed. I seem to recall the most over-the-top sequence was a drunken dream of Gosling's in which a car drove by itself and a giant bee talked. All that being said, the best humor in the movie is the running jokes and the physical comedy that takes place in the action sequences, which are of course very well done. Overall, the movie's semi-unoriginal plot is presented in such a fresh way that any minor problems with the script can be brushed off in a heartbeat. This movie is very watchable and here's to hoping we get a sequel, because it's so rare these days for movies to deserve one (if they aren't already a reboot to begin with!). 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plenty of adult action and fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fate turns Holland March, a down-on-his-luck private eye and Jackson Healy, a hired enforcer into unlikely partners when a woman mysteriously disappears.Filmmaker Shane Black - writer of Lethal Weapon, Predator and director of Iron Man 3 offers a dark comedy with a Chinatown-like detective story. The Nice Guys is set in 1977 on an LA sleazy vibe back drop which is convincingly recreated, topped off with the music of the time.With their own reasons for getting involved the duo team up to achieve one shared goal both reliant on each other's different skills. It's a different era of wild celebrity disco parties, cigarette smoking and lenient police involvement, allowing unlikely partnership of drunkard PI Holland (Ryan Gosling) and Jackson (Russell Crowe) paid hard man to go about their business. What's interesting and surprisingly works is Holland's young teen daughter (Angourie Rice) who helps her dad and dicey new partner as they investigate the murder of a porn star, Misty Mountains and its mysterious link to environmentalist wild-child Amelia (Margaret Qualley) and politically connected mother, Judith (Kim Basinger). It feels likes it's all shot on location, the period setting is at times the star of show, injecting plenty of atmosphere and mood, the cars, the fashion etc. The supporting cast a great, notable are the excellent Matt Bomer (White Collar, American Horror Story Hotel) who plays a professional hit man and thug Keith David (The Thing, They Live) who want Amelia dead. Black offers corruption, some surprise deaths and twists but it's a comedy at heart. Gosling and Crowe are kind of 70s version of Laurel and Hardy, yelping and mumbling through scenes. Their chemistry is great, it's an interesting and brilliant casting with the leads displaying a naturally comedic zaniness along with Crowe adding a believability that he can bust heads.Thankfully Black and writer Anthony Bagarozzi create enough back- story for Holland and Jackson to ensure your buy into the characters' plights as they work through clues looking like Starsky and Hutch in Boogie Nights. Both Gosling and Crowe somehow feel they belong to the period. Rice equals Leon's Natalie Portman in terms of a young girl being in an improbable adult world. Gosling is disinclined to being a good dad, in contrast to Crowe's deadpan character wanting to be liked and you find yourself rooting for the at times unsavoury characters. With its period setting, some hard hitting action and taboo comedy there's plenty of entertainment to be had, recommended.</fullReview>

The laughs are plentiful and very well done. Both Crow and Gosling are funny people. Some actors are just not funny such as Seth Rogan whom I find just plain stupid and vulgar.

		<fullReview>One of the best films I've seen in years; the plot and script are highly original and consistently hilarious. Shane Black knocks this out of the park, and while it is definitely an homage to movies of the 80's, it feels so refreshing in the modern day. The film has incredible acting all around. Gosling and Crowe, as unexpected a pairing as Gibson and Glover at the time, have incredible chemistry and sell the movie and their relationship to a tee. Bomer is great as well, but possibly better than all of them is Holly, Gosling's daughter in the film, who for my money is a star. The dialogue is perfect, great cinematography, beautiful sets... I could go all day. It's everything you could want out of this kind of movie. Simply outstanding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great entertaining buddy cop film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard good reviews for this film so I went see it and I was very entertained by this fun movie. The premise sees two different personal investigators on the hunt for a girl who has gone missing. Russel crowe and ryan gosling are the two pi's in this film and they are both great in this film. They have such good chemistry on screen together and even though it's pretty clich you buy there friendship on screen. Also both of them are interesting and funny characters in there own right which helps boost this film. Also goslings daughter in this film is amazing, she gives a performance way beyond her years by providing some great humour and drama so I hope to see her in more things in the future. Unfortunately, everybody else in this film is wasted. All the villains are boring and have absolutely no character to them even though seeing keith David is always cool. Kim basinger is only in this film for a few scenes which is such a waste of her talent. The story is a bit convoluted but it works because it is always moving, the story keeps evolving and you are on this journey with the two guys and its pure fun. The script is really good with all the witty banter between the two being funny and when it needs to be the film hits the drama levels well. The style has some great action scenes that were filmed very well. Also the 1970s feel really works for the stylistic nature of the film. But, I do feel like the film has a few pacing issues especially in the first 30 mins and is probably a tiny bit too long. But I really enjoyed this film and think it is definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Nice Guys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Nice Guys is a film that I didn't see a lot before going into it. I had heard heaps of positives going into it but I was essentially going in blind. This movie was just straight out fantastic. I'm going to start by saying that for me personal, I really feel that this is going to be one of those movies that whenever it comes on TV I'm going to watch it.As far as humour goes it nailed it. As a comedy you expect it to be funny but it's a type of comedy that I didn't expect. The Nice Guys has a MA 15+ rating here in Australia which is the same rating as Deadpool, but I feel the sense of comedy was completely different. Deadpool would not have worked without that R rating but I really think that The Nice Guys could have easily been a lower rating. Thats a massive compliment to the movie for me. To say that the humour was so genuine and they didn't rely on using coarse language to get laughter really stands out as what I really loved about this film. I do however understand the high rating because this film is essentially about pornos which they simply couldn't do without that rating.I really liked the story the film had. Story is always a massive thing for me in films and it is often the thing that makes a great comedy even better. I'll admit, it was a bit confusing at the start to follow what was happening and who was who, but in the end it all clicked together and I think second viewing will really benefit from it.I thought the cast was fantastic. Gosling and Crowe had a fantastic chemistry together and they nailed the buddy-cop aspect of the film. Gosling especially was outstanding, most of my favourite moments of the film were things done by Gosling. I think however, my favourite person in the film was Angourie Rice. She played Goslings daughter and her character in many ways seemed like the most intelligent. I thought she nailed the role and I thought she handled the role of what seems like the strongest supporting character.I really loved this film. So many times it gave me massive laughs. This is one of those films that I really think everyone will at least like. Unless you are completely against nudity and swearing, there are so many genuine funny moments that will make anyone laugh.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Shane Black comedy n'stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What do you get when you cross Cutris Hanson's LA Confidential with Shane Black's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang? The answer is this entertaining crime comedy centred around a porn film in 1977. Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe make an unlikely pairing as together they investigate a missing persons case which escalates quickly into insanity and hilarity.Russell Crowe portrays Jakson Heely, a character who shares similarities with his LA Confidental character Bud White. Crowe plays the brute with a softer side fairly well, making a mini comeback after some less than stellar performances in films such as Les Miserables. As good as Crowe is, he isn't the stand out star of this show, the would go to Ryan Goslings brilliant performance as the alcoholic buffoon Holland March. Gosling embodies the clown role of the film, perfectly executing the many, many gags he's faced with delivering. Goslings performance plays a big part in my enjoyment of this film and finally shows that the actor isn't just a pretty face.The film is a funny film, thanks to Crowe and Gostling for their delivery is definitely in order for the films humour working, but their delivery would have been for nothing if the script wasn't funny to start with. Also the direction and editing are also great in pulling off some of the physical comedy of the film. Long story short the team behind this film work brilliantly together to compliment one another and create a genuinely amusing movie.The only issue I had with this film was the crime story itself. As the film progresses it seems to shift from a mysteriously cursed porn film to yet another government conspiracy to which I am still confused as to how that was resolved. The films climax centres around our protagonists retrieving a porn film to which the story is evidence against the department of justice for illegal activity... But everyone involved in the films making is dead and its a PORN film, so I'm struggling to see how this singular piece of pornographic evidence is enough to take down someone high up in the ranks of the police force. Sure Chet is alive to testify but that is never specified and is that really enough?Overall The Nice Guys is a really nice film. Although the overall story gets a bit sh*t the characters and the humour will compensate for this to the end. Ryan Gosling gives the performance of his career so far and deserves a special mention for his work on this film. This is a cool movie filled with porn, murder n'stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We have all seen Ryan Gosling and Russel Crowe in far better movies than this and we know what they are capable of. It's more their way of playing that kept me in action and not the story, which was predictable. I know, it was just a comedy, but I have some standards and I want something more than just the average screenplay. Never the less, there were many moments that I enjoyed not only because of the humour, which was good and nothing more, but thank's to the messages the movie wanted to sent us, about many things, which I don't want to spoil. Well, in order to conclude, it's a movie that it's better to see it with your friends (as I did), you will enjoy it better and you will have fun. It's easy and it's perfect to relax after college or work, on Friday evening.6/10P.S. I loved the face of Ryan in the biggest part of the movie. I'll not say anything more.

		<shortDescription>A Journey Back to the 70s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, like a lot of movies, I wasn't really all that sure what to expect from this one, except that from the poster ads it seem like one of those buddy movies (I didn't check out the trailer on IMDb, nor did I see one at the cinema). Okay, from the brief synopsis it said something about a couple of detectives and the porn industry, so I was a little unsure, expecting it to be a little sleazy. However, while it was a little sleazy, it was also absolutely hilarious ? in your typical black comedy type of way (and yes, the comedy was really black, especially what happened to one of the bodies that they accidentally discovered).Anyway, the film opens in 1977 (and the entire film is set in the late seventies) with a kid stealing one of his father's girly magazines from under his bed. Suddenly the girl in the centerfold comes crashing through his house (in a car) and in the valley below. We are then introduced to the two main characters: Healy, who is a strong man that basically discourages sleazes from messing with young girls; and March, who is sort of a private detective, but makes his money more by ripping off his clients than actually solving cases. They end up crossing each other's paths when they both become involved with a young girl named Amelia ? Healy being hired to deal with a couple of guys that are following her, and March to actually track her down. As what ends up happening in such cases, both of them quickly discover that they are right out of their depth. Not only is Amelia mixed up in the porn industry, but somebody is going around killing her associates one by one.The thing that I really liked about the film was the retro feel about it, while dealing with issues that are still relevant today ? pollution and environmental degradation, government corruption, and corporate white washing of scientific evidence. As the film opens we are told that Los Angeles is facing a smog crisis, though while at first this seems to be a bit of background information, it soon become evident that this is a major part of the movie's plot (especially since Amelia is involved in an environmental protest group). It also soon becomes clear that the death of the porn star Misty Mountain is connected to this hunt for Amelia (though the lady that hires March swears that she saw Misty Mountain in her house two days after her death).The thing is that this film is a detective film, and one that harks back to the 70s style of detective mystery. It is not so much a 21st Century film set in the 1970s, but rather a 1970s style film that was made in the 21st Century. In fact it was this real retro feel about this film, and that it shows how the concerns we have today are very much the same concerns we had back in the 70s, that was the main reason that I really enjoyed this movie. Oh, and also that it had me in fits of laughter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the kind of movie I generally do not appreciate, but I was honestly surprised that I enjoyed it. Although it is a crime film, it is also tied nicely with a comedic atmosphere. The film is able to balance both the serious scenes with the funny ones, and it pays off. Gosling does a superb job with his character. While being both the smart one and the goofy one, his antics, behavior and lines are just so hilarious. Quite a few of his actions are *slap hand in face* worthy, and that's what makes it funny at times. Without a doubt, Gosling carries the film. At the beginning, I was not a big fan of Crowe's character. He play a tough guy who uses fists first, talk later. But after some time I grew to tolerate him. He does have some character development, mostly due to Holly, and I could go either way with that. We aren't given a lot into the other characters' background, but it works for this film. As mentioned, the subject matter of the film is one I do not generally enjoy. What with the swearing, prostitutes, pornography sounds, and the like. However, it is not explicit at all, save for one nude woman in the beginning (which was censored in my country), and the swearing. For a movie of this type, I would say it is one of the more tamed ones in terms of what they show. Set in the 70's, the mise-en-scene does a great job at bringing alive the era. As well, the story is engaging and fun. However, I am a little surprised that there isn't a romantic line in the film. Having said that, there is also not much of a female counterpart to the protagonists, in the sense that there is no presence of strong female characters. Amelia and Holly do portray that hardiness, and have quite a lot of screen time, however, the fact that they are young girls is a little concerning. Maybe I'm reading too much into this, but if I had to say who the four main characters in the film are, it would be: March, Healy, Holly, and Amelia. Two middle-aged men, and two teenage girls. Think of that what you will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shane Black kicks back to his signature style with flair and reverence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the era of disco and cheesy moustaches, enforcer Jackson Healy (Crowe) teams up with detective Holland March (Gosling) to track down a young woman last seen acting in a porn film. As the hilariously uncompromising duo gets closer to finding their target, they accidentally stumble upon a much larger conspiracy...If you enjoyed "Lethal Weapon" or "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang", then you should feel right at home with this mystery-comedy directed and co-written by Shane Black. The film is bolstered by a tightly-knit script as well as strong performances from most, if not all, of the cast. The chemistry between Gosling and Crowe is explosive; not only is the duo's comedic timing on point, but both serve as strong foils to each other's personalities. A genuine connection can be felt in their relationship throughout the film.Another actor who deserves a special mention is 15-year-old Angourie Rice (who plays Holland's quick-witted and observant daughter). In my eyes, she is the true star of this film. Rice not only infuses her character with a rich energy that few child actors possess but also has no problems keeping up with her enormously talented co-stars. There is not a single scene where she gives a weak performance ? Rice was by far the best casting choice Black and his team could have made for the role of Holly March.The production design, costume design, and cinematography also deserve a special mention. The film is so seventies in the way it is designed and lit, it actually feels like it was made in the seventies. The filmmakers also hid plenty of little nods toward the culture and political climate of that period throughout the film (which makes a second viewing all the more fun). Additionally, the film's musical selections and soundtrack will have you settled in immediately.At its core, "The Nice Guys" is a genuinely funny and sometimes shocking film. It features a convoluted story that's big on laughs, heartfelt redemption, and flashy action scenes. Realistically speaking, the only problem that I have with this film (and see others having) is exactly that: the film's convoluted and seemingly senseless plot. Nevertheless, for those looking to get away from this month's stale slate of sequels and adaptations, but still want to see something entertaining and well-made, this is the film for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Nice Guys" from the duo Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling, particularly neat with onions, results in a comedy, kind of caustic police investigation that mocks itself, frankly hilarious! Under situations where no heavy humor mars or burdening the film is very particular how shifted to play two players that makes it quite a hit ... Far from the frozen composition "Drive" here it is just the opposite Ryan Gosling in man returns rather left, deceitful, or not too clever at the edges but releasing a charm and bonhomie that echoes his muscled sidekick, equally amazing and explosive under Russell Crowe traits ! What looks, which phrases associated with unique and unexpected reactions. Crazy as can be, all that will trigger both nickel feet detectives will bring us some very funny moments when the secondary roles give all their importance and have nothing to envy the two heroes, like the little Holly, egghead element weighted and benevolent as thoughtful girl of Holland ... No mention or describe some surreal scenes have a quite senseless sequence and so jubilant! The survey nevertheless a thread a little crazy there too, and follows more or less, but in the utmost good humor. A really nice about the vintage decorations, these sour moods 70s of Los Angeles of a mythical time! A small slice of fun and humor well prepared to taste without moderation!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Comedy Duo of the Year is...Crowe and Gosling?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the late 1900s, there was a very particular genre of film that had a ubiquitous presence at cinemas and the box office: the good-ole fashioned action-buddy-comedy. From 48 Hours to Rush Hour, it's a mindlessly entertaining genre, known as much for its cozy saxophone scores and cheesy emotions as for its ridiculous explosions and fun patter. The Nice Guys mixes these familiar feels with the gloss of a (less-layered and more accessible) Coen Bros film, giving us a seedy and comfortably familiar noir-caper, full of big characters and bigger laughs. Through a series of chance meetings and unlikely alliances, two men barely on the right side of the law in 1970s L.A. join forces to try to locate and protect a young woman. While tonally the film is very 80s, the 70s L.A. setting perfectly shines with grimy detail. Crowe and Gosling, donned in loud suits and ill-advised facial hair, fall right into place. Both of them are super-funny and clearly enjoying themselves, eating up scenes filled with more character than you can shake a pimp's stick at, and getting to play with dialogue worth dying for. That brainy banter is a large part of director/write Black's signature style. With only 3 directing credits to his name (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Iron Man 3), his fearless confidence with his characters and scripts is admirable in our increasingly play-it-safe action-movie world. The Nice Guys is pure and simple fun that deserves to be supported if for no other reason than to get to see these three dudes team up for more hilarious misadventures in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had a laughing-out loud ball watching this. Everything was "1977" starting even with the main title design. Then, like throughout the movie, something HORRIBLE happens that caused me a belly laugh!Crowe &amp; Gosling were terrific as a couple of noodnik PIs, Gosling being the "dumb and dumber" sillier of the two. There's one point in the movie when I swear he was doing a Stan Laurel. Come to think of it,"fat &amp; skinny" are their style as a duo.Don't get me wrong, this was not a "stupid" movie (sorry, I don't want to be politically incorrect to any stupids), it was damned smart. I've wasted too many tickets on so-called "comedies" that were boring and laughless. This one, with a really high-action, at times scary- violent narrative, is also simultaneously hilarious.The Gosling character's daughter in the movie (Angourie Rice) was AMAZING, almost stole the movie from the two leads. She has a great future as an actress. Plus you've got a Coen Bros-like assortment of weird characters. It's all set in Hollywood and the hills, and that in itself is a touch of tribute to things like "Mulholland Drive," "Bosch," "The Long Goodbye," and (check it out!) "The Big Fix" (w/Richard Dreyfuss). There's a stereotypically "Hollywood" decadent party that reminded me of Peter Sellers' "The Party" - including that Gosling's character may have had as many pratfalls, though at far greater altitudes!This movie is A-class fun! I don't think it's getting much theater showtime, so I guess we're gonna have to get it around by word of mouth. If ever a movie deserved a sequel, it's this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crowe and Gosling are brilliant together in another winner from Shane Black</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, oh yes, The Nice Guys is every bit the hilarious and entertaining movie I was hoping for. Part action, part buddy comedy, The Nice Guys is the latest movie from Shane Black and believe me when I tell you, there is so much fun to be had at the cinema with this one.Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) is a hardened private eye who chooses violence as his method of business. On the other hand, Holland March (Ryan Gosling) is a bit of a bumbling private eye, not akin to the violent methods of Healy's choosing.When the mismatched duo are paired together to investigate the death of fading porn star, Misty Mountains (Murielle Telio), they begin to unravel a web of corruption and lies, pointing toward murder over suicide. They are hired to find Amelia (Margaret Qualley), a girl who holds the key to the whole conspiracy, before others with cruel intentions do.First things first, The Nice Guys is really driven by the great on-screen partnership of Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling, who share such an unbelievably good chemistry as the two private eyes who couldn't be more different.This is the best Crowe has been since State of Play in 2009 and he has no trouble at all selling the tough guy persona of Healy. The comedy was something I thought Crowe could struggle with however, having seen him do a few interviews recently and after his performance in The Nice Guys, I had no need to worry.Crowe is funny in this but Gosling is absolutely hilarious. He proved he could do comedy in Crazy, Stupid, Love but there is so much more to the comedy he performs in The Nice Guys. A lot of it is verbal but there are some moments of physical comedy that Gosling nails, particularly one sequence in the movie's finale that was rather quite brilliant.The two are aided by a brilliant script, full of enough wit and quips, written by Shane Black and Anthony Bagarozzi. Black is no stranger to writing both movies and characters of similar ilk, having written the first two Lethal Weapon movies and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, which he also directed. It's not only Crowe and Gosling who benefit from the script either with Matt Bomer shining as the sinister John Boy and Angourie Rice almost stealing the show as Holly March, Holland's rather persistent daughter.I understand that The Nice Guys hasn't performed well so far at the box-office which is a real shame. I urge anyone who likes to be entertained to go and spend two hours watching this at the cinema. Trust me, those two hours will fly by and we could do with having more movies like this being made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Nice Guys was a pretty entertaining detective movie taking place in the late '70s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had wanted to watch this movie for a while because of the '70s atmosphere so I just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend just now. It had a pretty weird vibe that was pretty humorous much of the time though not always hilariously so. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling reluctantly team up in search of a young woman who's involved in a porno film and Kim Basinger is also involved somehow. Much of the movie is pretty entertaining though because I was a child of the decade in question and I know what music came out certain years especially the 1977 timeline here, it took me a little out of the picture when I heard something like Rupert Holmes' "Escape (The Pina Colada Song)"-which came out two years after that year-playing in the background. Still, The Nice Guys is worth a look for anyone interested in the era. Oh, and how cool to once again see the Saul Bass Warner Bros. logo beginning this one...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very Shane Black comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ryan Gosling plays the "world's worst detective" Holland March, and Russell Crowe is Jackson Healey, a mercenary tough guy who's paid to punch paedophiles.This 1977-set LA story starts with a slightly misjudged visual joke portraying the death of adult movie star named Misty Mountains. When Misty's aunt claims to have seen her niece alive, March is hired to find her. Separately, Healey is hired to stop him by force. A series of convoluted events conspire to bring the mismatched duo together, and off they go on a search for a missing girl named Amelia (Margaret Qualley). There are a ton of bad guys standing in the way of their goal, who happens to be the daughter of a sinister VIP from the Department of Justice (Kim Basinger). It's fair to say that March's and Healey's chaotic quest is propelled as much by luck as skill.Being written and directed by Shane Black, comparisons to Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang and Lethal Weapon are inevitable. It's not quite up to the same standard as those scripts ? perhaps future instalments might shed light on Healey's backstory and his neurotic need to be "useful", or delve more into the broken home life of March ? but there is undeniable pleasure in seeing Black do his thing: banter, pathos, idiocy, lunacy, and old school shootouts. It's probably on a par with The Last Boy Scout, which will do nicely.Gosling and Crowe are cast subtly against type, playing around with (and against) their ice cool and wounded warrior personas respectively. It's especially effective with Gosling, whose tendency toward stolidity works well in the more deadpan moments. Angourie Rice, playing March's precocious daughter Holly, almost steals the show from the stars. It's a great performance and a great character: she binds these two emotionally stunted men in the way that Murtaugh's family once brought Riggs back from the brink.The trailers for The Nice Guys have been subtly misleading, presenting the film as a pure knockabout action comedy. Yet Black's skill has always been his ability to combine humour and sincerity. It's refreshing to watch an adult comedy with an intricate (if ridiculous) plot and actual scripted jokes; and one where we're not waiting for the next filmmaker-buddy cameo.The movie has more in common with the slacker detective pictures of the decade in which it's set ? it is faintly reminiscent of Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye in its depiction of nihilism and questionable competence. Another touchstone would be Paul Thomas Anderson's Inherent Vice, although this is the far less detached and humorous film. Similarly, the period is lovingly reincarnated, in part because it doesn't simply revel in the coolness of the time ? here's a movie that's happy to eschew the disco and observe the rubbish brownness of late-70s social decline.The Nice Guys is a welcome return of one of cinema's most reliable and intelligent mainstream filmmakers. Shane Black is a master of toying with genre (he was responsible for Iron Man 3's bonkers twist); and although the buddy genre may be a familiar one, it remains the perfect vehicle for his talents.Arguably the worst impulse of the modern action movie is excess, and the curse of the modern American comedy is irony. The Nice Guys offers mercifully little of either, which makes it feel both old and new.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>L.A. Confidential if Done by Blake Edwards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The titular "Nice Guys" are two formerly functioning members of the boys in blue who now scrounge up a living working on the fringes of the law. Holland March (Gosling) is a private dick who largely keeps his clients on a leash just long enough to get paid extra for little work. Jackson Healy (Crowe) on the other-hand barely scrapes by as an enforcer of sorts; beating people up on behalf of anyone with the right money. The two cross paths when the secretive and frightened Amelia (Qualley) hires Healy to keep March off her back, but after an escalating set of circumstances, the two boys team up to find out who Amelia really is and why she's on the run.On the face of it, The Nice Guys has all the outward themes and calling cards that make director Shane Black's oeuvre so appealing. The story twists and turns with the erudition of a Peter Cheyney pulp novel only played up for belly laughs. There's the obligatory precocious child who's often too clever for his/her own good, this time played by Angourie Rice. Then there's the crackling dialogue whose machine-gun wit and irascible one-liners impresses even in his lesser efforts. Here, the script is a perfect blend of Lethal Weapon (1987) pacing and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005) sardonic witticism, with a touch of seventies style to add ironic snark.If one were to find fault in the film's finely tuned, well-oiled machine it'd be the obviousness of the villain. With tons of effort made to establish the film's tone and groove into the plot twists and reveals, you'd think they wouldn't tip their hand so much. No matter; less time thinking about the intricacies of the plot leaves more time to revel in Gosling and Crowe's deft, pitch-perfect acting, the gleeful, uproarious laughter and the gaudy seventies swag.The Nice Guys is L.A. Confidential (1997) as done by Blake Edwards. It's smart, funny, effortlessly assembled and easily accessible. The story is tight and clever which more than makes up for any far- fetched tomfoolery and the themes are similar to those of Shane Black's other efforts though it never feels like he's resting on his laurels. Give The Nice Guys their due in theaters lest you wind up on the wrong end of a loaded cookie jar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun summer movie filled with mystery, comedy, nudity and violence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was reading some reviews on IMDb, and Whoa!, some people really did not like this movie. I went in without any expectations, and just sat back, and enjoyed a detective noir comedy. So many people were nitpicking about the music being played in the movie not being out yet in 1977 or that Jaws 2 wasn't out yet. It makes me wonder how many of these people actually knew the release date of these things, or Googled them after (hopefully not during) the movie. To me this is a bit extreme, just enjoy and take in the groovy sounds of the 70's/early 80's.I loved the combo of an enforcer (Crowe) and an alcoholic P.I. (Gosling) that seems out of it, but is actually very observant. I thought they worked well together. They bickered like an old, married couple. It was just the perfect amount to make it amusing, and not annoying. The story itself was well done, with lots of twists and turns. And if any part of this was true, it just goes to show how corrupt the government was, even back 40 plus years ago. At times the plot may have gone to extremes (a young girl at a wild party watching porn), but I thought it fit the theme of the story. Life is hard, you see things you can't unsee, and people aren't always around to protect you, so you have to do the best with what you have.I think Angourie Rice, who played Gosling's daughter, stole the movie for me. She was like a non-naive Nancy Drew. While her dad and partner were bickering or floundering around, she jumped right in and did what was needed. It will be interesting to watch her in more movies, and to see if she does as well in them.All in all, a fun summer movie. A crime noir, packed with physical comedy and lots of nudity and graphic violence?. Four of my favorite things!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got to the local movie house to see this latest action-comedy from writer/director Shane Black over the weekend, which I refer to as "Chinatown" meets "Boogie Nights". Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe team up as a bumbling PI and, I really don't know how to describe Crowe's character - he just sorta beats up dudes who harass little girls - for cash! Like the aforementioned "Chinatown", the film is a period murder mystery detective story set in LA, including political corruption, and like "Boogie Nights", it's a comedy set in the 1970's porn industry! Gosling is very funny, and Crowe is too, in a different sorta way as a washed-up bloated almost Orson Welles-ish version of himself! The real star here though is the young actress who played Gosling's daughter. She steals every scene she's in, and I definitely see stardom in her near future. Definite recommend on this one, and, like a lot of Shane Black films, this is a good one to see with an audience. Kim Basinger co-stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fast paced, a bit crude but clever black comedy. Now I thoroughly enjoyed other previous films that Shane Black directed such as "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang". Which is another cleverly executed neo- noir black comedy. I was amused and entertained with "The Nice Guys" from start to finish. Despite it having few parts where the momentum drops slightly. This is a team up movie of opposites, while Holland March(Ryan Gosling) has the professional title of being a private investigator. But is not really professional and lacks integrity in just about every aspect. He is one of those characters that tries to act cool, but loses his cool when things that getting serious and is the ultimate clutz. However for some reason luck seems to be on his side when things get dangerous. Russell Crowe plays a Enforcer for hire that does not have the professional title of a private investigator but is more professional than his partner. He is a tough guy, that looks tough, knows how to keep his cool and is just really good at handling things. The dynamic between these two characters surprisingly work well without it getting annoying to watch with constant bickering. This is a cleverly executed film with fun dynamics, cleverly executed humor which is rare these days and the scenarios is just so darn amusing. I still think "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" is the better film but I really enjoyed this one as well.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Shane Black back alright.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shane Black has been a name in Hollywood I have always taking great pleasure of seeing in the credits. Creating characters such as Riggs and Murtaugh from Lethal Weapon and The Last Boy Scout. This man invented the buddy cop movie and unlikely friendships with The Nice Guys being yet, another fine example. If there's one thing Shane Black is great at creating, it's those interesting alliances that are formed from equally interesting and awkwardly different characters each presenting counter ideals or attitudes. It's watching an almost mutual hatred for one other slowly turning into trust and tolerance. Gosling's P.I. Holland March seems to be very much influenced by Jimmy Rockford from the Rockford Files by taking cold cases, avoiding conflicts and charges the same fee of $200 per day. Not shy to drinking and seems to marauder around with a careless yet cowardly way of life. Now Crowe's Jackson Healy is of the heavy handed, brass-knuckle kinda guy, who's not afraid of conflict and isn't shy of hurting people. However, he bares a moral code and there's something quite honourable about the guy. Wanting to do the good thing but capable of doing the other, he has a sense of heroism. Basically the two of them are the good bad guys, or the bad good guys depending on which way you look at it. It's creates a great relationship for comical situations where the duo somehow compliment each other. It's not a case brains and brawn, but more so stupid blind luck and haphazard accidents with some clever scripting. Who does accompanying the cast and inappropriately so is Angourie Rice's character Holly March. Holland's inquisitive and and actual helpful daughter. She pretty much saves the day. Set in the seventies it has a neon disco haze everywhere it goes and the cleverly shot in a yesterday's L.A. Which is still very much recognisable. There's a good soundtrack but a lack of it and it's fairly unnoticeable score is really quiet compared to his score for X-Men: Apocalypse. It's shocking and borderline controversial with some great comedy. It's unpredictable but wouldn't say it's original. Different maybe but there's a strong fragrance of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang in the air which isn't a bad thing as that film was brilliant and this film is a stand alone great. It's funny and entertaining, doesn't lose pace and the chemistry between Gosling and Crowe is superb. However, as much as I did enjoy it, it wasn't as funny as some parts should have been and there isn't anything majorly outstanding about it but having said that, I would welcome seeing the two investigate some more but maybe speed it up to be set in the eighties? Running Time: 9 The Cast: 9 Performance: 9 Direction: 9 Story: 8 Script: 8 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 5 Job Description: 7 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 5 points for Gosling and 5 for Crowe, just can't seem to award one without the other. 82% 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shane Black has always had a way with words. His movies work because the banter between characters is natural and witty, and The Nice Guys is arguably his best work. Not only is his script funny, but the story is clever and meandering, with unexpected plot developments and twists.The other great thing is the casting. Gosling and Crowe are perfect in their roles as the clumsy PI and experienced muscle man. They're both well written and deep, with proper motivations and detailed back stories. But punching way above her weight is 14 year old Angourie Rice, who brilliantly supplies the heart and soul of the movie with honesty, integrity and innocence.Stylistically, The Nice Guys is also top notch. The production design, costumes, cars and sets have a wonderful retro '70s vibe, and the classic soundtrack matches the visuals perfectly. Perhaps there's one too many naked women, it gets to a point where it feels a little excessive, even if it is relevant to the story.Great characters and acting, with funny dialogue and strong visual style, but maybe a little too long. The action packs a punch too, worth a watch just for that alone, even without the many laugh-out-loud moments!4/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Nice Guys' is one joyride! A hilarious, violent, suspenseful Buddy-Comedy, that's bolstered by Fantastic Performances by Russell Crowe &amp; Ryan Gosling. They are at their BEST!'The Nice Guys' Synopsis: A mismatched pair of private eyes investigate the apparent suicide of a fading porn star in 1970s Los Angeles.'The Nice Guys' is Blockbuster Entertainment from start to finish. Watching these two unlikely heroes form a team to uncover a mystery in late 70's Hollywood, is irresistible fun. The chemistry between the electrifying leading-men remains in tact, &amp; the series of events that follow, left me in splits. I haven't laughed so hard in a really long time. The suspense works, the pace is consistently crisp &amp; even the action, packs a punch. Shane Black &amp; Anthony Bagarozzi's Screenplay is Superb. This tale of mystery, laced with some terrific humour, doesn't miss a beat. Sure, its a bit too long, but that never pops up as a major flaw. The Writing is top-notch. Shane Black's Direction, on the other-hand, is fabulous. 'The Nice Guys' is amongst his best works, without doubt! Cinematography &amp; Editing are top-class. Art &amp; Costume Design are perfect. Action-Sequences are solid, while David Buckley &amp; John Ottman's Score, is just right.Performance-Wise: 'The Nice Guys' is another showcase of the impeccable talents of Crowe &amp; Gosling. Crowe, though out of shape, is simply flawless as the brawny bad-ass, while Gosling, is a scene-stealer. Gosling displays a rare talent for Physical Comedy, while portraying the brainy idiot &amp; delivers the best laughs in the goings-on. Crowe &amp; Gosling also share an infectious on-screen camaraderie, throughout. A Special Mention for Angourie Rice, who's sensational as Gosling's bad-ass daughter. Of the rest of the cast, Kim Basinger shines in her brief bit, while Matt Bomer is at his creepiest best. Others too lend great support.On the whole, 'The Nice Guys' is Great Entertainment! And as for Crowe &amp; Gosling, Salute!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Not So" Nice Guys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A mismatched pair of private eyes investigates the apparent suicide of a fading porn star in 1970s Los Angeles.The Nice Guys reunites director and co-writer Shane Black and producer Joel Silver, who have previously given us the Lethal Weapon movies, The Last Boy Scout, and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang - among others. Where Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans or Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer have gone before, now we have the sublime pairing of Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling. Before our emotionally liberate 21st-century world invented the idea of the "bromance", we had the buddy comedy and the first reference that come to my mind is Roger Moore and Tony Curtis in The Persuaders on television. This film is an arch return to this tradition. Not unlike Deadpool, this is a rare American Studio movie willing to acknowledge the stupidity of mindless action with cathartic elements. The complex plotting bears a close resemblance to Inherent Vice in its dirty arrangement of events in which the main characters generally seem lost in the fog of their own pursuits. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling are funnier than ever in this buddy movie about crime investigation. Though at the end of the third act, it sometimes shifts into more straightforward procedural details that lack the same spark as its stars. Still there's no doubting the appeal of these two bumbling entities. The Nice Guys delivers brilliant physical comedy, null the actor's ability to turn their screen presence into a punchline. In this movie, everyone is trolling everyone else. Ryan Gosling, among his many talents, has blossomed into an inspired physical comedian. While what's fun about watching Russel Crowe is that he treats the savagery of his job as casually as if he were filling out a tax form. Indeed, they are a brilliant pairing and fit like a glove. So well in fact that you will wonder why it didn't happen sooner. It's a Hollywood buddy pairing that leaves you wanting more - a sequel, if it happens, would be justified and welcome.This movie is likely to score big with audiences, and for the same reason that it's proved to be a perfect fit. It's a treat to see popcorn movies this decadent made by people who know exactly what they're doing. Philippe Rousselot's cinematography gives L.A. a night bloom glow but not so much of a period authenticity, unfortunately. Finally, the hotel elevator scene, when the heroes duck back into the elevator with a "we don't need this" shrug. The timing of the gag is exquisite because it's Black's way of expressing what it feels like when whenever you're expecting is almost certain to turn out worse.Overall, The Nice Guys is a cynical movie but yet more or less sympathetic. An innocent pleasure that you can just let slide.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Shane Black sold his first screenplay at a very early age which led him to become something of a phenom with the success of that film, Lethal Weapon (1987). Later, he disappeared from Hollywood for about 10 years before resurfacing in 2005 by directing his own terrific script with the immensely entertaining Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (my favorite movie of that year), and then hitting big-budget time with his script for Iron Man 3. This time, Mr. Black (directing and co-writing with Anthony Bagarozzi) returns to the detective-farcical-comedy-mystery-action genre and even adds an element of being a 1970's period piece.Black's rapid-fire wise-cracks were perfect fits for Mel Gibson and Robert Downey Jr, and for this project he's working with Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe ? both fine actors, though neither known for their comedic work. What's clear from the beginning of the film is that both Gosling and Crowe are fully committed to the material and their respective characters. Gosling plays a boozy Private Detective and single dad who just can't quite get things right, while Crowe plays a hired-hand bruise type ? think of his Bud White in L.A. Confidential (1997), only with an extra 50 pounds and a lot of miles. These two damaged boys play off each other very well, and with Black's dialogue and visual gags, the film provides a good number of laugh out loud moments ? more silly than the sophomoric humor that's so pervasive at multiplexes these days.Of course for comedy to really click, there needs to be some type of story to follow. In the opening scene a young boy (Ty Simpkins) watches as a car slams through his house, culminating with a "model/actress" named Misty Mountains meeting a not-so-pleasant ending. We then learn that Gosling's Holland has been hired to find Amelia (Margaret Qualley), who bears an uncanny resemblance to Ms. Mountains ? with two significant exceptions. Simultaneously, Amelia has hired Crowe's Jackson to convince Holland to stop searching for her. Soon enough, Holland and Jackson are working together on the "case" that mixes in the Auto industry (Big 3), Porn industry, Justice Department (government conspiracies), environmental protesters, Killer Bees, LA parties, LA smog, The Waltons (John Boy), The Rockford Files, Detroit, and Richard Nixon ? all hot topics in this 1977 era.As much as the story is needed, it really doesn't much matter. This is a movie of moments ? some of them featuring funny words, while others focus on pretty astute physical comedy. Gosling (and his stunt double) provides some pretty impressive gags as he is bounced and slammed around for most of the run time. The surprising heart of the film ? and moral core ? is Holland's daughter Holly played by Angourie Rice. Despite the title, she is really the only "nice guy" in the whole film, and her good-hearted nature keeps us rooting for Gosling and Crowe, despite their flaws.Other support work comes from Matt Bomer as a "John Boy" hit man, Keith David, Lois Smith, Yaya DaCosta (quick, name another Yaya), Beau Knapp (as the toothy Blueface), Jack Kilmer (Val's son as a "projectionalist"), and Kim Basinger (re-teaming with her LA Confidential co-star, Crowe). Also playing a significant role are the mid-to-late 1970's vehicles, the period music and houses and dcor that puts us right in the moment, and the clothes and hairstyles that are sure to inspire a chuckle or two.Fans of Lethal Weapon and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang will surely find plenty of laughter here ? despite one of the worst trailers in recent memory and even if the film is lacking the one thing it advertises ? nice guys.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie with honestly no idea as to how it was going to turn out. It was nice to see Russell Crowe starring in something different and I thought his pairing with Ryan Gosling could potentially create a solid comedic combo. All in all I thought the movie delivered well enough. It is definitely funny throughout, with no shortage of jokes to Ryan Gosling's expense or humorous scenarios in the film. The movie itself does not try too hard to be a comedy, but rather toes the line being decently funny while staying true to being an action/adventure flick. The movie flows nicely and is consistently entertaining. No scenes are really painful to sit through or necessarily dry. Overall my expectations were met and I definitely feel that I got my money's worth. Russell Crowe's performance is enjoyable to watch, as he effectively delivers a character that is likable and empathetic, while maintaining himself as the muscle of the duo. If you're going to go to the theaters soon this movie won't let you down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This tries way too hard to be Lethal Weapon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a while since Russell Crowe made a good movie. He's not quite on the Robert De Niro / Al Pacino spiral of stinkers but he's getting there and with The Nice Guys he continues on his own little run of movie dross. This is about a pair of 1970's private detectives who are hired to find a missing girl who is caught up in corruption involving the porn industry and people high up in office. That may sound interesting but believe me it's not. I found the whole plot of this film utterly dull and If that isn't bad enough the chemistry between Reynolds and Crowe was non existent. I didn't laugh once. This film tries so hard to be a Lethal Weapon or a 48 hours and never comes close. This one plus point from this film is 14 year old Angourie Rice who plays the clever kid really well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent homage to 70's violent cinema that was surprisingly not directed by Quentin Tarantino.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's set in the 1970's, and it feels like it was made in the 70's, and at the same time satirizes the 70's. Director Shane Black really brings the action comedy and crime thriller qualities and puts them together perfectly.Two private investigators(Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling) who are both mismatched, become unlikely partners to solve the sudden death of a porn star, and to find a young woman who may be connected, but quickly discover there is more than meets the eye.It's easy to imagine that Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe where having a blast making this. The two play off each other perfectly during the 70's setting. Angourie Rice(who looks like a young Reese Witherspoon) steals the show as Goslings daughter, she really becomes the heart of the movie, I hope to see more from her in the future. It has great laughs and suspense also. It really keeps you glued, I want to see more films like this in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shane Black is known for his involvement in the development of late 80's buddy cop film Lethal Weapon, The Last Boy Scout, Iron Man 3 and this solo underrated crime comedy flick Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Black returns with a new feature film that packs not only the key elements of his works but a solid buddy cop movie that definitely feels like a new Lethal Weapon film for the new generation.The plot follows two men; tough enforcer Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) and private investigator Holland March (Ryan Gosling) who has been down on his luck since the death of his wife but tries to raise his young per-teen daughter who paths cross when they discover Holly (Angourie Rice). At first Healy manages to get March off the case for a search of a fading adult film star in the 1970's, but it soon discovered that both men will need to work together when dead bodies surface and they are targeted by hit men. As they draw deeper into the case, a bigger conspiracy unfolds and both men are driven to solve the case.The Nice Guys plays so well; firstly the direction and the script are well presented that Black himself could write and vision, what is shown on screen is pretty much enjoyable with the production set detailed to high standards (the film is set around the 70's), it's soundtrack is catchy and nostalgic and costumes are presentable for the story's set era. The script is smart, funny and very much a noir mystery, I won't say too much on what is involved but knowing that Black's style of storytelling is a cult following, it surprises to be engaging throughout without a dull moment existing.Another strong key element that makes the movie work so well it's is great leads Crowe and Gosling, I don't think anyone would ever see these two in a film together but the chemistry they share is often smart, funny and forms the element purpose of a buddy cop film. Crowe manages to be the tough guy as we all see him, but he does give a convincing performance of a man that seems to roll with it. Gosling manages to run with the humour of his fallen character, showing his struggles of being an alcoholic and raising his daughter. Angourie Rice is an Australian actress from the deeply moving These Final Hours, here she show cases not to top over the leads or affect the plot but she serves well as both comic relief and support for the leading characters. The supporting cast handle themselves well, there is no miscast whatsoever.Overall, The Nice Guys plays out like a nod to noir crime thrillers of the 70's, old school action flicks of the era while it carries a feeling and tone of a buddy cop action/comedy that helps to keep the audience watching the plot unfold and see its leads play out in hilarious ways. Well worth a watch if you love Black's style of film or your just in the mood for a film that packs crime and comedy into the one.Nick - 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Nice Guys. NOT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These are the main reasons why The Nice Guys didn't do it for me: - This film wants us to take its ridiculously overstuffed story seriously, while the latter is mainly used as a pretext for jokes and "funny" situations.- Let's remember some key plot development parts. When the duo is searching for names or places, they just happen to stumble on them (mostly while driving). Towards the end of the film, a car accident forces their briefcase to open and unveils the fake money. All these are plain luck, but sure as hell aren't genius plot development. (Lest we forget, the dream sequence that leads to the accident, with objects talking to Ryan, is a gigantic clich) - Small segments of random scenes may seem relatively funny when secluded from the context of the movie. Take these segments and multiply them by 4 and you have a full scene which is not funny anymore. They just didn't know when to stop. Gosling is another victim of this practice. He obviously has comedic talent, but is constantly overdoing it.- Didn't like the pacing either. While I was waiting for the story to make some sense, the film unexpectedly slowed down a couple of times. During these parts, even the acting became subdued, causing coherence problems. "Not quite my tempo" - A little kid behaves like a clever adult. How original! - Talking about buddy comedies, even Rush Hour had a huge asset, and I'm talking about the great chemistry between the protagonists. Gosling- Crowe? Not so much. Well, to be honest... not at all! - The two main characters can be dumb. But they can be clever too. Depends on the scene. Wait... What?- "How long has he been missing?" "Since the funeral." Hands down hilarious. NOT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No chemistry between the stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I often find the best way to gauge a comedy is to see it in a packed theatre and observe how many jokes actually get genuine laughs out of the audience. I saw 'Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising' in a full theatre a couple of nights ago and nearly every single joke landed, and landed big, with many jokes causing loud and extended laughter. 'The Nice Guys' tonight however, was quite the opposite. The amount of pieces of intended humour that raised no sound at all were more plentiful than the ones that did. I laughed perhaps five times throughout the entire film and never once more than a quiet chuckle. The main problem was a lack of chemistry between Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling. Gosling was trying so hard in every scene to make things funny, but it was simply coming across as desperate. It wasn't natural. Jim Carrey overacts, but he still has a way of making it seem natural and hilarious. Very few people in Hollywood today can pull this off and Gosling is evidently not one of them. Crowe plays the straight guy, but doesn't add a lot in the comedy department either. A pairing like Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum in '21 Jump Street' and its sequel, are what these guys needed to style themselves more around. Those two worked as a team and got hilarious results. Crowe and Gosling were just playing for themselves, and it comes across that way.It's not all bad though. There are some good action sequences and the story moves at a fast enough pace to be interesting. In fact the story and action are a lot more enjoyable elements than the comedy side of things, which I never expected going in. At the end of the day though I think this set out to be a comedy and failed in doing so. There's a lot of positivity in the reviews of this film, but don't be fooled. It's not as fun of a ride as a lot of them are making out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great comedy noir, funny and entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Nice Guys is a great action comedy from the director of Lethal Weapon and Iron Man 3, Shane Black. Starring Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling, the movie tells the tale of a hapless drunk private investigator and his odd partnership with a tough guy-for-hire. The PI played by Gosling drinks and slouches his through the story while Crowe as the tough guy punches and fights anyone that gets in their way.I found this movie incredibly enjoyable from the comedy to the mystery to the few action scenes, all of it meshed together nicely. The acting was great for a comedy and the directing kept the pace moving fast. From escaping ruthless killers to confronting young activists to meeting with the head of the Justice apartment played by Kim Basinger and all through parties in the pornography and auto industry, the team up of Crowe and Gosling crack jokes and keep the mood light despite several deaths throughout.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mixing excessive violence with comedy rarely works. Here again the bone crushing, blood and gore just isn't funny. Well maybe it is when they toss a body over a fence and it crashes down on a wedding table. Of course there was no reason to toss the body except to get that laugh. Tossing a child through a glass window just isn't funny.Written and directed by Shane Black he gets all the credit and the blame. The movie takes place in the 70's and except for a couple of "hey" greetings it seemed like the script has been on Shane's shelf for 40 years. A couple of glimpses questioned the 1977 setting. Jaws 2 wasn't released yet and there appeared to be some newer structure along with the "Felix" sign. The movie projector in the house appeared to be 16mm. The reel in the projecting booth looked like 35mm. The film can being chased seemed empty especially when hosted into the air with extreme ease.There is no need to see this in the theater. It will play well and long on home platforms. If you are looking for a buddy action picture watch Black's earlier work which still hold up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disjointed, uneven, sporadically funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throughout this film I couldn't shake the feeling that I had missed something. Watching it is like watching a long, long trailer with all the highlights, but with the explanatory scenes cut out. Shane Black, the director, seems to want to put on the screen his whole "bag of tricks" without making the effort to connect them in logical or emotional order. Watching the film becomes like thumbing through a catalog of Hollywood tropes. Black throws one thing after another on to the wall to see what sticks. (Catalog or spaghetti on the wall, which is it? That will give you an idea of how disjointed and jarring the narrative is.)The film presents some genuinely funny moments. The problem is that they are not prepared for or followed up. In one scene (in the trailer) the two dump a body over a fence. Big laugh! But so what? We have almost no idea about the people on whose table the body is dumped. Where do they fit into Black's word? Having a body land on your patio table is a very effective metaphor of the corrupt nature of L.A., but it's immediately abandoned. I felt left in the lurch.The director has declared that he wanted to convey, underneath the comedy, a more serious message about a corrupt world in which two knights in tarnished armor must make their way. So far, so good. The problem, again, is that he hasn't paid enough attention to establishing their backgrounds or to the development of their relationship. I felt constantly off balance and blind- sided.Which relationship is primary: the one between the two detectives, or the one between Gosling's character and his daughter? The film can't seem to make up its mind and doesn't define either very satisfactorily. I kept comparing this film to "Paper Moon," and the latter won every time.The director also declared that the moral objective of these knights is to protect little girls (among whom, besides Gosling's daughter, are adult female characters like Misty Mountains and Amelia). This is sentimental and patronizing. If we have learned anything since the seventies, it is that (1) women demand the right to make on their own decisions, and (2 ) that little boys and men deserve protection, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Niiiiice job Shane Black for directing and co-scripting with inventive flair the very groovy and immensely entertaining "The Nice Guys". The movie is set in the 70's and stars Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling as (respectively) hit- for-hire man Jackson Healy and clumsy P.I. Holland March. Circumstances that are uproarious in happenstance lead them to team up to find a missing teen named Amelia, who just might be the key to revealing more not-too-nice foul play situations. Kim Basinger co-stars as Amelia's mother who hires The Nice Guys to find Amelia before she gets lost in the clouds (with all due apologies to the late, great Amelia Earheart for that pun). "The Nice Guys" will be like no other movie you will see this year; its distinctive quality and magnetic unpredictability are two major reasons this movie is a very nice gem. But of course, other nice gems come in the form of Crowe and Gosling for their super nice performances; Sure the real Crowe has had his real life moments of not being too nice, but who cares, he was very nice here as Healy. And give that Gosling fellow an Oscar nomination for his uproarious performance as March, it's the Ides of March!! Hey, wasn't he in that movie? And hail to Mr. Black for putting all this nice stuff together! It's time for you to play nice and take &amp; have a trip with "The Nice Guys". ***** Excellent</fullReview>

A few of you wrote you were somewhat confused as to the direction of the plot and I can assure you, you're not alone. Comedic relief didn't hold up against this disaster. We almost walked out but stayed in hopes it would get better. I have no idea where all these great reviews and ratings are coming from. Were we watching the same film? Please don't waste your time, money or the 2 hours of your life to see this in the theater. I am actually surprised Gosling would choose this horrendous script to work with, although his acting was on par and more than decent, it wasn't enough to save this tragic POS from itself. I'm shocked this is something Shane Black would write. I love his films but he missed the mark on this one, sadly. The comedy was trying hard to carry through but never quite caught on and most of the time felt entirely out of place. The young girl playing Gosling's daughter did a very nice job but the rest of the acting fell so far below any expectation I had for this film. This is my first review here.

		<shortDescription>This is a terrible movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a massive Shane Black fan, this movie is crushing. And I defended "The Last Boy Scout." Warner Bros. seems to be getting his dreck as Marvel uses him as a gun for hire to fool Warner to believe he can direct. He can't. This movie is an absolute mess. I am certain Black can't possibly be proud of this movie. It's awful.Sure, thank you kindly for the repeat shots of porn star tits. Or, the debaucherous scumbag references of Los Angeles, but aside from all that, it just is too silly to even be interesting.The year is 1977, and we are deep into a plot about a thug-for-hire Russell Crowe and a sad-sack gumshoe (Ryan Gosling) with a daughter. There's some tragic story there about the mother's absence, but it is strangely played for laughs. As is Russell Crowe's backstory. There is none. He seems to be a good guy who wants to do good, but sees the world as awful. Presumably a recovering drunk, he hires Gosling's P.I. to track down a girl gone missing. Sound familiar? Yep, "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" follows the template. Except here, it's really ugly and not very fun. The story takes odd turns, leads come up dead?and the wise-cracking timing is off somehow. There are good moments, but that's all there is. There are the moments of endearment. Dad jokes type endearing, where you feel it's been told to Black by a drunken molest-y uncle or something. It's silly stuff you see in every movie he writes. Everything just seemed so misplaced. The action didn't even seem all that thrilling. And the fight sequences are clunky. Save for punch sounds, you wouldn't know if anyone even got hit. And the teen daughter in the world of porn in the 70's is really odd. Odd that it probably seemed more natural in a movie like "Boogie Nights" but for Gosling's kid, she was suppose to seem precocious, ended up being a lot more unnerving. The movie is also shot digitally. Film negative would've added so much more to the mood of the movie. And you can tell how much they were fighting with the modernized look of digital with the analog look of film. The setting just looked..plastic and flat. There wasn't that aged feel, even though they had "aged" film in the movie itself. If you're going for a plot, there is none. ? through the movie you're actually really confused as to what they are suppose to be doing. Never fear, someone comes into push the story forward. It happens too many times that you wonder if luck doesn't play a role in their work. They're not good detectives or muscle, they're just passive bystanders waiting for someone to tell them their next move. TERRIBLE mistake. I get that the studios probably thought "we can't pass on the guy who wrote 'Lethal Weapon.'" That is close to 30 years old. Wow, what a difference Black is going through. He's lost so much more when he started directing. Weird, since it seems most people figure out how to directed by writing. This movie stinks bad. Sorry?it just does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so nice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The people who created the coming attractions for this film deserve an Oscar. They made me believe it was going to be a great buddy drama, something akin to "Bad Boys" or "The Last Boy Scout" (of which this is a strange clone). Instead it is a mindless waste of talent with virtually nothing to recommend it.The acting is only slightly better than bad. And there is no chemistry at all between any of the main characters - a grave sin in a buddy film.The film takes place in 1977 but there is almost nothing to evoke the era. Neither the music, dress, locations, or slang bring us back to that era.Then there's the plot, or lack of it. I won't reveal it here, but you wouldn't believe it if I did.Don't waste your time or money. If you've seen the coming attractions you've already seen the only worthwhile scenes in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(RATING: &#x2606;? out of 5) THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: A bubble-headed rehash of crime thrillers and buddy movies.GRADE: D+SYNOPSIS: Two inept detectives try to unravel a mystery during the groovy 70's.JIM'S REVIEW: Take the popular buddy movies of the 80's, add the retro good vibes of the 70's and quickly stir in the grisly blood and violence of the 90's and voila!...you have a half-baked movie entitled The Nice Guys, a film with no identity to call its own. To any unsuspecting moviegoer sitting through this dreadful rehash, the age-old adage, nice guys finish last, becomes all too true.The setting is L.A. during the mid 70's. Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe play misfits Holland March and Jackson Healy, a couple of low-life PIs who join forces to solve a convoluted mystery involving a missing girl, a porn starlet, and how two distinguished actors can pick a real loser. This alleged comedy is directed by Shane Black, whose previous experiences with this crime genre, like Lethal Weapon and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, has shown the filmmaker to have had some relative success. Here, he is more concerned with capturing the seventies era with his references to killer bees, rationed gas lines, disco music, and pong video games than delivering an entertaining and logical film.His screenplay, co-written with Anthony Bagarozzi, is a total mess. Its plot frequently detours to violent chases and shoot-outs as it tries to connect the two unsolved cases and add some far less clever one-liners between the assorted mayhem. The crime and the comedy elements rarely align unless one agree that this comedy is indeed a crime and a waste of time and talent.The casting of Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe, two actors known more for their heavy dramatic roles rather than their light comic style, seems off from the start. When it comes to the high art of comedy, the track record of both actors is spotty as best. (While Mr. Gosling has had some success in this area, with film projects such as Crazy, Stupid, Love and Lars and the Real Girl, Mr. Crowe's comedy film credits include only Noah, a true laugh-riot.) Together, the two leads have zero chemistry between them. Their foray as two wild and crazy guys is a dismal failure. Their so-called comedy bits are labored and bereft of humor. In fact, in one desperate scene, Mr.Gosling tries to channel the comic timing of Bud Abbott's double takes which elicited groans rather than laughs from the audience members. A paunchy Mr. Crowe is briefly united with an air-brushed Kim Basinger, his LA Confidential co-star, in a brief scene or two. Let us just say time has not been kind to either star and move on from there. In supporting roles, Matt Bomer is underused as John Boy, a paid assassin, and Beau Knapp as a blue-faced killer is more annoying than menacing.The talents of fine actors like Keith David and Lois Smith are squandered in this dud. Only Margaret Qualley as Amelia and Angourie Rice as Holland's wiser-than-her-years teenage daughter create real characters, but that is due to their screen presence rather than the dialog they are spewing. (Both actresses make a strong impression and do deserve better parts.)The film is interminably long, makes absolutely no sense, and has no laughs...none! The Nice Guys makes for miserable company.

		<shortDescription>Simply the Best Movie of 2016</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beauty of this cinematic masterpiece lies within two frank elements. Shane Blacks incredible script and direction. The second element is the cast - equally as superb. Equally as enigmatic! This buddy, noir, almost comic book representation encapsulates the perfect science of making a movie well. Shane Black has an incredible edge when it comes to producing a script that has you screaming for more. The wit is second to none, the shocks are timed well and the dialogue is simply sublime. Mix this with a master class in direction and you have a movie that will etch its way into the "favourite" category within that film library in your mind. I was overwhelmed with gratitude for this film. It was fresh and a change from the normal daliances with overweight ties to super hero flicks that seem to dominate the screen at the moment. Sometimes, simple, catchy, energetic dialogue and good, well rounded acting is all you need to make a film special. Gosling and Crowe are splendid. Crowe stands out as the "chequered past" investigative partner of Gosling. He is rough and ready, humorous and big on screen. His portrayal of Jackson Healy is one of the best I have seen of Crowe of late. Black seemed to bring the life back to Crowe as he slung his whiskey soured voice around the movie without breaking a sweat. He is endearing and captures the performance with an ease of timing and purpose that makes you hungry. Equally, Gosling is frenetic and brilliant. His character portrayal is beautifully and mercilessly flawed. This gives an added extra as Gosling seems to perfect his portrayal of Holland March with a methodical flow. You become sympathetic and angry at the character. A testament to the brialliance of Gosling. The combination works and it works well. At first I was uneasy about Crowe and Gosling being able to pull off this buddy team. However, your mind is at ease as soon as they hit the screen together. There is another who makes this films cast stand out. Screen starlet Angourie Rice (who plays Goslings daughter Holly March) - tempers the relationship between Crowe and Gosling. This is not her only attribute as she stands firm in her own shameless portrayal. She is quite the actress. Her humour and movement give her, easily the break away performance of this movie. There is quite a support cast (look it up). This movie is a gem. I don't need or want to say too much because I genuinely want people to watch it. My faith in good, old fashioned, simple, well put together screen plays have been restored. This movie shows that there is not always a need to spend 12.3 billion dollars on an ensemble cast with heavy special effects. It is simple and beautiful. It is irreverent and conclusive. The only bitter pill to swallow was that it ended....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Original Buddy Cop Movie that is Action Packed and Funny with a Top Notch Cast,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Nice Guys is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. It is really what I think most movies should be, what a lot of them are forgetting to be nowadays, it comes up with an interesting premise and delivered the promise it had spectacularly. Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe shine as a duo, the chemistry between them is evident throughout, they play off one another in ways that are tense at times, and other times that will have you in stitches. The story is also marvelous, it's original, it takes the buddy cop/detective concept and spins it on its head, it kept me at the edge of my seat as the sense of mystery is also highly evident throughout. The Nice Guys is a movie, for me, that is almost perfect, it does not take itself too seriously, it knew what it was and respected that fact, and by knowing what it was, an action comedy, it tried to become a better version of that, and it succeeded. Gosling, Crowe and the great Shane Black made an incredible trio and brought us an exciting movie that will keep you at the edge of your seat and laughing out loud at the same, the atmosphere in the cinema was one of the best I had ever experienced, everyone loved it. I would recommend it to all moviegoers, definitely worth the watch if you are looking for an action, comedy or crime film. Two mismatched men are forced to work together to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a young girl. Best Performance: Ryan Gosling</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A recommended watch, despite its flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is great fun, and it's easy to narrow down why: The performances from Gosling and Crow, and the characters they portray. Not only are there several instances of hilarious dialogue and banter between the two, but even some first class physical comedy, way ahead of most other action/comedy movies made these days. Especially Gosling has some hilarious moments.It's hard not to compare this movie with Shane Black's previous film "Kiss kiss bang bang", which also includes a hilarious duo that stumble through a mystery that's way bigger than the both of them. There are some differences, though. In KKBB, the balance of competence is very uneven, where Kilmer's character is the competent one, and Downey plays the moral compass. In the movie, they are more even, with Gosling and Crow both playing deeply flawed characters, with each their strengths. The balance works, and much like KKBB, they are hilarious together. In KKBB the female sidekick is also a love interest, while in this movie it is the daughter of Gosling's character. The setting is a bit different, but it is still set in the entertainment industry, and with some similar locations.The movie suffers a bit from too much build up, with too little pay of. There are several elements introduced that seem like they are supposed to pay of in a funny/interesting way later on, but that end up only being used in one or two gags. This movie would have lent itself perfect for running gags, and there's one that has great potential, but is dropped quite quickly (a character that accidentally kills the wrong person a couple of times).There seems to always be some sense of self-awareness in Shane Black's movies, where clichs are either broken, or commented upon. Ryan Gosling's character has a moment in the movie here that very much keeps up with this, where he acknowledges the streak of luck he seems to have. I love how Black plays around the tropes and clichs of the genre, but wish that the story/plot would be as solid like KKBB.So, while this does not hold up to KKBB in many regards, it's still way better than most others out there, and I highly recommend watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . long BEFORE the fact, not decades AFTER the shark's been jumped. However, at first glance THE NICE GUYS seems to be chewing cud already masticated in the 1900s, as alcoholic drug-addled Califorians plot to eliminate the U.S. Middle Class by replacing the Classic Cars of Detroit (such as Mustangs, Corvettes, Continentals, Caddies, GTO's, and Chargers) with an Invasion of Axis Imports from America's Revenge-Minded Enemies of World War Two, led by Germany, Italy, and Japan. As each Trojan Horsepower takes a hundred bucks out of a True Blue American's pocket (or $20,000 plus per vehicle), THE NICE GUYS documents how civil order breaks down, with everyone at risk of Death by Random Gunshot, as bodies rain down from the rooftops (unless they're burned up in arson fires or Smushed by killer foreign cars first). Ryan Gosling's character drives a German Mercedes here. The script for THE NICE GUYS is sprinkled with references to Hitler, since Adolph is having the "last laugh" now. Perhaps Warner's warning is that if you think things have been bad the last 50 years, just wait and see how much WORSE things will get with a One Per Center Secretive Billionaire representing the Trilaterals in the White House!</fullReview>

Somethings teenagers would love to relate to. You come out with a smile on your face.

		<fullReview>The Nice GuysIf it weren't for bad fathers there wouldn't be any porn stars in the world today.Thankfully, there are no shortages of either in this buddy-comedy.When an adult film actress (Margaret Qualley) disappears, a gruff enforcer (Russell Crowe) is forced to work with a PI (Ryan Gosling) and his daughter (Angourie Rice) in order to find her - and to dissuade a dangerous third-party.But when her latest project turns out to be an X-rated expose on the car industry's exhaust inhibitor cover-up, the motley detectives find themselves searching for her misplaced stag film at the 1977 L.A. Auto Show.With all of the sleaze of 1970s pulp cinema and the witty banter and odd couple camaraderie of classic comedic duos, Gosling and Crowe forge a unique bromance through a sharp script and apt directing.Furthermore, porn shoots make the best crime scenes on account they're covered in DNA evidence.

		<shortDescription>Hell yeah</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Nice Guys is a torrential downpour of laughs, prat falls and lovable idiocracy, a formula which director Shane Black perfected with his super underrated Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. This one is no doubt it's sister film, and while it has comedy in spades, top tier performances all round and luscious 1970's production design, it's just a we bit under- plotted. Having said that, that's my one and only complaint about it. It's the funniest film of the year by far, thanks to the rough and tumble pairing of Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling. Crowe is Jackson Healy, a mopey hired thug who will put the hurt on anyone if the dollar is right. This occupation has him cross the path of Holland March (Gosling) an ex cop PI who, according to his daughter (Angourie Rice), is the world's worst detective. He's certainly a buffoon, a trait which forms one half of their comedic shtick, the other being Healy's laid back exasperation every time March gets them into trouble, which is pretty much throughout the entire film. The two of them unwittingly stumble into a dangerous turn events involving the justice department, murder, the apparent suicide of a porn star (Margaret Qualley), a very scary assassi (Matt Bomer) and one angry goon played by an afro'd out Keith David. It's tough to make heads or tails of what's really going on, but like Kiss Kiss Bang Bang it's not about the plot or the outcome, it's more about watching the characters trip over each other in style as they get there. Crowe is terrific, a bear of a dude who's in way over both his head, IQ and pay grade, aghast at Gosling's antics at every turn. Gosling's character belongs to that special class of stupid that is so clumsy that he circumnavigates his own ineptitude and ends up falling right into clues, without a clue how he got there. After a string of recent stoic introvert roles, he's the most animated character of the film and is clearly having a ball. None of what the duo do would be possible without March's precocious 13 year old daughter, played with uncanny ability by Rice, whose star is going to be solidly on the rise, I'd wager. A reunion of sorts occurs with the arrival of Kim Basinger as the head of the justice department, joining Crowe again after their work in L.A. Confidential. Basinger isn't given much to do ultimately, but her presence is a welcome addition to the vibe. Black deserves kudos for his gorgeous recreation of L.A. in the 70's, right down to the sickening lampshades pastel suits and souped up cars it's a treat to see. The energy from Crowe and Gosling is where it's at with this one, and they both eagerly tuck in to the dialogue, making this one groovy, delirious riot of a flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You know who else was just following orders?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you see this wonderful movie for the first time, don't worry if you find the relationship between the two leads and the daughter slightly familiar, Black has just borrowed some of the elements from the equally wonderful The Last Boy Scout.And why shouldn't he, he wrote it? Holland March is a down-on-his-luck private eye in 1977 Los Angeles. Jackson Healy is a hired enforcer who hurts people for a living.Fate turns them into unlikely partners after a young woman named Amelia mysteriously disappears.Healy and March soon learn the hard way that some dangerous people are also looking for Amelia.Their investigation takes them to dark places as anyone else who gets involved in the case seems to wind up dead.If you are familiar with Black's body of work, then you will know that he is one of the most talented writers of the action genre, and he practically invented the Buddy movie thanks to the likes of Lethal Weapon, Last Boy Scout, The Long Kiss Goodnight, and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.But what keeps his writing so fresh and lively is, quite ironically, the fact that seems to follow the same pattern with his characters and the people they seem to run into during different settings of the film.Crowe hasn't been this good in an absolute age, and it's wonderful to see him putting in a great performance, and seemingly be having a whale of a time with the script.Gosling is surprisingly hilarious as the hapless PI, and his comic timing is spot on. There is one scene when he discovers something in the woods where he emulates Lou Costello perfectly. And the chemistry between the leads is almost as perfect as Riggs and Murtaugh.This could well have been a franchise if the film was more successful.Black has proved himself once again that he is an exciting writer, and to think he's written some of the most prolific action movies of the past three decades is highly impressive.The film is a hoot from start to finish, and the set pieces, especially the one at the party, and the finale are pure works of genius.easily one of the films of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On paper this film would appear as middling and unimpressive as the CV of a middle-aged company-man reeling from redundancy. Desperate, predictable and rife with so many buzzwords that HR's spide.y-senses would tingle - eagerly anticipating an opportunity to snuff-out yet another pathetic attempt. 'I'm sorry, Mr. Doe, but unfortunately you were not considered for the position.'That presumption was wrong - in fact, it couldn't be further from the truth.Enter the middle-aged bruiser; stubble unkempt; dress - functional and straight off the rack; imposing. Short on time and patience - he doesn't get paid by the word. Surely he's inaccessible, you posturi.ze? Long uninterrupted monologues provide momentary glimpses into the 'inner- workings' of the veteran. By the end it's clear that all symptoms have dissipated, Doctor - the emotional constipation has passed. A man of action; of professionalism; he's the guy you want to be. Russell Crowe's physical attributes, his rasp and his charm sell, sell, sell on this one.The yin.g to this yang: a young, good-looking, well-put-together slick-ster; fast-talking, confident and full of good intentions. It helps to be witty when you couldn't fight your way out of a wet paper bag - he often succeeds in-spite of himself. He will always give it the old college try and somehow it works. There's being lucky and then there's being Holland March. He's lovable and totally flawed; he's the guy you can relate to. I don't have time to even mention his child prodigy - and what a performance.Both work in people - one person, in particular, puts them on a collision course of confrontation, collaboration and eventual conspir.ation. A mutual ruthless entrepreneur-ialism brings them together - money talks, after-all; a unwavering moral compass binds them. They bounce off each other so naturally and with such comedic success that it's easy to buy-in - effortless even. OK, so you get it - it's the unlikely friendship that results in a win. Not quite. The film perfectly paints a picture of transition. The team that can't seem to catch a break ends up being the only two people you'd consider capable of doing the job - in fact every main character reaches their own personal summit in the end. It's satisfying. The plot escalates onwards and upwards and without my consent - these sudden points of inflection, a literal moment of turning on one's heels, keeps the plot's focus in a constant state of flux. It scraps the 'beginning-middle-end' formula in large part by making the scenes timeline feel continuous - I sat down and BANG... Roll credits. Now that's engagement, folks. Frantic; from the outset the pace is awe-inspiring. Every single inch of screen real-estate is utilized, as is character airtime; witticisms and one- liners feel necessary; cuts and transitions have purpose; foreshadowing is constant and, ultimately, all of the above feature solely in aid of the narrative through-line that will keep you on your toes. There's no excess fat to trim. Is this how a buddy-cop tribute, set in a 70's L.A manages to feel fresh? I think so. *CLIFF HANGER* Quick cut. Cue: Curious funky bass- line. Scoring infallible. Any film set 50 years ago is at risk of hanging it's hat on prevailing modernist perspectives of the past - not in this case. Nixon, Earth Wind and Fire, porno-staches and bell-bottoms make cameos, but it happens so naturally and feels so credible that the fourth wall comes off unscathed. If you could put this film in a time-capsule and watch it 20 years from now, or even 20 years removed, I feel it would still work - this one will age very well indeed. Even the 'action' feels sincere - the 'Jason Bourne' effect is thankfully absent and yet the sense of realistic physicality rings just as true when such moments are called upon. Nothing in this film feels heavy-handed once you accept that the premise itself - and the premise alone - is a dime a dozen. Hey, Hollywood - this is what tip-top writing and execution can get you. Go figure!To summarize: this movie manages to flip the script on an old classic. The cobwebs weren't blown out, they were vanquished. Maybe I'm a mark, but when the lights came on and I looked around the theater my immediate feelings were ratified - I wasn't the only one smiling from ear to ear. I will give you my money - right now - now give me a sequel. Don't label this a 'love- letter'. I'm hip, man - consider it an exercise in purely self-indulgent hyperbole. And remember: 'For the birds'.Peace + Plants, JR.</fullReview>

Sure this movie is definitely not for everyone but what movie is?I laughed throughout the movie as well as all the people in the theater around me. The comedy is suited more towards adults and I thought Ryan Gosling surprisingly quite funny. While not of Russell Crowe's best performances he is convincing as an enforcer and still does a good job. The girl in the movie did a very good job and I enjoyed her role not being the helpless girl that does stupid things. I liked the plot of the movie and without giving too much away found it to flow pretty well without very many obvious flaws, although the ending did seem to go against the tone of the movie, but i was satisfied by it. Basically the two men join together to find a girl named Amelia and it goes from there as they continue to find clues and connections.So overall I enjoyed the plot and characters and laughed through out the movie. If you like kiss kiss bang bang (same director Shane Black) then chances are this movie is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Nice Guys begins with the killer bass-line of "Papa Was a Rollin' Stone" and some 1970s attention grabbing neon font, and just like that I arrived in 1977 in my time machine. The film hearkens back to the heyday of bubby movies of the 80s, the celebrated world of porn stars and the crime noir of the 70s. All these is given neo-twist of a fresh lemon slice and wala... out comes a new concoction that I gleefully drank non-stop for 2 hours. The story is not really as important as the ride. It is merely about an enforcer (Russell Crowe) and the world's lousiest private investigator (Ryan Gosling) joining forces to look for a girl named Amelia. Along the way they will encounter goons, a hired killer, Pocahontas, a human fly and strippers dressed as mermaids in a world of government conspiracy. I only managed to glean the story much later on and was befuddled for the first two-thirds of the movie, but that never took away any joy, not one single bit. I found myself laughing out loud at the hilarious antics of these intensely lovable pricks. Writer-director Shane Black gets the "anything goes" tone and the 70s vibe just right and deftly balances the gravity of the story and the hilarity of the situations. How I know? I found myself laughing at sequences of gratuitous bloodletting as boorish people die on screen. That is not an easy feat to achieve. Even though the film is far from perfect, the snappy dialogue crackles with such vibrancy that it smooths out the uneven passages. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling makes a superb pairing for an odd couple and both of them dial down their gravitas to serve the story. They also have the help of Gosling's daughter, Holly (Angourie Rice) to neatly get them out of plenty of troublesome situations. What a threesome they make! Endlessly charming and free-flowingly hilarious, you would want to hire these not so nice guys for a missing person case and watch the ensuing havoc with a beer in your hand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a fun 70's romp. I almost wish it would have spent a little more time showcasing the 70's (much in the way Zodiac 2007 did), because that is the film's biggest strength next to Crowe and Gosling. There's a few head scratching moments and the movie falters logically in a few places, but overall a fun film with good chemistry between most of the characters. Disappointing to have Keith David cast in a prominent role, but given almost nothing to say. Give the guy at least a few good lines to showcase his voice. Russell Crowe is distractingly overweight. I can see his character as being a bit pudgy, but there are some shots in this movie where you fear for his health. This review is a bit focused on the negative, which it shouldn't be. Good performances, overall good writing, fun movie.Spoiler: There is an interesting moment in this movie where the character delivers a monologue gradually directly into the camera basically saying that the Detroit automakers do not want you to see this movie because it exposes the truth about pollution, and there is a comical moment referencing electric cars and other hints here and there regarding oil, cars, etc.. The film seemed to want to convey a subtle message about the future (our present) regarding pollution, transportation, and fossil fuels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Guys is no Kiss Kiss, but still goes Bang Bang!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No spoilers ahead- Writer/Director Shane Black has returned from the highly underrated Marvel film, Iron Man 3, with The Nice Guys. The film is extremely entertaining and had me laughing throughout the entire 110min run time. I did myself a favor and only watched the first trailer for The Nice Guys. This allowed most of the comic skits to play out unseen by myself and hit hard for me! I feel the chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe was on point, with much of their adventure together being more entertaining on screen then when they were not on screen together. Don't get me wrong, both Gosling and Crowe are master performers, but together they really shine! I feel the plot of the film was a little hard to keep up with all the pieces, but overall the film closed all those loose ends up. The Nice Guys definitely deserves a second watch while in theaters to grab onto anything I may have missed during my first screening. One of the best parts was the ending. Because today's films are always looked at as possible film franchises, The Nice Guys does not shy from this, but is wrapped up and president as a stand alone film. However, the ending does leave us with an out to bring in sequels, with brand new stories staring these two private investigators. The 70s setting is a great time period to place a film franchise, and even in this first film the writes remind us it's not so easy to phone someone when you don't have cell phones in the 70s. I really love how the writers used the time placement to play on the story. Definitely check this film out, if you haven't already. Overall, I highly recommend this film! Spoiler alert, this film is not a child friendly film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Buddy Cop Movie Without The Cops</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "The Nice Guys", starring Russell Crowe-The Man With The Iron Fists, L.A. Confidential; Ryan Gosling-Gangster Squad, Young Hercules_tv; Kim Basinger-L.A. Confidential, Wayne's World 2; Margaret Qualley-The Leftovers_tv, Palo Alto and Matt Bomer-White Collar_tv, Chuck_tv.This is a nice throwback to the old buddy/cop movies, only these are not cops. It's directed by Shane Black and if you don't know his name, you should. He had his influential hand in some great action movies; he wrote Iron Man 3, Long Kiss Goodnight, The Last Boy Scout and the Lethal Weapon movies, and he directed Iron Man 3 and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. That is a nice little resume. The movie takes place in 1977 Los Angeles. Russell plays a guy that is hired by people, just to beat up people-that is actually how he makes a living. Margaret hires Russell to scare off some people that are looking for her. Ryan is a private detective-the world's worst, according to his own daughter-that is hired to find Margaret by Kim, who also happens to be Margaret's mother. Matt plays a dangerous hit man that is after Margaret, and his name is John Boy- anyone remember the Walton's? It has both action and comedy. I don't want to give too much away but other plot elements involve a dead porn star named Misty Mountains and a film that exposes a government conspiracy involving the Detroit automakers and their polluting of the environment. Ryan even gets to do his best impression of Bud Abbott. It's rated "R" for violence, language, drug use and sexual content- including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 56 minutes. I really liked this one and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Something was seriously off with the plot of this movie. First Crowe seems like a savvy detective and then he hires bumbling detective Gosling to find a woman for some reason not entirely clear to the audience. Why a detective should hire another detective to work for him is beyond me and I can think of other ways the script could have brought these two together into this really stupid buddy movie. Then the dynamic shifts where Gosling seems to be the smart one and Crowe is depending on him to find this woman who might or might not be a porn star. I'm having a difficult time writing this, as you can tell. If my synopsis appears confusing well, that's how I felt in the movie. I still feel weirdly unsure about what role each of them played.I did not find the funny scenes funny. To me they were forced and a little pathetic. Apologies to Crowe and Gosling, I loved you both in just about everything else you've done.There were three scenes (before I left the theater) that contained children talking about or being exposed to very adult sexual content that crossed the line into inappropriate.1979 came off strange to me and not entirely right. Sometimes it looked like the 80's and sometimes a bit like the 60's. Maybe that was just me. I was also a little distracted by the couple sitting behind me talking all throughout the movie. Do I shush them? Report them to theater management? Or just walk out? Well, since the movie sucked...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boogie Nights Redux</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of those films so aswim in the culture of porn that you wonder why....oh yes, there's that, the seeming limitless appetite of Hollywood for pure, unadulterated trash with a heavily misogynistic overtone. Maybe the word should be undertow. Everything that passes for a plot is mere window-dressing, what sustains this awful effort is the lurid atmosphere. And there is one disturbing element that is so prominent it can't be an accident. The children in this film, appearing in very disturbing scenes - it's downright degenerate. "Boogie Nights" used banal acting and a tired plot to mimic the feel of porn films. So it could claim (a lame claim) to be a parody, although its moral emptiness was so close to the real thing it might as well have been the real thing. "The Nice Guys" has something of the same feel. The exploitation of women and young girls, dumb scenes (hundreds of rounds shot, no one hit), cheesy music, how really different it is from the junk the porn industry turns out - except for two A-list actors?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Instant classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I had to pick my favorite screenwriter of all time, I would probably have to pick Shane Black. Despite not being nearly as prolific as he once was, every time a new Shane Black penned film rolls around, it's always a treat. The trailer for The Nice Guys made me hopeful that the film would be the kind of comedic action flick that used to be made in the 1980s and 1990s, one where the plot actually mattered. As it turns out, while the very action-heavy trailer for the film is somewhat misleading, The Nice Guys is still not only a great surprise, but also my favorite movie of the past decade.Those expecting non-stop gunfire and constant jokes may be disappointed by the fact that The Nice Guys is, first and foremost, a period piece mystery. Set in 1977, the story follows hard-drinking private detective Holland March (Ryan Gosling) and hard enforcer Jackson Healey (Russell Crowe in his most entertaining performance ever) as they try to find Amelia Kutner, a missing young woman who may be in way over her head. This may sound like a plot that would be full of clichs, predictable story beats, and characters that have been seen over and over again. While it's true that The Nice Guys does lean on a few staples of the genre, it's also consistently surprising, completely fascinating, and even unexpectedly touching in a few places. This being a Shane Black film, there's still plenty of hilarious lines and comedic elements, but it's a bit less jokey and quip-filled than a lot of his previous work. The story and the characters come first here. When the occasional action scene does happen, it feels purposeful rather than just thrown in to be cool or keep the audiences' attention. Black's direction in these scenes is better than ever, as the shoot-out that concludes the film is the most entertaining action scene I've seen in at least five years.The biggest surprise for me is how great Crowe and Gosling are together. I've never loved or hated either one of them, as I've always been kind of indifferent to their respective careers. But here, Gosling and Crowe are absolutely perfect in their roles. Funny, sad, mysterious, and cool at times, both their characters are ones that are great to spend the entire screen time with, even when they aren't necessarily, as the title puts it, nice guys. They are insanely well written, damaged, and completely compelling characters throughout every scene. In supporting roles, Kim Basinger, Matt Bomer, and newcomer Angourie Rice shine in parts that could have been stock characters. Every person in this movies so amazingly good that it's hard to pick a favorite.If there's one flaw in The Nice Guys, it's that the very end, while totally in line with the type of story being told, is a minor letdown. The ending is an appropriate one for the film, but it could have used a bit of punching up. The ending leaves things open for a sequel, one which will never happen due to the low opening weekend numbers. There's no movie I would rather see than The Nice Guys 2. The characters lend themselves to the possibility of a great franchise.I can't overstate what a blast The Nice Guys is to me as a movie fan. I won't go as far as to call it flawless, but it is as close to perfect of a film as I'm likely to see the rest of 2016. I loved almost every second of it, and would gladly sit through a longer cut in a heartbeat. The Nice Guys is an instant classic, one that I will definitely be watching over and over again. Highly recommended. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One star is given for having Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling in a movie together, two stars are for the brief moments of nudity that were displayed and 0 stars for rest of the film. This was an erratic film of unknown purpose with a convoluted plot line that made no F*king sense. Set in the 70s with two guys just running around doing random things to random people. Why was this film even made beats me, save your money and watch Angry birds, at least you can play the game if you're bored! I am filling more lines so that this review can be posted, I just want to make sure people save their money so they can use it for food or shelter which is better than spending it on this stupid movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right. I was hoping to avoid the loud larry curly and moe noises I've heard from Mister Gosling ever since seeing him in a place between the Pines....that was the last theatrical release that ide seen him in. I skipped Blue Valentine and forced myself to watch Mobsters INC...or gang squad...something like that..which I liked better. reading other peoples reviews hi lighted what I think they liked about the film....shrugging things off like water down a ducks back...but seriously...money was the main motivation for the guys to be involved in their coexistence. One of the bigger things to upset me were for example the two hit men...Russel Crowe runs into them again and immediately they fight...Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling have a fight and there isn't an urgency to reciprocate the painful process of that outcome. Using my imagination and seeing the streets and neighborhoods and cocktail parties were the best part of this film. Things that people thought were funny I didn't...I actually didn't think that I laughed at any point of this movie. Even when the little girl feels bad for one of the hit men that got hit by a van and goes to get Help.....Maybe that was the funniest scene to me? But I don't recommend this movie and it does do its best to give you a vision of that old FREAKY DEAKY and Royal TeneBaum era in your face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Was What I Thought It Would Be and Was What I Wanted It To Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say from the trailer I was hoping for a movie that was fun, full of action, funny, and has good dialogue.This movie was exactly what the trailer promised me.I'll try not to spoil the movie, but I'm checking it just in case and read at your own risk.It almost seems odd that Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling have never worked together before because they were really good together. Gosling plays Holland March, an alcoholic cynical private investigator, and Crowe plays Jackson Healy, a thug for hire.We don't seem to know much about these characters pasts, but Healy seems driven by a desire to do good and help people. He is far from idealistic though, he's very subdued throughout the movie like life has dragged him to the edge of hopelessness. March, well it's not clear if his wife is dead or they're not together anymore, but he is a cynic and pretty much a loser with a 13 year old daughter who takes care of him and while she loves him, also is hugely frustrated by him.Both men find themselves involved with a girl named Amelia, March is looking for her because she's connected to a missing person case he's working and Healy is hired by her for protection before disappearing.This however only proves to be the beginning as the two men find themselves working together, Healy because the mob trashed his home looking for Amelia and March because he needs the money.All the actors do a great job from Gosling playing a loser drunk who is surprisingly sharp at times to Crowe playing a thug who wants to help a girl who wanted to be safe to Angourie Rice playing Holly the daughter. I'm also impressed by Matt Bomer who plays a hit-man named John Boy. I'm used to Bomer playing Niel Caffrey on White Collar. He doesn't get a lot of speaking lines, but the few he had he seemed charming at first, but something was off in an unnerving way. It was well acted.This movie also does not shy away from violent or language and I haven't seen this many breasts in a movie in a while, though that might be because I haven't seen an R rated movie that interested me in a while. It is not a kid friendly movie at all... though I would soon recommend taking your kids to this than Angry Birds.Bottom line, if you liked the trailer you'll enjoy this movie and there is a lot more that I haven't mentioned. Shane Black has made a movie he should be very proud of and frankly I hope to see a sequel some day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Nice Guys" is more than just a "nice" way to spend a couple hours.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm really excited about this one! Sometimes I'm concerned that the movies I reference in my reviews may be too old or too obscure to really help the reader understand the point I'm making, but never before have I come across a group of movies that represent the movie I'm reviewing so remarkably well, or that are so surprisingly well connected to each other! Let's look back at the fall of 1997. Just three weeks apart, two great movies came out which would both go on to receive multiple Oscar nominations and were both set in Los Angeles in the mid-to-late 20th century. "Boogie Nights" dramatized the porn industry in the San Fernando Valley from 1977 to 1984, as shown in the rise and fall (pun intended) of young porn actor Eddie Adams, a.k.a. "Dirk Diggler" (played by a rising star named Mark Wahlberg). This movie is notable for its excellent screenplay, terrific acting from a fantastic cast (which included Julianne Moore, Burt Reynolds, Heather Graham, John C. Reilly, William H. Macy and then relative unknowns like Luis Guzmn, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Don Cheadle) ? and for the film's realistic portrayal of late 70s' and early 80s' L.A. "L.A. Confidential" had come out three weeks earlier and painted an equally vivid and nuanced picture of the City of Angels in 1953, complete with government corruption which involved a character played by Kim Basinger. Fast forward to 2014. The Oscar-nominated "Inherent Vice" tells the story of a private eye (Joaquin Phoenix) who is investigating a case involving multiple missing persons in 1970 L.A. That movie was written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, who had also written and directed "Boogie Nights". The darkly comedic 2016 film "The Nice Guys" (R, 1:56) has a private eye looking for multiple missing persons, while uncovering connections to the porn industry AND government corruption in 1970s Los Angeles AND a character played by Kim Basinger is an important part of the plot. Boom! So, are those some really cool connections, or is it just me? Oh. Just me. Alrighty then. I'll just review the movie? The title characters in "The Nice Guys" are? kind of nice, relatively speaking? when you understand that they do some not-so-nice jobs. Jackson Healy (Oscar winner Russell Crowe) is muscle for hire. He beats people up (or worse) for money, but he's relatively polite when he does it and he feels kind of bad about it. (Well, he feels that he's cut out for more than, say, roughing up a guy whose messing around with a client's teenage daughter, and he wishes that he were doing something different.) Holland March (past Oscar nominee Ryan Gosling) is a private eye who seems to make most of his money half-heartedly investigating far-fetched missing persons claims by little old ladies. He's very polite in dealing with his clients and he's sorta smart, but he's not as tough or skilled as he acts, and he has a real problem with pain and with the sight of blood ? especially his own. Regardless, Holland makes a good living and takes good care (financially, if not emotionally) of his teenage daughter, Holly (Angourie Rice). Holly is smarter, tougher... and nicer than Holland, whom she reluctantly "parents" better than he parents her.Holland is simultaneously investigating an alleged sighting of a porn star named Misty Mountains (Murielle Telio) ? two days after she was supposedly killed in a car accident ? while also looking for an even younger woman named Amelia (Margaret Qualley), who is a protest organizer, who may have appeared in "an experimental film" with Misty Mountains, and who definitely does NOT want to be found. Jackson, on the other hand, has been hired by Amelia to get this PI named Holland March off her trail. This situation leads to an inauspicious first meeting between Jackson and Holland, followed by an auspicious second meeting when they decide to join forces and use their respective talents to find out what's actually going on. You see, Holland has recently received an unwelcomed visit from a couple of thugs (Beau Knapp and Keith David) who demand to know where Amelia is, and then people who are connected to Amelia and/or Missy start dropping dead at an unnatural rate. Our titular "nice guys" eventually meet a Justice Department employee (Kim Basinger, an Oscar winner for "L.A. Confidential") who hires the pair to find Amelia, just as they discover that a Mafioso (Matt Bomer) from New York is in L.A. looking for them ? and he ain't interested in talking. With Holly forcing her way into the equation to help her dad and his new partner, it's a race against time to find Amelia and figure out who's killing her acquaintances (and why) before those really not-so-nice guys catch up with the two relatively nice guys."The Nice Guys" is a quirky, darkly comedic and intriguing whodunit. The script, by Shane Black (who also wrote "Iron Man 3", "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang", "The Long Kiss Goodnight", "The Last Boy Scout" and the original "Lethal Weapon") and newcomer Anthony Bagarozzi, is intricate, but not hard to follow, and contains smart and very funny dialog and situations (including great tie-ins to TV's "The Waltons" and President Richard Nixon), plus a mystery that's engaging but suffers from an awkward final resolution which feels forced. Besides co-writing, Black (who also directed "Iron Man 3") directs this film with a good feel for pace, tension and comic timing, while his very talented cast (especially Gosling, Crowe and Rice) really brings it all together. While similar in content to those other three films mentioned earlier, this one is closest in tone and style to "Inherent Vice", but is more accessible and less flawed. "The Nice Guys" is more than just a "nice" way to spend a couple hours ? it's a pretty damn entertaining one. "A-"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shane Black is back baybee!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can we just stop for a moment and thank the all-that-is-cool demigod Shane Black? Seriously, he wrote the scripts of some of the classic action movies like Last Action Hero, The Last Boy Scout, and the iconic Lethal Weapon trilogy, which encapsulates a whole generation of masculine action movies. Utilizing this experience he built throughout those movies, he went to direct his action parody debut, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, a film claimed by many to be his masterpiece. Though many might be write him off as yet another cynical action director based around scummy a-holes doing scummy a-hole stuff, I believe that these films hold some deeper context; outside of delivering action comedy chops, what really makes Black stand out is the way he observes and deconstructs his main leads and the environment around him. The way Tony Stark deals with his insignificance and anxiety in the Avengers universe in Iron Man 3, Lockhart and his position as a thief in KKBB, the whole works. His endeavor this time, in his latest The Nice Guys, he examines two pass, hot-tempered detectives unable to cope with the new generation, all while delivering the most brutally hilarious and endearing buddy cop movie any buddy cop movie can ever transcend to. To what amounts to a mixture of Lethal Weapon and Inherent Vice, it centers around a single father and licensed PI Holland March (Ryan Gosling), who is hired to investigate the apparent suicide of famous porn star Misty Mountains. Among this search, he comes to terms with an unlicensed and unmerciful detective Jackson Healey (Russell Crowe) and his brass knuckles, both hired by the young hippie. However, it all gets worse when Misty, who reveals to be an anti-pollution activist named Amelia, vanishes and it becomes apparent that March wasn't the only party interested. As both men are forced to team up, they'll have to take on a world filled with eccentric mobsters, exotic 70s-style strippers, and a possible government conspiracy.One of the things that fascinates me about this move is that amidst all the shootings and trashy humor, there is quite a fascinating subtext about a new coming generation overlying the old. These two cops, along with most of the other characters, represents the retrograde, no-nonsense police enforcers now out of their depth with the new generation. At the heart of this subtext and what ultimately brings some unexpected heart to the film is Angourie Rice as the young daughter of March Holly. Having to deal with the hardships and goon mix-ups the same level as her father, she still endures to be tough and capable in her own right and restrain herself and others from going over their limits. Of all the themes I came to expect from this movie, the implication of a younger generation could stand more superior to the wide array of brutes, dirty strippers, trigger-happy criminals, or even police officials honestly passed my radar.But enough of that pretentious baloney! What you'll likely get from this movie is a plethora of slapstick humor, gun-toting action, and hilarious banter from the two main leads who might as well be called Abbot and Costello with a lot more balls! Crowe, as expected, is a blast to watch, portraying a husky, no-BS private eye who kicks all sorts of ass but also manages to bring some humanity near the end. But the big surprise is Ryan Gosling, bringing an unexpected Buster Keaton-type humor character. Of all of what I usually expect from a Ryan Gosling role (from romantic main lead to un ironic main leads) his turn as sort of a fun and ironic role is instantly his most memorable. However, for all that goodwill, I still struggle to call this film on par with KKBB. The reason lies strictly in design; KKBB is essentially a parody of these types of buddy cop movies that constantly breaks the fourth wall and pulls the rug from your feet with every twist out of the conventional story beats. This movie, though, sticks to be fairly predictable. It still works as is, and thankfully the movie stays far away from several clichs, but for the most part, anyone paying attention might catch up with about 40 minutes ahead at most. It is definitely not a deal breaker, but a compromise definitely from true greatness. Minor issues aside, it's pretty awesome! The jokes are funny, the dirty stuff are really dirty, the character moments are engaging, the old-fashioned and exotic 70s setting feels lived in and compelling, and Shane Black remains the best at directing intense action. Definitely a would-be classic!Rating: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More action and drama than comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shane Black's new film THE NICE GUYS is being billed as an "ACTION/COMEDY" and I think this is a mistake. When I think "ACTION/COMEDY" I think more of things like the Will Ferrell/Mark Wahlberg film THE OTHER GUYS or the upcoming Dwayne Johnson/Kevin Hart flick CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE. Basically, a comedy with action in it. THE NICE GUYS is a atmospheric period piece that blends drama, action and comedy. It is much more nuanced than the average "action/comedy" and, for the most part, succeeds in this nuance.Set in 1977, THE NICE GUYS pairs Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe as they investigate a disappearance in Los Angeles. The more they dig into the case, the more the bodies pile up and the deeper the conspiracy goes.The key to a film like this is the chemistry between the two leads and I am happy to report that Gosling and Crowe have pretty good chemistry with each other. While I thought Gosling was trying a bit too hard in the comedy areas (he managed the balance of comedy and drama better in THE BIG SHORT), the surprise to me was how easy the comedy parts seemed to come to Crowe while the dramatic parts showed off that he still has strong acting "chops".Ultimately, where this film falls short for me is in the direction by Shane Black (the underrated Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and the overrated Iron Man 3). He has the "70's vibe down, no doubt about it. Where this film falters is it's continual shift of tone. Is it a comedy? Is it a serious action film? Is it a farce? Is it a drama? All of these elements are thrown onto the screen so it takes about 2/3 of the film to settle into what type of film it is - which I would call a dramatic action film with comedic overtones. And, by the way, there are 2 comedic moments in this movie that created huge, sincere belly laughs from me - I would argue that both of those moments are worth the price of admission alone.Go for those moments, but stay for the friendship of Gosling and Crowe. You'll be entertained.7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)</fullReview>

Nonsensical and burdened with the 1978 setting that was supposed to be ironically amusing, but was ultimately useless. Russell Crowe and Kim Basinger are cast to draw in the audience of LA Confidential, but the lack of character development and weak dialogue dissolve any credibility. Young Angourie Rice as the daughter is a stand out and has a promising future. The film was directed and written by Shane Black who also wrote Lethal Weapon.

		<fullReview>We had high expectations for this movie, based on the cast and on the trailers viewed. In fact, the movie was quite good until the ending, which was unnecessarily amateurish and inappropriate. The character played by Russell Crowe would not have reverted to drinking after witnessing--and scorning-- the pitiful alcohol-induced incompetence of the character played by Ryan Gosling, nor would he have partnered with him going forward. Also, the idea of having a pre-teen saying "I need a drink!" as the movie drives to its close is a bit of enabling that society (and the story) really doesn't need. The last five minutes of this movie scream for a re-write! Apart from this, the movie was very promising, with generally very good performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was excited about this movie. A movie that was not all CGI. I like Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling so I knew they would be good together in a movie. I read the above reviews that gave it glowing reports. Well I must have seen a different movie. The chemistry was great between the two actors and their comedic style was good. I picked up on several problems in the movie. First of all the story and plot were really confusing and really had no connection until somewhat at the end. Just a lot of running around and getting into situations that had nothing to do with the story just so we could have a joke and slapstick comedy. When you thought you might get a payoff in a scene, they chopped it up with so many cuts, the scene fell flat. I did laugh a few times when the scenes worked and we're not cut so fast for so-called action. Ryan Gosling, at times, was just silly and overdoing the gags, like he was trying too hard to be funny. Poor Russell Crowe just kind of went along on the stupid gags. The actress, who played the daughter, was the best part of the movie. Overall, I thought it could have been better without so many cuts to scenes. They could have had longer takes. Oh, it was way too long. Could have been a more concise film. It really dragged about halfway through. I was so disappointed in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very NICE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ryan Gosling in a physical action-comedy? Whoever thought of the idea should be crowned genius of the year. With dynamite timing and uproarious gestures, Gosling mines his diverse abilities and becomes a blast in The Nice Guys, directed by Lethal Weapon and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang scribe Shane Black. Cowritten by Black and Anthony Bagarozzi, this nonstop-hilarious buddy-cop film is both a committed rekindling of the old formula Black aced throughout his career and a playful wink to the genre, bouncily walking on the fine line with occasional backflips.Not that Gosling's character, Holland March, a clumsy, drunken private eye living in 1977 Los Angeles, is exactly a cop, per se. (He's often hired by confused old ladies looking for their dead family members.) And neither is his eventual partner, the ultra-serious tough guy Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe, beefed up and effective), who rakes in hard cash by beating up his clients' enemies.Between a gorgeously grandiose finale, memorable parts for Yaya DaCosta and Kim Basinger and a juicy soundtrack that includes Earth, Wind &amp; Fire and Kool &amp; the Gang, The Nice Guys is the perfect, incredibly crafted yet laid-back procedural we've been starved for. Even when it sometimes seems that the endless jokes are being thrown against a wall to see what sticks, The Nice Guys, on the whole, summons that victorious, innocent feeling of seeing likable heroes win while having fun along the way. It's nice, guys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comedy where only a few people in the theatre ever chuckle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the moment I'm writing this, "The Nice Guys" currently has an IMDb rating of 8.1. Seriously??? You MUST be kidding! I have to believe this score will drop precipitously as more people see this cornball bit of slapstick. My wife and I stared at the screen in utter disbelief that we were suckered into such a waste of our time. Judging by the sporadic number of chuckles in the theatre, the audience apparently agreed with us. Gosling had a few clever lines... emphasis on "few". Crowe looked like he spent the last year bellied up to a smorgasbord. The addition of a perky Nancy Drew character was waaayyyyyyy out of place.I looked on with jealously as a handful of people walked out before an hour had transpired. Who at IMDb do I complain to get my money back?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underwhelming and mostly forgettable tribute to classic TV/film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I worked on this while it filmed in Atlanta. I couldn't wait to see it. I'm a lover of classic noir and pulpy/sleazy PI films like The Long Goodbye, Hardcore, Klute, Chinatown, Harper, Hopscotch, Night Moves, etc. I much expected this movie to be like 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang meets Hardcore meets Boogie Nights', but alas, I was sorely mistaken.The plot of this movie isn't very stimulating, which is a bummer because most noir films are intentionally complex and confusing. This one is paper-thin, and it mostly just limps along from one anachronistic set piece to another, with (painfully) forced humor and nonsensical violence as filler along the way. It's all pretty artless and tedious...which leads me to my biggest problem with the movie:It doesn't even remotely look or feel like a 70's movie. In fact it's almost completely devoid of period style. I could have easily shrugged off the stupidity of the plot and the bad characterizations if the movie just 'looked the part', but it's so far off, it's confounding why Shane Black has it take place in 1977 at all. PT Anderson proved so well that it could be done with Boogie Nights and Inherent Vice. I wish he had directed this one too.I was really hoping for a Marvel killer with this one. Bummer.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tedious until it was just plain bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking forward to this movie, but it was terrible. Most of it was tedious, until the grand finally, which was just plain bad. None of the characters were likable. The plot was convoluted. It couldn't decide on a tone, neither action nor comedy nor drama.Set in the late 70's in Los Angeles, it is kind of a cross between Shaft and Miami Vice. The one bright spot was the 13 yo daughter Holly, played by Angourie Rice. They should've made the movie about her.This was supposed to be a big comeback for Shane Black, writer of Lethal Weapon and Iron Man 3, but this is not. As of its opening weekend, this movie is very highly rated by critics and fans alike, but I disagree, I did not like it at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so IMDb wants me to write 10 lines describing this terrible movie. I'll try my best.Are you a ten to fifteen year old boy? If so, you may enjoy this. Did you enjoy 48 hrs with Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte? Then rent it and watch it instead. Have you not seen 48 hrs? Same advise.If you've seen the trailer for 'Nice Guys' then save your money, you've already seen the best parts of this movie. Actually, the trailer is far superior to the actual movie. Ryan Gosling...Why did you agree to star in this? Have you already retired or did you do something wrong and offend some Hollywood big wig who wanted you to make amends by staring in the worst movie of the year?Russell Crowe....Wow. When I think back to all those terrific movies you made....Kudos to the young girl who played Ryan Gosling's daughter in this. She actually did a pretty good job.Bottom line: This movie was made for adolescents. Yet it's R-rated for good reason --- the subject matter is for adults only. But, considering the idiotic story line, campy acting, and corny gags, I can't see how anyone outside of an adolescent boy could enjoy this movie. Go figure.</fullReview>

Very simple , this movie can be seen by almost everyone , doesn't matter the age or the gender. It is so well written and played , you don't get bored at any part of the film , It has comedy elements packed with action moments put together so well that there is no chance you will not like this movie. Normally i don't like Ryan Gosling that much ,put this role made him shine from my point of view and I'm happy for it. Sadly i haven't heared about this movie that much so I'm guessing it is not that popular now ,anyway , i recommend this one for everyone .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hits and misses throughout, but a fantastic lead pairing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in the late 70s and based around a string of suspicious deaths within the porno industry, this Shane Black joint lovingly harks back to the good ol' days of ultra-violent buddy-cop flicks like Lethal Weapon and 48 Hrs. With this breed of movie almost extinct, it's gratifying to see Black breathe life back into it with his trademark dark wit, genre-subverting style and willingness to unleash a spot of sudden violence for nervous laughs. Crucially, he's aided and abetted by charming lead performances from Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling, the former a gravel-voiced, hard-nosed enforcer with a noir-ish edge, and the latter a likable loser with dubious parenting skills but a sympathetic past. Crowe and Gosling are the epitome of chalk and cheese, and are all the more delightful to watch because of it; some of the film's finest scenes are nothing more than them chewing the fat about life, albeit their warped life. Unfortunately it's not all rosy for Black's trip down memory lane though. The central mystery is convoluted, boring and ultimately a damp squib, whilst the numerous tangential subplots, infused with pitch-black comedy, often go nowhere, despite lengthy build-ups. On first viewing it's difficult to grasp exactly how entertaining The Nice Guys really is, such are the typical ups and downs of Black's distinctive writing/directing style. Cult classic status potentially awaits, but so does cinematic obscurity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent buddies movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Nice Guys represents the buddy movie genre at its best. Shane Black is an excellent director and a brilliant writer. He knows how to create hilarious characters and how to put them in absurd scenes ? absurd in a comic way. It is a ton of fun. Watching The Nice Guys made me want to go back and take a look at his earlier films. The characters were well written, even better cast, and fit well with the theme of the film. There was rare a dull moment, it seemed I was either enjoying the dark comedic tone, or getting engaged in the plot. The Nice Guys is pretty much a buddy cop comedy. Set in 1977 Los Angeles, bumbling private eye Holland March (Ryan Gosling) and muscle-for-hire Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) become unlikely partners when they find themselves both looking for a missing woman named Amelia (Margaret Qualley). The two men then find out that Amelia was working with Misty Mountains and an amateur filmmaker named Dean. Dean, however, mysteriously died in a fire that burned the film. The two end up at a party to search for the film's financier, Sid Shuttuck, a notorious pornography producer. The two detectives come to party for searching Amelia. However, they met Blue Face and Older Guy whom are two assassins hiring by Amelia's mother, try to kill Amelia because Amelia have evident which reveal her mother's bad stuffs such as drug dealer, porn movie, sell illegal weapon. Jackson Healy fights with Older Guy, while Blue Face tries to kill Amelia from inside his car, only to be stopped by Holly (Holland March's daughter), who warns Amelia and then escapes with her. While chasing them down, Blue Face is seriously injured in a hit-and-run. Later, Blue Face was strangled by Jackson Healy and dead. After a brief investigation, the two are greeted by Amelia's mother, Judith Kutner (Kim Basinger), a high-ranking official in the United States Department of Justice, who claims her daughter is delusional and paranoid and she hire two detective to protect her daughter. Jackson Healy reveals the note paper with Holland March 's address given to him by Amelia is identical to a paper he found at the party, which gives leads to an airport hotel where Amelia was going to distribute the film. Two detectives found Amelia land on their car from the building where she is accidentally knocked out. They take her back to March's house and two detective was told by Amelia about her mother bad stuffs in government and bad Detroit group. Amelia created How Do You Like My Car, Big Boy? To reveal those bad stuffs in government. Amelia mother has her assistant, Tally (Yaya DaCosta), arrange for Holland and Healy to deliver a case that supposedly contains one hundred thousand dollars. However, a half-asleep March accidentally crashes their car and the case is opened to reveal shredded magazines, causing them to realize that they have been double-crossed. At home, Holly is confronted and attacked by John Boy, who had been sent by Tally under the guise of being a family doctor. Holland March and Jackson Healy arrive back at the house and engage in a shootout with John Boy. John Boy escapes, while an impatient Amelia leaves, only to run into and be killed by John Boy. March and Healy try to bring the matter to court, but are rejected, as they have no evidence, leading them again to search for the film. They found out that the projectionist, Chet (Jack Kilmer), another protester they had questioned about Dean, is the projectionist for the film and had worked with Amelia to make How Do You Like My Car, Big Boy? Public by splicing it into the presentation film for the Los Angeles Auto Show, which is being held at a hotel. At the auto show, the two find that John Boy and Older Guy also was in this hotel to searching the film. Two detectives fight with two bad guys. At the end, two detectives have the film and two bad guys (John Boy and Older Guy) was dead. The detectives take How Do You Like My Car, Big Boy? To the police and though Judith is arrested, the Detroit car companies are immune to any charges, due to insufficient evidence. When she talks with March and Healy before her trial, Judith claims she did not want her daughter killed and justifies her involvement by insisting that "what is good for Detroit is good for America." Afterward Healy and March decide to continue working together as private eyes, naming their agency "The Nice Guys."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever started a dish, found that you don't like it, and eat it all? It seems that, with movies, we are to watch the whole thing until the end, no matter how bad it is. Thankfully, more and more people began leaving the theaters when bored, and this is exactly what I did with this movie.I watched some 30 minutes before deciding that enough was enough and left. It is not that the movie was awful, or the acting terrible, but for the life of me I could not get hooked on the story no matter how hard I tried.The movie began in a very promising way, with very funny parts...and then, nothing. In retrospect I feel that the movie was more like a collection of funny gigs without a plot. Once the plot came, the movie went out of the window.Ryan Gosling is very good. Funny and fresh. Not the same can be said about Russell Crowe who seems tired which would be fine if it wasn't for the fact that he is supposed to be an action type of guy. The rest gets lost to me.By the time Kim Bassinger showed up I was ready to leave and left. I have no idea how the movie ended, so my 3 points are based on the initial performance of Russell and Gossling.Another movie I really wanted to like and didn't make it. Pity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Nice But Funny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Nice Guys (2016): Dir: Shane Black / Cast: Russell Crowe, Ryan Gosling, Angourie Rice, Matt Bomer, Margaret Qualley: Director Shane Black revisits the same formula that worked in his Kiss, Kiss Bang, Bang. Russell Crowe plays enforcer Jackson Healy and Ryan Gosling plays private investigator Holland March and they are reluctantly involved in a plot regarding a missing persons, a porn star car crash, and thugs with blue face paint. Despite all the twists and turns to an otherwise ambitious plot, the climax is somewhat predictable in terms of who the villain really is. What works is the back and forth banter between the leads. As with Robert Downey Jr and Val Kilmer in the previously mentioned film, Crowe is the tough enforcer who must rely on someone whom he previously broke the arm of at the urge of someone else. Gosling provides many laughs as the whimpering investigator. Angourie Rice makes the best impression as March's daughter Holly. She is bright beyond her years and makes like Nancy Drew concealing herself into her father's investigation. Margaret Qualley is also compelling as the female on the run with a gun and ducking both sides. On the negative note the villains are cardboard and about as enticing as bathroom tile. Even Kim Basinger is wasted in a predictable role. This is pointless and pathetically violent but it is not without its finer points, which is the humour that is on tact. The result is an entertaining action comedy that is visually well made with clever action scenes but a worldview that is not that nice. Score: 6 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PROS: 1. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling work really well together, they have good chemistry. 2. The set pieces are amazing, the movie pulled off the 70's vibe.3. The movie made me laugh, it has physical humor mixed with intelligent humor, and at times it blended really well together.4. The cinematography, the directing, and the music blended well.5. The movie forces the viewer to examine the story, there's so much going on, and you can miss an important detail if you're not paying attention.CONS: 1. The plot is extremely, excessively, and overly complicated, I believe the movie could've went for a more subtle approach, maybe it did, but I feel like the plot could've been toned-down a notch. 2. Crowe and Gosling engage in some small conversations that ultimately lead nowhere; for example, Gosling tells Crowe that he has no sense of smell, the screenwriter could've created something cool with that within the context of the movie, but it really doesn't cater to the story in any kind of way, and I was disappointed by that (truly missed opportunity).NITPICKING: In the opening scene, I know that the boy's parents were sleeping, but you know damn well that a car traveling that fast and going threw somebodies house like that would wake up the whole damn neighborhood.OVERALL, The Nice Guys is a fun movie to watch. In my opinion, it's not good, it's not great, it's just okay.FINAL GRADE: B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best way to describe this Shane Black film is to call it "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang Lite." It's dark and interesting in a completely quirky way but I found it to be less charming than KKBB. The dark humor is about the same and it often works quite well. Russell Crowe is exceptional and Gosling works well enough. They do have the chemistry required to pull off Shane Black material. The pleasant surprise was the daughter character. She added much needed heart and motivation for both leads to become somewhat better men. Overall enjoyable and I'm rounding my rating up based on expectations. I expected a truly great film and left the theatre somewhat unimpressed but that's my flaw so setting my sights so high and not a fault of the film itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quothed WC Field: 'I like children. If they properly cooked.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please no 'Nice Guys two'. One is enough. Spare us films with children or dogs. They usually steal the scene, if not the show. Much has been said of Shane Black's farce 'The Nice Guys', staring Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling. A new Abbott and Costello, or so the publicity tells us. Don't believe it. True, there is good chemistry between Crowe and Gosling, but it is Angourie Rice who runs away with the film, as Gosling 11 or 12 year old daughter going on 35. We're in 1970s Los Angeles. The film has a false film noir atmosphere with high living, sex and a blow for saving our environment. Murder, violent murder is in the air, as Gosling, who never goes without a cigarette and his Zippo lighter, and Crowe who is tipping the scales on weight run down clues and the mysterious porno star Misty Mountain, who uses sex to expose a nasty multinational ruining the air...in a save the birds moment. It's a dumb and dumber 'comedy', that has few laughs. The children on the edge of puberty are bright and have potty mouths, that seen out of place in the 1970s but not today. Kim Bassinger, looking beautiful, turns in a fine cameo as a bent high government bureaucrat who is out to stop her daughter's exposure even if it kills her offspring. Matt Domer, formerly of 'Suits', plays the bad guy who leaves a trail of bodies. The consummate Crowe can and does raise a skeptical eyebrow that says it all. Gosling is good as a bumbling private dick who isn't as dopey as he seems. The pair deserve a better film. Rice gets the golden ring of a smart little cookie with a soft heart. No sequels please.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shane Black's nostalgic and great writing make The Nice Guys of the best of 2016</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Nice Guys takes place ten years before I was born. Though I was technically alive in the 1980's, I've always seen myself as something of a nineties child. I think it's because of the media I was watching. I was heavily into the Nickelodeon channel and the 1990's fast evolution into the computer age. The reason I bring this up is that one's preference of culture can definitely define the era they were raised in. My older brother may have been born in 1985, but he has a love affair of the 1970's. He likes a lot of the television shows from that time like Dukes of Hazzard and Starsky &amp; Hutch. While I'm not that much of a nostalgic individual, I can see some of the appeal of the seventies. There is something of a bright but gritty combination that's unique. A lot of that had to do with the darker content that was coming out now that the previous restrictions that were present from old studio system were lifted. The Nice Guys returns to this era, giving us a buddy-buddy mystery that's in vein of something that's closer to the seventies cop shows like The Rockford Files?only with an emphasis on comedy.In the late seventies, adult film star Misty Mountains is killed in a car crash. The aunt of this star hires private investigator Holland March (played by Ryan Gosling) to find a missing girl named Amelia Kuther (played by Margaret Qualley). Amelia, however, does not want to be found and hires an enforcer Jackson Healy (played by Russell Crowe) to try and intimidate Holland to stop trying to find her. Jackson is something of a wannabe detective who may be better at it then Holland, who is an alcoholic klutz. When Jackson encounters and escapes two thugs looking for Amelia, he decides to team up with Holland to find Amelia before the bad guys can.The two end up being assisted by Holland's teenage daughter Holly (played by Angourie Rice) who seems to be the only one to truly read things between the lines. Holland and Jackson end up going from a porn producer's party in Bel Air to an air pollution protest. It's there they discover that Amelia was making an experimental movie to work with the air pollution protesters, leading into suspicions into the adult film industry, Detroit auto industry, and the Los Angeles city government.While it sounds like a lot to take in, The Nice Guys not only has an interesting mystery, it is also a great buddy-buddy comedy. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling make a surprising good team, given how well they establish Crowe as the rough guy and Gosling as the idiot (a role I never expected him to play). Now if you want to know who had the best performance, that honor goes to young Angourie who played Holly. She may have been smart and curious about the mystery that her father was a part of, but she still acted like a child. Why is it that few movies that involve kids really let them act like kids?Shane Black wrote and directed this very enjoyable film. You can see a lot of Lethal Weapon's same buddy cop mentality, though I'd argue there's something of a "meaner" feeling. A lot of that might have to do with the fact that our heroes are not cops, but private investigators. It also has to do with it's 1970's setting which is so rich in it's own world, that I'd be surprised if the film isn't awarded for it's production design. I'll give this nine cookie jars out of ten. The Nice Guys is already guaranteed a spot as one of my favorites of the year. Shane Black is clearly one of the best writer's in Hollywood and I'm glad to see studio's like Warner Brothers taking a chance on him to let him make whatever he wants. I can't summarize enough with how much fun this original story is. Please see The Nice Guys to support more new content from Hollywood!</fullReview>

Filmmaker Shane Black who collaborated on the rat-a-tat-tat screenplay with Anthony Bagarozzi delivers the goods and the pitch perfect chemistry of his leads are dead-on particularly Gosling in his porn 'stache and in touch with his inner Lou Costello (shrieks and one riotous slapstick sequence involving a fall and a corpse is epic). Nice to see Crowe dialing it back and enjoying himself as well as the tougher of the duo and making a hideous blue leather jacket look good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Had An Awesome Time Watching The Nice Guys. Go See This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the summer blockbuster season. I enjoy smaller films but it's usually the late spring to early fall where I end up going to the theatre 3-4 times a month. People like to criticize those movies as immature and juvenile. But I like watching franchises and sequels and I won't apologize for it. So while I like the big films, it's movies like The Nice Guys that remind me how important original properties can be.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* The Nice Guys is set in Los Angeles in 1977. We watch a scene where a young boy sneaks into his parents' bedroom to sneak a peek at his dad's porno stash. After he gets away, we see a car drive off the large hill behind the house and crash right into the house below. The boy is unharmed and goes out to investigate the wreck. Coincidentally, the passenger in the car is the same porn star (Misty Mountains) that the boy was looking at in the magazine. She lies there half naked and unfortunately dies. The boy covers her up and we hear sirens in the distance.We then meet The Nice Guys. First is Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) who is a thug for hire but not in a mafia capacity. You need to send a violent message to someone, slip him some money and he'll greet the guy with his fists and a pair of brass knuckles. Jackson doesn't seem evil however, more world-weary and cynical. He's still getting over his divorce and wants some purpose to his life. He meets his next client Amelia (Margaret Qualley) who gives him the name Holland March and his address. She claims that he's been following/stalking her. Jackson agrees to take the job and they part company.Our other "hero" is Holland March (Ryan Gosling). We see him wake up in a bathtub full of water, fully clothed in a suit. There is an answering machine right beside the tub with a message from his daughter Holly (Angourie Rice) that he's supposed to be working and that since it's her birthday. March tells us about how slimy his job as a P.I. is, how he's a drunk and that he's dealing with the death of his wife. March does not appear to be sympathetic, we see him take a job at a nursing home from a concerned old lady looking for her missing husband when he's being kept in an urn on her mantle. We also see he's a bit of a klutz, he's been hired to look for Amelia and he tries to break into a bar after hours. He accidentally cuts his wrist however and ends up in the hospital instead.These two professionals collide at March's house when Healy shows up to deliver Amelia's message. Jackson beats Holland up and seems content to leave but March keeps trying to reach for his gun. This leads Jackson to break his arm just to make sure it sinks in. Jackson thinks his work is done but when he returns to his apartment, two goons (Keith David and Beau Knapp) beat him up, demanding to know where Amelia is.The first thing I want to say about this movie is that it looks cool. It's a period piece set in the 1970s and it seemed to be very period accurate. I liked the wardrobe, the vehicles and the set design, everything looked great. Add in some great 1970s music for the soundtrack (including Earth Wind and Fire) and you get to travel back in time to the 1970s. I thought the movie nailed that aspect and showed the attention to detail with embracing the funky atmosphere of that time period. I know The Nice Guys wasn't made for pennies but it was nice to see such a great looking film that didn't need 200 million to do it.So if you talk to film buff, you'll likely learn that the director of this movie is Shane Black who was a pioneer in the action/buddy comedy genre. It's not surprising that he was involved in the writing and he directed the movie because the dialogue and action are both top notch. There are so many funny jokes in here I wasn't just laughing once or twice for every 20 min but consistently throughout. The action was also pretty gritty and brutal. You wince with every blow and they even found a way to intertwine the comedy into it making for some funny gags. You get the feeling that there was a really good team behind this and looking at the credits, there sure was.At the same time, they didn't just rely on the material because they have 2 leads who pull their characters off effortlessly. Russell Crowe is the less animated of the two, he's more the straight man. But he gets more than his share of moments, he fits into the tone of this movie really well and he brings a great balance of his action man persona with some decent comic timing. Ryan Gosling really shows how versatile he can be in this movie. He does a lot of physical comedy here and he pulls it off completely. He's hilarious and his chemistry with Crowe is excellent. I also wanted to single out Angourie, she has a great character to play but she holds her own against two A list stars. The rest of the cast is excellent too. Matt Bomer, Keith David, Yaya DaCosta are all good.I really thought this movie was a treat to see. I had a smile on my face from beginning to end. The Nice Guys is really funny throughout, the action packs a punch, the cast give some great performances and the story was both interesting and involving. I really hope people get out to see this, we could use more movies like it. Especially if they're made with this level of expertise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I absolutely LOVE this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm gonna start off by saying 2 things: 1. I'm going to keep this review short and sweet because I don't wanna take the chance of spoiling such a great movie.2. I haven't laughed this hard since February of this year when I saw Deadpool.I was expecting The Nice Guys to be an action movie with some comedy mixed in, but in reality it was a comedy with some action mixed in.The movie is about 2 private eyes who end up working together to solve a case that they (unknowingly) are both working on. It takes place in the 70's in a time where private eyes can do pretty much whatever they want, and crime is running rampant. Their chemistry is great; they harass each other all the time, tell each other what they're doing wrong, and actually end up learning a thing or two from each other. (Their relationship is kinda like Murtaugh and Riggs' from Lethal Weapon) All in all, this movie is perfect in every way. It's violent, hilarious, old-school and JUST PLAIN FUN. If you loved Lethal Weapon (and you should), you will love The Nice Guys. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Funny Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this film an 8 because in truth, its an 8 for today's movies. One of my measurements for films is whether i yawn, check my watch (phone), or wander, i did none of these. Another meric was for a comedy it has to make me laugh, and it did. The pacing and laughs were nit always to my taste There were a few areas of the film that were getting boring, but they picked up. I think of this film as kind of a hybrid Ford Faurlane meets Coen Brothers, with a slight twist of the Tim Conway and Don Notts Private Eye films. The settings and music were one off in a few areas, but mostly they were close to the time. I think a lot if people were expecting An Inherent Vice type period piece were a little disappointed in this aspect of the film. If you go into this film with low exoectations i think you'll thoroughly enjoy this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Nice Guys" had one of those trailers for the ages that you just know would yield a disappointing movie. No let-down here; I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a terrific mix of comedy, action, porn and Detroit gangsters. With less profanity and violence, this is something that'd work great on TV. But that'd be neutering it.It's a very Shane Black movie, built on his own refined formula - there are echoes of "Lethal Weapon", "The Last Boy Scout" and "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" here - but that's also why it's so entertaining. It's his signature brand of dialog and brutality that make for a good time. But it's also the chemistry between Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling. Both are good casting choices, but this is Gosling's show; he plays the hell out of a hapless loser, and more than a few laughs come from his spastic humor.The tone is spot-on, the plot has just the right twists, and this works beautifully as light and breezy Summer fare.And I need that soundtrack.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great, nostalgic throwback; to the buddy flicks of yesteryear (which Black was a master of)!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'THE NICE GUYS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Action-buddy flick from filmmaker Shane Black. Black previously wrote (or co-wrote) such popular (and classic) action-buddy movies as 'LETHAL WEAPON', 'LETHAL WEAPON 2', 'THE LAST BOY SCOUT', 'LAST ACTION HERO', 'THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT', 'KISS KISS BANG BANG' and 'IRON MAN 3' (he also directed the latter two). The film hearkens back to the glory days, of his greatest work ('LETHAL WEAPON' and 'KISS KISS BANG BANG'). The movie was directed and co-written by Black, with first time film writer Anthony Bagarozzi (it was also produced by Joel Silver). It stars Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling; as two mismatched private investigators, trying to solve the disappearance of a missing girl (in 1970's Los Angeles). The film also costars Angourie Rice, Margaret Qualley, Matt Bomer, Keith David, Beau Knapp and Kim Basinger. I loved it!Gosling plays Holland March; a private detective, in 1970's Los Angeles, and single father. He's good at his job, but he also takes advantage of people; and he's also a bumbling alcoholic (due to the fact that his wife recently passed away). His daughter, Holly (Rice), takes care of him, more than he looks out for her. Crowe plays an enforcer named Jack Healey. Healey is also very good at his job, but he's also only motivated monetarily. March and Healey's paths cross, when they're both involved in the same missing girl case. They reluctantly team up, in order to solve it.The movie is hilarious; due to some really cleverly written dialogue, and some insanely odd comic scenarios. It's also a great action flick; with some highly entertaining, and extremely well- executed, action scenes. The characters are really well written, and acted, and there's even some really touching drama (involving them). The movie exceeds on all fronts, and there's never a dull moment. Besides all that, it's just a great, nostalgic throwback; to the buddy flicks of yesteryear (which Black was a master of). The film is a must see!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuGIEoCGrtw</fullReview>

When I saw the trailer I instantly wanted to see this movie and when I left that theater after the movie, I was not disappointed at all. It held its own.Ryan Gosling and Russel Crowe did a fantastic job on this movie I loved how they stayed true to what the 70's Was actually like. It would have a funny part and then an action part right after it to keep you going and interested the whole entire time. It was packed with action and comedy.It had many humorous parts and kept you on the edge of your seat with the action. I recommend seeing this movie. Some of Goslings best work. Crowe was also very entertaining. Really hope that they decide to make a second one. One of my favorite comedies and one of the best comedies of the year for sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I give it a 4 for the production value. The movie was in color, the camera was held steady, the lighting was good, the sets were well-staged, and the sound was clear. I also give it a 4 for the poor quality of the script. Unfortunately the good production value and the good acting by the principals could not elevate the script beyond the level of a film school senior project. How that script got made into an actual movie by professionals is beyond me, unless it simply signals that professional filmmakers these days have little idea as to script quality. How can the script be described to someone who hasn't seen the movie? I can say that the laughable jokes were weak, few, and far between, the characters were written without any depth (requiring the audience to create them), the story line was much too complicated and hard to follow for a silly comedy, and I wanted to movie to end about half an hour before it did. I did admire Crowe's performance. He is one of those rare people who can become the character they are asked to play. However I think he needs to loose a bunch of that weight if he wants to be an old actor some day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry I viewed this movie but I didn't hate it. Must say it had more violence than laughs for me. That would appeal to some more than me, I guess. Like Quentin Tarantino with some goofiness. And a cute kid. Redeeming features include 70's era cars, eye candy models (not really any erotic appeal unless you mix sex with bullets and car crashes.) The preposterous plot at least moved it forward with some appropriate villains in big business and the government. Ryan Gosling again scores by playing his favorite character, a likable rogue. Russell Crowe proves that even with a few extra pounds, you don't want to mess with him. Kim Basinger makes some appearances which are persuasive of her appeal persisting. Mixing in the kid actors was a fun addition if you don't mind the loss of childhood innocence and general cynicism of our age.</fullReview>

I was a fan of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Shane Black in general so my anticipation levels were high, especially after the red band trailer. The film didn't disappoint!Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling are on TOP FORM in this and the pair are a surprisingly excellent double act, Crowe as the grizzled, tough PI and Gosling as the drunk, 'worst detective ever' and it's good to seem them enjoying some levity after their long run of dramatic roles. Shane Black really delivers and this is his best work to date. His direction is assured and he nailed balance between the neo noir, hard boiled story telling and his trademark snappy banter and dark humour. The story leaves the door open for a follow up and I for one would love to see more of these characters.</fullReview>

I should have realised that a film nowadays with Russell Crowe is risky (whatever happened to the excellent actor we saw in Gladiator? He's now a fat, lazy inarticulate slob!). This is the first time I've been to a cinema for a while and the constant eating and phone watching of the other patrons again reminded me why a large screen HD TV and Netflix subscription at home are now essential parts of modern life.With films like The Nice Guys I could then stop watching at no cost or hassle..

		<fullReview>This movie started out great and I was very convinced in the first 20 minutes that this movie would turn out good. However, I was wrong. The writers on this movie basically jam packed it with a ton full of jokes, some were good, but most of them were terrible. A lot of cringe-worthy one liners, rambling non-sense, a repetition of annoying inside jokes and 12 year old sex jokes. Ryan Gosling's character's daughter is basically a b-grade version of the movie; Kick-ass, character; hit girl - which didn't work out at all. It is also filled with a lot of predictable plot-holes which really drives the story round and round again. This is the type of movie to give you light entertainment with a few laughs here and there. But if you're looking for a more complex movie with a good story line, this is not the movie for you.- 2/10.</fullReview>

Gosling and Crowe, it goes without saying, have the best chemistry a film director could ever ask for. The screenplay is so well written. The mystery really takes you for a ride. The jokes all land solidly. By far it's biggest strength is the work put into it as a period piece. It looks amazing. Not even American Hustle replicated the 70's as seamlessly as this. Every last detail and fabric is perfect. I look forward to seeing it again, and again.. and maybe again after that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasant 70s-era crime caper: Angourie Rice steals the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Nice Guys" (2016 release; 116 min.) brings the story of a couple of private eyes looking for a missing girl. As the movie opens (to the tune of "Papa Was a Rolling Stone"), we are reminded that it is "Los Angeles, California, 1977". Before we know what hit us, a car comes flying around the corner, crashing into a house and killing its driver, whom we later learn is Misty Mountains, an adult film star. We the get introduced to Holland March, a private eye who is down on his luck, and separately also to Jackson Healy, the guy you call on "to bring a message". It's not long before Healy is hired to "bring a message" to March. At that point we're a good 10 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this is the latest movie from writer-director Shane Black, who previously brought us Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Iron Man 3, among many others. Here Black takes us back to the golden era of police and private eyes dramas and film noir, but with a never missing smile (or is that smirk) on his face. Second, don't worry about the insanely complicated story line, in which I got lost in no time. Instead, enjoy this movie for the many outstanding performances: Ryan Gosling (as March) brings comedy to the screen like I've never seen him do before (the 'bathroom' scene is destined to become a classic). Russell Crowe (as Healy) plays it rough and gruff, the perfect counterpart to Gosling's role (the ying and the yang), so in that respect, this is a great "buddy" movie. But with all due respect to Gosling and Crowe, the movie is stolen by newcomer Angourie Rice, who plays Merch's 13 yr. old daughter Holly. She seems like is was born to play in movies, that's how natural she comes across. Surely this is only the beginning of a long career for this young lady. Kudos also to the set designers, who did an outstanding job recreating what 1977 looked like (the "Jaws 2" poster, Tower Records, etc. ), And last but not least, there is an overabundance of outstanding music from that era featured throughout the movie, from the opening sounds of The Temptations' "Papa Was a Rolling Stone" to when Al Green's outstanding "Love and Happiness" plays over the movie's end credits.The movie opened nationwide this weekend. Having seen the trailer a number of times, I couldn't wait to see it. The Saturday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended nicely (but nowhere close to sold out). If you are in the mood for a 70s-era crime and buddy movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, you cannot go wrong with this. "The Nice Guys" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, I guess I've found my favorite movie of the year--so far, at least. The Nice Guys did so many things right and so little wrong, it's a shame its release will not garner the recognition it should.Russell Crowe plays an underground enforcer who's helping out a young girl, Amelia, trying to shake the private investigator, Ryan Gosling, who keeps following her. Crowe beats up Gosling, but soon realizes Amelia may be in danger of getting killed, and Gosling might be the man needed to assist him in protecting her. Little do they know, they're about to get involved in a large-scale conspiracy and a string of connected murders.The Nice Guys commits to its quirkiness and loves taking advantage of its irony. Gosling's character won't drive after he's been drinking, so he makes his 13-year-old daughter drive him around instead so he won't get in trouble.It's really hilarious. Not in an over-the-top Will Ferrell sense of the word, but in a very clever and cool Oceans Eleven-y type of way--with a little goofball thrown in, too. Each joke is ingeniously thought-out, but still feels very organic. While credit partially goes to director and co-writer Shane Black, we also have to praise the two leads for their brilliant delivery and conviction.Gosling is on another level and proves he deserves to be considered a comedic actor with the best of them. Crowe, who may not get to say most of the jokes, is just as important in playing Gosling's straight man--maybe the coolest and most realistic one we've seen in awhile. Their chemistry is undeniable.Amidst all the humor is a really brilliant script in its own right. We get an enthralling mystery that unfolds perfectly as the film does. There's a lot going on, but it's never confusing or overelaborate. It's old school, but new school just the same.The only thing you might say, is that there's some underutilized depth. But then again, not really. Both main characters are deep and complicated and interesting in their own ways. There's more than meets the eye and not a lot is laid out for us that easily. Black likes to make us figure things out on our own, but doesn't ever totally abandon us. Instead of flat out stating what year it is, he drops hints, forcing us to pay attention.Another marvel is the young actress, Angourie Rice, who plays Gosling's daughter. She has the talent of someone twice her age, while still maintaining a healthy amount of precocity. Based on the trailer, I knew I was going to really like this movie, save for a possible overwrought premise. But I was surprised even beyond those expectations. This is truly one of my favorite comedies in a long time. Definitely my favorite, so far, for 2016.Twizard Rating: 97</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Works the men are as dumb as rocks angle, a perennial favorite in Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Nice Guys" works the men are as dumb as rocks angle, which is a perennial favorite in Hollywood. What is a bit different about "The Nice Guys" is that the 13 year old daughter of the Ryan Gosling character is totally involved in the very dangerous detective work. Quite a few people are shot in 'The Nice Guys' and the daughter is frequently in the line of fire. The daughter is also immersed in pornland. Is the point that children today don't live in the World of the Walton's and that pretending that children do is senseless and counterproductive? The Ryan Gosling character is clearly not breaking any sort of path vis-?-vis how dads appropriately act. In ab opening scene the Russel Crowe character sees that an underage girl is trading sex for drugs, apparently waits until the 'trade' has taken place lets the underage girl leave and then hits the drug dealer which is behavior on the part of the Crowe character which is way, way far away from being acceptable behavior on the part of an adult man. Children can't be totally roped off from the World today but that doesn't mean dads and other men have to be totally resigned to children being immersed in all the seedier aspects of life now.Hollywood is totally afraid of being the least bit controversial. In movies men being presented as dumb as rocks always works and is totally noncontroversial. Works with women, works with young men. Men throwing up their hands before the challenges of raising children works for every one. (Conservatives - 'Raising children in this evil world is totally impossible'. Liberals - 'Social scientists say roll playing is healthy. People have very wide variety of sexual kinks and that is just how people are and that is terrific. Anything goes sexually is a desirable goal!') Porn may not be the end of Western civilization but a lot of totally legal porn is basically rotten. Dads completely loving their children but otherwise throwing up their hands vis-?-vis challenges of parenting is not a route dads can take.There are huge possibilities for terrific plots vis-?-vis parenting today but the possibilities though sensible are too controversial. For example, a thirteen year old boy is a computer whiz and becoming very interested in girls. He can't be kept off the Internet but there are tons of terrible porn websites. In slapstick comedy sort of way the parents unbeknownst to the boy guide the boy to X-Art rather than a porn tube site. More than a majority of parents maybe a substantial majority of parents would be very happy if a thirteen year old son developed an X-Art kink and avoided the porn tube sites. The movie could end in the parent's bedroom with the wife saying to the husband 'We are such hypocrites' and the husband saying, 'He has to learn the basics before the fine points'. The wife goes to a drawer and pulls out some handcuffs and a ball gag. The husband says, 'You're such a slut'. The wife then says to the husband 'I am your slut' and starts undressing. Such a movie would be way, way, way to controversial as at least some porn and at least some other than vanilla sex would be presented as not being terrible even as kosher. Maybe 'The Nice Guys' is suppose to present talking points. Talk about what? In 'The Nice Guys' men are as dumb as rocks and throw up their hands vis-?-vis challenges of parenting, which is typical Hollywood fare. The tone of the 'The Nice Guys' is akin to a porn parody which typically attempts to push terrible behavior such as teachers having sex with students or doctors having sex with patients is all in good fun which is, of course, not the case. 'The Nice Guys' is yet another very mediocre movie out of Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Similar in spirit but inferior in execution to "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bullets fly and bodies pile up when down-on-his-luck private investigator Holland March (Ryan Gosling) meets brutish mercenary Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe). March, hired to reexamine the death of adult film star Misty Mountains (Murielle Telio), partners with Healy when the two discover that flighty Amelia (Margaret Qualley) seems to be the key to the numerous murders of those involved with one of the actress's movies. Tracking the young girl from decadent parties to clandestine meetings across 1970's Los Angeles, the mismatched sleuths must battle gangsters, assassins, the law, and each other if they hope to stay alive and uncover the truth."The Nice Guys" takes the look and style of "Inherent Vice," but it doesn't capture the tone. This is a shame, because what it desperately needed was the right feel for this kind of buddy-cop picture - which is, namely, one with two comic relief protagonists surrounded by a wealth of serious situations. Gosling is the overly flamboyant funny man, providing much of the slapstick and panicky overreactions - even going so far as to emulate a popular routine from Abbott and Costello. And Crowe is the bigger, tougher, heavy, who is supposed to play it straight. But, somewhere in the middle, his character becomes equally as inept as his fussing, inebriated cohort, leading to more than one aggravating conundrum. As this duo accidentally collects clues, unearths a dead body, or stumbles into the right place (at the wrong time), it should be amusing, not agitating.Like "The Big Lebowski," there's a distinct film noir atmosphere and a bevy of red herrings to make the murder mystery excessively unguessable. But, unlike that aforementioned parody, which purposely overdid the twists to make sure that the impromptu detectives were inconsequential to the case at hand, "The Nice Guys" looks to be doing it all in earnest. It isn't trying to make a point with its circuitousness, and it's hoping for genuine misdirection with the classic briefcase-full-of-money routine. Writer/director Shane Black believes he's crafting an intelligent caper, merely laden with comedic interludes. But, in reality, he's created a hopelessly overwrought, overlong, insignificant puzzlement, wherein the characters never behave like they're in any real danger. They're invincible cartoon versions of private eyes, failing to take anything seriously and always impervious to bullets. Writing in a young girl sidekick (Angourie Rice as March's daughter Holly) is a smart move, as it infuses the movie with its only marginally deeper moments, but even she serves mostly to highlight just how unrealistically March and Healy behave. This goes doubly for the villains, who must continually delay shooting, stabbing, or apprehending the heroes in the most noticeable, inconvenient ways.The very idea of combining bickering flatfoots with deadly assassins, adult film stars, and precocious children demonstrates the filmmakers' interests in contrasting material. During the opening moments, many important opposites are established, from a small boy gazing at a naked woman to a calm evening interrupted by a careening car to the introductions of the leading men (one a callous enforcer, the other a cowardly deceiver). But the laughs that could have been derived from exceptional disparity are quickly replaced by wisecracks, slapstick, and cynical observations (Healy insists that "Marriage is buying a house for someone you hate," while March has the phrase "You'll never be happy" scrawled on his hand). The humor rarely flows naturally, instead arriving in the form of squabbling asides, designed specifically to be a separate, segregated moment outside of the plot, just for the main characters to exchange insults and solidify their lack of true detection skills (not unlike Black's previous nod to pulpy noir, "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"). The whole movie essentially becomes an excuse for the comic duo (and trio when Holly partakes in the repartee) to joke about the '70s, petty crooks, the corruption of humanity in general, gumshoes, and pornography.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is absolute trash. I don't know where to begin in explaining how awful this movie is. Maybe with the opening scene with a child viewing pornography, while his father was passed out drunk. This seems to be a theme in the film, with Ryan Gosling's character too busy drinking himself into oblivion to realize his own daughter is at a party watching more porn herself. I'm not sure why the film makers insisted on this theme of minors and porn but it is frankly disturbing. There is no comedic value and a disgrace. I wasn't surprised when people, including myself walked out of the film. Don't waste your money on this, you will regret it.Aside from this content, the film lacks in comedy with all of the laughable scenes already in the trailer. Everything else is just filler. Gosling plays a complete idiot, who we're supposed to feel sorry for. Maybe the audience could give a damn about him as a single dad raising his daughter alone if he wasn't too busy day drinking and putting her in harms way every other scene. Crowe is supposed to be the lovable tough guy but instead comes across as a bland character who adds very little to the story. Again don't bother with this film, it was so bad I had to create my first review to try and save people some money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From all the positive reviews I was looking forward to this film. Boy. what a letdown. Wish my wife and I had walked out a little earlier and enjoyed a day in the park or maybe a cat video. Acting is over the top by the two "pros" and everyone else is annoyingly bad. I would love to know the age and film going experience of the reviewers who loved this trashy little film. Have they not seen the classic films from the last 75 years so they have a point of reference? Have reviewing standards really slipped this far? I almost feel sorry for Russell Crowe having to endure this one. I wasted a couple of hours and $18. Crowe spent months on this humorless exercise. Hope he lost a little weight in the process and was well compensated. Save your money and time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1 is higher than I would give it. Why two talented actors would lower themselves to be part of trash like this is beyond me. It probably boils down to the parts they played "Anything for a buck". If there is any redeeming quality to this picture is that we had the opportunity to walk out and took it. The sad part is that I actually paid to see it.It was humorless. It was vulgar. It was profane. It was poorly acted. It was a TERRIBLE story line.Russell Crowe looked like a blimp. I feel sorry for the young actress who had to endure being a part of this low-life movie. I guess that's what floats as entertainment today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is not a bad movie; but it is not a good movie either. All of the ingredients were there for a really good time; but like Maxwell Smart said, "they missed it by that much."If you want to walk down memory lane this movie will transport you back to that time. If you are a young'un and this was before your time it is a pretty good period piece.The writers had enough material for a decent Saturday Night Live skit; but they stretched it and milked it. It's as if the producers of Saturday Night Live watched an episode of Kenan and Kel and said to themselves, "we're so good at what we do that we can take the unfunny member of Kenan and Kel and make him a star even though he has no real talent."I might have walked out of the movie if I wasn't emjoying all of the good soul music from back in the day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shane black gives us an incredibly average neo-noir buddy cop comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shane Black, the writer/director of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, returns with another neo-noir, buddy cop comedy called The Nice Guys. The Nice Guys takes place in 1977 Los Angeles, and after a bizarre opening scene that will only fully make sense until the end of the film, the film introduces us to one of the main protagonists, Jackson Healy. (played by Russell Crowe) Who is just low-level muscle for hire, who one day is hired by a shy paranoid girl called Amelia, (played by Margaret Qualley) to beat up a bumbling private investigator, Holland March (played by Ryan Gosling) that is on her tail. Later on Healy is attacked by two thugs that demand to know Amelia's whereabouts, which Healy does not know. After Healy escapes the thugs he goes and tries to find Holland March in order that they can team up and find Amelia and figure out what's going on.The Nice Guys is a mixture of a neo-noir mystery and a buddy cop comedy, but the film is works much better as a comedy then as a mystery, a lot of the jokes are really good with great deliveries on the punch-lines and some solid physical humor to boot. But even though the jokes on a hole are pretty good some of them do fall flat, and the film doesn't do a very good job of keeping the comedy going in a continuous flow, it sort of just comes in these short bursts. But the comedy on a hole as I said earlier is really good, so there's no real reason to get nitpick it, especially when there are so many big problems I have with the film mainly the plot. The plot itself is pretty generic, if you've seen any neo-noir film you've basically seem The Nice Guys, but not only is it generic, it's lazy. The majority of the time the way the plot is furthered is by the characters accidentally stumbling across the thing they needed, or some random character coming over and telling the protagonists the information they needed to know, very little goes on in the way of actual detective work, which makes for a very obnoxious and dull movie.But the biggest problem I have with the Nice Guys is that it's not immersive. While I was watching the film I never felt like I was actually in 70s. Compare this to Paul Thomas Anderson's Inherent Vice, (which is a film set in a similar time period) when you're watching Inherent Vice you feel like you're in the actual era its placing you in. All of the characters mannerisms and the smallest things in the background help contribute to this feeling, and it makes the film so much better and enjoyable. I never got that from The Nice Guys. Which was a serious let done, the lack of immersion makes the film feel tedious and just fake. Overall I'm split on The Nice Guys, on one hand there are some funny jokes and solid performances and on the other the plot is unoriginal and weak, and the film is not immersive. I guess it's worth looking into if it looks like something you'd be into, but you wouldn't really be missing anything if you didn't see The Nice Guys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of The Nice Guys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shane Black scripted two of my favorite buddy cop films in 1987's Lethal Weapon and The Last Boy Scout. With The Nice Guys (my latest review), he directs and sadly his direction is much better than his writing."Guys" playing like an art house version of "Boy Scout", is a mixture of clunky dialogue and bone-crunching payoffs. Whereas that 1991 film had a fair amount of nasty wit, The Nice Guys seems to be all look and no feel. Billed as an action comedy, "Guys" is patchy kitsch and contains two actors (Russell Crowe, Ryan Gosling) that completely strain for comedic timing. Sure its setting of 1977 Los Angeles is light film noir and variably flawless. However, that's about all the movie has going for it. These "nice guys" don't finish last but they come real close.Shot beautifully in a darkened haze, "Guys" unfortunately is sloppily edited, contains songs that came out after 1977 ("Boogie Wonderland", "September", "Boogie Oogie Oogie", etc.), and unjustly features 70's relic Gil Gerard in the opening credits (was he in the movie cause I just couldn't tell). Basically this picture is not the best way to get your Me Decade fix. Boogie Nights, a film that also dealt in the pornographic industry and City of Angels backdrops, is truly a better option.Now the story of "Guys" which is based on true events that happened to a real-life Marine in the late 90's, has little reason to occur almost 40 years ago. With the exception of skin flick interludes and visions of old school movie projectors, it could have taken place in any time period.The main character is Private Detective Holland March (played by Ryan Gosling). Gosling's March smokes and drinks so heavily, he teeters close to having liver and/or lung cancer some twenty years down the line (I'm not kidding). March gets paid to find people and now he's on the lookout for a missing girl named Amelia Kuntner (played by Margaret Qualley). Somehow someway, Amelia is connected to a dead porn actress named Misty Mountains (great name). On hand to help March in his quest, is Enforcer Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe). Whereas March's job is to find missing persons, Healy's job is to beat people up. Matt Bomer (Magic Mike) plays a murderous villain named John Boy and Kim Basinger makes a cameo as Amelia's two-faced mother. With heighten sound effects editing, "Guys" is loud, violent, and the in-jokes are few and far between. I had to rely on the random chuckles of the audience to see what was funny or not.In conclusion, I remember seeing the trailer for The Nice Guys in February. I automatically thought that the casting of Crowe and Gosling was interesting and sort of out of the box. After seeing the finished project, I realize it doesn't really work. At times it felt like they were in separate movies altogether. Crowe looks a little bloated while Gosling tries too hard to be funny. In truth, Ryan Gosling stumbles around "Guys" and the whole time I was kind of hoping he would turn to his forte which is the dark side (remember Ryan in Drive?). Some much for that. The one bright acting spot in "Guys": Australian actress Angourie Rice (she plays March's daughter). She has that "it factor". I mean I'm not saying she's Meryl Streep but the girl could be a big movie star someday. Rice is like a charismatic, Reese Witherspoon mini me. She's all coiled up with energy and some serious, glowing enchantment.Bottom line: The Nice Guys with its locations looking more like sumptuous movie sets than actual, recreations of L.A.'s Hollywoodland, litters its script with the name "Amelia" and the words "find Amelia". It does this so many times you could make a drinking game out of the entire, two-hour running time. As for the procreated bearing, well Philippe Rousselot's cinematography for "Guys" is the high point until it evaporates due to the flick's manic choppiness. During the final act of The Nice Guys, Gosling's March quips, "I think I'm invincible... I don't think I can die". This movie, well I think its staying power isn't invincible and I think its box office take will die a little. Soon. Rating: 2 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just an average Joe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, I was disappointed by this film. I had such high hopes for 'The Nice Guys'. The trailers sold me, the actors and actresses had my attention. I was all-in for this but after my viewing of it; it was good and entertaining but it ultimately fell short of my expectations. Let us start with the good. Crowe and Gosling delivered. I digged their chemistry, they balanced each other out very well and the comedy hit well for me. I felt Gosling had the stronger performance and I was enjoying every scene with him in it. The 70's private investigator feel of the film was also enjoyable to me. Now for the negatives... Too drawn out. The film felt way longer than needed. To be honest, the characters of Jackson Healy and Holland March are not very developed besides being brutal yet comedic characters. The film tries to give the two characters a background story but it feels forced and forgetful. Bottom line: 'The Nice Guys' had incredible potential for me but it ended up falling short. Primarily due to the drawn out story and a lack of character development. Although still funny and pulling enough; just an average movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wickedly funny and wonderfully profane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shane Black's The Nice Guys is a thoroughly entertaining, retro 1970s buddy-action-crime romp that brings to mind a cross between his previous works (such as Lethal Weapon and Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang) and the blackest absurd humor of the Coen brothers (The Big Lebowski). The buddies here are an absurdly bumbling private eye, his far-more- intelligent (though also somewhat bumbling) 13-year-old daughter, and a gruff, disgruntled enforcer (who sends physical messages to people doing things they shouldn't be doing). They are grudgingly drawn together to solve a far- flung conspiracy involving mysterious deaths, porno films, Detroit automakers, the Justice Department, and The Waltons. The chemistry of the trio ? played to perfection by Ryan Gosling, Angourie Rice, and Russell Crowe ? is a delight to behold. Sincerely hope this is the start of a franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know how much broad appeal a period piece that's structured around an adult film industry crime has, but you'll have a hard time not getting behind the chemistry between Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling as the title characters. The Nice Guys is undoubtedly one of the most entertaining films from beginning to end in 2016 with a refreshing take on the buddy-cop genre.Crowe plays Jackson Healy, a tough, uncompromising, and rugged private eye of sorts who is looking for the same young woman who Gosling is as well. Gosling plays against type as Holland March who is everything Healy is not as he pretty much weeps at the sight of blood. The two play wonderfully off each other in what is hopefully just the first time we see them on screen together. It appears as if some of the gags between the two of them is improvised, but Shane Black's script and direction deserves a ton of credit.If it does well enough at the box office, I have to believe the audience would be open to sequels. Black not only establishes the bond between Healy and March, but he also sets up the characters individually just as well. The subtle hints at who they were before this movie added the needed depth for the story and motivations from both sides. With that said, the heavy inclusion of March's daughter, Holly, doesn't work as well as I think Shane Black hoped. I didn't have any problems with Angourie Rice's performance, but her presence sometimes overshadows the brilliant dynamic established with Healy and March. Seeing a 13-year-old girl parade around adult film parties filled with gunfire can be quite amusing at times, but it's more uncomfortable than anything else.It's worth mentioning that Kim Basinger re-teams with her L.A. Confidential co-star, Crowe, so that was neat. In all, I really love the world Shane Black created with The Nice Guys. There's something to be said for a period piece that poses a smart and entertaining time at the movies all while amping up my excitement for sequels.+Chemistry between Crowe and Gosling+Intricate and funny script+Sets itself up for installments in the future-Focus shifts to the daughter a few too many times9.1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The talented Shane Black brings us back several decades with a very unique but authentic looking film. His latest flick - The Nice Guys - looks like it could have been released in the 70's, just with upgraded visuals. This along with a swinging soundtrack makes both my eyes and ears happy. :)More-so, I had a blast! I think it's the first time I laughed this much in a theater and it's a film I didn't expect this much humor from, honestly. Shane Black's glorious writing/directing along with Ryan Gosling's perfect execution made for HILARIOUS laugh out loud moments. However, Ryan wasn't the only one standing out in this flick, Russel Crowe and Angourie Rice were just as awesome. Others like Keith David and Beau Knapp with relatively 'smaller' roles packed quite a punch too. But still, these are accomplished actors while on the other side it was the first time I ever heard about Angourie Rice whom felt very mature and talented for her age. She kicked ass as Holly March (literally)! The young miss Rice is someone we should be on the lookout for, I am sure we will be seeing more of her in the near future.Mr. Black certainly succeeded in bringing us a fresh buddy film and I very much recommend The Nice Guys! Guaranteed fun for young and old.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shane Black, the father of Buddy cop movies, returns to write and direct this 1970's action/comedy about private eyes investigating a missing girl who is a person of interest connected to an apparent suicide of a female porn star.It has everything you would come to expect from the writer of Lethal Weapon, The last boy scout and kiss kiss bang bang: Chemistry between the two leads, dialogue of them bickering, a small case that leads to something much bigger and a insane amount of action make our heroes seem invincible (a trope that is actually acknowledged by one of the leads.) Ryan Gosling, playing against his usual suave bad-ass type, is hilarious as a bumbling, drunk goofball and Russell Crowe does what he does best, punch the crap out of bad guys.I recommend not watching the trailer as it gives away some of the film's biggest laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Sometimes, you just win"Everyone ready? Cool, 'cause it's superlatives time! The Nice Guys is the best action/comedy I've seen in years. And probably also my favorite film of this year in general. *Insert Classic Footage Of An Old Hydrogen Bomb Test* But why? I'm trying to keep this flashy, so we'll stick to three elements, bearing in mind the rest goes from decent to great.What's it about? Seventies LA! Private Investigators! Doing... Quips! Action! Drinking! Quipping while drunk! Shooting whilst quipping... In an intoxicated fashion! Also porn stars, stripper mermaids, eccentric gangsters and protesting hippies.Let's start with the writing. And no, this is always my pet aspect of filmmaking, I'm not turning to it just now because Shane Black is involved. Look, say whatever you want about Iron Man 3, the man is still a rockstar. And if you disagree... Reserve judgment till you see this movie. There's not a line waisted, no tiny setup that goes without pay- off, no detail that's left unacknowledged. Does it have typical Shane Blackisms (quippy characters, subversion of action movie tropes)? Yes. Are those 'isms' appropriate? Never more so. Watching it, I could feel the release of those now so rare endorphins that tend to accompany well structured stories.Next, let's turn to the main guys and gal. I mention her because Angourie Rice really acts the hell out of the role of 'too wise and quippy for her age teen'. To channel my inner 1977 LA exec: that kid is going places. But you're here to hear about Crowe &amp; Gosling, aren't you? Well, I personally got them served just the way I like 'm. In Crowe's case, it's noble yet down on his luck Russell (also, not throwing heavy objects at my facial area). In Gosling's case, it's fast-talking (!), occasionally dumb- witted or genius, well-written Ryan. Also, chemistry, huzzah. Crowe seems to know more about it than Bryan Cranston.*.And the final element is: laughter (note to self: great pitch for something at some point). Yes, I know, not really fair and probably a combination of the previous two. Maybe I should've said that this movie looks really great, even has some fun framing at times to improve the visual gags. But I'm going for the sappy line because it (laughter) is essential, at least in my opinion, in knowing why one should revisit this film. Yes, it's a great film all round, but I rarely rewatch films just because they're great. I need something else, and I think many others do to. Casablanca because I want to re-experience a time when movies were 'that', Goodfellas because I haven't seen a good gangster flick in a while and Mad Max because every action movie feels the same.That's why I'm sure that in a few years time, I won't have forgotten The Nice Guys, and probably, neither will you.*Get it? 'Cause of Drive? But also... Breaking Bad?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a great action comedy by from Shane Black!It's very very similar to Kiss Kiss bang Bang! so if you like that movie, this is a slam dunk no brainer. It's a classic buddy buddy cop film that Black practically created. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling made an excellent comedy duo. Crowe playing the straight man, A tough guy who gets paid to beat people up. Gosling does most of the slap stick, as a private dick trying to balance work and rising his daughter, but doing a half as job at both. Together they are on the trail of a girl in the porn game who got some high rollers looking to do her it.Both Crowe and Gosling where in good form and had good chemistry.

		<fullReview>So... this is set in 1977.At one point, you see Earth, Wind and Fire singing September (which came out in 1978). In another scene, you hear the Pina Colada song (which came out in 1979). Ryan Gosling tells his daughter to call 911 (which Los Angeles established in 1984).Sorry to be such a geek, but these things drive me crazy!Other than that, it was somewhat funny. I didn't think Gosling and Crowe had enough chemistry to pull off a buddy-cop movie (if that's what they were going for).I found the plot to be interesting enough, but the execution was lacking. They seemed to have this "who's a good person" theme running through it. But they never really developed any of the characters. It was all over the place! (much like this review! :)One high note: Kim Basinger still looks awesome. I couldn't decide if it was from using soft filters or Botox.

		<fullReview>...we've got a winner!And, for many reasons! For starters, there's the period music. Most of it, the way too-often unjustly maligned disco. My favorites were the classic songs from Earth, Wind, &amp; Fire and Kool and the Gang.Then, there's the re-teaming of Russell Crowe and Kim Basinger. Their first appearance together since L.A. CONFIDENTIAL (which I'm positive she makes a thinly-disguised reference to when she first meets Crowe's "Mr. Healey").There's also the chemistry between the three protagonists. Crowe, as a professional strong-arm man for hire. Sort of like Liev Schreiber's character from that Showtime series (only way more interesting). Ryan Gosling as Holland March; a bumbling-but-gold-hearted private eye trying to drown his survivors' guilt following the loss of his wife. And young Ms. Angourie Rice as Holland's long-suffering (though not always in silence) daughter Holly, who's twice as mentally sharp as--and ten times more emotionally mature than--her father! Throw in some nice physical comedy relief (like Gosling's hilarious imitation of Lou Costello at discovering a body in some bushes after an incredible fall down a wooded hill). Plus some witty banter supplied by co-writer and director Shane Black (most famous as the ill-fated "Hawkins" in the original PREDATOR). Not to mention some good old- fashioned corporate crime and corruption typical of the post-Watergate Seventies. And you have a the funniest action-comedy thriller I've seen since the original LETHAL WEAPON!Ryan and Russell rule.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah. Yeah I'm giving it a ten. Just because of the age thing. I don't know if this movie was really a "10" but I enjoyed it immensely. So much that I used the word "immensely" which I don't do, much.I went to see this film on another of my "at the mall, have to kill time" movie afternoons and it was this or "Angry Birds." I mentally tossed a coin and went in, expecting to be disappointed. Well, I wasn't. But I'm a weird guy. I like Monty Python. A lot. I like a certain kind of messed-up humor--not poop jokes but jokes ABOUT poop jokes. I found the jokes in this to be laughing out loud funny, and the last "comedy" that I laughed out loud at was "The Birdcage" with Robin Williams.So your mileage may vary. I like it. I liked it a lot. It is tough (no...it's just about impossible) to make a "real" detective movie now, since the Cohens made "The Big Lebowski." But somehow, this movie pulls it off. It's really a true, hard-boiled detective story with plot and humor and everything. I'm not kidding. Plenty of plot twists and all that stuff.But the movie did remind me that I'm weird as well as old. I can remember the seventies. The seventies were a friend of mine. This film is not from the seventies. But WHO CARES? This isn't about the seventies, at all. It's about NOW. Sheesh.Now that you know where I stand, I should tell you that most "cop" shows make me sick. I can't stand a movie about America's Finest busting bad guys. Fascist crap. So this movie is for people who like movies that aren't fascist crap. So sue me. Stay away if you like fascist crap. A word to the wise. Now you can click "helpful."</fullReview>

If you watched this movie at surface level, watch it again. In the movie, the "real" subject matter is spliced into an auto-show preview movie at the 1977 Detroit auto-show, disguised as an adult X movie, but really a message to everyone. The Nice Guys movie on the surface appears to be a detective movie, but pay close attention to the clues. No death is random, well maybe a few. If you pay attention, this movie will not leave you disappointed. And now for the spoiler: A guy with a TESLA jacket and phone case was handing out the premier tickets.

A plot that is close to just 3 quarters or an hour tops, just snagged for a bullshit comedy. The girl asks a person not to kill, but can't control her dad to stop drinking or smoking while at work. Too many mistakes in the film, god terrible plot full off mismatches. Was writer thinking of a sinusoidal wave while scripting? Oh god too bad, rather than enjoyable it was annoying piece of acting. Annoying literally, can't even laugh forcefully.</fullReview>
