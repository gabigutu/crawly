		<shortDescription>Coming from a non-Michael Jackson fan...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't been since I was a kid. I therefore had zero expectations for this movie, and even groaned that I had to come in at 6 this morning to preview it for my theater. That said, I was completely blown away and entertained from beginning to end. His voice and his dance moves are top form and timeless. He sang all his greatest hits, even from the J5 era, which really hit a soft spot with me. And people might be complaining that this isn't a typical concert movie...in truth, that is a big plus here. Typical concert movies are overly produced. The intimacy of this footage makes you feel, not like you're in a concert, but like you're witness to very private performances. You get to see first hand how involved this man was (to every little detail of production and planning). There are no crowds of screaming and crying fans to have to sit through (with the exception of a brief opening scene in which the auditioning dancers get a little too blubbery at times). This film easily reignited my appreciation for the man, who was without a doubt one of the greatest entertainers of our time. Complete 180 for me, I'll be the first to admit. And a side note, his female guitarist (her name escapes me) had me picking my jaw up off the floor, and not just her looks. You'll see what I mean.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moved with no expectations.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie as a non-Michael Jackson fan with absolutely no expectations. I bought the tickets for the world premiere as a birthday gift for my girlfriend. We went to the cinema in the morning and from the beginning I was moved. I have never done it before but in the very beginning a tear came to my eye. Thinking that this guy, with so much energy is 50 years old and about to die. When I bought the tickets I expected a movie with some biography of Michael, a lot of interviews etc, but there is none of this in the movie. The whole movie is about how the concerts would be, but I still didn't feel like I was seeing a concert. I was seeing a little family making a big project come true. I also expected to see Michael less weak, than some of his others concerts, but damn.. If you didn't know he was dead, and saw him dance and sing like he does there is no way you could predict that he was about to die of illness. There was no way I wanted to pay for tickets to his concerts before this day, but now I would pay 500$ for seeing those concerts in London. Although that This is it was about the concerts, the movie also consist a little sense of humor, love and a insight to the worlds climate problems.A really great job, with great cutting and editing. This movie is a must see for everyone! Even though you aren't a fan of Michael, go watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is truly it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget everything you think you know about Michael Jackson. Forget the scandals, the surgeries, the rumors, the mysteries. Just accept that we're all innocent until proved guilty in America and let it all go. Michael Jackson was the greatest dancer in the history of mankind. This documentary shows that hours before his death, he remained the greatest dancer in the history of mankind. He was a revelation, pure and simple. And the greatest achievement in Kenny Ortega's simple, elegant tribute is that it allows the viewer, without a shred of distraction, to witness the process of an artist. Sure, some of the footage is a little amateurish, as this was meant for Michael Jackson' records more than anything else. But that's the fun of it. The viewer gets to witness the raw nature of the artist rather than the glossy outcome that would have been the final product. If you're concerned that the film will be an act of gross exploitation and an attempt to squeeze every last dime in the wake of Michael Jackson's death, know this: I haven't the slightest doubt that Michael would have wanted his fans to see this footage. Of course it's exploitive, don't fool yourself into thinking otherwise, but so what: All documentaries are exploitive to some degree and tasteful exploitation is better than tasteless exploitation. This is a film about the process, nothing more. We're just lucky that this process happens to revolve around the finest entertainer of our time. If you're even the slightest fan, this is a must see. If you're not, I dare you not to be won over. Also, if you're looking for signs of fatigue from Michael Jackson, you will be disappointed. In fact, if there's one thing that bothered me about the film, it's that Michael was in such terrific shape that it's angering to think he died so close to the finish line. We don't have many great entertainers left in the world. And the fact that at 50 years of age, operating at about 80% energy wise, Michael blows the top 10 pop singers of today out of the sky, is rather remarkable. Prepare for an emotional and downright exciting concert-film. "This is it" will show the world that with all the noise, all the distractions, all the craziness: Michael Jackson still had it. And then some...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must-see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had my fear going in, but it was all shattered. What a blast. This is a must-see for every MJ fan and even non-fans to understand why he was so popular and deserved every bit of the title King of the Pop. A consummate artist, a perfectionist, and a visionary. The film is overflowed with his energy, passion, and dedication. If the rehearsals could be this good and engaging, one could only imagine what the concerts would've been. His voice sometimes showed his age, but his dance moves were not, at all. Also the young female guitarist was not just good looking, but crazily good with the guitar as well. Smooth Criminal segment is probably my favorite, but they're all very excellent. I don't feel the film is exploiting his death in any way. It's simply paying the tribute and gives fans something they deserve to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genius ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a clear view into the intergral preperation of a concert by a complete genius. I was never a Michael Jackson fan, however, my wife was and since she was desperate to see the film I decided to accompany her. I was astounded. I could not believe this man in the film was the same person that is was always hounded by the press and made to look like the devil. He was by no means weird, ill health, or a drug user. If he was, he masked it very well. The film shows us what we are missing as far as the concert goes and what a pity, it would have been amazing! He seemed at ease, and so happy and normal while on stage, as if it was built to be his. You would never believe this was the ''freak'' that the world perceived him to be. Shame on those people. Genius at work, a perfectionist down the smallest detail and I think the film has captured this very well. What I liked a lot was the fact that the film was not concentrating on his death and tradegy, but solely on his concert, his music, and his geniality and it was a fitting tribute to one of the greatest musicians of our times. So I would urge anyone who has had any miss conceptions about the man to go see this, you like me will more than likely change your views on the man. RIP</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one has any apology to make about this wonderful documentary, least of all Kenny Ortega. When I heard he intended to take "rehearsal" footage of the "This Is It" tour and market it as a film, I assumed it was an attempt to recoup the investment made in the project. Who could have guessed that this film would stand on its own and also enter the echelons of the "best" documentaries about rock music ever made? No less, Michael Jackson reveals more about himself in this footage than we've ever seen before. It's his premiere moment on film, and I would guess he would not have wanted it shown only because we see?for the first time?Jackson without a mask. I won't attempt to characterize this complicated, insanely talented, person, but basically he's painfully shy. And he excelled at one of the most public vocations there is: performing.What's interesting about the footage is that it exists at all. But since concerts today use video projection for the large venues where they play, it was natural to include the cameras during the rehearsal period. And it's riveting! Nothing is ever less than compelling in large part due to the level of talent in all quarters. The dancers, the musicians, the back-up singers, sets, costumes?it's a parade of the best of the best. While Jackson is the center of all of this, if you don't care for him, there's plenty of other things to look at and enjoy.Any sadness is brought by the viewer. There's not one nod to Jackson's demise or when it occurs. He looks thin, but even in a rehearsal mode, he's electrifying, and I think that's why the film works. We're not at some huge arena (for which the concert was conceived) with 10,000 screaming fans. And rather than missing that electricity, we get intimate performances of familiar Jackson material. But it's re-imagined and you never know what's coming next.An alert: there is footage throughout the final credit sequence and after the credits end. And if you can, see it in a DP theater...for the sound alone. An amazing experience!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just came back from screening of this movie.I went with very low expectation but it was really great movie. Lots of MJ songs and practice sessions.His female guitarist was out of the world, simply superb.I wish they had shown or MJ has performed some more of his stunts (moon walk, dance stunts etc etc)... so deducted 1 star for this...MJ was so humble, I dint expect that from such a big start... I m really impressed with his behavior towards his troop :) I m not a big MJ fan.. and I was totally amazed by editing and quality of movie... I m pretty sure MJ fans would love this....Hats off to MJ ... RIP....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fitting Final Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife asked me to see this movie tonight as sort of a preview,to let her know if we should see it together on our day off.As we are both Michael Jackson fans,I would have to give an emphatic "YES" to that.I was really apprehensive,since I thought that it would just be some rehearsals with tons of filler(biographical info,etc),but most of the numbers were pretty fleshed out,music and choreography wise.Some of the special effects were amazing,and I really liked the extended intro of "The Way You Make Me Feel".I liked the way they tried to make the film feel like a performance,rather than a eulogy.The talent,from the dancers to the musicians to the lighting and effects crew were just first rate all the way.I thought beforehand that this might be just a cynical cash grab-one more trip to the ATM from Michaels legacy,but honestly,I think they may just be trying to recoup some of the enormous costs of putting on a show that never came to fruition.And if some of us fans can enjoy seeing MJ one more time in such a classy way,Im all for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw This Is It today and all i can say is that it is fitting for the man Michael. That will say more than anything else about how well done this movie is. It makes me sad when i see what a fantastic production this could've been to know that the world never got a chance to see it. But i know it would've been amazing, that's more than enough for me. For the film it is basically all of his biggest hits that would've been performed in the shows on the big screen instead. It's just rehearsal but he's still amazing in them. Between each song you got some insight into the bigger picture of the shows themselves, and sometimes you'd even get to see Michael as himself. Michael you were truly one of God's greatest gifts to those of us lucky to be alive now. R.I.P</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just came from seeing the movie and plan to go and see it again soon, probably tomorrow. I am a MJ fan since I was 10. I hope I was going to be cry but I was just admiring the priceless piece of work in front of me. There was so much creativity, sweetness, professionalism, understanding, effort, energy in that film that didn't leave me any chance of crying. The professionalism and patience of ortega was outstanding, he was perfect for this whole production, the cast was phenomenal, MJ was awesome. Come on! 50 years old and dancing, singing like that? Absolutely amazing. This movie deserves to be seen over and over. My final thought: Michael Jackson will be forever the king of pop and music and he did really give us a final precious work..."this is it".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's All For Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A strong feeling of love towards myself, everyone around me and planet Earth is what I left the cinema feeling. Michael was alive again for those two hours. This Is It showcases the King of Pop at his finest.As the lights blackened and the Columbia Pictures animation played, the theatre erupted with cheers of "I love you Michael" and "God bless you Michael". After the chaos died down the audience sat in awe as the King did what he did best; he thrilled us.From the rocking tunes of They Don't Care About Us and Beat It(which I was particularly impressed with) to those real toe tapping hits such as The Way You Make Me Feel, Billie Jean and Wanna Be Startin' Something to the beautifully emotional songs that really showcased Michael's ability as a singer such as Human Nature and I Just Can't Stop Loving You, Michael truly dominated the stage. Every single person in the theatre was singing along and clapping for and after every song. I was over the moon with the recreation of the Jackson Five seeing as The Love You Save is a touching one for me. The real fun came with the especially theatrical numbers that were Thriller and Smooth Criminal, both had me in fits of happiness. Then, after a dramatic and heart touching rendition of Earth Song, Man In The Mirror drew the whole show to its close, emanating love and Michael's passion for people to make a change.I saw not one single thing, in my opinion, wrong with this film and I believe everyone will enjoy it. If you aren't a Michael Jackson fan, while you may not appreciate the significance of This Is It, you will sure as hell have a brilliant time. And if you are an MJ fan, you will truly appreciate the greatness and strong sense of meaning behind the final documentation of the true King of Pop's work, the legacy of Michael Jackon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forever Michael</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fans around the world had a very sad day this year when the news of Michael Jackson's death was announced. Michael had inspired so many, wither it was dancing, singing, wardrobe, or just being a generous human. The thing that made Michael so special that many people don't realize why he was so special to so many, how many years Michael had been performing. Since he was a child, my grandparents, my parents and my sister and I were fans. 3 generations as I'm sure many families feel the same.This Is It was supposed to be Michael's major comeback tour after years of hiding after all the child molestation trial drama. 50 sold out concerts in London, I was so excited and hoping he was going to possibly come back to the states for another world tour and was even looking up how much the tickets were. Unfortunately, Michael passed away just a few days away from performing.This Is It documents the rehearsal footage of his future concerts. Ranging from a wide variety of his mega hits from his newest song This Is It going back to his roots singing "I Want You Back", "I'll Be There" and "State of Shock". Of course also performing all of the fan favorites from his Thriller, Bad, and Dangerous Albums as well. Watching this movie got me teary eyed as well as others in the theater when he performed both "Human Nature" and "I'll Be There", he still had his wonderful voice giving his all. Michael was an absolute perfectionist and his shows in this documentary as other describe how he knows his tune and his years of experience has helped them grow.Also having little commentaries with the musicians and dancers, everyone so excited to work with Michael. You could tell this was the cherry on top of the sundae for them working with one of the world's greatest entertainers. The girl who was rocking out on the lead guitar was beyond awesome, my sister and I had our jaws dropped on how she just tickled those strings making those incredible sounds come out. The dancers were also just wonderful and had such energy and pr essence and would've done a terrific job.All I can say is that This Is It would have been the ultimate concert. Michael really went all out for this concert with mini movies introducing his songs. He had a little Chicago gangsters clip with Humphrey Bogart and other gangsters chasing after Michael. Thriller was also such a show with the dancers rising from their graves and their costumes were awesome! Michael also did a very touching performance of Earth Song that would make anyone want to look at our Earth and want to make a difference.To sum this up, this was a gift to Michael Jackson fans and was incredible to watch. Even if you're not a MJ fan like my boyfriend is, you'll still enjoy it, he was impressed on how dedicated everyone was and loved the music. This Is It should not be missed!10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The concert would have been great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hadn't really planned to see this show today, but a dental appointment was timed such that I ate lunch in a mall here in Bangkok and wandered by the multiplex upstairs after eating. The second showing of the day was to start in ten minutes, so I bought a ticket. There had been advance-booking for the last couple of weeks, with a chart showing the available seats for each show. A week ago the showings had two or three seats booked at best for any show. For the showing I attended there were twenty-five people in a five hundred seat house. I looked at a poster on my way in and realized this was the first day of release, so this was a disappointing turnout.I don't know what material was available from the tapes of rehearsals, but the film as a whole is often a bit of a patch-work quilt, sometimes feeling somewhat like the pieces are a bit mismatched. In some numbers there are frequent cuts back and forth from at least three different occasions, as shown by Michael wearing different wardrobe. Also adding to this effect is the fact that some shots were captured in high-definition, others in standard video which are inter-cut for the same songs. The audio on the other hand is pretty seamless and of high quality throughout. Sometimes a song sequence is interrupted to show a behind the scenes conference on how to proceed. Many songs are not included in their entirety, apparently to allow for such background material to be included instead. Much of the show seemed like an extended "making of" extra to a main event.Again, I do not know what material was available, but if most songs were recorded in their entirety, I think I would have preferred to see an attempt to show what the final concert would have been like, without so many interruptions. If I had directed it, I would have done a few minutes of the behind the show material first and then attempt a concert experience. For instance, there is a sequence done in B&amp;W with MJ interacting in a crime movie facing a menacing Humphrey Bogart after watching Rita Hayworth sing. But this segment is interrupted multiple times with color shots done on stage, some with the associated song, some not. I was disappointed not to be able to see the way the B&amp;W segment would have played in concert. I am guessing it would have been in one continuous piece.As it is, I can see where the concert would have been a real treat. I worked as a stage hand for a Jackson Five concert over thirty-seven years ago, and it was well done but far less elaborate. Michael's voice and dancing still appeared to be in top form to me despite all the intervening years, and the set design and lighting was elaborate and effective. Perhaps the show was edited as it is to allow us to see him as a perfectionist at work, but someone who had rapport with his cast and crew. His interaction with the cute blonde lady guitarist is a high-light. He comes across as a normal, down to earth person, albeit one that is incredibly talented. I felt a little sad at times while watching this show because he seemed so vital and fit that it is still hard to accept that he is gone. Perhaps he really could have played fifty play-dates in London without faltering. Considering how vigorous the numbers are, this would have been another great achievement for him.</fullReview>

As for me I thought that this moving was amazing... If you are a Michael fan it is a must see, you will see him in a whole new way and if you are a hater you need to see it because it may just make you change your opinion about this amazing, talented man. He is so talented and gracious and for as amazing and talented as he was he didn't even act all superior he was kind and loving... Oh and the guitarist are just wow.... You gotta see it in IMAX I know I wanna go back and see it in IMAX!!! At the end it was dedicated to his three kids....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Exposed Life, the Spatial Logic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film is such an ordinary business in many respects that when something unique comes along, it takes on an importance on that fact alone.Whatever you think of the music, he was a person manufactured to exist only in the media marketplace, uncomfortable and profoundly unsuccessful at a human scale. He, like some other performers I suppose, can only live, can only actually breath on a stage, and then only if it is bigger and more dynamic than any ever created. If I had seen the show, I would likely have left crying about the huge waste of resources, the fantastic color budget, there only to suspend a shaky being and the shakier admiration we grew to need.The form of the film is set up to keep us from reminding ourselves that we are not seeing a concert. Instead we are seeing stuff that would have been culled for a terse "making of" DVD extra, one focused on how the most expensive and elaborate stage show in history was put together. Jackson would never have allowed us to see him as a human, never allowed us to see him not trying hard. He would have hidden what he knew to be his great weaknesses ? that he was never allowed to develop a mind, a means of articulation, any semblance of connection to the world outside his craft. If it were possible for him to know about this, it would be a hell for him, knowing that we can see him as he is, not as he invented the image:He knows music and movement at an intuitive level, perhaps qualifying as genius, but he cannot speak more than four words that are genuine, even when it comes to the music. He is a master showman, but unable to imagine anything at all, instead only see what others have done for him and intuit how it needs to bend to fit him in. There are sequences here that you can see someone was clever with, for instance a sequence which would have him composited into old movies. He is terminally uncomfortable in this, and one can imagine the angst of identity he carried home and which had to be drugged away. The man shown here as his trusted collaborator (credited as "director") was who killed Jackson, by shifting the only world he knew.The performances themselves are remarkable. The singing is unrewarding; he tells us repeatedly that he isn't really using his voice, that he is preparing to warm up, knowing that physical stress was coming. We don't notice it much because we know the songs so well, and what we hear has been supplemented dishonestly. But the dancing IS rewarding. The backup dancers are rewarding in the usual way; they are the best in the world, possibly ? given advances in the science of training ? the best ever assembled. Each time we see them, they are working hard as if their lives depended on it. In terms of narrative, the film is about them (and to a lesser extent the backup musicians). We see the tryouts, and the announcements of the winners. We see some truly extraordinary people here. This is where the energy comes from.Jackson's dancing is remarkable as well, but for different reasons. He reinvented stage dance. He is as influential as Astair, more because his visual style transformed music into a video art, a transitional metamedia where it stands today. We may be even more familiar with his moves than his sounds. He lopes through the numbers. It isn't fair to expect him to be good. His body is in pain; joints are taped up to allow even what we see.But what we see, even if it lacks energy, is amazing. Jackson is important because he created himself and everything about himself. Even his ideas about love and peace are fabricated. But the invention: face, clothes, music, pseudofamily and all are physically situated. He has created it all in the context of the space around him and how he moves in it. Even the iconic moonwalk where physics seems denied indicates this. It is remarkable not only because he invented a self, one that it is outrageous and comic in every detail, but that it is coherent and has an inner logic. That inner logic is spatial, a logic of movement. His soul invents itself first in movement and builds a self to occupy. This part alone makes the film amazing. Often in the film, we see numbers from beginning to end that are assembled from different rehearsals. In some of these rehearsals, it is clear that he has just arrived on the set that has been cooking for months. His stage choreography is made up on the spot. As the splices shift back and forth, you can see that each time, he is making up a different ? sometimes wildly different ? routine. He does so effortlessly. He does so automatically and with grace. But most remarkable is that it makes sense each time. It is a whole soul, coherent and true, visible. Visible to us, conveying that sense, that spatial logic.What an experience. It is sad that he had to suffer and die so this could come to us. If he had lived, he would have made a big show. As it is, we are allowed to see him in his own private show, living in movement, exposed.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To miss this on the big screen would be a real shame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Jackson is The Man.No statement better sums up the artistic genius who is arguably the greatest performer of all time. Witnessing him here is nothing short of breathtaking; he effortlessly exudes coolness, everyone and everything around him directly benefitting from his unique persona. His natural charisma and talent is unparalleled, his body a rhythmic treasure. Every 360 spin, every whiplash hand movement, every grab of the crotch, every nod of the head: iconic, hypnotic actions that are given an instant gravitas by Michael. Watching him dance and glide across the stage floor is akin to seeing Michael Jordan slam dunk or Marlon Brando act ? you absolutely know that nobody will ever be able to do what they do to the same magical level. And these are only rehearsals.As for the tour itself, it was so close to kicking off that we are lucky enough to see all the other elements it had to offer. A superb pre-filmed sequence that has MJ superimposed onto film with Humphrey Bogart ends in a machine gun fight which is a delight to see, its noir-ish atmosphere perfect for 'Smooth Criminal' ? one of the best dance sequences on offer. Also pre-filmed (intended to be in 3D) is the ghoulish and ghastly 'Thriller' segment, a fun-filled lead up to Michael and co doing the uber-famous Thriller boogie. However, for a solo dance performance from MJ himself, nothing can beat his electric stand-alone routine for 'Billie Jean', the backup dancers and technical crew present stare on profoundly awestruck ? as will you.The documentary itself doesn't have much to do. Director Kenny Ortega, creative director of the tour and a close friend to Michael, knows that all we want to see is the man at work and he capably delivers. Ortega plays the music in an appropriate order ensuring there is a meaningful narrative to the proceedings but is thankfully never forceful in sentiment. Allowing the lengthy rehearsal sequences to play out, complete with MJ feedback and chatter, there is an added poignancy here that goes a long way to showing the world what was really lost on 25 June 2009. Not only an iconic, sometimes controversial, entertainer who was often viewed through a cynical lens but a genuinely affecting human being.With only a limited two week run at cinemas around the world, I suggest you book tickets now to see this freakish talent in action. To miss this on the big screen would be a real shame.4.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would have been a great concert</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before you go to see this film please remember that it is made from footage of rehearsals. The footage is similar to that of Michael Jackson's rehearsals for previous concerts (Dangerous/History).Michael's voice is amazing even though he mentions he is not going to go all out until the actual concert, it really shows he was 110% dedicated. He doesn't dance full on either, at times he does get into it but most of the time he is conserving himself for the concert.It's all performances apart from a few interviews with the backup singers and dancer. There are also the intros for Thriller and smooth criminal.For the non-fans that go to see this movie: It is not a concert film, its a summary of what could have been, and how hard Michael worked for it. It shows his humor and how involved, dedicated he was for his performances.If you are a fan, you need to watch this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a lifelong Elvis fan, as opposed to a Michael Jackson fan, I have to say this film does MJ proud as a lasting legacy. There were two documentary films made about Elvis which, quite frankly, do not hold a candle to This Is It in style, scope, editing and footage. This Is It is a wonderfully brilliant homage to Michael Jackson. Granted it was done more for his own record and not the viewing public but thank God the powers to be decided to release it. I can only sympathize with MJ fans when they lost their idol (having gone through it 33 years earlier) but they have a wonderful film to remember him by. I went to see it because I quite like his music (like Elvis he had a God given talent) and I love dancing and I came out of the theater blown away by his professionalism, hard work, and attention to detail. From beginning to end, I was enthralled by the dancing numbers (Smooth Criminal rehearsals being my favorite) and the music. Fan or not, you can view this movie and appreciate his talent and he had it in spades. There is enough dance footage in this movie to satisfy dance fans and for Michael Jackson fans, there is more than enough to keep them satisfied. I came out of the cinema appreciating Michael Jackson much more than before I went in. I mourn the loss of his early demise and the talent that surely robbed the world of future projects. If the concerts in London had ever gone ahead, they would have been outstanding, no doubt about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AN EYE OPENING EXPERIENCE - please read</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost everyone around me is against seeing this movie. They only know what the media has fed them about Michael Jackson and don't want to just jump on the bandwagon now that he has died. I was scared to see this movie because I felt was contributing to Sony's profit off his death. Of course I had to see it anyways because I needed closure. The first thing I noticed is how "normal" he looked in the footage. From what the media presented to us I was expecting to see a frail &amp; weak Michael Jackson on stage. I was shocked at how well he moved, how good he sang and how "normal" his face looked. He blew me and everyone away in the theatre I couldn't stop singing and dancing in my seat.. to me this movie was a celebration and victory for Micheal Jackson. Many people will look at it differently and focus on his appearance but if you look past it you will see his beautiful soul and relentless talent that is and always was Michael Jackson. I think that everyone who ever doubted him should see this movie and you will find that you have been lied to by the media. What I take most importantly from the footage was that he was not only going to give possibly the greatest performance the world would ever see.. but also he was going to use this show to express his love for the world and inspire people. After everything that he has been through in his life... the world turned against him and the media used the one thing he loved the most "children" to destroy him and we sat back and watched it happen. Why would he still care about the world after everything he had been through... I think because he stayed true to who he was from the beginning he never let the "evil" of the world change his heart. This is a true victory to me. I wont allow myself to focus on his death and possible murder because then I will remember his story as a tragedy and that's what the media wants us to do. Focus on a tragic icon who rose to the very top and came crashing down.. that's what sells. This is not the true story of Micheal Jackson if you watch the movie " the Jackson : an American dream" &amp; "this is it" you will see that he overcame the struggles of his life and got back on the stage to perform his heart out because they didn't break him. This is how I will remember his story.I want to point out some issues about the many pictures we saw of Michael before he died. As I photographer I know that we can easily manipulate the way a person looks through professional programs and make it look very real.. I used to wonder myself why he would wear the masks. Think about it.. thousands of photographers who were paid millions of dollars were always trying to catch a picture of him and they would manipulate his features and exaggerate them to make him look like a freak. By covering his face they couldn't do that anymore... so the media turned it and used it to make him look even more weird. Of course none of us "normal" people walk around with masks like that so we think it looks weird but we don't live like Michael Jackson in a world so secluded from having a normal life.. the media and fans made it impossible for him to ever be "normal." So why did we compare him by our own standards. I can point my finger at everyone else and say look at what "they" did to Michael Jackson but I am guilty of never really looking into things while he was alive. I always loved his music and what it stood for but I was ashamed so I would say " I don't care for his personal like but his music is amazing" and no one would dispute. No to say that I believed what the media presented about him but I never took the time to educate myself and stand up against all the garbage. I will learn from this and teach my children one day to stay away from gossip and especially the media.. and learn about person before you judge them. Most important I will teach them about the story of Michael Jackson and how he inspired me to be better person.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I was angry and sad when I finished watching This is it! But not because it was in some kind of way bad. not at all! I was angry because we won't be able to watch this beautiful peace of work that MJ was preparing to give us in this series of concert! I didn't listen to Michael's music before his death. I couldn't even understand why he has so powerful fan base. I just saw him in the way the press presented him to me. As a pedophile and someone who changed his skin color with a series of surgeries. I didn't even take a slice of time to really listen to his music and understand a powerful message that he tried to gave us in his songs. When he died I wasn't shocked at all but started to listen to his songs out of pure curiosity and you can tell that I was amazed. This movie shows all of Michael's haters (as I was before his death) his real side. A humble, loving person that loved us all no matter what. And he tried to give us all his love in this concerts.Well, what can i say... See this movie! Just to say goodbye to a King. Or to understand why he is a King. Because that's what he is! King of pop!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MJ's talent and professionalism really comes through</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing "This Is It", I now understand why Michael Jackson's 50 shows in London were sold out in just hours. I saw this movie with no expectations, thinking that it was just a way for the studios and his family to make money, that it would be just a bunch of interviews and clips hastily thrown together to cash in while MJ was still in people's mind. It was not. The movie documents the months of hard work Jackson and the crew put in to prepare for the London concerts. In light of the amount drugs that Jackson had been on and his poor health, for him to be so alert, to dance so well, and to work so hard is mind-boggling. Throughout the movie, Jackson oversees the minutest details - slightly changing the beat on the piano, refining cues and positions. While I liked Michael Jackson's music in the past, my respect for him was tempered by his freakiness and many controversies. But after watching this movie, I have a whole new respect for him. You can see the talent oozing out of him. He knows his music intimately and works so professionally with his crew. He's famously eccentric, but he's also an extremely nice guy who was always courteous with his staff. I really regret not seeing Jackson's live shows in the past and am saddened that the world lost such an extraordinary talent. His songs have held up well after more than 30 years, and as one commentator noted, at the age of 50, he still blows all the top 10 pop singers out of the sky. I'm really surprised that the movie only got 7.9 million at the US box office, but I expect its sales to grow people who have watched the movie say great things about it. In China as well, the theater where I saw the movie was only about a quarter full (although I do live the outskirts of town...) Watch this movie and be amazed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is the title missing a question mark....This is It?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not one to watch concert videos. I am not sure I've even sat through an entire concert video and I still can say I haven't because I just couldn't make it through Michael Jackson's successful This Is It. I watched almost the entire thing before I gave up. I love Michael Jackson's music as much as the next person. I grew up with him, one of my favourite anthologies was the History album and I was shocked about his death as well. I suppose with all that and the hype that was and is Michael Jackson my expectations of his final concert/film were reasonably high. What I expected was some of his greatest music mixed with his charismatic and brilliant stage presence, musical genius and a majority of behind the scenes footage we have never seen, or could never see and that is where This Is It hits a brick wall. It hyped itself as 'behind the scenes', Michael's last days, and there is virtually none of that. The scenes are the most mundane, pointless moments in putting together this concert. The music is a mish mash of various moments in his career but nothing really moves you or shows you anything that really makes you want to see more.It bodes well for the people who put together Michael Jackson's last concert that they hired a legitimate director like Kenny Ortega. Ortega's credits include a host of TV Shows and Disney musicals and I would have hoped he could have put together something with more than just clips and short snippets of music and more of a story. I guess I just wanted something that really just paid the ultimate homage to a man who is truly a musical legend. I wanted to be moved by his music the way he has always done but for me This Is It was a total dud and did none of that. At the same time this is strictly my personal opinion of the film because I know many fans and concert lovers adore this movie or at the very least enjoyed it so maybe I'm not the right person to review this. I score a 2 because it did so well and many love the film so they must have done something right. However, if you're like me and not a huge concert video person you might wanna steer clear and simply watch Youtube videos of Michael Jackson because then you can put together your own homage to the King of Pop. 2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think there needs to be a bit of perspective here (and I know that when it comes to MJ there's not always been much of that). I've been a fan of his music since I was a little girl, and I went to see this concerned that it would be mawkish or grotesque in some way. It was both incredibly wonderful and incredibly painful to watch. There were times when his vocal performance was so touching and beautiful that it took me straight back to the 80s at the height of his career. At others he sounded weak and frail by comparison. As far as the dancing went, whilst there were glimpses of the sheer brilliance that made him so incredible to watch, he didn't get much above a walk throughout the film and even during 'Billie Jean' the moonwalk was, sadly, absent. I've read the other reviews and I think that people need to re-watch his Motown 25 performance before suggesting that he was still performing as skillfully as he always had. Having said all of that, I felt that it was well put together, and tastefully handled. If you go to see it as an opportunity to see behind the scenes rather than the way the concert itself would have been, you get a touching and almost intimate glimpse of MJ in his last months. This could have been a tawdry and shameless attempt by Ortega to recoup his losses on the tour, but even if it was, it didn't feel that way, and I'm really glad of that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>has the songs you love (or don't) and a mega talented singer/dancer at the core</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Say what you will about Michael Jackson in his personal life (many have, many times over), but it's hard to dispute his talent. Months before his very untimely death- he was about to put on a ten-show last-time concert in London- this collection of footage from his rehearsals shows undeniably that the guy could sing and dance and entertain even when he was just in front of the other awestruck dancers in his group. He was a strange guy behind closed doors, perhaps more (or less) than we think we know, but the footage that's collected here by director Kenny Ortega is, at the least, proof that there was fire burning in him to put on a show wherever and whenever and to do it to his maximum potential.With This is It, it's a concert film mostly, and sometimes a documentary on the making of some of the background footage that would have been used in the concert. Some of the latter stuff is interesting to watch, though a little unsettling (i.e. a 3D remake of Thriller is sort of pointless as it's impossible to top the Landis original, despite the addition of never-before-heard Vincent Price dialog), but it's the stuff on stage with MJ perfecting his performances, and of those around him, that intrigue the most. Director Ortega (of High School Musical films) is not quite as adept at mixing together the video footage with the on-stage rehearsal. It usually works best when we see a song performed either just in its entirety on stage with MJ and the other performers (i.e. Billie Jean) or with the majority from video footage (Smooth Criminal, one of the highlights of the film due to its update with MJ in a Bogart movie).Truth be told, I didn't enjoy the entire film, but it's mostly based on the preference of songs - I could have done without some of the slower numbers or ballads like Human Nature, I'll Be There or Earth Song - and it's not to discredit the real appeal of This is It. We get to see what it's like behind the scenes (save, perhaps, for some of the much more intense squabbles or whatever that were likely cut), with MJ's perfectionism knowing no bounds. He could basically direct the show himself, we see, and that Ortega is mostly used for directing the background dancers and pyrotechnics. A lot of your favorites are here, and he performs them in rehearsal with the kind of energy some bands and groups or singers barely ever have the energy to muster up.</fullReview>

It's a collection of his preparation for his concert "This Is It" that was suppose to start 18 days after Michael Jackson's untimely passing.In these footage, you get to see the absolute talent &amp; skills that Michael Jackson had in performing his songs, music, dance and choreography. Watching this film is like sitting in the arena, watching a musical artist's rehearsal just before their big concert. You'll appreciate the natural talent in Michael Jackson's musical abilities and all of his hard work, including his own love &amp; appreciation for all of his co-workers. It's also refreshing to actually see the personalities, skills &amp; talent of the back-up singers and dancers that we initially saw (but did not recognize), during Michael Jackson's funeral.As you watch Michael Jackson's very last musical performance, "This Is It" could have been a truly awesome concert.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is it was a very interesting movie that shows all the time and talent that goes into rehearsal for what would have been a great Michael Jackson show. Without a doubt, just from what you see from the footage, this was definitely it. The best Michael Jackson show ever which the world never got to see. Michael showed no signs of sickness in the movie. He seemed healthy and very enthused and driven to put on a phenomenal show for his fans. I had tears in my eyes while watching some of the scenes. He was such a great talent and loss. He was a perfectionist and it truly shows in his work. Forget about all the negative headlines and lawsuits against this talented person. This is it would have been his ultimate comeback and it is a shame we only got to see it in rehearsal. The 3-D Thriller part of the show would have been fantastic as well as the flames shooting back and forth on the stage. And of course the host of talented dancers who would have shined in the spotlight with MJ. Do not miss it. This is all we will ever see of this incredible show. Go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Is It, wow!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw it and I was wowed. This would have been the greatest concert ever. I was planning on seeing it, whatever it took. Seeing the movie confirmed my belief that MJ was truly the "King of Pop". New music, videos, updated versions of past hits, with an incredible group of musicians. Kenny Ortega, wow what a creative genius (along with Michael, of course). The scene with Rita Hayworth, Humphrey Bogart, Eddie G, wholly smokes, who thought of that one? injecting MJ into the black and white scenes. Always loved Rita Hayworth anyway, so when this scene began with her doing "Gilda" (and MJ sitting at a table in the club) I was blown away. Thriller, with the new video shot for the concert, better than the original. Billy Jean, very similar to the original, but I love it, so it was just pure fun to see Michael do it again, with his so hot band backing him up. The rehearsals were full of love initiated by Michael, and it put a whole new perspective on him for me. He was a perfectionist, a genius, and at 50 years old still the best. Too bad we were unable to see him perform for 15 years prior, because any other rock group or rock performer could not hold a candle to Michael Jackson. He was it!</fullReview>

His voice through out is excellent and seeing him organize everything from the 3d Videos to the sound engineer was very interesting. In between each chapter the screen went black and the beat of the next song came on and each time i felt like getting up and dancing I'm surprised some of his fans didn't although there was a round of applause at the end. I can only imagine what it must be like for fans who had tickets for the concerts, they would have been amazing, there are part of the film were it is obvious he is holding back, it is sad to think that he never got that last change to go full out and show the world what he can do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: This Is It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was one of those mornings like any other mornings, where I would wake up, and turn on the TV set to the news channel, as it plays in the background while I go about getting myself ready for work. It was a news feed to a flurry of police activity from a helicopter vantage point, and I thought there was probably another massive shootout in the USA, until I squinted at the news flash at the bottom of the screen. It mentioned something about Michael Jackson's passing, and I couldn't believe my eyes, I had to put my glasses on.I pretty much grew up with the music of Michael Jackson, being all but 6 years old when I got the Thriller album on cassette tape, and was hooked. It was played countless of times, and I too performed Beat It with a primary one school friend, in front of the class, big MJ fans that we were. And in 1993 when he was in Singapore which served as a pit stop for his Dangerous World Tour, I was there as well, for the first night out of two when his birthday was celebrated. And all that just around the time when the craziest negative news about the man had surfaced.But This Is It is not that documentary, but one that's set to allow audiences and fans all around the world witness what MJ was preparing for ? that grueling 50 shows in London that would be as much a showcase as well as a swansong. I mean, he's no Peter Pan, and it's still pretty amazing that he still possessed this fabulous energy to create that special magic that only MJ can create on stage. Watching him perform live is definitely an entirely different experience from watching it on video, but I suppose Kenny Ortega had created the next best thing, culled from rehearsal footage of his practices leading to the run up of the landmark performances.Naturally, don't expect MJ to be at his very best or performing everything 100%, as many a times he had mentioned that he's conserving energy, though most times he just couldn't help it but to perform his numbers through and through. It's also a valuable peek into how he crafts the entire performance to perfection and love, never losing his temper as he offers his two cents worth on what he exactly wants out of the performers, musicians and dancers. You can see the respect he commands from his crew, who knows that they must be up to the mark whenever he comes on set to practice with them, and it's very much amazing that when MJ is on fire, everyone else will be silenced, and in awe. Look no further than Billie Jean where the man just captivates everyone's attention.And you cannot get better ringside seats than what this film has to offer. Culled from various rehearsals sometimes of the same song, it allows you to see how MJ finetunes and experiments with various ideas, especially for his dance. His stage performances were always a spectacle, and the sheer amount of effort in pyrotechnics and special effects, would make you wonder how awesome the actual London performance would have been, which sadly will never materialize beyond the ideas tossed up in this documentary.This Is It is as much about MJ, as it is about the meticulously handpicked dancers and backup performers who would have been part of a legendary concert. It's not easy supporting the King of Pop given the innate pressure to excel and he acknowledges that effort put in, though I feel it must have been quite heartbreaking for them to learn about the passing of the superstar, and a mentor whom I'm sure they would have learnt a lot from during their time spent together in preparation. At least their efforts will not go to waste with the release of this film, which may seem to be gimmicky since it's going to be on screen for only 2 weeks. And a reminder too not to leave the hall prematurely before the end of the end credit roll.RIP Michael Jackson, you will be missed by your fans worldwide as the greatest performer who ever graced the stage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceeded expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught the first show of This Is It at a theater in a mall in Penang. The crowd was rather 'disappointing' but it was a 12 noon show. I hope that both fans and non-fans alike will take the efforts to watch this movie. It exceeded my expectations because it greatly underlined how the world of entertainment has been impacted with the sudden loss of this great icon. I counted the number of songs on the credits being rolled at the end of the film and I believe it listed 28 songs in all. The accompanying CD - being from the masters of the studio versions of the albums that carried the songs in the sequential flow of the movie - is thus something that could have been more. For example "I'll Be There" is not on the CD itself. But then, I would not worry too much because for sure the DVD and Blue-Ray versions will be out sooner than later. After all this movie is strictly for two weeks only. Overall the sound was superb, music simply captivating and behind-the-scenes dialog with the dancers / musicians and Ortega in all really showed what a master Michael Jackson was... I almost want to say is! The 1 hour 45 minutes flew by just too quickly. How I wish I could watch the movie in IMAX... no such theater in Penang. At the end of the day, a lovely experience and one which die hard fans, newly found fans and non-fans should take the opportunity to watch simply to know and understand / appreciate what a musical pop legend MJ is. His music and songs will live with us forever!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not just scraps of rehearsal footage as it has been promoted, there is enough material to get a genuine idea how the show would have gone, including brand new music video sections for Thriller and Smooth Criminal. The latter especially was ingenious and has some unexpected cameos. If you have ever liked MJ at all, go and see this, it will not disappoint. It is a little bit indulgent as you might expect but when you see the talent on display that is completely forgivable. Michael is incredible for a 50 year old man on death's door. There is something other worldly about him. We get to see him being very professional and very much a director or his own show. You get the idea that all or at least most of the crazy surprises have come out of his head. The interviews with emotional dancers overwhelmed by getting to work with MJ are welcome to and do not crowd the film or let it deteriorate into sentimental rubbish. This is pure entertainment, I bet nobody can sit still or resist the urge to mouth the lyrics all the way through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Created Art Like No Other</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Jackson slides his feet together and claps his hands raised above his head to Michael Peters' iconic choreography for "Thriller" in "This Is It". Michael Jackson had such joy as a performer. In Director Kenny Ortega's "This Is It" we see a vibrant MJ, moving and sounding amazing, as he rehearsed for his final World Tour that would never be. Amazingly, this is not the presumed feeble Michael Jackson. Instead 50 year-old MJ looked totally prepared and ready for his world tour, under the guidance of his choreographer Kenny Ortega, who is a master. "This Is It" is not the best movie ever made, but I enjoyed this movie more than any in recent memory. The great paradox is perhaps separating Michael the persona and private man from the gifted artist. "This Is It" is an exploration of the art, and brilliant creation. MJ emerges as the consummate professional, who knows what needs to be done, and also very gracious. In a great scene toward the end, Michael thanks his musicians and dancers for bringing their best, and says, "I love you all." Michael's amazing talent will be truly missed.Director Ortega created "This Is It" from the rehearsal footage for the Michael Jackson Tour from sessions in London and Los Angeles. The movie opens with the dancers expressing their gratitude, and saying "Thank you!" to MJ for selecting them for his Tour. From the dancer's perspective, "I'm dancing on stage with Michael Jackson!" Life is great. Ortega and MJ assembled world class dancers, singers, and musicians in "This Is It". The results are stunning. Jackson sings "I Can't Stop Loving You" with Judith Hill. He plays air guitar along side killer lead guitarist Orianthi on "Beat It". And MJ completely wows in the dance number for "Black or White". Jackson's voice sounded great?hitting his notes. Admittedly, he said on several occasions he was saving his voice. My good bud John pointed out to me that Michael was just "marking" the dance numbers?not going full out. To my untrained eye, I thought he moved exquisitely with a great sense of line and drama.As amazing as the musical numbers are, it was the whole creative process of MJ and his crew that mesmerized. In one of the opening numbers, Ortega was expecting MJ to burst into song. MJ replies, "I want it to simmer." As an artist trained by the best including Quincey Jones and Michael Peters, he knows what he wants, and what works. Working with singer Hill, he uses his hands to illustrate in time and space the placement of the lyrics, "I? can't? stop? loving? you." He instructs his musical director Michael Bearden he wants it "simple". MJ tells him, "I want the audience to hear what they hear on the album." Now that is perfectly clear. Bearden admits in interview that he loved working with MJ, because he knows exactly what is in the songs, being that he wrote them. This in itself is astounding. Everyone knows MJ's songs like "Thriller", "Beat It", and "Billie Jean"?they are all part of the pop music lexicon.Michael Jackson in "This Is It" comes across as the consummate professional, pushing the envelope on creativity. MJ generated art. While he performs "Human Nature" solo on stage, the dancers watch in awe. His voice and moves are impeccable?completely generated in the moment. Whether it is watching Lebron James driving to the hole or watching Japanese Tea Ceremony, this is mastery expressed as art. Michael Jackson was creating art. And there is always thrill and a sense of joy in that. "This Is It" celebrates the art of Michael Jackson, and reminds us that we will truly miss that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the reason i give this a 10 out of 10 is because this movie does what it is meant to do. For all of the Michael jackson fans out there it makes you realize his unconditional love and commitment to his fans. He was hands on for everything in the show and when you see him do things on the screen the people around him were all star struck. He will make you laugh with his unique choice of words, and will make you cry when you hear his talent and see his passion. This movie makes you realize that what Michael Jackson was going to do for the show was going to be a thing of legend. I can not see a person leaving the theater thinking they just wasted their money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must watch for all Michael Jackson fan and Non fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first time i am writing on IMDb and i am happy that i am writing it for a movie which is about Michael Jackson the man who i admire the most.The movie is awesome and a must must watch.The movie is in the chronological order as Michael would have perform on stage with bits from his crew and dancers.I love the thriller, smooth criminal and Dance and Shout Performances(rehearsals),in fact all the performances (rehearsals) had the perfect blend of technology and art.Michael looked in good health but a little skinny and the way he was jumping,dancing and was having fun on stage was a treat to watch. His dance moves were as great as they always have been with some new amazing moves but his voice sometimes showed his age. Non the less his energy, passion, and dedication seem to have not change at all. The intensity and the passion with which he was rehearsing would only make you think how spectacular the real concerts would've been.The movie is full of rehearsals,great song,some cool special effect which are incorporated in the performance which depict Michael Jacksons devotes towards his art,his constant efforts to create some thing new and spectacular,his eye for detail, his love for his fan,his humble nature and his love and affection towards humanity.I hope to see the entire show performed by someone like usher as Michael would have performed as a tribute to him.I would recommend this movie to all as i feel that after watching Michael Jackson working toward Creating a show that would have taken Live entertainment to another level you would be inspired to work harder and achieve something great in life.I would like to end by saying that Michael Jackson is the King of Pop and that he will live Forever through his Music and Dance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a filmmaker I was very impressed with the manner in which Ortega arranged the rehearsals. He allowed MJ to control most of the process, yet he was the steady rock on which the production relied. Bless Ortega.MJ restrained himself during the rehearsals, so his performance isn't at its peak-- YET it's better than 99% of the artists out there today. This 50 year old man who was hours away from death reigned supreme even when he was holding himself back.I recommend this film to everyone-- even people who are only mildly impressed by MJ.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm an MJ fan and I walked in with high expectations. Mainly I was impressed, in fact I l loved it! The Movie shows MJ as he really is, he's really humble and really dedicated to the fans. He wanted everything perfect and that it was.The songs were great, the performances were spot on. We see a lot of Michael dancing and practising with his voice, we see plenty of him though you just want more! It's really great for MJ fans and for anyone who's not a fan.I was only let down because I wanted to hear some more of his good songs, but there's so many of them I can't really argue over that. The "Smooth Criminal" and "Thriller" performance are particularly good!The hour and 45 minutes fly by. I enjoyed it that much. It felt like less than 1/2 an hour. I didn't want it to be over.Overall it's really a fantastic finale for MJ Seeing this I know that the Live Shows would have been Stunning.R.I.P MJ 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fitting Tribute/Epitaph for One of the Most Talented and Troubled Personalities of the past 1/2 Century!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>.......................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FLThose of you who are fans will undoubtedly love THIS IS IT.(Although it most certainly will bring you some tearful moments) Those of you who aren't, will probably enjoy it a lot, despite any negative feelings or concepts you may harbor about Michael Jackson's personal life. Frankly, I was lukewarm about going to see it. Thanks to my wife Carmen's insistence, this outstanding work moved and inspired both of us.Ever the consummate perfectionist, Jackson seemed poised to embark on a grueling 50 performance tour that, undoubtedly, would have served as the comeback/swan song to end all comebacks/swan songs?! This miraculously edited work (From over 1,000 hours of footage), apparently the brainchild of director Kenny Ortega, provides us with a direct window into the elaborate creative process of a true performing genius. What a show it would have been! Jackson was putting together a tour experience that elevated itself to near art form/near perfection. What a profound shame that it was never to be! A stunningly awesome international ensemble of world-class dancers, singers, musicians, performers, and technicians were assembled by this Tour juggernaut, ALL of them seemingly worshiping the ground M.J. walked on. Was there any foreshadowing of the looming ominous event that caught us all by surprise? A few chips in M.J.'s armor? Frequently, he apologized to all present for "Holding back and not giving 100% in order to conserve energy and save his voice." But then again, most of the other performers were 1/2 his age! One thing is for certain: There will be no more Michael Jackson Tours, nor new Michael Jackson hits to add to his long and impressive list. They are his legacy to all of us and have forever become part of our cultural landscape. I recommend you experience THIS IS IT in a good home- theater for full impact...9* STARS*....ENJOY/DISFRUTELA! Any comments, questions or observations, in English or Espa?ol, are most welcome!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lack of commentary allows Jackson's talent to take center-stage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a way, Kenny Ortega's "Michael Jackson's This is It" is more interesting for what it ISN'T than for what it is. What it ISN'T is a documentary account of the life, career and death of Mr. Jackson, inevitably colored by the personal viewpoints and biases of its maker. In fact, but for the cruel hand of Fate, "This is It" shouldn't even exist as a movie at all. The behind-the-scenes footage of Jackson and his crew mounting their elaborate, effects-laden worldwide tour scheduled for summer 2009 - his first in over ten years - was initially intended only for Jackson's own personal library. Instead, that footage has become a moving elegy for the self-proclaimed King of Pop, who died tragically on June 25, 2009, at the unripe young age of 50. Wisely, there are no post-mortem interviews or commentary included in the film. The performers all speak of him in the present tense, excited at the prospect of being a part of what is clearly an experience of a lifetime for any musician, dancer or singer fortunate enough to be a part of the show. That their dreams never really came to fruition is what gives the film a depth and poignancy that goes beyond simply the loss of Jackson. Indeed, watching this film is a bit like experiencing how the gods must feel, looking down upon us mere mortals as we go about our daily lives secure in the na?ve belief that we will live forever, blithely unaware of what the future actually has in store for us. As to Jackson himself, he emerges as energetic and deeply engaged in the creative process, no more petulant or demanding than your average multi-talented, legendary superstar - one who actually had talent, by the way, celebrated for his songwriting and choreography as well as for his singing and dancing. And, of course, the music itself is irresistible and timeless.It's a bittersweet experience watching this film, not only because of what happened to Michael but because of all the time and energy displayed by these hardworking individuals that would eventually come to naught. The small compensation is the existence of this film that captures not just for us but for generations yet unborn the creative and performing genius of Michael that will endure through time.Who knows, but someday someone will make a warts-and-all biography of Michael Jackson that will attempt to knock the king off his throne. But "This is It" ain't that movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Living Proof the Great Michael Jackson Is Truly An Icon!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this film in theaters, I'd have to say Michael Jackson's back and better than ever! Back in 1990 when I was four years old, my parents introduced his music to me and after more than a decade of listening to his music and seeing many of his complex dance performances in several of his signature music videos, it makes this movie live up to my expectations."This Is It" was truly worth every penny of the movie ticket price. Since the entire movie is composed of a set of performances Michael would have shown at his sold-out concerts in London, there were also interviews with stage crew, choreographers, band members, and dancers that showed how much they appreciated working with the Man. Michael was pure genius when he blended his music, dance, and completely new video footage that he filmed along with the crew. After hearing of his tragic passing, I too was devastated by the horrible news. It was like losing a childhood friend, but now after watching this movie over and over again, it's living proof that he will always live on in his music and in our hearts.All I can say now is that the entire movie was impressive, awe-inspiring, and superb to the very end. Here was Michael not trying too hard or looking ill during rehearsal periods, he practically owned the stage and was willing to show his devoted fans that he is NOT a fad or a trend, but an ICON.Although there are some talented people that can memorize his songs and mirror his dances perfectly, his genius cannot be replicated. My hat's off to the King of Pop, you will always reign supreme!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Appropriate, Heartfelt Good-Bye To Not The Man We Didn't Know, But The Man We Forgot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When "This Is It" was released the Fall after Michael Jackson's death, it promoted to be the film to "Discover The Man You Never Knew". After watching the film, and seeing what would have been, it turns out to be more the man that people forgot existed.This is a very different look at Jackson than we've seen in a while. Gone are the media tabloid stories, the court cases, the allegations, the rumors, the scandals.... The film focuses on something that had long been forgotten under all of the press about Jackson's unusual and turbulent life: This is about the artist.Michael Jackson was in top form here. Singing, dancing, creative control.... Forget the "frail" allegations regarding his health, the man was truly in his prime, and moreso than any of us could hope to be when we reach 50 years old. The Jackson we see is funny, good-natured, patient, understanding, and above all, a consummate artist. A total professional and perfectionist in his work who knows what he wants, and works to get that performance out of every aspect of his crew, his performers and this show. He never loses his temper. He just reminds that this is why they have rehearsals.For "rehearsal" sessions, MJ sings and dances through his performances with a vigor that we haven't seen documented in years. While these are clips put together to make a coherent performance for the film, the only thing that really changes is the outfits Jackson wears through his performances. The editing is solid in this film, showing that no matter the number of practice sessions, he was "on" the whole time. For a man holding back, his stage presence remains mesmerizing, and perhaps even more invigorated than seen in the last decade.Throughout this film are clips of various short films that Jackson was known for instead of the standard music video. There are new updates on "Thriller", "Smooth Criminal", and "Earth Song" that show not only his love of film, but that he really was going out for this final show. Even the concept renderings of what would have been are amazing, and are edited in to flow well with the film's narrative.The film provides a glimpse at what could have been. The concert that will never be. And in seeing what Michael Jackson had in store for his final tour, it would have been very special indeed. It was a spectacle of music and visual wonders that will only ever be seen in this film, and would have been nothing short of a near-magical experience had it come to reality.I left the movie feeling sad for so many reasons. His untimely passing, of course, but also for all of the performers, musicians, and crew who clearly poured their hearts into this production. And for the mere fact that it took for the man to pass away for people to be reminded how talented and creative he truly was. There were a number of reasons that I left this film sad, in some ways unexplainable, but the show that could have been was most definitely an entertaining film with some truly classic music.A remarkable, energizing documentary, and a fond, fitting tribute to one of the greatest pop legends of our time. It's never sappy or heavy-handed, or even gives an inkling of the events in weeks to follow, but it's no less of a very real experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is one simple way of understanding whether one will enjoy This Is It or not, and that has to do with a caption that appears at the beginning of the film: "For the fans". Translation: Those who grew up with Michael Jackson's music, know his songs by heart and idolized him despite his bizarre antics and legal problems will love the movie; those who believe he was an overrated, disturbed artist will probably loathe it. Then there's a third category, to which I belong: people who enjoy listening to Jackson's music, without necessarily being die-hard fans. In that case, This Is It comes off as an interesting, but rather hollow experience.The story behind the picture is well-known: following Michael Jackson's tragic, unexpected death in June 2009, just before the first of a series of gigs that would mark his retirement, it was decided to make the rehearsal footage, filmed during the preparations for the first concert, known to the public, so that the late singer's admirers could get an idea of what could have been. The film begins with several young people auditioning to become dancers or background singers, and their tangible enthusiasm remains unaffected throughout, a feeling that is shared by Jackson once the real work begins.Watching the footage makes one thing absolutely clear: if Jackson had lived, it would have been a major event. Showing no signs of weakness whatsoever, he was both precise (he knew exactly what everyone should do and when) and playful (he is shown goofing around on the stage and joyously interacting with everybody), trying to make sure all the people involved were having a good time. Unfortunately, a lot of that passion and energy fails to get through the screen, mostly because of the center-stage presence granted to the project's director, Kenny Ortega (of High School Musical fame), whose constant attempts to please his star get annoying rather quickly.On the flip-side, it's intriguing to see all the special stuff the team was preparing for the event: new filmed material to go with certain songs (including new footage shot for Thriller), devices that would allow the stage to "transform" as the show went on, smoke, special effects, you name it. Additionally, even casual listeners are likely to be thrilled when Jackson performs live versions of everyone's favorites. This Is It was, in his mind at least, a true labor of love. The resulting film, however, does occasionally have "cash-in" written on it. It's an interesting look at a lost opportunity, but it's more of a curiosity, rather than a proper, affectionate tribute. You know, for the fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He was it and it is very sad that the media contributed so heavily to his death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm literally in the process of watching the end credits role as "This Is It" plays softly in the background. I feel a great sadness in my heart and a tremendous feeling of loss because Michael Jackson (The King of Pop) is no longer with us.It's too bad that people didn't support him or show him the love that they so openly displayed upon learning that he had died and permanently left us! Unfortunately most people, including big name celebrities, were more worried about what others thought when they supported Michael instead of being concerned with doing the right thing which would have been to show him the love and the support that he deserved as a human being. Unfortunately, I still find that all too often when the subject of Michael Jackson comes up I hear people saying that he got what he deserved and they're glad that he's gone. Those words are difficult to hear because while I was not a Michael Jackson fanatic, I definitely was a fan and admirer of his and the rest of the Jacksons as I grew up listening to their music.I also was inspired by his passion for music and his drive for life. Michael was one of those unique individuals with a very rare spirit that will never be duplicated or experienced again in the same phenomenal way that Michael was able to share his talent with the world. And yet, in spite of all of the evil, hatred, and disdain that many people had for him, including the media and Martin Bashir, he continued to live as best he could without hating or attempting to get revenge on those who destroyed him."This Is It" provides a very authentic and candid look into the gentle spirit and the gentle persona that was Michael Jackson. It's lovely to watch video of Mr. Jackson as he wholeheartedly did what he loved best during dress rehearsals. His musical prowess and his veteran performance ability comes across very naturally and unrehearsed during many portions of the video footage in "This Is It." And like everyone else, one of my primary thoughts while watching the video was that I only wished someone would have been there that Michael could have talked to and confided in, so that would have prevented him from coping with his stress through drugs and subsequently dying long before his natural time on Earth was up.I can't even imagine what struggles he must have gone through while he was constantly hounded and sought after by the paparazzi and other media figures that were only interested in him for the financial gains that he could provide them. However, I'm very thankful that his spirit never hardened to the point that he became jaded about life and bitter about those who sought to destroy him.Instead, he continued to quietly create and to bloom as an entertainer in private until he was ready to give his fans the show of his life which would have been "This Is It" if he hadn't of died before he could complete that tour. I'll always be thankful that I was allowed to experience his musical genius and I will certainly miss him but I take comfort in knowing that at least he left us some footage of him performing so that we can enjoy him through video, whenever we begin to miss him to much. Rest in Peace Mr. Jackson! Your true fans love you and will always appreciate what you did for the world, and even if others will never acknowledge it...now you're in the presence of the Lord, who is ever-loving and forgiving. Goodbye Michael. We'll see you again some day in Heaven!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful. The human being comes back to the foreground</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I danced a million miles to his music. I drifted away from keeping up with him sometime right after Thriller. I still enjoyed the occasional hit from time to time. I felt for him and lamented the loss of the man, hidden behind layer after layer of fame, of surgery, of inexplicable behaviors.I was happy to tutor my 10-year-old son along in separating the gifted performer from the very (in my opinion) tortured man.All of which I say by way of setting up this: The film was a delightful and touching complete surprise. Like some of the other reviewers, I cried almost immediately. I don't know if it was gratitude over seeing the artist as a human being up close after so long, or thinking what a lovely final memory to present to the public, after years of on screen or front-page weirdness.Watching this gifted performer, this gentle man, I mourned the loss all over again.My boy could not contain himself during Billie Jean, and went down front, to one side, to dance along with him. Even so, I think that maybe at 62 I enjoyed the film at least 6.2 times as much as he did.If you ever enjoyed MJ's performances, but, like many of us, you had moved away from him for completely obvious and understandable reasons, I say : See this documentary. Watch a gifted performer doing the hard work with people at the top of their field all around him.Now even more than before, come to think of it, after seeing this, I ask, "With everyone tossing out 'We love you too Michael' so often, was there no one who would stand up to him and say 'Michael you cannot live like this'. Sad, very sad. It turned out to be literally true.Nonetheless, I cannot think of a kinder, more humanizing, more enjoyable (the music of course is great as is the dancing) last view of the man.Rest in peace, Michael. It is our family's prayer for you.</fullReview>

It's emotional to see him smile in content during the filming an knowing that he was alive just 5 months ago. The movie is humorous in parts where M.J makes comments during rehearsal. Wow,in addition, I was also amazed to see Michael Jackson, a 50 year old man, full of energy dancing away all his famous moves. It was also nice to hear M.J actually sing all his songs,there was no lip singing in all his rehearsal. I have to say, "This Is It" is a must see movie that will touch your heart and make you want to watch it over and over again !</fullReview>

He could due the same dance moves two weeks before he died that he could in 1983! Amazing! And he didn't mess up on a note in any of his songs. And this was just a rehearsal. I wanted to cry when I saw him do the Jackson 5 tribute. And this movie confirmed that MJ was a perfectionist.

		<fullReview>I went to see this with my 25 year old son - he is a Michael Jackson fan and I'm not particularly.But I did know all the songs in the show (even if I've never been able to hear the words clearly). And, on the basis of this film, it would have been a spectacular show which would have enthralled and entertained me all the way through. There is absolutely no doubt that Jackson was a prodigious talent, and these rehearsals give the lie to any speculation that he was unfit or burnt out: this film shows a consummate professional at the very top of his game performance-wise, and in complete charge of every element of what was to be presented to the audience.Being a film assembled from rehearsal footage, it follows that there is no audience, the performances presented are, by their very nature, not finalised, Jackson is often not in costume (although the dancers usually are), and the various production effects are shown in development rather than in performance.And, more than anything else, one is reminded that Jackson is no longer here: his absence is the very reason this film exists.It is a very worthwhile document and I suspect that time will enhance its entertainment value.I make no comment on Jackson's personal life: this film shows clearly how major a loss he is as a professional performer.</fullReview>

He was a genius, it's really amazing watching him doing what he did best, singing, dancing, ENTERTAINING.It's not a movie for MJ fans only, it's a movie that everyone will find fascinating and inspiring. While MJ fans will enjoy it more, non MJ fans will finally understand all the hype around Michael and will see the genius at his best. Just forget everything you have heard about him and go watch this movie. Forget for a moment that it's Michael we are talking about, it could as well be Mozart, you get the chance to look over a Master's shoulder here and you sure don't want to miss that. Watching Michael do his "job" is simply amazing, it's incredible how he can see even the smallest movements of his dancers while concentrating on his own steps.I can't describe my feelings right now. I feel happy, sad, amazed, angry at the same time, because when the movie is over you realize that this WAS it, that it's over indeed. He's gone and we are never going to experience what was going to be the greatest concert of all time."You owe it to yourselves and your loved ones to see this again and again.

		<fullReview>I am a fan of Michael Jackson but not a single-glove wearing, moonwalking, true believer who is blind to his darker side. I had feared that "This Is It" would be a tacky, saccharine mix of fluffy biography material about his troubled childhood, interviews with adoring, screaming fans, shots from his funeral, etc interspersed with the rehearsal footage. Instead, "This Is It" is a very simple presentation of the rehearsal performances of his most popular songs, with very minimal "background" material. It shows his raw talent and natural feel for putting on a great show - the man simply out-dances, out-sings, out-performs everyone else on stage, most of whom are half his age. The movie even allows itself to show a couple of his more "kooky" moments. I'm really grateful that the people who put this together used restraint and a soft touch and avoided what could have been a nauseating experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highty Cinematic musical from the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK so Jackson no longer is around but this film is being hyped as "the final goodbye...for the fans" which in all cases it really is.Michael Jackson's This is it (to give it the full title) is a film of what if's. What if Jackson had lived to complete the final 50 shows?How amazing would these shows have been? is this film a stunt to crawl back its money spent on the shows that did not happen? Jackson's fans can rejoice (and yes - I count myself one of those) This is it is a love letter to his fans. All the hits sound ever better on the big screen. Lovingly crafted around the on screen stage work - which at times is amazing - more so for the background visuals that would have been part of the live act.For something of these videos that was a work in progress - you will be craving (sadly) to see the real thing and it is sad to say that will never happen.The actual live singing seems to be stuck on the first half of the film. Jackson fans should pick out when Michael is singing live or singing to the backing tracks ripped from the singles - because I did. I am unsure if this is a naughty trick on the hands of the producers to trick viewers or just part of the act. However the singers and band are very good at duplicating the hits.What you can be sure of are some great moments. Jackson being chased into a 50's type film (with special cameos to look out for) smashing into "Smooth Criminal" or indeed the very good "I just can't stop loving you" duet.Although because of the footage the film stops sometimes between songs to Kenny Ortega directing the stage work - its good but as with the Smooth Criminal section it would have been nice to dive into from the 50's film footage with Jackson into the live act.Sadly at times Jackson does look thin - but his voice seems as good as it always was. "Human Nature" is sang just as good as it did over 25 years ago. (25 years!! wow) Kenny Ortega did a fantastic job here of putting together a movie which had its backlash from the start. The film is a guilty pleasure of someone who moved so many people and as it says on the tin - "This is it"</fullReview>

The amount of work that was put into the production of this was immense, the detail and quality of the music, dance moves and stage was amazing. Especially the female guitarist, absolutely amazing. If you're a Michael Jackson fan you will really enjoy this, if you are a fan of music I think you can appreciate this film. The music is amazing and you really get a first hand view of Michael rehearsing. When you watch this, you really understand how brilliant a singer,dancer and musician he really is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brass tacks, "This Is It" is a concert film, and I approached it just wanting to see Michael Jackson perform the big hits on stage. Also, the chance to see Orianthi shred Eddie Van Halen's 'Beat It' solo (I am a simple man).Having said that, I did really like the glimpse at rehearsals for a major league concert; the tremendous amount of work from all involved (support dancers especially) and Michael's perfectionism. The guy deserves immense credit for knowing his stuff and laboring to get it right. And when he gets going, the energy is infectious.His passing gives this an inescapable sense of finality (it's felt right from the beginning) and it's sad, really. He deserved to go out with a big tour. This at least gives us an idea what he had in mind.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Is It (2009):Dir: Kenny Ortega / Featuring: Michael Jackson, Kenny Ortega, Judith Hill, Orianthi Panagaris: In mid 2009 it was it for the pop sensation who has dazzled fans for four decades with the most unique style of performance. Michael Jackson was crowned "the King of pop" and despite controversy throughout his career, he still sustained a talent unequaled and often imitated. Director Kenny Ortega takes fans backstage for an intimate view of what was to be the comeback tour of Michael Jackson's career. We meet the awestruck dancers whose dreams are now reality. We witness the tremendous stage productions the accompany the various popular pop hits. Plus we meet Michael himself, humble, dazzling, and encouraging to the abilities of others. Highlights include a spectacular production of the hit song "Thriller", as well as a duet with Judith Hill on "I Just can't Stop Loving You." Guitarist Orianthi Panagaris does a solo within the song "Black or White." There are numerous songs featured although unfortunately not every great Jackson song made it. Perhaps more detail with the dancers and backup singers might have given it an even more personal touch, otherwise this is a well crafted visually appealing documentary. If anyone seeks a backstage view of concert tour preparation, or just wish for another glimpse at the man himself, this is it. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

Michael Jackson was unquestionably the biggest pop star of the late 20th century, and certainly one of the most popular recording artists of all time. In his prime, Jackson was an unstoppable juggernaut, possessed of all the tools to dominate the charts seemingly at will: an instantly identifiable voice, eye-popping dance moves, stunning musical versatility, and loads of sheer star power. His 1982 blockbuster Thriller became the biggest-selling album of all time (probably his best-known accomplishment), and he was the first black artist to find stardom on MTV, breaking down innumerable boundaries both for his race and for music video as an art form.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Proof that the magic never left...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not that I doubted that it had, for a second...Like many millions of others, of different generations, I grew up mesmerized by the phenomenon that is M.J. I was 5 or 6 years old when I saw a performance from the dangerous tour broadcast live on T.V. I remember being perplexed at as to why there were thousands upon thousands of people going absolutely crazy for a man stood solo on a stage, doing absolutely nothing but gazing into the crowd, frozen to the spot, for a good 4 minutes. I was hooked.Fast forward almost 17 years, after a long hiatus (understandably), Me and my mates were almost as excited as we were at the prospect of losing our virginities, M.J was back! and we would get to see him live in our country!Alas, it wasn't to be, instead we were 'treated' to this, a melancholy insight into what might have been. Thank god the cameras were rolling though, because without this film, we would have been left wondering whether Michael still 'had it', this footage shows he did.If you're expecting a performance reminiscent of his late 80's/early 90's heyday then you will be disappointed...the man was 50 years old, dependent upon painkillers and of ill health (as it would transpire, more serious than anyone thought.) but he still shows flashes of brilliance. One scene in particular where he allows his performing instinct to overcome his modesty, leaving dozens of much younger backing dancers and crew in awe, will give you chills. Or scenes where he takes command, showing the starstruck backing dancers how it's done, how he wants it to be. Although the dancing throughout most of it might be a little rigid and out of sorts (having said that, it's no secret that Mike only performs at half speed in rehearsals anyway), the voice never falters, not once.We are treated to an M.J acapella numerous times during this film, and it's all live and pitch perfect. I hope this isn't classed as a spoiler, because it hardly gives away any important plot points, but the duet he sings with a talented young female, 'I just cant stop loving you', shows that, vocally, he still stands way out above any other live performer, and he manages to have a little fun with it at the end of the song, it's just beautiful to watch, and to see the girls reaction to his improv. We see quite a bit of Kenny Ortega, who, while encouraging Michael and applauding his performances, seems a little emphatic, in the sense that he seems to think he's the one directing the whole thing and his voice can be heard throughout, barking orders and such. I don't know, maybe M.J felt like he needed some direction at this point, but he he seems to be swayed by most of Kenny's suggestions.Anyway, this footage is a must see for fans, it was filmed on the 23rd and 24th June 2009 (according to Jermaine's autobiography, AEG have said it was the two weeks prior to the 25th), His last few days of life. Enjoy, be bedazzled by the man who inspired your pathetic moonwalk attempt at your high school leavers ball, just one last time...</fullReview>

But still his gift and legacy lives on he was the true and real "King of Pop". And we still honor him for that today and everyday.

		<fullReview>It's the spring of 2009 and Michael Jackson is organizing a new concert. However on June 25th and 8 days from traveling to London to begin final dress rehearsals, he is found dead. The movie starts on April 15 with interviews with the dancers. It goes back to the dance auditions, the planning, the construction and most importantly Michael Jackson performing in rehearsals. What's missing is some in-depth interviews with Jackson. He's the only person that truly matters. It's nice to see the young dancers get emotional but it's Jackson that is historically important. Jackson does speak as he directs everybody. He is sharp and on the ball. His performances are always present. It is interesting that he's always in charge. It's basically behind-the-scene footage and it's good on those terms. This is for the fans and there are plenty fans around. The other missing element is post-Jackson. It would be compelling to have everybody's reaction to his death. Although I understand the idea of this as positive memory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An example of editing at its best and a movie you can enjoy even if you're not an MJ fanatic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Say what you will about Michael Jackson, but his final film, compiled from rehearsal footage taken during rehearsals for his comeback tour is a great documentary/concert film that will make you miss the man's musical genius. The film is arranged so that we go through all of the songs that would have been featured in the tour scheduled on July 13, 2009. We get to see Michael working on the choreography of the numbers, singing his most beloved songs (and a new one) and get a feel for what the final product would have been like if it hadn't been for his death on June 25th.The movie really gives you a feel for what the concert would have been like thanks to masterful editing. Different takes of Jackson performing songs during rehearsals are spliced together to focus on the songs, his moves on stage and the people in the background who would have enhanced the experience. Without a doubt this would have been a dynamite tour, with a bold visual style and impressive theatrics for every song. It really makes you sad that the whole thing never got put together because it really would have been an amazing show. I couldn't believe that Jackson was 43 years old at the time this movie was shot because he has so much energy and enthusiasm during the footage captured. I don't like to get involved in peoples' personal business, least of all celebrities who are often under a lot of pressure and it seems, to me at least, that people are just waiting for them to slip up even a little so they can tear down their idols and rip them to shreds. I didn't feel like I really knew anything about the "King of Pop" but after watching the movie, I felt like I did get to know him at least a bit. He comes off as a passionate but extremely gentle perfectionist and you have to respect an artist that puts all of his efforts into his work. When things don't go right Jackson seemed like an easy guy to work with, a professional that's excited to start his music career up again with a dynamite tour. The movie might be cut in a way that exaggerated this trait of his, that's kind of expected considering the film is a tribute but it felt genuine nonetheless. We also see some of the people that were excited or overwhelmed to be involved in the concert and that helps make the experience feel genuine. It gives you a hint of the hundreds of hours that were involved in a show that tragically never came to be.You might be surprised to hear this, but I am not a Michael Jackson fan. I know very little about him and most of the songs performed in the film I was hearing for the first time. I've heard people say that the film was made only to profit from Jackson's death but it didn't feel like that at all to me. What it feels like is a farewell to the fans with the best efforts being put together to give them a glimpse of what could have been seen if they had gone to the show. It's a testament to the legacy of a man that did fall from grace but was anxious to come back and please his followers. If he had been given this second chance who knows what the end results would have been?Even if you're not a fan of Michael Jackson and his music, this film is a terrific example of how to shoot a concert. The editing is nothing short of brilliant and if you're aspiring to have anything to do with the music industry, you could learn a lot from "This is It". I was really surprised and impressed at how good it looked and I did end up really loving it. (On DVD, May 10, 2014)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watching the Magic-In-Motion!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been 5 years since Michael Jackson passed away and 3 years since I first watched "This Is It"; I was still in "state of shock" and denial that MJ is gone - too soon. A second watch stroke me with an overwhelming feeling right when the feature film started; how "alive" is the king of pop! How can he be so "real" and time- transcendent! I felt so overwhelmed to see the King on stage - a master par excellence! The feature film inaugurates with a remarkable message: "For the fans..." and, as an MJ fan, it puts me right in the moment that I am going to watch a somewhat intimate filming and it was heartwarming."This Is It" is simply well edited, carefully piled together feature film to put the best of what Michael has poured into the rehearsals, to give back to the fans and the world. More, it is so easy to feel the heart of the director gathering these scattered shootings into an almost 2 hours adventure. It feels so much Love to the King of Pop and so much consideration to his fans. The quality of communication between Michael Jackson and K. Ortega gives a clear clue of what type of relationship the two have developed, for the love of art and giving to others.In my opinion, "This Is It" is to be watched many times, but as much as one would get easily captivated by the magical moves, voice, discussed technicalities by MJ, the movie is also a good opportunity to explore what it is like to work with a world icon, vis-a-vis the director, technicians, musicians, vocalists, dancers and everyone involved. It feasibly goes on exploring the songs along with dances and decoration; it pauses at times when a remark needs to be discussed, it repeats a given part, dance, musical key note, a played instrument, etc. All of these details have been kept in the movie to give fans a chance to re-live work-on-process, sculpture refining, magic in-motion. That is how "intimate" this feature film is and this is why it is worthy of several watching.Michael Jackson's rehearsing is beyond any expectations! His level of energy and "mental presence" are very unquestionable, yet, it puts the viewer in a position of confusion; how can this man with this level of energy and readiness of giving die so suddenly!? And the sad truth is there would be no logical answer, that maybe the consolation would come from watching "This Is It" as it is. With every song, MJ is pouring all of his heart and emotions - the man is not taking anything for granted. He simply lives in the moment of the song, feels it deeply, expresses it with a voice and a body language, pauses to change, edit or discuss a detail or two, rehearses and repeats to an "overkill" degree and leaves the audience, me in person, literally breathless! He was 50 years old, yet, nothing of what he does and how, would give you a clue of his biological age! He was simply young at heart and immortal in soul. Selfless, giving, friendly, humble, respectful, easy-going and loving are easily noticed when watching MJ with everyone around him. He believes a work is a team-effort and he doesn't miss a chance to show gratitude to those around him. He is fit for his title: the King.There is also a big focus on the effort that was made to re-film parts of some of the biggest hits to include in the live show, all under MJ's direct supervision. The man was just too much involved in the nuts and bolts of his show ? nothing of a surprise to his fans - the perfectionist.All in all, the general working atmosphere felt friendly, loving and space was allowed for any talent to explode, be it intellectual or physical. In MJ's rehearsals, there is a welcoming ground for anyone to be. Everyone would look at ease doing what he/she is supposed to do and the tension is left behind ? that's what I have felt while watching the entire movie.Then, hats off to K. Ortega. Not only did he manage to piece together the genius and artistry of Michael Jackson, but he also excelled to present the human-MJ, person, soul and heart to his fans and to those who knew little about him. Ortega generosity included short interviews of musicians, dancers and technicians ? their presence has been reserved for being key-players in the project.As the movie reaches its end, so the King's. A beautiful spiritual-like scene is captivated where every one is holding hands and Michael's words of gratitude come out ? the message conveyed was larger than the clock of his body ? it was as global as he is. RIP MJ, a true King that ever lived.</fullReview>

He has been called many things throughout his entire life, but the one the one name that suits him to the letter is THE KING OF POP - Michael Jackson is and will forever be a true legend and a person of great heart and honor. This movie happens to be a genius at work. With the help of the director who brought us all 3 High School Musical movies - Kenny Ortega, Michael gave us an inside backstage look of what would have been his greatest triumph to date. And then a week later, he was taken from us. This is not what should have happened. Michael should still be with us. But now, as we look into the future, we will see many rising up to the challenge to take what Michael taught us and we will rise to the occasion just like he did at the age of 4. He will live forever in our hearts and his music will live forever. Just 4 words sums this up ALL HAIL THE KING!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't expect to like this film as much as I did. There's been some criticism about turning the rehearsal footage into a film, but that's exactly what makes this film so different from anything else we've seen with or about Michael Jackson. What's most engaging about the film is being able to witness Jackson's creative process versus just seeing the final product, and observing how he worked behind the scenes and how he thought, managed and directed his artists and technicians.While I enjoyed Michael Jackson's work off &amp; on over the years, all the negative press, media frenzy and over-exposure made me lose interest over time. Watching this film obscured the negative for me. Jackson's creative genius, intelligence, humor, depth, dedication, kindness and charisma made him incomparable as an artist. We see an artist who is mature, wise, self-aware, capable, mindful, kind and respectful to everyone around him. Yes, it's irrefutable that Jackson was eccentric and childlike, but he seems neither weird nor wacky here. There have been many brilliant people throughout history who were viewed as "weird" by their contemporaries because they were unusual and different from the pack or purely interested in-- and focused on-- what inspired them. Jackson also appears quite strong and lucid in all the footage and seems completely inspired &amp; energetic. The film also does a great job of showing how much heart, integrity and care went into this tour by everyone involved. How lucky were all those who got to watch the magic up-close, and how lucky his fans are that all this was actually captured on film so thoroughly. The dancers are incredible and the dance routines and sets breathtaking. The concert would have been amazing. But for me, being able to glimpse this magical artist behind the scenes was the real gift.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Michael Jackson died, he left behind him numerous debts and the whole cost of a planned and prepared-for tour. So the obvious thing would be for the bean counters to hash together some rehearsal footage of Jackson performing behind the scenes, call it a film, and rush it out to cinemas shortly after the superstar's death in order to cash in on the media furore surrounding his death.The result is disappointing to those of us who are fans of genuine documentary films that are assembled, edited and directed with care and attention. This is a mish-mash of stuff that just about gets by generated on the goodwill accrued by Jackson. I consider myself a fan of the musician, and I admit there's a certain thrill from watching him going through all of the old classics one more time. So, as a film this is hopeless, but fans will lap it up anyway for the chance to see the final footage of the man before his untimely death.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a Michael Jackson fan. I never was, even though I grew up during the 80s - his heyday. But I do recognize his songs and I even like more than a few of them. But for me, the genius of his music was overshadowed by his bizarre (and allegedly - never proved in court - disgusting/disturbing) private life.I put all that aside and watched this film. And it is a very insightful look at the creative process and musical genius that was a big part of Michael Jackson's life. His dance moves are still unbelievably smooth, as if he's not really human. I had to keep reminding myself that he was around 50 years of age when this was shot. If only I could be so agile and nimble at that age! His voice was pretty good for most of the songs with very few exceptions.You can see him enjoying himself, performing without a care in the world on the big stage and giving his input into every aspect of the production. He was no boy-band mass-hyped, over-produced musical product. Michael Jackson had an integral part in the song writing, the music production, the choreography, the story, the lighting.It's actually a shame that the concert never saw the light of day. All we have is a eulogy in film form to what probably could have been the greatest live spectacle of all time, produced by perhaps the greatest entertainer of all time.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A concert event that sadly never came through</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Jackson promised his fans a concert in London entitled "This Is It." He would have kept his promise, we all knew he wouldn't have broke if he didn't die on June 25th 2009 (my birthday.) This heartwarming, extraordinary documentary showing how Jackson prepared for his tours. Through sweat, tears, and very mild frustration, dancing his heart out and completely giving us all. Not just a half put together movie, not a grieving documentary. A truly amazing movie showing us everything Jackson would have wanted us to see.The rehearsals seen in this film were from April - June 2009. The film has crystal clear picture and sound. As well as being beautifully shot.Michael Jackson completely ignores all the media's rumors and false accusations he is being accused of and like I said gives it his all. What keeps him going people wonder? The fans of course. Without the fans, Jackson would not have gotten anywhere and most definitely wouldn't be called "King of Pop." Jackson performs various songs throughout the movie. Along with some of the most well designed and most brilliant dancing I have ever seen. Songs and dances to Beat It, Bad, Billie Jean, Smooth Criminal, Black or White, This Is It, They Don't Care About Us, and various other hits make up "This Is It." Plus a 3D set up of Thriller, obviously one of Jackson's biggest hits.Jackson is one of the few who always spoke softly. Never raising his voice, stressing out, or blaming little mistakes on his co-workers/helpers when one big mistake happened. He always remained calm and did his very best work.The ending of the movie really puts you down because you know all of MJ's choreographers, dancers, and all the special effect designers were put out of a job and were in shock and dismay on June 25th. After the hard work spent on the set designs, the commitment to finding the dancers and the right people for the job, and lets not forget the countless hours spent working on the rehearsals for each song.Michael Jackson is a truly amazing singer, the shocking thing is I didn't know it till this movie. A legend, an amazing singer, and a great father to his kids. He may have been a little weird or somewhat of a "freak" (I can relate). But he formed the Pop genre and completely transformed the music industry all by saying "Beat It", "Bad", to notice the "Man in the Mirror", or saying there's no difference between "Black or White", and by wrapping up his effervescent life by saying "This Is It." Starring: Michael Jackson. Directed by: Kenny Ortega.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific Music Documentary. Way cool.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>wow. this was just a blast. Kenny Ortega has delivered a really good music documentary. i'm a little surprised this wasn't nominated in the category of best documentary. it was really well put together and featured some powerful musical footage of MJ before he departed this realm.in fact the footage of MJ is so powerful that it's a true testament that his concert come back would have been tremendous. whatever you might think of MJ's eccentricities, he still has got it at age 50.in fact MJ's talents were never properly explored. one of the reasons that MJ had such a deep rooted disgust for Steven Spielberg is because there were plans to make a rock musical opera of Peter Pan that was supposed to star Michael as Peter pan. that rock opera would have been incredible. i couldn't imagine a better Peter Pan then Michael. he would have been brilliant. unfortunately Spielberg wouldn't share creative control with Michael and Spielberg very spitefully blocked the project and went ahead with another concept which was the disastrously stupid 'Hook'. the rock opera with Michael would have been a instant classic. 'Hook' was a cinematic shame.i also found Michael's comments on the Amazon rain forest and the irreversible damage we are doing to the environment, to be direct, well spoken and timely and deep. he was very sincere and right on the mark. you go Michael.but screw Spielberg in his "E.T." hole. and basically Michael's detractors will be proved wrong about Michael's "supposed" downfall. Michael WILL be remembered and will go down in pop history. some may think MJ is out of the "big" picture, but hey, time is on Michael's side. whatcha wanna bet i'm right. and let's face it. most celebrities since Greta Garbo have been eccentrics. why call Michael out on that one. to single Michael out like that was a classic example of racism in America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing, Enjoyed Every Second</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is, of course, for Michael Jackson fans so I find it hard to believe any true fan wouldn't thoroughly enjoy this film. However, I have also watched it alongside others who aren't the huge fans that I am and they still can't deny that the film blows them away and leaves them feeling inspired. It provides great insight to the real Michael Jackson... generous, funny, musical genius, etc. I own the DVD and have watched it 20+ times. Unlike other films, I enjoy it more each time I watch it. Even though it is only footage of rehearsal, it is truly magnificent to watch and each time I am left with a sense of sadness as it would have been beyond incredible to see the final product. May he rest in peace and may we be grateful we were able to see the genius of his work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thumbs up from a non MJ fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a lot of reviews here from Michael Jackson fans, but I figured I'd offer a different viewpoint--from someone who's not a fan, even somewhat cynical toward the MJ phenomenon in general.I thought I would hate it, twice declined buying the DVD even though it was only $4 (go to your local Blockbuster used pile. There's still a ton left) before finally deciding heck with it, I'll give it a shot.I was blown away.Let me say up front I'm more a fan of classic rock leaning toward the heavy side (Sabbath, Zeppelin, etc) and although I grew up right in the middle of MJ's popularity explosion, I never crossed over.This movie caught me immediately because it doesn't take the "Michael Jackson is the best thing ever" attitude that I had feared, but instead it's a somewhat humble approach which focuses not entirely on MJ but instead on the people he affected. In the first 5 minutes we get some pretty moving testimonials from dancers &amp; performers whose lives were changed (saved?) by Michael's music. And with that in mind, even if you aren't a fan of his music yourself, you have to respect the fact that his music connected with so many people in such a powerful &amp; positive way.From there we start to see the rehearsals and behind-the-scenes stuff regarding the ill-fated "This Is It Tour". It left no doubt in my mind that this truly would have been the greatest concert production ever seen on planet earth. Yeah, watching lasers &amp; giant inflatable pigs at a Pink Floyd concert is one thing, but MJ's This Is It Tour was set to have 60-ft-tall, panoramic, IMAX-type video screens, giant transformer robots, bulldozers, human cannonballs launching from under the stage, the world's best (and hottest) dancers, and not to mention the singing, dancing &amp; moonwalking of one of the greatest pop stars in history. PT Barnum eat your heart out.The movie also features several videos that were to be shown at the live show, and these were also quite a treat. Interspersed with Michael's own comments on what he had hoped to accomplish, it takes on a bittersweet, tragic-yet-inspiring vibe, particularly when you realize how socially &amp; environmentally conscious Michael was. Though the film didn't dwell on it, we can see that he was a person tortured by the problems of humankind and doing everything in his power to fix it, by inspiring people in a positive way. And that's when I realized that, yes, all of his songs carried powerful, world-shaping messages beneath those slick dance moves.The performances are captivating, the musicianship (from both Michael &amp; his band) is meticulous &amp; passionate, and I found myself suddenly liking the music which I had ignored for 20 years. One song almost had me in tears, and let me tell you I don't cry easy (I thought Platoon was a comedy).I think every human being owes it to himself/herself to check out this video to be reminded that even bizarre, eccentric pop stars serve a purpose in this world. And who better to learn from than the most successful one that ever lived? Despite the tragedy of MJ's life, this is one of the most inspiring musical documentaries I've ever seen. Even if you're not a MJ fan, I guarantee you'll become one for at least 2 hours as you watch this film. Rock on \m/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't usually comment often here at IMDb, but as before, i felt a desire to share what i felt when it really deserves it. First of all, i was never a huge fan of Michael Jackson, sure, i loved a few of his hits, i even danced like crazy a few of them, but the true point here is, that this is not a music videos compilation of him, neither the story of his life, sadly, the show didn't go on, i'm pretty sure i would pay to see it live. This piece of art allowed me to see and to know a really different Michael from what you are injected from TV and news about him, his relationship with everyone involved with the rehearsal, a great director, the musicians, it was just overwhelming, his commitment to the show, to the acting, so everything goes the way that he feels that people watching deserve to see and enjoy... just superb. It's a true chance for everyone to see how things are done, the work it takes to make it happen, and a little smell of the final work. Michael is to be respected as one of the performers i feel that respected his fans the most, and gave them the best. 10 out of 10 Rest in Peace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>jusco's review: Michael Jackson's This Is It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was relaxing in a hotel right in the heart of New York's Times Square the very day Michael Jackson died on June 25, 2009. Needless to say, I was shocked. And I was not the only one: the entire Times Square was stunned. It all happened so suddenly, so abruptly. The King of Pop was dead. I can't say I'm a MJ fanatic, but I was definitely a huge fan. He easily gets a place in my top 3 vocalists of all time. It saddened me to see one of the music greats leave the scene forever.But I'm relieved to know his legacy will continue, be it through his albums or this documentary, This Is It. I was aware of the film when it came out but just never had the chance to watch it, but I'm glad I finally did. It's a brilliant look into the mind of a genius. Before he died, he was preparing for a series of concerts to be held in London, and this behind-the-scenes takes a look at his rehearsals.The first thing that popped into my mind when I watched it was obviously the natural talent that flowed out of MJ. The MJ that this film portrays does not look sick, nor does he look like he was on the verge of dying. This MJ was filled with energy, with vibe, with the passion for his music, for his dancing and the desire to entertain his dedicated fans. Fans of his music will watch the entire film with their jaws dropping; how does he manage to consistently produce that beautiful voice we fell in love with in the first place? And I am no dancer, but it doesn't take a genius to realise just how revolutionary his dancing was. His naturally flowing motions made me wonder if he was really 50 at the time.The other thing that struck me was the intensity of the rehearsals. It is by far no easy task to prepare perfectly for what may have been the most anticipated series of concerts in years. Yet I don't see that disheartening MJ. In fact, it almost seems like he enjoys the pressure, forcing him to step up his game and produce something that exceeds the formidable expectations of his fans.On the downside, the last half an hour or so got a bit draggy, but it's to be expected since it's a film that fuels itself solely on MJ's music. I've heard that many MJ extremists criticised the film for feeding off MJ's death with the sole intention of making a handsome profit. I'd disagree. I think it's a present to the world, a window with a great view to see the genius in action. It was a bit weird though to see him act very childlike at certain moments. Just another part of the mystery that is MJ.For fans of MJ's music, it's a must-watch, but for those who don't like his music, then don't bother. There's not much other than MJ's music and dancing; bits and pieces of the background dancers and musicians which I found interesting, but not enough to single-handedly lift the film. For those who have never listened to his music, or for those who haven't quite formulated an opinion about MJ, give it a shot. You might just come to love the man and his music, dancing and passion.Personal Highlights: Near the beginning of the film, MJ sings a stripped-down version of Human Nature, my personal favourite of his songs. You can feel the raw emotion behind it and it's one of his best performances in the entire film. Also keep an eye out for Orianthi, the female guitarist with the magic fingers and easily one of the current great guitarists. It's good to know she's garnering more attention for her talent after this film was released.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MJ Thank you!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the time when I think of Michael Jackson, more than the man or the music I think about me. MJ like many other things a part of life, growing up, learning things and most of all experience. I can remember the days I used to put on the good old head phones and listen to the 2 channel dull, bass poor record quality music over a cheap Walkman. And when life improved the quality of the music I listen improved as well. It went from Walkman to a set up and then 2 channels to 6 channels and more. Tape to digital and i-pod to i-touch and online streaming. Whichever the method or the equipment the music was listened, stored or viewed one thing was certain. Michael Jacksons music was there. He was so amazing and inspirational that there was no way that I would missed his music changing from platform to platform or bouncing through hardships of life. MJ was that brilliant. He was 'Off the wall'But one day everything known about the man has become "History". Creating an immense void everything went blank. A "bad" news which came earlier than expected. From his death onwards he was un doubly became more famous than fading away. "This is it" is not a movie. Or it's not just a backstage footage of the greatest musical show to be staged on the planet. It is 111 minutes of pure sensational music and character beyond legend. I do not like people calling him a legend. Not because of anything else but because legends are not unique. There are many. But when it comes to MJ there was one. One king, One man, One entertainer that world has seeing only once. So he was more than a legend and ultimately proved that more than a human by his character. If you love the man you will love "This is it". It's a pure musical journey towards the final hardships MJ went through trying to bring the show to light. Immense team effort and personal dedication by the leading MJ "This is it" should have being a once in a life time experience for any one. But the world was unfortunate to see it in its full glory. Just as the start the show came to an end unexpectedly. But I'm glad that I was fortunate to see MJ performing even in rehearsals and how glorious he was in his own way. A must watch for all MJ fans. You will be blown away by his politeness and attitude. Michael? Thank you for the music, Thank you for the joy you bought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice final MJ reminder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that although I call myself a huge MJ fan I hadn't bought a ticket to his concert. Having already seen him perform at Wembley Stadium back in 1996 I figured that I had seen as good at I was going to see live. I was wrong. This film gives us front row seats to the rehearsal stage of the shows and lets us in to see him as a director and performer.We don't see the show to its full potential which is a great shame because the dancers, the singers, the sets, the band, the films inserts are all are worthy of applause and standing ovations - something you don't get in a cinema (someone did try and get a clap going at the end but it didn't quite catch on). Jackson's dancing is amazing as ever ? not quite as energetic as the younger dancers on stage with him, but then what do you expect ? the man was in his 50's, and he can show them a thing or two as they look on in awe as he dances to Billie Jean. Jackson is hands on and isn't afraid to say just how he wants something done and its 'all with love'. He settles for no less than perfection and it's important it be perfect for his fans and indeed for the performers who he strives to get the best out of. All my favourites were there including: The way you make me feel, I just can't stop loving you, Human Nature and even some of the old Jackson 5 hits that made him famous such as The Love you Save and I want you back.He's not shown in conversation a lot but when he is we can see his professionalism and passion but we also see his humour in what he does with some very bizarre dance moves and in how he would choose to sing a certain line of a song.What I disliked: The cringey comments from the singers and dancers at the start Kenny Ortega butt kissing Michael throughout.What I loved: The Thriller and Smooth Criminal film inserts. Michael's Billie Jean performanceIf you'd bought concert tickets or even if you hadn't, this is a must see. By no means anywhere near as good as what the live show would have been but it's a fitting tribute and a testament to the hard work that was put into the show and a nice memory to be going on with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The final curtain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obviously this feature pretty much has the appearance of a DVD add-on extra item, but of course got elevated to feature status by Michael Jackson's untimely death just over a year ago. The only time I saw Jackson live was in the late 1980's at Glasgow Green Showground and whilst the show was a technical marvel, it lacked heart and conviction. Trying to imagine this show in its full glory, I get the impression that the punishingly scheduled 50 "This Is It" shows set for London would have come off similarly making it ironic that it takes backstage footage to get us closer to the man behind the fireworks.It's incredible to think that he was 50 and still capable of some remarkable dancing - you'll notice too that none of his vocals were lip-synched either and certainly some of the planned visuals would almost certainly have boggled the mind and dazzled the eye, like the army of millions for "They Don't Really Care About Us", the graveyard recreation for "Thriller" and especially the NYC skyline for "The Way You Make Me Feel". The set-list seems pretty well selected, although I always hated the way MJ cheapened the greatness of his early J5 smashes by running them together into a slick medley, as here too. I wouldn't have cared either for the insipid ballad "I Just Can't Stop Loving You" (especially with extended extemporisation) or the over-the-top ecology rant "The Earth Song" and can't believe he would omit "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough", but you can't please everyone. No new material either which is always a regressive step. I could also have done without the sycophantic remarks of his support dancers which presage the action.What you do get though is an artist belying his media image, looking in fine shape and voice, still able to cut the mustard at least as a live act. Shame on the promoters who signed him up to this unremitting schedule and who knows perhaps unwittingly hastened his early death. We'll never know if this was to be a last hurrah or the start of an artistic renaissance, enough that we can see from this footage that it would at least have been the former.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched about half of it and could stand it no more. I can still remember when Thriller came out... I was out and the entire bar just stopped and the volume on the TV went up and we are all and I mean ALL in awe!! It was an absolute shame how his life ended. The man was just talented! I would not say genius but that's just me. Personally I think music is just music and a ton of people with just as much talent are out there and I can't say genius because that word means so much more than this. I do things that no one has ever done but I certainly hope I'm not considered a genius for it! The film was good, entertaining but as another reviewer said there was NO ONE that would say no to him.. to afraid I guess. It's a shame so many people helped him to become what he finally ended up being. There were many before him and they'll be many after him. I loved the Jackson 5 but as MJ's albums came out the more I went away from him. To strange for me.God Bless the man... he is, at least, at peace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply put, Michael Jackson's last performance had me spellbound. This Is It shows how one of the greatest entertainers of all time prepared for his biggest concert. No big overblown production and no audience (aside from his fans, the dancers and musicians). All of the music and vocals are live, not prerecorded. Meant for his private archives, this footage shows the viewer what the man was really like, not how the media portrays him at all. Words can't describe It. You just have to see it for yourself. You will be surprised. Here is something a lot of people didn't know: Michael Jackson loved nature, flowers, trees, animals, ..the planet we live on. I believe, had he lived, he would have made more people aware of what is really wrong with the world, and who's behind it! Sad, but just like John Lennon, he was a man who recently started to speak out about "man's mismanagement of the planet", ..and then he was taken out. "It starts with us...it's us! Or else it will never be done." Yes, I miss Michael Jackson very much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THIS IS IT is now all there is. Watching this film in the DVD format in the home strikes many chords for almost every viewer. Michael Jackson's life was made far too public and this brief recording of the preparations for his final tour sets much straight about why he was such a remarkable talent. It allows us to forget all the raucous press that hounded him during his life and simply watch Michael Jackson doing what he did best - perform. Some of his gifts can be listed. Creative body language that permanently influenced dance movements both popular and classical. Articulation of his sensitivity to even the minor details of his performances. Total involvement in whatever he performed. His genuine kindness in dealing with both his troupe of musicians and dancers as well as his producers/stagehands/publicists. A mind that could push the edges of entertainment like few others. A seemingly indefatigable energy level while rehearsing. A genuine love for his audience and yes, for life. One could wish that the DVD showed the completed THIS IS IT show as there couldn't have been more than one more day of rehearsals before is tragic death. But maybe that will come later. What this DVD preserves is the quality of uniqueness that was Michael Jackson. Grady Harp</fullReview>

Yes I miss Michael Jackson ? for the man he tried hard to be, even if ultimately he fell short of that ideal.

		<fullReview>Rating of This Is It is 8.6/10Watching this movie months after it came out still appealed to me even after all of the hype and drama has calmed down. It was an awesome experience watching this movie. Coming from a young teenager I was not around during his "prime years" and was a fan but not a huge fan of MJ. This movie makes me want him still to be here and to still have those concerts that i would really like to attend.The movie is a documentary style film on the King of Pop that is inspirational, eye opening and an overall great experience. There was no in film interviews that slowed down the movie nor was there any background information on his life, family and personal life. It was solely on his concerts, his love for everyone and his passion for music. I really enjoyed this film coming from a guy who watched it with his mother and girlfriend I now want to listen to more of his music and learn as much as i can on such an influential man of our music history. He is as famous as Elvis and ironically actually at one time married Elvis's daughter. Overall, i recommend this movie to fans and non fans who gets to have an inside look on what would have been one of the greatest 50 concert series ever! See this movie!</fullReview>

It was good to see him performing his songs that were hits but I'd like to have seen him perform some off his earlier songs like Don't Stop Till You Get Enough, Rock With You, She's Out Of My Life.

We see him sing and dance many songs along with the special effects that contributed so much to the dynamic show. The film itself is more home movie than documentary; comments from the show staff come later in the extras.I hadn't followed Jackson's life for years and assumed he was past his prime, but this film completely changed my opinion. I was mesmerized by his energy and stamina, his gracefulness and power, and his absolute knowledge of what was right for the show. He looked to be in the best shape of his life and happy to be mounting his last tour. Fans of Michael Jackson will certainly enjoy this last monument to his considerable talent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is it was something I anxiously wanted to see in theaters, but unfortunately, never ended up getting the chance to do. I thought the dancers were just fabulous, and some of the filming sequences for the songs he was gonna do, were absolutely out of this world to be honest. Michael Jackson was a Pop Icon beloved by many, and resented by quite a few, for the allegations of the infamous incident, which I won't speak of here, but you truly can't deny the impact he made in music, and while it wasn't the ultimate send off, I was pleased for the most part. My favorite had to be "The Way You Make Me Feel" Bit, the set pieces they were working on their, was really quite incredible. The only thing that truly saddens me is he died before the product was finished, and we never got to see any of the concerts.Bottom line. This really was it for Michael. His death saddened millions, and completely shook up the music industry. There will never, ever be another Michael Jackson, and this is a fitting tribute I must say.

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Hard to believe that just a year ago today, Michael Jackson was still alive, albeit far from the huge star he was in his heyday. With all the press and media coverage since then, you would have to have been on Planet Mars not to have known about his untimely passing in March last year. It was a passing on a par with that of Princess Diana, Elvis Presley and John Lennon, in the amount of press coverage it received. These things do come so out of the blue, but that is the way life is. And now all we can know about his last days is this feature film of behind the scenes footage as he planned for his huge concert at London's O2 arena, a rare glimpse into his private personality produced with the full consent of his estate.It would seem Jackson was a Charlie Chaplin style perfectionist, seemingly wanting to get every last little detail to his idea of the perfect show to a tee, from the keyboard tuning to the cueman signalling at the right moment, though never losing his temper or behaving in a primma donnerish manner, and always demonstrating a love and affection for his dancers and crew, such as at the end where he gets them to all gather round for a group blessing.The songs he was going to perform are all brought to life on stage, most notably one of his lesser known ones, Jam, which is mesmerizing in both the sound and visual production. The Way You Make Me Feel opens with a slower, more bluesey beat, before blasting into full tempo. Thriller is predictably lavish and extravagant, with the monster make up and costumes. Jackson wouldn't seem to have been a quality over quantity sort of guy, but there's no denying his stage shows were something to behold, even if they did over whelm you.Kenny Ortega has produced a personal film of a close friend of his, that is none exploitative and gives a unique insight into Jackson's final planned show and a little bit of the man himself that is all we will get now. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad But Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's sad to see the man Michael disfigured himself into. His face looks like he's 70 and his body looks thin and exhausted. Still, he is a performer and his magic fills the screen. I loved the back up dancers and how they contrasted the master with their moves. Mike's moves were dynamic yet careful. Careful as if he was holding back until the real lights came up, yet the dancers were like juvenile gazelles running through the forest. It was great to see Mike hand picking them from hundreds of contenders. I could see the age and wear on him as well how he basically moved his feet while the others were leaping a soaring all over the stage. His voice was great even though he was trying to rest it. I was glad to see him in this non guarded atmosphere and the reverence the young dancers gave him. There was no pity, only awe. I know the film didn't mention anything about his death and this was appropriate. It does make you wonder,"What If!". What if he didn't die. His dark glasses hid the only part of his face he could not change. I liked the movie because it was the last chance to see the man in a way many of us never got to. The irony of the whole project is that he had such a strong conviction about saving the earth when he was destroying his own temple. Listening to him tweak the music and everything else is proof of his genius. He got it. He knew what the audience came to see. His Peter Pan like endeavor to help folks escape from their cares is synonymous with the movies of the 40's during WW2. My heart goes out to all of the young performers who thought this was going to be great adventure for them when the death of one man crushed their dreams. I think every Jackson fan should watch this. They deserve this personal touch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fitting Tribute to the Gloved One as a Master Orchestrator</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though it represents the name of the concert tour, the film's title is a bit of a misnomer because it's more accurate to say this could have been it. Nine months after his death, Michael Jackson is unlikely to move anywhere close to obscurity soon. As the first post-mortem tribute to his legacy, this 2009 documentary, filmed at the Staples Center in LA and directed by choreographer Kenny Ortega ("Dirty Dancing"), is testament to an idiosyncratic talent driven by an even more amazing level of dedication made up of equal parts anxiety and intuition. In fact, it is his perfectionism that will remain in your memory more than the quality of his performance here, which was never meant to be in a commercial film. For the most part, he sings half-heartedly in order to save his voice for the real shows, but what we do see is Jackson as the master orchestrator of the concert experience.Throughout the 112-minute running time, Jackson never looks like he's taking any aspect of his performance for granted. Rather, he becomes a rather human presence who knows when the music is off a beat or when a dance move is not quite right. A particularly insightful scene occurs when he stands over the keyboard of the show's musical director and tries to coax a specific note out of him. If Barbra Streisand said "I just want to hear it the way I wrote it", she would have been accused of diva behavior, but Jackson manages to say it without malice in a way that shows how little it takes for him to make such a demand. There is no doubt who is in charge of the concert, and Ortega often seems to kowtow to Jackson like a personal assistant until the performer's enjoyment on a cherry-picker brings out the watchful parent in the director.Judging from Jackson's clothing, the footage appears to capture him on three separate occasions during the rehearsals, and you can see him rethinking each familiar song with something new like a proposed fiery ending to "Beat It" a la Jimi Hendrix. Even though some of his performances are ragged, even unpolished, there are key highlights to savor such as Jackson's a capella version of "Human Nature", a genuinely edgy take on "Black or White" complete with a sharp guitar solo from Orianthi Panagaris, and the film noir treatment of "Smooth Criminal" with his fedora-wearing character melding into archival footage of Rita Hayworth ("Gilda") and Humphrey Bogart ("The Big Sleep"). In fact, several of the numbers come with mini-movies like a Tim Burton-influenced take on "Thriller" and a bucolic fantasyland for "Earth Song". Interview snippets featuring musicians, singers, choreographers and costume designers are interspersed throughout.In the end, the film feels like an elaborate home movie of a worshipped performer who refuses to rest on his laurels and instead wants to show his relevance for the next generation. Although painfully thin and with an overly reconstructed face, Jackson doesn't give any indication of his pending death in the footage, and I'm sure that was quite deliberate given his family had approval of the final cut. It's worth seeing for what could have been quite a sensational concert comeback. The 2010 DVD contains six featurettes that focus on various aspects of the production; showcase two of the mini-movies in their entirety, "Thriller" and "Smooth Criminal"; and present a post-mortem tribute from those who worked with him in those final weeks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"This is It" shows Michael Jackson in rehearsal for his final concert tour, 50 performances that never happened.This is so much more than a DVD of Michael Jackson in concert. It shows a complete artist and perfectionist, full of energy, in total control of all aspects of the production. From the pieces that are shown, it was to be a magnificent production, full of amazing special effects, 3-D, and Michael inserted into film clips so that he's shooting it out with Humphrey Bogart and watching Rita Hayworth sing "Put the Blame on Mame." Watching it, I was so full of sadness. I was not a rabid Michael Jackson fan. I loved his music when I heard it, but he could have been performing across the street from me, and I doubt I would have gone. To watch this and realize that days later, this man would be dead is just gut-wrenching. On stage, he was so full of life, his voice like velvet, his dance moves exciting, his directions clear. Off-stage, his life was full of emotional pain, drugs, scandal, and probably a lot of emptiness. Like Elvis, he felt trapped by the kind of icon status very few people attain in this world.This documentary shows Jackson's creative spirit and the originality that made him great. It's a pity that once the spotlight was off, his life was so full of turmoil and sleeplessness. Behind the footlights, he was a man of great talent, vision, and life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bought the DVD. I just keep watching it over and over. I love the music. I love the dancing. I find MJ riveting. I never was a fan of his before he died, but now I'm hooked.This was the concert that was going to redefine what the word "concert" means. The special effects planned, the costumes and the various dance performances are nothing short of astounding. The music is hypnotic, perfect.The eccentric, first truly multimedia composer, greatest fine arts genius since Mozart -- at work, surrounded by the world's greatest dancers. What a privilege to be able to see this! How frustrating that the concert never took place! I still cry frequently over the loss of this wonder of our times.I hope we can all get together to make his song, "Heal the World," the official international anthem of the United Nations. The world might actually be healed if we could unite behind a single song.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No expectations deliver an absolutely stunning concert film experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Jackson's This is It opens with a dedication to the man himself and his fans, telling everyone that the footage they will see was never meant to be seen by anyone from the public. Almost immediately afterwards, it simply and unequivocally jumps right into following the King of Pop from the announcement of his historic final concert tour in the United Kingdom, through the dancer auditions, and right into practicing and creating the concert itself.Having never seen a concert film, my first reaction after watching the film was of exasperation. I was only ever a small fan of Jackson as a singer, and after seeing the film, wished I was a much bigger fan before he passed away last year. The movie is a tribute to the man's final wishes, and gives a firsthand look at what the final concert series would have entailed. The whole thing makes for a grand spectacle, featuring special effects, incredibly produced 3D videos, pyrotechnics, dancing, and of course, music that has spanned four generations. This is an amazing concert anyone would have been extremely lucky to see, but seeing it like this is a very worthwhile consolation.What is truly incredible about the film is the editing. Reportedly culled from more than 100 hours of footage from various points in the preparation process, the film is just stunning to look at. These practice runs for Jackson's songs took place over a number of days, and with the exception of the camera changing angles or changing quality (from a high definition camera to a standard definition camera, or to totally different footage altogether), it is hard to imagine to each song occurring in real time. The editing is just so seamless, so perfect that everything blends into each other, and easily tricks the audience into thinking it all happened all at once. For a film that is more documentary-style above anything else, this makes for a thrilling experience.While the film is far from an emotional roller coaster, it is downright heartbreaking at its conclusion to note that the star is gone, and will never be able to let anyone experience this concert for themselves. You can see every ounce of Jackson's being going into perfecting the concert, and can see his visible exhaustion in more than a few instances. This is a fifty-year-old man pushing himself to do things he could easily do in his twenties and thirties, but obviously not so well later in life. And knowing going in what comes after for the legendary star makes for an honest feeling of devastation.Watching the movie, and seeing the life and perseverance Jackson put into his performance, made me think almost instantaneously of the reckless and psychotic brilliance Heath Ledger put into The Joker for The Dark Knight. Both were performers taken before their time, and both had very accomplished pieces of work they were working on when they died, come out after their deaths. Of course, Ledger would become an even bigger star after that film, but Jackson only makes his star power grow even bigger with this performance. It would have been legendary, and would have put him back where he always should have stayed.If there is anything I hold against Michael Jackson's This is It, it is the fact that there is no real material shown here outside of the concert. In the trailer for the film, and even in the beginning with a few casual interviews with the dancers at their auditions, it hinted at the film expressing some form of idea regarding Jackson's death or how it affected the crew behind the concert. If someone watched the film, having no idea Jackson had died and having not seen the opening dedication, they would have no idea what makes the film so special and so personal. It is simply, an almost straight concert film which was marketed as at least partially being a documentary. This does not take away at all from the spectacle the film offers at every turn, or just how amazing this footage is in itself, but it does take away from the lasting impact of the film.Also missing is any hint of the problems Jackson apparently suffered from. Outside his obvious exhaustion and fatigue, there is not even a suggestion that something else was going on in the background. No insight from the producers, no insight from the dancers, no thoughts at all. It appears that director Kenny Ortega (of High School Musical fame) either never found any hints at all within the footage he pulled together, or he simply did away with it entirely. It makes for a bit of a distorted view on what was actually taking place, and again, for someone looking for some form of substance outside of what this experience provides, it acts as a bit of a disappointment.I went into Michael Jackson's This is It as a casual fan with a bit of a morbid curiosity over the King of Pop's death and what his final concert would have looked like. I got one hell of a concert-going experience out of the film, but nothing else really. It is a moving and really personal film, but it just offers nothing outside of seeing how much Jackson was putting into the concert itself. It was his last chance at going out on top, and unfortunately, he never got to see it through. I liked the film, and will easily recommend it as a stunning experience, but outside of that, do not expect anything else.8/10.(Portions of this review originally appeared on http://www.dvdfanatic.com).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! That is one of the few words I was able to speak after I saw this film. I went to see this film the last week it was in theaters, and I really regretted that I didn't go sooner, so that I could see it more in theaters. I am not really a fan of concert films or documentaries, but this film really broke down that wall for me. Michael Jackson is mesmerizing in his final performance on stage. Watching this film, you can really see Michael's passion for perfection, and for his fans. After watching this film, you can tell that he truly cared about his fans and he wanted to give them the best show ever. The lights, the dance choreography, the special effects! It truly is unlike everything I had ever seen before in my life. He takes you away from your world and puts you into his world. It is a fantasy land and I really felt amazing during this experience. I really think it would have been the best concert series ever, if he would have lived. Like Elvis Presley, he was electrifying in his stage presence. The film is made up of footage taken from multiple cameras and the thing that surprised me is how well the sound and the film is edited very well. Kenny Ortega did a fantastic job with helping prep the show. Michael really is a showman and this film proves it. Decades from now, I will tell my children that I saw Michael Jackson in concert and that he was amazing. I really hope that people do the same after seeing this movie. We miss you Michael, your legacy will live on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Is It is an interesting behind the scenes look at the way Michael Jackson did business. The main thing that struck me while viewing it was what a real loss the world suffered when Jackson passed. He was immensely talented and immensely caring. Some of the highlights of the film are seeing how hands on Michael is with everything and also what modern spins he was planning on putting on some of his classic tunes in his comeback shows. It's always refreshing to find someone as famous as MJ was also quite humble and that shows through here as well. A must for fans and probably quite educational for those with limited exposure to the King of Pop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three famous celebrities died in June of 2009. Farrah Fawcett(Charlie's angels) was one of them. David Carradine(Kill Bill, other Kung fu films)was another. But of the three deaths, none were more talked about than Michael Jackson's death.There is a scene in the excellent film Death at a funeral where the lead character says" It seems like now that he knows people now that he's gone than when he was alive" or something like that. Well, that kind of describes what happened with me and Michael Jackson. For an awfully long time, everyone was creeped out by Michael Jackson.First his skin color turns white in which he looks unfortunately scary. Then he is accused of molestation. Everyone didn't like Michael Jackson. But when the news came out that he died I felt deep down that he did not molest any boys.As you can tell in the documentary This is it, Michael Jackson was a nice man. I don't think he ever molested any children. It's a real shame what happened to him. His life was unfortunately ruined.This is it shows Michael Jackson practicing for his final concert, This is it, which was going to be his last performance and his first performance in a decade. The film shows MJ rehearsing. That is really the whole film. Him dancing and singing to songs like Billie Jean, Thriller, Beat it, Wannna be startin something, Smooth criminal, and other hits. It also shows Michael Jackson in new videos for these songs. The videos are awesome. So is the film itself. The film was shown in IMAX and when I heard about it I was like why. Well, if you see it, you will definitely know why.I miss Michael Jackson. Even if you're not that big of a fan of his songs, you can't deny that he does have some great stuff. He was great back then. But his newer songs were okay. Either way, still a man of genius.I started watching the film. And five minutes into it I had realized how much I missed him. Five minutes or even less you will realize the same thing. Jackson is a great singer. I never thought he did that stuff. We will miss him. This is it, unfortunately. when the film ended, I was a little upset. So will you.This is it: A</fullReview>

Although people sure got a shock when they saw what an amazing movie this is.Many people who went in to see this film who weren't michael Jackson fans to start off with definitely came out as passionate Michael Jackson fans.This movie contains many of Michael Jackson's greatest hits and even some of his Jackson 5 songs. His female guitarist was an excellent musician as you will see when watch this movie.This movie is not your typical concert experience as many have complained but i personally prefer it this way as you get to meet michael Jackson and his crew personally and you will feel as though you know them and there is not the annoying crowd that sometimes spoils the experience.Overall, i recommend you watch this is it and see for yourself what a brilliant musician Michael Jackson was.</fullReview>

I don't think there would be anyone who would even come close to what he was ever again. The amount of practicing, stress involved is incredible. He must've been the most talented man on earth, he knows everything about his music, and the movie shows how everything should be just perfect for him. He is a Perfectionist when it comes to Music Dancing and choreography. What blew me away was the way he loves the world. There is no words to explain the kindness, innocence he has, and the care for people, animals and nature. It is so sad the crap he had to go through when he was alive. Nobody understood him. he was so child like and the people couldn't see that beautiful, innocent side within him. Watch this movie.. it's fully worth the time and money spent !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the very opening scenes until the final message, I think this movie is a gift for the fans, but also an opportunity for the people who hadn't had a chance to know his work to find out how talented this man was. It gives a glimpse at the work he was heartily preparing for what was supposed to be his great comeback.. his redemption from all the turmoil he was put into in the last years.. Fate changed the plans, but at least we now have THIS IS IT.. we can see his rehearsals, his moments with the crew, his jokes, his perfectionism, his love for what he did.. but the moment when everyone becomes dazzled is when the speakers blow with the sound!!.. you are mesmerized by his performances right away.. at age of 50 he still sang and danced awesomely, he was not intimidated by the young dancers at his side whatsoever.. And you gotta see it to really get the feeling of what Michael Jackson singing and dancing is all about.. The movie is funny, emotional, exciting, beautiful, contagious.. Its virtually impossible to watch it without rocking your head or moving your feet with the beat.. After all it's what he was used to be doing in his last 45 years: make ppl sing and dance along..and with THIS IS IT he is there, alive, right in front of you.. It is said Michael was really intending to finish his musical career and dedicate his time in making movies: ironically we can say his first movie was a #1 hit around the world.. In the final scene we get the message that was stuck in our throats since he left this world in such an absurd way.. We don't know why things happen in certain ways in life...but we know this love will last forever.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The music movie of the year is beyond critical jabs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where I live the San Francisco Chronicle film critic completely trashed this movie with more ink than was spilled on the sinking of the Titanic. But anyone with even the slightest musical sensibility would see this as a moving, tragic an completely joyous window in to the life of a terribly flawed and completely brilliant musical man. Everything about Michael was incomplete, right down to his plastic surgeries and his musical meanderings that became hopelessly fractured and over blown. That said, and despite everything, Michael was a player and magical performer who is finally released from his own machinery of gloss and glitter in this very moving and truly wonderful film experience. Just seeing the band, dancers and staff put together the show is something that any music fan will adore. The band is hot even if the keyboard player is stealing all the horn licks (a real horn section would have been a gas), the dancers are killer, and ironically, the show in preproduction is probably better that the actual one. How so? Well few of us would have ever made it to London, and the insight gained in seeing much of it so close and in this kind of detail is a very special view, one that no film in my mind has ever captured. Great musicians, and musical people rehearse, and love playing. Watch Michael drink in this experience. He is a player, and a performer you won't forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Say what you want about Michael Jackson, but listen to this...he is one of, maybe the, biggest musician of this generation, and possibly of all time. There's really no denying his amazing talent, and the movie definitely brought that out in such a beautiful and magical way, it's beyond words. Even as he's 50, Michael's still got it. It's amazing how Michael's concert come, or was supposed to come together, with the auditions, the effects, everything. Even his famous "crotch grab" is choreographed, lol... I'm not kidding about that though. I do have one fault from this movie(sorry mj, but this is a movie review, but I say this with love), this movie is about the rehearsal of the "This is It" concert. What I'm saying is, your not exactly Michael giving his "all", so some might leave a little disappointed, but that's a small complaint of this fantastic, magical and awesome experience. If your not in not in total awe of the magic of this film and of course, Michael, you will be on your feet dancing in the theater to all of your MJ's favorite songs. Even for non-fans of Michael's music, it's still an amazing experience. There will be no one like him. He is truly one of a kind, and this movie did an amazing job bringing that out. R.I.P. Michael Jackson, King of Pop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MJ's moves are simply nowhere near as good as when he was in his prime. The concert that's being rehearsed might have been fun to see more so for the stage effects than for MJ's performances. And yet, here's everyone kissing up to him like he's still the master. Lame. He's also a bit senile, as revealed in the polite but patronizing way that his team deals with him (it's not malicious).You'll probably still have fun hearing all the old songs. Also, it's fun (at least for a little while) to see how he interacts with the crew. Otherwise, don't expect anything mind-blowing. Expect virtually nil new insight to his personality.</fullReview>

Then it's almost like one big long music video. MJ performs some of his best songs and you get to see the choreography that went along with it. Also, it shows him judging and picking out dancers.So, if you love his songs, then it's worth a viewing. It's not something you have to pay close attention too to enjoy.

		<fullReview>Michael Jackson fan or not, give yourself a break and see this. There will never be another tour for Michael Jackson. There has never been a tour as monumental as this tour promised to be. My gosh, the staging, the dancers, the discussion of the costumes that would've been part of this production are breathtaking. The talent of Michael Jackson is abundantly clear in This Is It. It has made belated believers out of some of my friends. This is a guy who came to life on stage. What I have never seen in any performer before was this man who, while dancing and singing, and completely involved in the moment, commanded the action around him. He cued the music and the dancers and super-charged the stage with his Presence, capital P. Until the movie I had never noticed how he used his hands and motions to control it all. Have you gone to a concert and heard some known singer get off mike for a second and their voice disappears? Not him. He was a real singer with or without backup. During the movie I found myself smiling because it was joyous to watch him. It will always be the next best thing to what was to be. It will be one of the greatest performances I've ever seen. When you speak of heart, This Is It.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate hyping movies up cause i feel everyone is going to view something differently and you should go with an open mind but personally i liked it. My girl dragged me to go but i am glad she did. It gave me a different perspective towards Michael Jackson as a person. If you grow up to MJ like i did and you go with a bunch of friends and family who can relate it is a fun and pleasant ride for the whole audience to get into. It also makes you appreciate the level of MJ and his whole team around him. It also had a majestic airiness around it with all it captured. I never knew a concert could be this off the hook. If he got the chance to carry it out it would have been a show the worlds never seen..he pushed the boundaries on this one..This movie is the closest i will ever get to going to a MJ concert.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For The fans...This is the ultimate way to feel Michael's love. To see the master at work, not only to know he is genius but also what inside his heart as a person. for the rest of the world...they might never able to feel it like the fans but it is time for them to see inside the real man. the soul they tortured. This Is It might be the end for some but it certainly not the end for the fans. it is a message...message of LOVE that will continue from fans to fans all over the world. The greatest music movie of all time,no matter other artist will might beat it someday but Michael will never be forgotten. He is the King and if music industry is a kingdom,He is the last king to reign. there will be no other like him</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to watch the movie on the first day of screening. Up until now I can never imagine a world without such great entertainer. When I saw the movie, I can't help but drop tears in my eye--tears of joy, of love, of pity, of longing--for such a great talent, for such a great genius, for such a kindhearted man, that has now, gone to soon. After seeing the movie, I can validate what he said during his interview with Martin Bashir, that he don't wanna be buried, he wanted to live forever. In our hearts, in my heart, with the help of this movie, Michael Jackson will truly live forever. People will miss out if they failed to watch such wonderful masterpiece.

I didn't know what to expect with this film but I left feeling absolutely privileged to have been able to watch merely 2 hours of rehearsal footage of the greatest musician that ever lived. He's so mesmerizing to watch, you can't take your eyes off him for even a blink. You really feel the compassion and love he had for his art and it gave me chills the entire time. To sum it up, it was brilliant. I cried, I laughed, I wanted to get up and dance during his songs, and I never wanted it to end. If you go see it stay till the VERY end, there's more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie 5x and love it all the more each time. Here is Michael Jackson larger than life and so amazing to watch. Never have I seen so many people sit quietly and teary when a movie finishes. You don't have to be a fan to enjoy this movie, its all about the LOVE. L.O.V.E. My husband reluctantly came to the preview with me and with the hope I could get him to see the real Michael, instead of the twisted and cruel image portrayed over the years, not only did he enjoy the movie and the music but he was touched by the humble and caring side to Michael. As a fan I have found it hard to sit still during my viewings, especially the first few times I saw it. The music is amazing and the short films/3d stuff takes you out of the theater and into the screen. Despite my best efforts I have yet to leave dry eyed, not because of the movie, but because of a life lost. A life and talent so extraordinary.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Concert Would Have Been Awesome!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not really sure what to expect about this movie. I did not want to expect too much. Well, I got what I expected. Director Kenny Ortega presents us with the final days of musical icon Michael Jackson while he rehearsed for his comeback tour.We practically get the entire concert here as they share with us a lot of his biggest hits. We also get to see what happens behind the scenes in these big concerts. From the selection of dancers, to the lighting effects, to the video productions -- all of these are of course in a much bigger scale given that the star is MJ. In addition, we see the dedication and talent of MJ as an artist very much hands-on the choreography and musical preparations of his shows.We see the imaginative video shoots for "Smooth Criminal" and "Thriller." We see the technical infrastructure of his stage with the launch pads and the cherry picker. We see the elaborate lighting effects with fires chasing all over the stage. We see MJ's generosity in sharing the stage with his beautiful guitarist Orianthi Panagaris (for "Black and White") and back-up singer Judith Hill (in "I Just Can't Stop Loving You").Apart from the dedications at the start by the dancers, this movie is basically a documentary about the concert rehearsals and preparations, and essentially a celebration of MJ's musicianship. Yes he did look thin and emaciated from certain angles, like in the "Human Nature" part and the duet with Hill. But his energy was definitely there. He was obviously not giving 100% as these are rehearsals. However, it still felt like he did get carried away by the music and still came up with electrifying performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a life-long Michael Jackson fan, it was depressing when MJ died close to his concerts. Being able to see the concert that never happened was truly amazing. The experience of seeing such incredible dance moves, with a great crew, mind-blasting sound and video editing and the musicianship of everyone involved, all together made this such a thrilling piece of art. Props to Kenny Ortega for his patience and hard work, also to all of the crew for their undying hard work - even though the concert never happened, seeing this movie has truly 'wowed' me and i don't think there would have ever been a concert on such a scale like this. 10/10 for sure.</fullReview>

The selection and infusion of video into the intended live performance, the emotions of the dancers and musicians as the worked with Michael, the storyboard, everything was incredible. My sister and I went to see it in an IMAX theatre. That was a great decision. We had great seats and felt as if we were there. The reaction of the audience in our theatre was amazement. We all erupted into applause at various points throughout the film. The first group emotion was at the end of one scene where the camera fades and we see Michael smiling as the camera fades out. There was a uniform appreciation and level of engagement among the people in the audience. There was laughter and cheers and lots of reminiscing. Michael Jackson will live on forever! Simply the greatest entertainer who has ever lived.</fullReview>

The segments of music are truly influential and moving to watch as Jackson and co give what would have been a classic show.From using the most high-tech equipment-3-d to be one of them, each set and moment is created with the up-most precision to detail.

		<fullReview>I went to see this film with a friend because we are both MJ fans and although both our expectations for this film were low we decided to give it a go. As it turned out our fears were not entirely justified. Neither my friend or I had planned on seeing MJ on his tour so this was an opportunity to catch a glimpse of what it might have been like. In my opinion the eventual gigs would have been spectacular. I am not aware of what the cost had been for the tour but looking at the crew and the equipment it must have been high. It is 17 years since I saw MJ live and he was superb then and from what I saw of him rehearsing and performing in the two hours of this film I suspect he would have been superb again. We will never know, but he was a class act and I loved his music. My friend pointed out as we trudged out of the cinema we will never see his like again, he was unique. I cannot in all honesty give this film a 10 because good as it was its not 10 material. The content stands as a lasting testimony to his talent and I suppose if you are not an MJ fan then the film will not be interesting enough but for his fans like me it was good to see him doing what he did best. The world is a sadder place because of his absence but thankfully his music lives on. RIP MJ.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Knowing a bit about Michael Jackson, I didn't expect him to be the frail, weak person in TII that some in the media have been portraying. But I have to say, I was astonished at how undiminished his talent was both vocally and physically. Even though his back up dancers were superb in their own right and half his age, Michael Jackson totally outclassed them with his liquid movements and style. And his live vocals were amazing. He sings with such emotion and passion and he sings as well as he did 20 years ago. Honestly, I kept thinking, this man I am watching cannot be 50 years old. It was also fascinating to see the behind the scenes process of putting the show together. And it was nice to see Michael Jackson portrayed as he was and not the tabloid caricature which was so often flashed by the media. Preparing for the concerts, he was a dedicated, inspired, perfectionist totally controlling the process; a man doing his job with passion and joy and doing it very well.Hats off to Kenny Ortega and crew for a beautiful, insightful, refreshingly real film. It made me laugh, completely held my interest, at times had me mesmerized and made me forget for a couple of hours that Michael Jackson was no longer with us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, worthwhile &amp; enjoyable - what more do you want?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I appreciate several of Michael Jackson's songs, I never bought a single one of his CDs until after his death. I therefore cannot be classified a true Michael Jackson fan. Yet, I really enjoyed this film.After one and a half hours I kept thinking, "oh, no there's only 21 minutes left." This film works on many different levels. It brings fans who were hoping to see his O2 concert as close as they'll ever get to actually experiencing it. The film is also interesting in that it gives us some insight into how meticulous, how focused, and how on top of every little detail MJ was. Really fascinating.The film is also a deserved introduction to some amazing dancers and musicians who were days away from performing on the biggest stage of their lives, only to be tossed back into obscurity. There is some incredible talent among these individuals and watching them is a treat. One who definitely will not fall into obscurity and perhaps may be the biggest beneficiary of this film is the amazing Orianthi Panagaris, the little, female, blond, Australian guitar player. When you watch her play (just mesmerizing) you spend the next five minutes asking yourself and everyone around you: "Who is that?" Well, not for long.Finally, this film creates pause in every thoughtful individual who for, what appeared to be, good reason believed with near certainty MJ to be weak, drugged up, and fearful of his concert failing. This film shows quite the opposite. Even comments that MJ could never have performed 50 shows was clearly the talk of people who knew absolutely "zip".I was truly impressed by Michael Jackson's mental and physical state. And no matter how many talking heads who were close to Michael told me he was fine and ready to go, I didn't believe them until seeing it for myself. But there on the screen you see how sharp and focused he was. And he could still move like a much, much, younger man. So it makes me wonder - how easy is it for innuendo and rumors to take hold and become truth when it really isn't. This is a great case study.For all his perceived oddities, Michael Jackson was foremost an amazing entertainer. Most people agree that he definitely was in the past, this film proves he still was at the time of his death as well. The people around me kept saying, "Wow, this would have been an awesome concert."This film hits the viewer on different levels and as such it's not merely a concert film. I only wish there were more "behind the scenes" scenes. While the songs were great, I just loved getting a feeling for what it was like putting this all together. You get glimpses of it, but not enough to satisfy my curiosity. I could have watched two hours or more of everything going on behind the scenes. That said, the performance pieces were definitely entertaining and nearly every song a big hit.Perhaps the most interesting thing is that viewers are watching something MJ would likely never have wanted to become public. He was such a perfectionist that he wouldn't have wanted to show the hard work and immense effort required to make the final product look so seamless and perfect. Yet, for the public this is a wonderful glimpse into a rarely seen world of monotonous practice and preparation necessary pull off a perfect performance.For me this was definitely worth the $11 I plunked down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Jackson is a great many things. Love him or hate him, one thing is for sure, he will go down in history as one of the greatest entertainers of all time. "This Is It" gives us an inside look at the rehearsals of Michael Jackson's tour which he was to begin in London's 02 arenas in July 2009. All the chart topping tunes we grew up listening to are there, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that, after all these years, he still cared enough to give his all. He knows his music, he knows his moves and he knows what he wants. Although he may seem frail at times (and much thinner than before), he remains a solid performer who strives for nothing less than perfect. Combining creativity and talent, Michael Jackson proves that, though this is it, his legacy lives on?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not being a MJ fan, I accompanied my wife, who was (and in fact still is) a dedicated fan. Seeing the man at work resolved a lot of my prejudice toward Michael. He was talented, hard at work, creating a great show.I was more amazed by the people around him. Get real! He's a talented figure, but still just a man. In the entire movie I heard no one saying 'No' to him, or discussing his ideas or just treating him like a normal human being. No wonder he developed a strange way of presenting himself in the media and getting a smeared image, with all these plastic people around him. Quite a pity.Another thing struck me. MJ developed over the years a habit of creating a spectacular show with funny moves, spectacular gadgets and a lot of dancers, musicians etcetera. Why did he do that? Was he afraid to be in the front position, to be alone on stage? He had talent and personality enough to do just that...Anyway, a movie worth seeing together with my (sniffing) wife; if I had to go alone I would have waited for broadcast on TV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Earth Song Back to reality and real crime fighting, fighting crimes against humanity. Things are not black and white. The trials of the terrorists are just starting and the debate is whether to have the trial in New York. Michael Jackson had seen all of the devastation too during his fifty years and asked during this film, what have we done? This is it he says, if we don't fix the earth, nobody else will. He pays tribute to the rain forest and the Earth in a beautiful video called Earth Song, near the end of the film. Unfortunately it becomes a confrontation with a forklift unearthing the magical forest, turning vibrant green to dirt brown much like the terrorists turned the twin towers to dust and rubble.For the whole comment see at Examiner dot com under San Francisco Arts and Entertainment then San Francisco Opera</fullReview>

All the way through the film Michael has a smile on his face just showing how much he really loved singing and performing. Everything about the show that was shown looked as though it would have been incredible to see, the special effects were out of this world and as a fan it makes me so much sadder that i didn't get to see the real thing. I definitely recommend this film to the fans and for the people who doubted him and said that he was in ill health which clearly he wasn't during these rehearsals.

		<fullReview>What a movie. Where to begin? I'm 26 years old and I've been a fan of Michael for as long as I can remember. Not as big of a fan of my brother but I still very much enjoyed his music. I was shocked to hear the news of his death and didn't really feel it too much when it happened. My concern was more with my younger brother who was heartbroken to hear the news that his hero and inspiration passed away so suddenly. When my brother showed me the trailer for "This Is It" I knew I had to see it. We went to an opening night showing and I was not disappointed.I found this to be a very emotional and moving movie. I hadn't really heard much about Michael for the last number of years other than what the media was saying about him, and most of that wasn't positive. Now I never have, or never will believe any allegations made against him, I remember feeling concern for what was described by some as his "failing health". That Michael Jackson portrayed in the media is not the same man I saw on that big silver screen last night. I was blown away by how false all those reports were. While watching the movie I was struck by how vibrant Michael appeared, how full of life he was, how enthusiastic he was to make these 50 concerts amazing. They really spared no expense. Incredible stage designs, special effects, dancing (loved the toasters!) and singing by the legend himself. "Frail"? "Fragile"? "Failing Health"? Nonsense. One of my favorite scenes was the "Beat It" segment. Michael was so into it, dancing like he was in his 20's, jumping on the ground. And then when it didn't end quite right he did it all again! I don't know many 50 year old men who could pull anything close to that off. "This Is It" gives a very intimate portrayal of Michael. We see him in a way we probably never have before. The interactions with the stage hands, dancers, performers, directors were a joy to watch. We see a man full of love for the people around him, a kind and generous soul. One scene I loved in particular was a moment between him and the female guitarist. He stands with her on stage prompting her to play her highest note, encouraging her and telling her that "this is your moment to shine" "we're all with you" and you can see that he meant it. I still can't get over that. Someone could easily be in that spot and say "don't take too much attention" but not Michael. For all his fame and fortune he still remained humble at heart, and this scene really showcased that for me. After it was all said and done I cried. Tears of sadness, mixed with happiness too I think. I felt happy to see Michael doing what he loved and looking so full of life. I was heartbroken thinking of his loss and of the treatment he endured. I cried for his loss, after all these months I felt the pain of the world losing such a talented and gifted artist. And much more than that, a wonderful man with a wonderful soul. I'll never care what any detractor has to say, no one with this much love could do anything he was accused of. And he was full of love. You can't fake that, and he wasn't. That was just who he was. I don't think any fan of MJ's will need any more encouragement to see it, but if you're on the fence, please do yourself the favor. It's a chance to experience Michael in a way I don't think we ever have before, and it's a final chance to say "goodbye".There's a line in one of my favorite MJ songs "Will you be There" that had added poignancy for me when I heard it again recently. "Through My Joy And My Sorrow. In The Promise Of Another Tomorrow. I'll Never Let You Part. For You're Always In My Heart."Thank you Michael, for everything. It was an amazing privilege to see you in action, one last time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this movie. It was great seeing Michael once again doing what he was born to do. This time we got to see him creating his masterpiece, as well as singing and dancing. There were times watching him perform that it was as if 20 years had been erased. It was fascinating to watch in action his often spoken about perfectionism and sheer genius. This movie made me cry, laugh and smile a lot.My one complaint is that it was over in a flash. I wish there would have been more of it. There was so much going on at times, that I know I missed things, especially since it was difficult to take my eyes off of Michael, so I'll be seeing it again.If the live show would have made it to the stage, I believe the world would have been in awe. There were great technological things going on that would have dazzled, and of course the chief dazzler himself, MJ. I think every second would have been spellbinding. The movie is just a taste of what the live show would have been all about, but it's a very enjoyable taste..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wrote this little blog after watching "This Is It" in Facebook and IMDb and wanted to share because I wasn't that much of a fan of Michael Jackson except this documentary was so inspiring, so I pay my tribute to the King of Pop. First of all, I thought the movie was powerful enough to show that Michael Jackson has still got the awesome moves like he did it in the 80's. Those who followed him after his world abandoned him from all the tabloids and forgot the real talent of this magical icon, was given a new inspiration and pleasure of the creativity of Michael. Yes, the world somehow abandoned this great singer/dancer/entertainer because he's different and eccentric, but we all are in our own way. During the entire movie of "This Is It", just watching the rehearsal of watching MJ perform even at 50% of how he could of shown his real energy in front of his huge concerts, made me see that it really takes a lot out of a person to do this? I could not sleep with these kind of rehearsals. Those dancers are handpicked because they have the stamina and moves of gymnasts and are proud of what they do and have lots of fun and excitement. Parts of the movie had segments where MJ would change even the smallest dance moves to make every reaction to his perfection and being in sync with every dancer takes great agility. I have to say that I am greatly inspired by the dancers and also share their excitement being with Michael Jackson. Their coach told them they are an extension of Michael for every move he makes in stage. Getting to the special effects, it's really neat how you can make hundreds of people added in the screen dancing very military like and strong. Watching the 3D version of Thriller was a real treat and seeing all the costume designs are very well done. Kudos to the special effects people. Kudos to the Director for making this happen. There are even funny moments of how MJ has to conserve his throat by not giving all his voice? I just though it's funny considering some of these songs were his ballads and slow songs. One of my favorites was "Smooth Criminal". I liked every scenery and effects and synchronizing energy from the segment. This is definitely one to watch on a big screen with all the songs vibrating the walls of the movie theater. Everybody seems to be stomping their feet feeling the rhythm of "Beat It" or the ballad of "Heal the World". The movie documentary doesn't bring any of his tabloids or his weaknesses or any of the things to be sad about that brought Michael downhill during his last few years, but brought tribute to his raw talents. In conclusion, everyone will have a new perspective and will enjoy his songs for years to come because Michael Jackson is Legendary!P.S. Hope this makes you want to watch the Movie.Ferdy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow!!! Amazing and Stupendous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You just can't afford to miss this one. I saw this twice in two days and was simply blown away by the greatness and magic of Michael. I was wondering if this concert would have happened Michael was sure to get his throne back. It has everything his music, his moves, his passion &amp; energy . It contains some of the amazing and breathtaking computer effects. It felt so good to see Michael creating his moves, trying to take control of the entire show. After watching this movie one has agree that there was and there never gonna be another performer like Michael. Only thing which I missed in this movie was Michael doing a Moonwalk. If you have interest in music you have to see this. If you are Michael Jackson's fan I am sure you will not miss it. Hats off Michael. World will surely miss you forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolutely amazing movie, i must say i had a few doubts before seeing the movie but they were all cleared. If anyone had any speculations about his health before the concert movie shows that MJ was in fit state and all the performances were to perfection...my favourites were probably smooth criminal, they don't really care about us (the background scenery was amazing!!), thriller, and the earth song(which nearly brought tears to my eyes), all the rest were great too but these stood out for me the most. I have to also give credit to the fantastic back up dancers and the guitarist who were all awesome. Seriously everyone must see this movie now you will not be disappointed!!! there is no doubt that he is a true legend. R.I.P MJ</fullReview>

I was actually hoping that they would show Moonwalker after it as well lol. Haters shouldn't be allowed on here, he was and always will be the King of Pop, not just not Pop Music but Popular Culture. His style, dancing, rhythm, voice, charity, I could go on. No one can change music and racial stereotypes the way he did. we will never see someone like him again. He was an easy target for the press and for the families of these kids that tried to cash in on this man who was a child at heart.Go see this movie, I wont spoil anything for you, but this is a must see, you gotta believe me! If you want to see MJ in his truest form, go see This Is It, because you will want to watch it again and again just like me and everyone else I know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Jackson without a doubt is one of the world's greatest performers. He is in totality, 'ART' itself. He is one of the best artist that ever lived in this world. Every detail he sees. Every note and beat and tempo he knew. He embrace his songs like treasures. He is excellent in every sense. He never fails to say 'God bless you'. He loves mother nature. He performs every song with so much passion and commitment to entertain his audience. He never forgets his fans... He loved them.All his songs, are songs that tells about life, tells about being you, tells about your creativity, tells about how good you can be, tells about what is real and what can you do about it. The documentary movie was a blast! He respects his team. He did everything with love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"This Is It" is terrific (I'm a white male over 50). Setting aside MJ's personal life and psyche, his artistic achievement puts him in the pantheon of modern culture. Looking at just what is presented -- preparing for a live concert comeback, drawing from all of his previous catalog -- he was a genius and invented a new language of movement and music (as much as Picasso, Fred Astaire, and Judy Garland set new standards in painting, dance, and dramatic interpretation, respectively, and then there's Elvis ...). People need to see "This Is It" as the slice of life it is and avoid getting drawn into discussions of MJ's (1) self image &amp; plastic surgery, (2) personal indulgence, (3) high class drug addiction, and (4) family denial, all of which unnecessarily muddy the waters of his creativity and humanity. I wish a deceased MJ could trade places on this earth with the unfortunately still living former vice president Dick Cheney.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A true icon, a great entertainer, a musical genius, the Moonwalker. He has been called many things throughout his entire life, but the one the one name that suits him to the letter is THE KING OF POP - Michael Jackson is and will forever be a true legend and a person of great heart and honor. This movie happens to be a genius at work. With the help of the director who brought us all 3 High School Musical movies - Kenny Ortega, Michael gave us an inside backstage look of what would have been his greatest triumph to date. And then a week later, he was taken from us. This is not what should have happened. Michael should still be with us. But now, as we look into the future, we will see many rising up to the challenge to take what Michael taught us and we will rise to the occasion just like he did at the age of 4. He will live forever in our hearts and his music will live forever. Just 4 words sums this up ALL HAIL THE KING!!!!!</fullReview>

But all it was, was insight of how great the concert inevitably would have been. But why should I pay to know that. A lot of work went into the preparation on the concert, but certainly not the film. In 10 years when your kids watch it, they will have no idea what its about as it makes no references to him dying before the concert commenced nor any tribute to him at the end. The end lacked luster or punch with most of the audience waiting for something to happen. The Funeral that was televised was mush more revealing. I give this a negative one if possible! Come on guys get your act together and stop wasting your hard earned money. Wait till it comes on TV next year!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is hard to write a review for something so bare-bones and incomplete as "This Is It". It's not really a concert movie, the kind that drops the viewer into the audience, experiencing the big show better than any ticket holder ever could. No, this simple handicam special is more like a full-length "bonus feature" on a real Jackson DVD. It's Michael Jackson at half-speed, so as not to blow out his vocal chords or wear his body down for the "real" shows - 50 potentially stamina-sapping performances planned for London's 02 Arena. It's ghoulish to watch a clearly not-young Jackson: inspired at times, sometimes going through the motions, reclaiming past hits, old dance moves - and not think about what is really happening in his life, and what is just about to. The other reaction is that the film seems shamelessly calculated. The only reason this footage exists is to allow technical crews and talent viewing backstage see where the show needed tightening or improvement. Hastily chopped-in reminiscences repackaged and padded out as a feature film, THIS IS IT smacks of quick-buck opportunism, cold and morbid.Admittedly, the show looked like it would have been a wowzer, and there's no doubt that Jackson had talent to burn. You do see very bright flashes of it from time to time in several dialed-up performances in THIS IS IT.Most reports paint Jackson as a perfectionist about his performance (you even see it in this film where he dressed-down a crewmember), and through that lens, I think this film would certainly not have seen the light of day if it had been allowed to pass through Jackson's hyperultra-managed image factory. Despite it's inconsequential nature, as a last-chance to see him work, the picture may offer fans an emotional resonance not shared by this reviewer - and even some closure from his untimely death. For viewers interested in reliving the excitement and stage presence that thrilled audiences around the world for four decades, this film is decidedly not it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breaking His Promise With The Man In The Mirror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2009, after nearly a decade of absence from performing on stage, an elaborate production called "This Is It" was set into motion which was intended to be Michael Jackson's much-lauded "comeback".Well, needless to say, Michael Jackson never, ever made that comeback. No. Instead, within that very same year, Michael made a confirmed date with death.In a weird sort of way, I found "This Is It" to be a somewhat eerie, little documentary. As one closely watched Michael during all of the behind-the-scenes preparations that went into "This Is It's" production, you could easily bet yourself that thoughts of suicide were already set in his mind. It was an event that wasn't very far off in his own personal calendar.I found it quite curious that through all of "This Is It", no close-ups were ever taken of Michael's face (either indoors or outdoors) without him first having a pair of sunglasses on.For me, "This Is It's" spookiest moment was when footage was shown of Michael as a young, afro-headed, 10 year-old in his happier, more carefree days with The Jackson 5.In my opinion, "This Is It" is a mighty sad and sorry statement about an aging ("has-been") pop star who gave so much of himself for the sake of his music, but in return he never acquired anything that would ever deliver him from the loneliness of his own inevitable suicide.Below is an excerpt from Michael's song The Man In The Mirror, which I think reveals a lot about Jackson if you happen to take into account what he ended up resorting to in order to "change" his ways - I'm starting with the man in the mirror.... I'm asking him to change his ways.... And no message could have been more clearer.... If you wanna make the world a better place.... Take a look at yourself and then make a change.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Is It: As it was visioned!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just when I was looking forward to see "Michael Jackson's This Is It" there were a few things that I was expecting... We get to see what Michael has planned for his canceled "This Is It" concert and a fully crowded cineplex which enables me to pretend like was act an actual concert with the clapping &amp; applauding at the end of every song but unfortunately I only receive half of what I have anticipated. The cineplex was less crowded than I was expecting and the audience watch through it like any other movie (Although I didn't expect everyone to share my enthusiasm) in which I too had to endure and only applauded after the film! But despite all that it was a good documentary but not a concert film as it been considered or as I hoping for it to turn out to be, it gave us a glimpse of what Michael has been preparing if the concert ever toke place and even show the viewers how much he's more than just an entertainer, it shows he's also a visionary which pretty much makes him for what his fans has seen him for and should be seen for. But still, the experience just reminded me and probably others who have view this even as bittersweet that Michael was truly gone and everything we see is just rehearsal but not what we should and could have been seeing! Non the less, the only good that came from this is aleast we get to see Michael perform one last time and what he have been preparing for what could have been greater than what we have seen so far. Nuff said!!!...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Jackson is back from the dead? No! But is the movie, "This is It", cool? Hell, yeah! "This is It" takes us on a behind-the-scenes tour of the originally planned MJ concert, "This is It". This movie tells us about Michael Jackson planning his final concert that will never be made, since his untimely death. The movie brings us in the middle of the action where we see a glimpse of the many stage rehearsals and concert film footage. I thought this movie helped honor Michael's memory, besides not talking about his death, and I enjoyed listening to all of MJ's classic pop music once again, since it's been a long time I have heard them. My favorite scenes in the movie were actually MJ rehearsing my favorite songs including "Smooth Criminal", "The Way You Make Me Feel", "Thriller", "Beat It", and "Billie Jean". The music was popping, the dancing was rocking, and the movie contains a real heart meaning that even though the King of Pop is gone, he will remain in our lives forever, while we still hear his music, and we still dance his moves. "This is It" is a must-watch behind-the-scenes documentary, and trust me, you will be singing to the songs, and dancing in your seat, just like I did. "This is It", in my review, "a popping and rocking jukebox movie, with a Michael Jackson twist".</fullReview>

But this is a must watch for a music fan. Anything you may have thought of the man "He's overrated" for instance, please take the time and watch This Is It. You will think completely different of him.For a musician that has the money and power to create such a blasting show and have computers to do CGI, for one, Michael didn't have to go all out and make every dance move correct and work his aged body, but he did it and it proved he truly had a passion for what he did.The band; what can I say? Jackson has a legacy of starting careers for musicians. Orianthi shows what made her wonderful on her solo album, along with all the other musicians.I will not spoil the rest but go out and watch it, this movie is AMAZING!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does not canonize him as 'Saint Jackson'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Spoiler/plot- 2009, This film consists of a montage of Michael Jackson on stage rehearsals preparing him for his last worldwide tour just before his untimely and unexpected death.*Special Stars- Michael Jackson.*Theme- Art and talent is eternal.*Based on- Michael Jackson personal and stage performance history*Trivia/location/goofs- Due to the nature of the filming of rehearsals and the tragic death of Mr. Jackson during this process, the costume continuity of many film segments is sadly lacking here. It is to be expected by real film fans. You will notice that Mr. Jackson's clothes change radically (costume jump cuts) between the films edits in his song rehearsal performances. Filmed at the Staple Center, downtown Los Angeles. This interesting film shows some of the back-stage personal matters of live stage show production.*Emotion- An UN-forgettable film to cap the Mr. Jackson's performance life that does not canonize him as 'Saint Jackson' as I had feared. I was not a rabid fan, but I can appreciate real talent when I see it. This film was balanced, fair and technically interesting to view especially with the huge problems entailed when your main star unexpectedly dies before a worldwide music tour. I enjoyed this film and feel it's a nice and balanced tribute to this man's music and art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Is It should be seen as a 'what if' film; it allows us to question the future ? one in which MJ successfully navigates through the protracted fifty sold-out shows.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Is It is Michael Jackson's final curtain call, a documentary- concert film which captures the King of Pop in action during the rehearsals for what could have been the biggest concert show ever staged by a pop star of such legendary stature in the last couple of decades. His passing is sudden and shocking. But his musical legacy and strong professional ethics live on. This Is It is a poignant reminder of his incredible musical talent and more crucially, his encompassing love for nature and humanity. Directed by Kenny Ortega, This Is It represents familiar territory for the director of High School Musical (2006), who knows a thing or two about capturing musicals and concerts on film. Whether they are worth watching is another matter. Having said that, This Is It, however exceeds expectations, and I am glad that Ortega has done a commendable job to make a film which preserves the sanctity of Jackson's greatness. Ortega wisely avoids the controversy surrounding Jackson's death and chooses instead to focus entirely on the singer-dancer's commitment to his craft. This is how MJ (as he is affectionately called) would have wanted his fans to remember him for.A wide repertoire of songs are featured here including classics such as Thriller, Billie Jean, and Beat It, and favorites like Black Or White, Man In The Mirror, and Earth Song. Performed live by a very talented group of musicians together with Jackson's irresistible vocals, these songs are delivered to the theater's sound system in extreme clarity. I daresay that the most outstanding aspect of This Is It belongs to its sound mixing which could be (and should be) nominated for an Oscar. It gives one of the most immersive 'concert' experiences on screen since Scorsese's Shine A Light (2008). And it is because of the fantastic sound work here which helps to create an illusion over the film's most significant drawback ? the absence of a narrative thread. If one were to break the film down to its most basic parts, it can be observed that it is just a random assembly of footage from Jackson's rehearsals with the occasional 'off-stage' exchange of dialogue. This Is It could have been assembled any another way with the same footage but edited in a different running order and it would be a different kind of the same. This means there is a lack of a driving narrative or one that coherently links together various parts to form a recognizable structure in which viewers can identity with and follow visually. If not for the hard work put in by the sound department, and the presence of Jackson himself (and his music), This Is It would not have fared better than the High School Musicals.Fans of MJ will be divided over the release of this film. Some will embrace it, seeing it as a celebrative tribute to a respected music icon while others might view it as milking the cash cow, taking advantage of his death to set cash registers ringing. No side is more right than the other. Instead, This Is It should be seen as a 'what if' film; it allows us to question the future ? one in which MJ successfully navigates through the protracted fifty sold-out shows. Will that feat change the way critics or cynics look at the pop star like this film has so excellently accomplished? We will never know. But at least we know MJ tried.

		<fullReview>I do not count myself as one of those passionate Jackson fans, yet I do have some of his songs in my collection, and have problem in accepting that the man -flawed as he was- always set the bar with his on stage performances.So I was curious about this film, more so since it followed so quickly after his death. Today I made the mistake of watching this progranda material, and so I find myself writing this review.If you are wondering what "it" is, I can now tell you: this movie is a last grasp, desperate, utterly contemptible attempt to make more money off the Michael Jackson brand. "It" is nothing more than exploiting a person's death for some quick bucks.Other reviewers have done a good job of explaining what the pitiful contents of this documentary/film are. Save your money, there is nothing worth watching in this worst form of exploitative propaganda/documentary. Michael Jackson may have been a flawed man, but the people around him who exploit his death so shamelessly are even worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perfection; a word that is Michael Jackson and a description of This Is It. This Is It is music documentary of the greatest show that never was. I was amazed throughout the movie because I did not realize this much footage was taken during rehearsals, and how complete they felt. This movie is, quite simply, a collection of clips taken during the many rehearsals of Jackson's final tour. Kenny Ortega did a fine of job putting it all together. He knows when to add the perfect clip and song at the perfect time to make you feel certain emotions, and you could not ask for a better ending. I was grabbed by this movie from the first five minutes. The most outstanding aspect of This Is It, however, is how it creates the feeling of attending concert front and center. Leaving the theater, I gained the knowledge of what happened backstage but also felt as I watched the full concert. If you enjoy Jackson's work, it is hard to not fall in love with This Is It. Long Live the King of Pop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Entertainment Documentary Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I received an invitation to attend the Los Angeles Premiere of Michael Jackson's "This is It," I must admit, I was thrilled. The very first music concert I ever attended, at the age 10 years old, was to see The Jackson 5. In the interest of full disclosure, dancing has always been of interest to me, both as a spectator and participant. Many acquaintances of mine are professional dancers ? and that alliance garnered me the opportunity to work in the background of "Smooth Criminal" - an experience I will never forget.Walking toward the star-studded affair at the Nokia Theatre in downtown L.A. that night I could see chandeliers adorning aerialists as they glittered in silver, hanging from huge crystal balls in the sky of the courtyard. Superfans donned fedoras, red and black ''Beat-It'' jackets, ''Smooth Criminal'' suits, sequined jackets and silver gloves.The courtyard near the bleachers of the red carpet area was abuzz with the likes of Paula Abdul, Will Smith, Macy Gray, Lionel Ritchie, Mickey Rooney and Motown Records founder Berry Gordy Jr., just to name a very few.His brothers were gracious to everyone, and served as respectful ambassadors of their brother's last live performance, documented on film. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa's presence made the evening feel like a full-fledged official City of Los Angeles event. Everything about the event felt more like a live show venue than a film premiere.Director Kenny Ortega took the stage to let us all know that we were part of an international premiere including 17 showings around the globe. The film opens with some of the dancers chosen. While it is heartbreaking to realize how the tour never materialized, getting to see their dedication is inspiring.Aside from the fact that this is a rehearsal documentary, for the most part, there is still plenty of energy throughout the film that makes it more than worth experiencing. Unlike more self-aware documentaries and dance films, this movie really allows for a glimpse into the heart, mind and soul of an entertainer who truly gave his life for his art. It is now more clear than ever, why dance aficionados both Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire tipped their hats to MJ while he was at his peak. It's important to remember that those two men never drew the crowds or had the singing career that MJ had. In fact, no one ever has.Despite his professional and very commanding presence, the respect he had for everyone around him was evident. Nearly every time he gave guidance, he'd temper the request with "It's all for love," almost as if he were apologizing. There is also a fair amount of humorous interaction between MJ, Director Kenny Ortega, the dancers and crew. "That's why we have rehearsals," he said a couple of times in the film.There are moments of pure brilliance such as with "I Just Can't Stop Loving You," the soaring interlude of "Human Nature" or "I'll Be There" - which could effectively bring tears to fan's eyes.The complete, modern Tim Burton-like makeover and funked up choreography for "Thriller" was most impressive, as were the jazzy notes and West Side Story-esqe choreography for "The Way You Make Me Feel." The old gangster film "Gilda" inserts for "Smooth Criminal" was the most complete and thoroughly satisfying experience."Earth Song," "Man In The Mirror," and "Heal The World" ? were part of small films more like represented in one fashion or another.There were many people speculating as to whether Michael would have approved of this film. It is important to keep in mind that most of the footage shot for this film was done with an eye toward creating a video diary for the artists. It really wasn't intended for Michael Jackson's fan base to see ? especially without his knowledge and consent. However, given the circumstances, as Michael Jackson was a person who spent his life creating art for his fans, there is no doubt in my mind that he would have wanted this footage to be seen by his fans. He did know that he was being filmed during rehearsal.Given that MJ always said he felt most alive on stage and never got to share this show with his fans personally, it is clear that he would have wanted to share the hard work and artistic genius that was put into these rehearsals. As Oscar Wilde said "Art is never finished, only abandoned." Be sure to watch through the credits in their entirety for a little extra footage.</fullReview>

Even at 50 , he didn't show one slightest sign of losing his voice.Here, we are able to witness the great show that MJ was going to pull off. We see his professionalism, dedication and kindness. Even after a long hiatus, no one has forgotten the king of pop as everyone looks up to him. If your not a fan then this documentary will give you a insight in why he is the biggest selling artist of all time . There no argument that his final concerts were going to be epic, something totally special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fitting tribute...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, for the record, I am not an avid Michael Jackson fan. I admired him as a performer and he also wrote a few tunes I have enjoyed over the years. Having said that, I thought it was a great loss to music when he died suddenly a year ago today. So I thought it would be apt to have a look at his final work on this anniversary to see just what his fans have been talking about all these years.Michael had planned to do a series of shows at the O2 arena in London starting July 2009. This documentary shows footage of him rehearsing for these shows in Los Angeles. There is no commentary, just Michael, the dancers and musicians going through various numbers and routines in preparation for the show. This footage is interspersed by interviews with various band members and dancers. The interviews were all recorded before his death so we get a sense of great anticipation from all the performers. There is also footage of special set pieces that were to be projected throughout the show. For instance, we are shown the making of a special piece of footage shot in 3D for the song 'Thriller'. All the hits are here, too many to mention, but the list even includes the Michael Jackson songs I like! I guess all the ardent Michael Jackson fans will have already seen this one.First of all I must say that from what I could see on the screen it looks like it would have been a spectacular show. All the set pieces looked really great and Michael, although his singing voice was a little subdued in places, put in a great performance every time. I guess because it was not the finished article, and never will be, it does suffer a little for that. Over all, a must-see for all those ardent Michael Jackson fans out there. For those, like me, who have a passing interest, it's still recommended because if you love music it's worth seeing as an insight into the way Michael Jackson went about his work. Is it a fitting tribute? I'm really not the man to judge, but if you pressed me, I'd have to say yes.My score: 7.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Tribute to Jackson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Is It (2009)*** (out of 4) This now somewhat legendary film captures interviews, rehearsal and backstage footage of the preparations of Michael Jackson's fifty sold-out shows in London. The documentary runs just under two hours and for the most part it's all Michael doing his thing on stage. If someone is expecting anything other than a concert film then they're going to be rather disappointed because this film, thankfully, leaves out all the melodrama and instead just takes a look at the music being prepared for what seems like a fantastic show. I can't say I'm the biggest Jackson fan in the world but I still enjoyed this film quite a bit. The lighting, setting and dancing all seemed quite impressive to my eyes and Jackson himself comes off very well here. I think the most fascinating thing about this film is just being able to see all the behind the scenes stuff that goes into making a big production like this. It was fun seeing Jackson sitting back and watching the dancers auditioning for the concerts. It was fun seeing Jackson watching everything come together and we even get some nice moments of him just (apparently) having fun. It's also fun seeing some of the young dancers tell their stories of growing up watching Jackson as a kid and now being able to perform beside him. None of the music sequences are full blow, hard rocking versions since these were just rehearsals but they are certainly good enough to really making you want to dance around. They Don't Care About Us, Thriller, The Way You Make Me Feel, Man in the Mirror and especially I'll Be There are the musical highlights. It's doubtful Jackson haters will watch this film and walk away feeling anything different but fans will certainly eat this up and those semi-fans like myself will enjoy seeing all of this but it will lead to an eventual sadness because we'll never know what the actual concerts would have been like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>first, the movie itself: it is good, not super but heartfelt and personal.Mr. Ortega, thank you! u did it right, no matter what they say...great persons tend to gather great people around them. you will see a lot of wonderful artists around MJ to wonder and enjoy.is it worth seeing? yes, it is. absolutely. hate it later, but see it first.so what is the message? unfortunately, of all the reviewers, only -cynthiadwarner- got it... MJ: "I really feel that nature is trying so hard to compensate for man's mismanagement of the planet. Because the planet is sick. Like a fever. If we don't fix it now. It's at the point of no return. This is our LAST chance to fix the problem that we have... where it's like a runaway train... and the time has come. THIS IS IT."to my understanding, this is what the movie is about (no matter how much or less a fan of MJ i'm)think about it before it is just too late and THIS becomes the END.why is it that i feel that we've already lost it...God bless us allRIP Sir</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Better than a concert, better than a front row seat, better than a faux-leather red jacket with lots of zippers.Chuh mon! THIS IS IT is Michael Jackson up close and personal - at least as up close and personal as an insulated, world-harried, neurotic, consummate performer could ever hope to be.Some of the best Michael Jackson footage ever released. In this compilation of rehearsal footage from Jackson's planned 50-date 2010 tour (derailed due to his untimely death), we are not presented with that weird public persona that Jackson obviously loved to cultivate; we see the artist as musician, dancer, songwriter; an auteur with his sequin-gloved fingers in every aspect of this massive production pie.Don't expect a documentary about the artist's last days or any kind of tragic retrospective putting a rubber stamp on his legacy; we go into this movie knowing Jackson is not just a legend, but a man who's presence alone can guarantee that even this disjointed, "unproduced" filmic record (of his REHEARSALS, no less) will generate interest, income and controversy.Kenny Ortega (HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL series) directs the stage show, and also directs this film, which is simply bare bones rehearsal rehearsal rehearsal. And that's why it's so damn cool. Musicians will enjoy the privilege of seeing the final stages of Jackson's empty arena dress rehearsal, complete with raw, undoctored audio, production crew directives, and Jackson creating a few cues and overseeing some final arrangements like a regular band guy. While all you "other people" will get off on just seeing Jackson. Doing anything.There is no narration to tell us who this is, where we are (Staples Center, Los Angeles), what we're doing (final rehearsals for London's O2 Arena) or even what year it is (mid 2009). By film's end, you'd never know the subject of the film is no longer with us. The final text simply reads: Michael Jackson / King of Pop / Love is forever.Movie opens with emotional testimonials from dancers hired for the show - who are now all out of work. (Too soon for that gag?) Hee-hee! Chuh mon! No crash-cuts, or 1-second edits - this clear, steady footage is taken from two or three cameras shooting Behind-The-Scenes and production footage for study purposes, and much of it would have ended up as supplementary DVD material. The production is nearing stage-ready; most songs are performed in their entirety.Wanna Be Startin' Somethin,' Jam, Smooth Criminal, They Don't Care About Us, Thriller, I Just Can't Stop Loving You, Beat It, I Want You Back, Black or White, Billie Jean, and more. But - surprisingly - no moonwalk.Jackson's dancing is, of course, a thriller, and he more than matches the backing dancers literally half his age. Though 50, there is no sign of exhaustion or complaining (at least, none is shown), and all his little botty boys ostentatiously applaud him every time they are standing floor-side and watching him solo. Little obsequious street-cred wiggas, with their Hammer pants and caps backwards.The Way You Make Me Feel - and Jackson's major shortcoming glares at us from the stage. He's no ladies' man. His interaction with the female dancer struttin' the stage is cringe-worthy; looks like "the way she makes him feel" is like a Just Friend, instead of a dangerous lover. He looks way more comfortable when surrounded by buff wiggas.A short video montage of the Jackson 5 during I'll Be There brings a tear, especially when we see the crew on the floor all raising their arms and swaying in unison. All in fun, but they would never have realized they would be the last "audience" to do so. Jackson gives a heartfelt "I love you" to each of his brothers after that song.Earth Song brings its contradictory environmental message, which is part of the theme of the tour - Share The Love and Save The Trees. The backing video shows a young girl walking through a jungle, enveloping herself in its wonder, but nowhere in any jungle is there a natural condition where a girl wearing those synthetics and using that styling mousse would be amidst that jungle. Maybe a naked ebony-skinned native, but this Disney caricature would be eaten by a jaguar in two minutes. You know where you are? You're in the jungle, baby. You're gonna die!By the way, Mr. Jackson, your semi-trailers and airplanes transporting this massive stage show can't be too good for the jungle.Hooooooe! Chuh mon! The film does wind down towards the end. They don't go out with a bang, but with the introspective Man in the Mirror.We could speculate forever on why THIS IS IT was released, and each reason is a part of the whole; part exploitation, part capitalism, part legacy, part recoup, part tribute, part time capsule... That gag about all those people out of work is no gag. Insurance clauses would have started flying across lawyers' desks since the King of Pop's death in June 2009. And behind closed doors where the only king is the bottom line, there is no talk of insensitivity when recouping money for the army of personnel who blocked out a whole year to work with the Jackson entourage. The puling fans shouting "too soon" and "disrespect" actually think their opinion matters in these decisions. Well, as long as they keep buying the stuff, the arbiters of Jackson's merchandise will keep lying to them that it does.In March 2009, at a press conference - wearing his coquettish public persona - Jackson announced the THIS IS IT tour, calling it his "final curtain call." The King of Pop is dead. Long Live the King. Chuh mon!--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"This is It", the first concert film I can think of that's entirely pieced together with rehearsal footage, is a noble, perhaps necessary topper to Michael Jackson's career. It's hard to believe you wouldn't know this, but when Jackson died this summer, he had been rehearsing at Staples Center in L.A. for a 50-show engagement in London. This film is a compilation of the rehearsal footage lovingly (and meticulously) edited together by director Kenny Ortega in a love letter to the entertainment behemoth Jackson was.Here's my theory on Michael Jackson. When the music was brilliant ("Off the Wall", "Thriller"), he was a musical genius who had a bit of controversy over his relationships with children. When the music went south ("Invincible"), he was an alleged child molester. The most disappointing part of Jackson's late career was that he didn't perform often enough, leaving the world to focus solely on the allegations and tabloid minefield that was his personal life. He needed these London concerts. This thought came racing to my mind immediately upon seeing Jackson's first song in "This is It", "Wanna Be Startin' Something". He floats, pops, locks, and lives in the music. He reminds you immediately that he is a performer not to be ignored, and unfortunately it took his death to get the most attention he's had in a decade.The concert footage here cuts between three or four different shoots (or more), of varying degrees of film and video stock quality. But "This Is It" comes pre-packaged with a built-in pass on all tech elements. I knew it wasn't 'finished', so I wasn't expecting Kubrickian prowess (any excuse to use the word "Kubrickian"). There was even one moment where a big stage show effect (a bulldozer crashes through the stage) was never realized, so the film cuts to the 3D rendering of what the effect might look like, but you can't fault the filmmakers for this move, it was all the footage they were working with.One tech element needs to be mentioned by name ? Editors Don Brochu, Tim Patterson and Kevin Stitt. Not only was the footage meshed together in a palpable concoction, but I couldn't help but wonder what ended up on the cutting room floor. Jackson looks really good in this. Was there really no drama? No celebrity tantrums? If they were captured on video, they were cut around nicely by the editors. Perhaps too nicely. The MJ fans will love the way their hero is represented. Movie fans might want to see more of the challenge in putting up this monstrosity of a show. There isn't much backstage in this show that's compelling. There are shots of the making of the short films included in the concert and extra rehearsals with the band, but nothing ever really seemed to be problematic. I mean, even Scorsese couldn't get the Stones set list until right before they went on.I think I also enjoyed "This is It" more than I thought because the film stuck to my personal favorite MJ tunes ? "Billie Jean", "Black or White", "Thriller" and the outstanding, high-energy "Smooth Criminal". With as large a catalog as Jackson has, it's impossible to include all the songs you might like, but I was fine doing without the inane "Bad" or any of the other songs from the Luke-warm "Dangerous". And there is a SICK amount of dancing in this movie. We get a very brief introduction to the dancers at the top of the film, who couldn't be more excited to land the job of working with the legend himself. As the rehearsals progress, they dance their ASSES off. Too often, I think the lightweight flakes that have emerged in Jackson's wake over the last ten years employ dancers because they really don't have much else going on ? no band, no lyrics to really sink teeth into and no personality. In "This is It", the dancers are the icing on an already tasty cake.The unforgettable moment of "This is It" comes during the end of "They Don't Care About Us". As the song ends and the lights fade, just before darkness covers the stage, Michael Jackson drops all the attention he's given his show, he sheds the focus he applies to rehearsal and the desire to get it right and he settles into a brief, but utterly playful smile. Even with an empty arena, on stage is where Michael Jackson was ultimately happy, where he knew he could get the only unconditional love he had left. Then the lights faded.</fullReview>

I could see that in this movie. He was a legend. A king of pop. He will be dearly missed. RIP Michael. You are in another world. Somewhere in which people love and care. People in this dirty world were not good enough for you. They almost killed you when they accused you of being a child abuser. I am so sorry you had to go through all these things. RIP Michael.

		<shortDescription>Michael's Final Bow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember being a child and watching the music videos on MTV (when MTV was cool) and gasping at the artistic capabilities of music artists. Pearl Jam's "Jeremy," Soul Asylum's "Runaway Train," and Nirvana's "Smell Like Teen Spirit" are some of the best music videos of all time. Among those three named, there are five or six of Michael Jackson's impressive career videos that goes along with that list. "Black &amp; White" being my favorite of all his videos while others jump on the "Thriller" train. Prior to Jackson's passing last June, I remember hearing about his final tour and how I would have loved to go. Would I have went? Probably not. I appreciate his music as well as many artists but it's really hard for me to spend nearly $1000 dollars for nose-bleed seats in an arena.This Is It directed by Kenny Ortega explores Michael Jackson, the artist. I finally got to see Michael at work, being artistic, making choices, everything associated with Michael and Music. I feel like I finally went to a Michael Jackson concert. The shots of Michael's dance sequences and rehearsals do not have him at top form because it was in fact rehearsal but even at 50% he's better than most.There is the utmost respect in the film, not touching on any scandal, family, anything that diminishes the memory of the musical artist that is Michael Jackson. Michael's respect for the environment and his fans is the most beautiful part of the picture. He loved us, he loved us all. He appreciated our devotion and at times, our frustration with him. But no one can deny how he has made a scar in the lives of every music lover.In other words, it would have been a really good concert.***1/2/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The musical genius that was Michael Jackson.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Jackson who died last June, was an amazing singer and dancer. Was often imitated, but never duplicated. He was looking for a comeback,trying to get through a scandal that nearly ruined him. This tour would have been his comeback, it would have put him on top again. But sadly it's a reminder of the tour that almost was.This documentary is the making of Michael Jacksons upcoming tour half the time we don't feel like where watching a film, more like we are taking on an experience. On rehearsing the dancing, and singing. And making videos for the songs, from Thriller to Smooth Criminal. And the fact that Michael can be a perfectionist,but other times he can be humbly, by letting his dancers and his band shine as well. It was brilliantly directed by Kenny Ortega, and very well filmed.This Is It best shows the memory of Michael Jackson 1958-2009.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always been a huge MJ fan, actually since the age of 8. I have seen him in concert many times and I was so happy to have tickets to one of the London concerts! I felt so lucky and excited. Then the bad news came and my world fell apart. I cried for days and I am still not doing much better. I feel as if I lost a very special part of me the day MJ passed away! I wasn't sure whether to go and see "This it it", but I was too curious and so I went again and again. I have seen it 3 times by now but since they extended it, I will go and see it again next week! I cant wait. This movie is amazing. Its just Michael, him dancing, singing and being himself :) He is so sweet and funny and every time I leave the cinema with a HUGE smile on my face :) I wish I could see the movie every day, it just makes me feel warm and happy inside. Thank you Michael :) For those who haven't seen it yet, go see it! You wont regret it! Its all for L.O.V.E. !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is Michael Jackson, still brilliant at the last</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As music documentaries go, This Is It is not really so unusual. Kenny Ortega, of the High School Musical franchise, is good at covering song and dance, but he's a journeyman rather than a genius and his aim is to please not to thrill or explore. There's not much variety here. Despite some film shoots within the film shoot of elaborate projection pieces to be used in the tour that never was, and a few quick emotional and adulatory interviews, cheers from the crew so to speak, most of this consists of rehearsals, and not from many points of view. There's a vast team on hand of dancers, singers, musicians, and stage crew, yet we don't get an in depth picture of their work. The music is all pretty familiar.But on the other hand, this is the last living record we have of one of the great performers of the last century, because the show that was to play in fifty cities for the fifty-year-old singer and dancer who had not toured for a decade, was Michael Jackson. And whatever you may have heard, he is in top form, and this is a close look at his artistry and genius. And also, ironically perhaps, the nicest of men, with a heart of gold.Rumors were about that Jackson was "frail" (he is very thin) and faltering. He holds back, especially to save his voice. Sometimes maybe he's just going loosely through the motions of the dances. But Michael Jackson going loosely through the motions is still something to see. And there's no faltering. In fact what's striking is the man's form and discipline at all times; his professionalism; his humility and good manners; and his perfectionism. He knows exactly what he wants. He knows the tempos and rhythms. Mostly he wants the songs to sound the way they do on the albums. The performances will differ, the performers have been hired for the tour. But he's not looking for innovation; he's looking for perfection.As for the dancing, which is the main thing, of course it doesn't have the energy and excitement of earlier MJ performances. But it's composed, precise, stylish, elegant at all times. He is the leader. It is a unique pleasure, a matter of awe really, to watch him move. His moves were always evolving at every stage of his long performing life, and they're at a further point here. Above all watching him is to delight in the precision, the clarity of the movies, the extension and grace. There's no sign of aging in the movement that you see. You do wonder a little bit how he was going to make it through a tour of fifty cities, if he is concerned about saving his voice. We'll never know. But there would have been ways to get around that. He could have done it. This was no vanity project. The confidence and composure are there. And genius, otherworldly talent.It's nice to see Michael Jackson going out this way: working in good form, and working cooperatively and with authority. As crew members say, he's "hands-on" all the way. He's there watching all the details, not hounding or obnoxious but, again, precise, pointing out when the tempo picks up too fast or doesn't go down slow enough or where a moment needs to be allowed to breathe. You'd think he was directing the whole show (which he wasn't), but doing so seamlessly and with a light but firm touch. This certainly was a consummate professional. And despite the fact that his education might have been sketchy, his world on the solipsistic side, he speaks articulately and sensibly. He sets a good standard of communication and leadership. He may be a tricky megastar with a history of erratic behavior, but we see none of that. Good manners and clear communication prevail. Mostly he points out others' mistakes, but always gently. Sometimes he points out his own mistake. "I'm sorry guys," he says at one point. "There is no second verse. We just go right to the bridge." But then, he forgives himself as readily as he forgives others: "That's why we have rehearsals."That's why we have rehearsals! Yes! But thankfully, we had these also because of the record they provide of what it's like to rehearse a big production and what it was like to work with Michael. The sequences are touching and beautiful, and the music recalls some magic moments, but they're also sad, because they reassure us of what we have lost. Michael could still put on an incredible show. This might have been one of the most tasteful and meaningful tours. This one seems to go easy on the corn and the crotch-grabbing (though a dancing coach is seen practicing a group of male dancers in just that). It's also without a moon-walk. And that's okay, because Jackson is replaying old songs, but not copying himself. His moves still feel improvised, natural to him, never forced. They flow out of him and are part of him. This is his essence. And he's having a good time. And shy shouldn't he be? This is a big crew packed with firm admirers, and their only desire is to please him.Despite the years of scandal and craziness, there are people that want to be Michael Jackson. For them he is what he was for himself, a performer to emulate. While you may see this as a promotional film, its subject is something worth promoting, pure pop genius and a dancer even Fred Astaire, for very good reasons -- there's a kinship there -- admired. For them and for any of us, this film is a worthy and fascinating record, something, like the Motown 25 performance, that you can watch many times and not get tired of. It's all about the moves. Above all this is a celebration of the art of dance.</fullReview>

If anyone has a comment on that i welcome it and as an Indian we always welcome suggestions and think more than twice before reacting. Michael's tour to India cannot be forgotten and i hope you imagine every villager in India knows Michael's name is an understatement considering the era they were bought up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I truly love Michael Jackson ever since the first time I heard about him. He is the greatest singer, dancer, music composer, song writer, actor, entertainer and person the world has ever known. He is recognised as the King of Pop but that title is so limited for him because he is much, much more than that.When I heard about his death I was about to faint and I felt sick, then I spent about five hours watching his music videos and I couldn't sleep all night. I never seen Michael Jackson perform live so I really wanted to see him at the O2 arena in London but sadly that cannot happen and now this movie is here so we can see him on the big screen.I was really looking forward to this movie and counting the days remaining towards the release date when it was announced. This is the only movie I got the advanced tickets otherwise I always get the tickets on the day I see the movie. I usually get popcorn and juice at the movies but not for this one because I just wanted to focus on him.Anyway This is it is really it. The movie was fantastic, amazing, heartfelt, emotional, colourful, glossy, and a visual treat. The director Kenny Ortega has done a really good job with the movie because there were about a hundred hours of footage of the rehearsals and he picked the out the best ones and compiled them in the right order creating a really good screenplay and the way the This is it concert would've been.It is really hard to pick out the best bits because it was brilliant right from the very first second to the last. During the Human Nature song my heart was flying and I loved the new segments of Thriller and Earth Song.I also felt really sad while watching this film because they are Michael's last days mainly the They Don't Care About Us song which was shot two days before his death. At the end of every song I starting applauding in the cinema and everyone else started to cheer as well. Although I never applauded in the cinema before.Overall anything related to Michael Jackson is always great whether it is songs, music videos, interviews or even movies. If there is anything Michael can not do is make anything awful. I only his music and no one else's. Off The Wall, Thriller, Bad, Dangerous, HIStroy, Blood On The Dance Floor and Invincible are my all time most favourite albums.Michael Jackson may not be with us anymore but his legacy will live on forever and he still is and always will be the King of Kings. Michael Jackson I want to say "Thank You!" not "Goodbye".</fullReview>

It was really good. This movie is very colorful and has awesome visuals. It shows how much time, effort, and details goes into a concert. Some of my favorite songs were They Don't Care About Us, "Shake Your Body Down to the Ground, I Just Can't Stop Loving You, Thriller, and Beat It! I loved the new version of Thriller, it looked creepy and awesome. Michael Jackson had an awesome singing voice, and will live on through his music.

		<fullReview>My Take: A breathtaking tribute to the late Michael Jackson."This is it. The final curtain call" These are the last words of the late Michael Jackson on camera when he announced his "This is It" concert tour; his final live performance which were already sold out. But during his sudden untimely death, the curtain fell much earlier than it should. THIS IS IT, a semi-documentary look on the show that could-have-been, is a surefire event for any fan of the late "King of Pop", it's everything they could have hoped for. I don't know what it would do to Michael's reputations regarding his many controversies, but all things aside, THIS IS IT is not about to make a statement, it means to show as a master showman at his peak as an entertainer.I'm not the biggest Michael Jackson fan, but I love his songs. I couldn't ignore the many controversies that surrounded him, but his talents speak for itself. Which is probably what THIS IS IT aims to show. What we're looking at here is a series of behind-the-scenes clips of his concert, it is, in a word, incredible. What a show this could have been! Stage director Kenny Ortega and his crew and not to mention the excellent dancers have put up a show that honors the presence of the King of Pop himself. There's use of many camera tricks, particularly the green-screen work where Michael is cleverly edited into a scene from GILDA and A LONELY PLACE for the opening of his "Smooth Criminal" segment (since "Smooth Criminal" is probably one of my favorite of his songs and videos, I loved that segment). But above all, there's Michael himself. Now we're not talking about an aged performer here. Although it's just rehearsals, Michael shows his undeniable strength and energy. In more ways than one, he's still the spunky revolutionary entertainer he always was.THIS IS IT will only run for two weeks in theaters everywhere, and I'm glad that I was able to see it. I may have not bought the tickets for the concert itself, but I certainly have to see this film. Not only was it a first-hand look at the show that never was, it was a first hand look at a master at work. Not only are we finally able to see him sing as we might have seen him on the show, but we also get to see him decide his own choreography during the sequences. It was definitely HIS show, and now we know what that really means. THIS IS IT is a spectacle to behold, a great look at Michael Jackson as not a magnet of controversy and gossip, but as a great entertainer at his best. For the fans who haven't seen it yet (which might be impossible), go ahead and see it as soon as possible. This is truly it! Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved the film, less rocking out, more thought provoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't realize I was a Michael Jackson fan until he died. At that point, with all the media coverage I realized that his music was part of the fabric of my early 20's &amp; 30's. I grew up on Thriller and the moonwalk. As so many pundits made clear, we all got distracted with MJ the kook, and lost sight of MJ the musical genius. This movie is all about MJ the musical genius, and one sees his talent, his dedication, his amazing stamina (drugs notwithstanding), his still awesome dance moves, and his extra-worldly voice. He is just extraordinary. I wouldn't have gone to his concert, and yet after seeing this movie I realize that would have been a shame. I was expecting to come to the movie and rock-out to the music, instead it was a thought provoking documentary with great, great dancing and some of the greatest hits of our time. It may be one or two songs too long, but bear with it, it has a strong ending -- well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie with wonderful visuals and musics. First of all, this movie means a lot to me as being one of Michael Jackson's fans. What was I expecting before I watch the movie ? I was expecting more like a documentary, little shots from his concert preparations and some sections from his life. What did I find ? A movie with full of his concert preparations before the concert. Am I satisfied ? Fully.To tell the truth, there is no other singer on earth that has such a high level stage performance. Usually and unfortunately, the lady singers prefer to go up to the stage with sexy dresses and some little light shows while male singers cover the stage with handsome dancers and some light shows. However, once I watched this movie, I once again realized that, no one is even near Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson always has the potential to raise the level to such a level that, it usually takes a couple of years for the other singers to reach him. And most of them even never succeed to reach his level. I'm sure if he were alive today, and those concerts were able to be done, he'd once again prove the whole world that he's still #1 on stage.Unfortunately none of us will have the chance to see all those beautiful actions becoming real, but from what I see in the movie is already beyond my expectations.To see Michael Jackson, who is a man of love, acting right before you and knowing that none of these would ever come real is a very depressing end. And as being one of his fans, I and my girl friend couldn't hold ourselves crying in "they don't really care about us". I suppose there is no better explanation than those tear drops regarding the meaning of this movie for beloved Michael Jackson's fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Is It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beginning Thoughts: After seeing this terrific documentary on Michael Jackson, I now have a new respect for the king of Pop and Roll. This is no ordinary Hannah Montana/Jonas Brothers concert we're getting here, this is a movie about the concert that was supposed to be, but never happened. And it was for the first time I actually bought a ticket to a popular icon without feeling embarrassed or being robbed of my 10 bucks. It's just wonderful.The Good: I've never been a fan of Michael Jackson until now. None of the music numbers that MJ sings are cringe-inducing nor will it make you squirm. In fact, I felt I was doing some of his moves in my seat. I pretty much loved everything about this documentary, especially in the first half; in which everyone was expressing their excitement to dance along with Michael Jackson himself. Sad, yes. But it's also fascinating nonetheless. And I was surprised to find out that Kenny Ortega actually directed this. For once, he actually knew what he was doing with a fascinating subject. Also in my audience, at times people where having good laughs when we were supposed to laugh, but most of the time the audience was silent. It comes to show that the audience respects the legend without having to scream out "OH MY GOD, IT'S MICHAEL JACKSON!" I wonder if people respected him like respecting Elvis if he was dead and made a documentary like that. In my opinion, not very likely. And I'm glad that this movie was rated PG so that at least everyone will get a chance to see this wonderful documentary. Even though it's labeled: PG for Some Suggestive Choreography and Scary Images(which it does), i'm sure kids will be fine by watching this since there's nothing too scary about it; even though it is, with Michael Jackson of course, a little suggestive. I hope this gets a chance to stay for another 2 or more weeks, and I'm sure it will. And besides, if that HM concert in 3D got more than a 2 week engagement, this will definitely succeed in doing so.The Bad: Now as much as I enjoyed this film, I will say that the movie is a little long for a documentary. And I fear that even though kids will be fine with it, they might get a little bored and fall asleep. Then again, those statements do not make sense. Because even though it is a little long, there really shouldn't be anything cut of the final product. So I guess there really isn't anything bad about this film.The Ugly: No ugliness detected.Final Verdict: Overall, this movie deserves the attention from not only Michael Jackson fans, but from people who don't have an appreciation for Michael Jackson. Because I swear, once you're out of the theater, you will be humming the song Thriller and doing MJ's WOO-HOO for a week. Forget that this is a movie, this is an event. A well-deserved 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"This Is It" is a fine collection of The KING OF POP's final energetic rehearsals for the most awaited show of this century, which sadly couldn't see the limelight of reality. It's like MICHAEL'S last precious gift for his countless fans, who were desperately waiting for his grand comeback on stage. A well conceived idea to satisfy the inner urge of every individual who loved MJ, the feature is a simple &amp; honest presentation of his trial performances amongst hundreds of dancers and crew members.With no support of additional gimmicks, graphics or melodramatic moments, the film truly delivers what was being promoted, the elaborate clippings of MJ's lavish on-stage rehearsals and that's it. Neither interested in any controversy nor indicating any mysterious happenings in those few days, the back stage docu-feature is just pure &amp; clean entertainment especially prepared for Jackson's die-hard fans as his last offering. Surprisingly, as speculated in the news, not even for one second Jackson seems to be ill or on medication of any sort in the rehearsals. Looking at MJ practicing hard with full spirits and the preparations being planned at a grand scale, it was indeed going to be one of the best shows ever in the history of entertainment. But as life always has some hidden plans in its kitty, the event was only meant to be seen as the loving memories of the KING. Amusingly the feature also showcases many other creative abilities of the Master Craftsmen apart from his world famous skills of a singer, composer, lyricist, dancer and choreographer. He actively participates in stage planning, presentation and even direction of his "Final Curtain Show". Especially concerned about the start and finish of his each &amp; every composition chosen for the event, he humbly instructs his co- dancers, musicians and director, explaining the exact details of what he wants to be there in front of his fans. And these are those exclusive unseen sequences, which make it a must watch for every MJ fan and lover of music living anywhere in the world. The movie ends with one of his most meaningful songs appreciated worldwide, called "Earth Song". And the song brings out the hidden, sensitive and thinking persona of the Master on the stage. He beautifully talks with his crew, explaining the thought process behind the song and asks them to live a peaceful life, loving and caring about each other like a big family. His message may not have reached many in the exact way and his meaningful works may have got lost in those unwanted &amp; over famous controversies. But for his fans, he will always be remembered as the First and Last KING OF POP who celebrated music on this planet for 50 years. And as wished by MJ himself, every true appreciator of art &amp; music, would love to see this lovely world, living with peace and love forever. But there is only one person with whom you can initiate the holy process and that's "The Man In The Mirror"????.!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating &amp; Sad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the beginning of 2009,Michael Jackson announced that he would be undertaking a tour of the United Kingdom,that would consist of 50 shows that would showcase most aspects of his career,and after which would step down &amp; retire from show business. A few months later,Michael &amp; a cadre of top notch musicians,singers,dancers &amp; technical crew began a grueling series of rehearsals for this tour. Tour &amp; stage director, Kenny Ortega arranged for these rehearsals to be recorded on video tape as an ongoing work project so they could see the progress they were making. Michael &amp; company finished their rehearsals for that evening &amp; said good night until the next day. By now,as everybody knows,Michael Jackson died later that night as a result of complications,due to a drug overdose of a lethal mixture of various drugs,(potentially)administered by his physician,Dr. Conrad Murray (who has yet to be found for questioning). Kenny Ortega arranged for a compilation of some of the best moments of these video tapes to be transferred to film,so that Michael Jackson's fans can experience what could/should have happened. We see some of the lucky chosen ones who would make up the band,singers,dancers,etc. We also get to see just what a massive production this concert tour would have been,if it came to be. Michael's fan base will be doing back flips seeing/hearing their favourite anthems being performed (although at times we only get to see/hear snippets of songs). There is no doubt about it,this is probably the best testimonial to M.J. that currently exists. For me,it was both a fascinating &amp; sad film to watch,as this is a document of a tour that never happened (and will never happen). Word is that this film in it's opening night went through the roof in terms of ticket sales (and internationally,and not just domestic,as the film was released world wide). Although the film is in the English language,there are actually English subtitles to translate some of the spoken text,that is at times not always easy to hear. Rated PG by the MPAA for some suggestive material (i.e.Michael's habit of crotch grabbing),as well as some scary moments during the 'Thriller' segment that may be a bit intense for smaller viewers</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly and Amazing Talent and Artist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are looking for a high paced, action, plot-driven thriller, This is It is not it for you. However, if a movie that exposes the raw essence of passion and creative genius is what you're looking for, you've found gold. This is it gives viewers a peek into the hard work of putting together an experience that would have blown your socks off. The movie, which chronicles the last rehearsals before Michael Jackson's untimely death, does not show a man who looks like he is about to die. While Jackson appears on the very thin side, his dancing and his energy show him at the top of his game. There are a few instances in which he talks of saving his voice and where he seems slightly tired, however, for the most part, his stamina is greater than the dancers who are half his age. The saddest part for me was listening to the dancers in the beginning when they talk about how this is a dream come true for them, and how after all of their practice, they will get to perform on the stage with their idol and inspiration in front of an audience. While they did get to work with the King of pop, unfortunately, they were unable to realize the last part of the dream as he died two weeks before the first concert. Michael Jackson's love for dance, music and the world is evident as his motivation throughout the film. He truly was an amazing talent and artist. Although I was never really a Michael Jackson fan, I think his concert would have been incredible and I would have loved to have been there. Michael Jackson - This is It will only be in theaters for a short time. With the level of interest and the quality of the film, I am hoping that it will eventually be on DVD. I highly recommend seeing this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was OK and I know it was pieced together it was not shot intending to be a movie but I think it could have been better. I expected it to be louder than it was if that makes any sense. THE BEST part of the movie was the last 20 minutes or so where it was MORE MICHAEL and less of everything and everyone else. It was cool to see what gets put into a MAJOR concert like his and it would have been AWESOME to see the finished result I am sure of that. It was also good to see what a kind person he was and that he let members of his show have a chance to stand out on their own. It was not all "Me, Me, Me". RIP Michael.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael the dancer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The imperfections of a rehearsal actually resulted in a more perfect presentation of Michael Jackson the dancer than we have ever seen on film or video. A major issue that'old-school' dance fans had with MJ,(and all modern popular dancers), was the isolation shots of the feet, (or any other body-part), speed-ups, slow-downs, and any other camera tricks that took away from real-time, camera 'pulled back', whole-body shots of the dance. Here, for the first time on film as an adult, is MJ in full-body, real-time, unaltered shots for extended dances. The good news is that MJ's up to the challenge: He may well have been moving better than ever, with an almost supernatural relaxation even when executing the crispest of moves, and independence/coordination only apparent when we can see the whole Michael in the shot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After attending a church service (as a guest) and the minister pleading for $18 million dollars to expand the compound, This Is It, helped me feel redeemed! The movie was an act of love, as the concert would have been. After seeing what was in store for those fortunate enough to have purchased tickets, I believe it would have been the best concert ever! Micheals energy, genius but above all his beautiful and loving spirit was inspiring. Kenny Ortega was so loving to him. The interaction of the dancers, the singers, the band and all those we had an opportunity to be there - appeared to have been touched by his very soul. The dancers were so in awe and you could see the respect and love they exhibited.It was a beautiful tribute to his love of his craft, humanity and the condition of our planet. It mad me sad to not have him any longer, but grateful to have been touched by such beauty and love of spirit. He LIVES on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Is It is a fine tribute to Michael Jackson's gifts as an entertainer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two notable deaths happened on June 25 of this year. The first one was of Farrah Fawcett who had been suffering from cancer and was already in her final throes so her end was not surprising. But the later passing of someone known as the King of Pop sent shock waves throughout the music industry, not to mention millions of his fans, and pretty much ensured his coverage in the media would completely overshadow not only Farrah's death but of anyone else famous that came after her. So it was with that that we are now being presented with rehearsal footage of what would have been a series of final concerts that had the title of the documentary listed above that M. J. was going to do in London. His voice wasn't always at his best as Jackson himself noted to his director Kenny Ortega but his dance moves were as exciting as it had been at his peak during the '80s and '90s. And the surrounding-mostly new-film wraparounds that accompanied many of the numbers brought some fresh excitement that could have overwhelmingly riveted the sold out ticketed audience members to the point of new awesomeness. Certainly I felt that way when classic movie footage of Bogart, Robinson, and especially Hayworth in her iconic "Put the Blame on Maine" number from Gilda was seamlessly blended in with Michael portraying another gangster for "Smooth Criminal" and also when they made a new video version of the "Thriller" number with once again Vincent Price's iconic narration. If there's any sadness I felt during the whole thing, it's whenever they show the musicians, backup singers, and dancers rehearse knowing now that this film is the only exposure they'll get concerning the Michael Jackson experience especially as they all get interviewed about how glad they are performing with him. But that shouldn't take anything away from what was one of the most memorable moments of their lives. This is certainly one of mine. So on that note, This Is It is an excellent tribute to one of the most unique entertainers ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That was it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember as a kid being a huge MJ fan! My sister and I used to LOVE to listen to Thriller and would run screaming when Vincent Price's laugh came on. Honestly, I remember earlier in the year when they announced that he would be touring again, but paid little attention because I knew that it would be impossible for me to see him. My daughters (6&amp;7) liked his music, but became fans after his death. Daily, they get into the car and want to hear any one of his hits. They love him. When he died, I did like many, I looked up his videos to show my daughters who I grew up watching. They instantly were amazed and wanted to know more. My husband and I took the girls to see this yesterday. I asked them what they thought and they said it was "good." For me, I'm not one who likes documentaries, but this was really insightful. I saw several things:1. This was going to be an AMAZING show, and those who had tickets would probably have seen the best show ever. 2. A man of 50, and on the meds he was on could still move and sing. He may not have had the range he had a 20 or 30, but WOW, to see him still in action and wanting to give so much, I was impressed. 3. He was not a pushover. He was a professional and a perfectionist. He knew how to entertain a crowd and what he wanted them to see. The one point in particular was when he was going to start Smooth Criminal. The band hadn't started and Kenny Ortega stopped it and told the band they missed the cue. MJ told him, they were waiting for his cue, and he stood his ground.It's unfortunate that so many took advantage of him. It's unfortunate that his children will not have their father. And it's unfortunate that AEG and "others" will profit/benefit from this movie. As much as I wanted to see this, and am glad I did, it sickens me that those who pushed him and were only looking out for themselves will gain monetarily from this. But I just wanted to see him in action one last time.On a side note....SHAMELESS plug for the new Jackson's show on A&amp;E. Shame on them, they are NO BETTER than AEG, and they I think they have a mutually beneficial thing going. AEG greases the Jackson Brothers palms and in return, the Jackson men show up and promote. Rest in peace MJ, no one can hurt you now and you can be a guardian angel to your precious children.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me tell you first that Im a big fan for Michael, No day in my life passes without at least hearing a song for him and Im serious about that. Let me tell you second that I watched many of his concerts, and noticed that his skill was slightly declining beginning with History tour concerts as you can notice that his moves weren't as perfect as his Dangerous tour concerts, and the 30th anniversary celebration concerts also were less magical than concerts before. After MJ died and his closest friends said that he was healthy and he was rehearsing with complete fitness, I believed that. but now I think I was fooled, After I saw THIS IS IT last night. Yes I was fooled, because michael in this movie doesn't seem like Michael jackson at age 50 healthy and happy and making his old moves, instead, he seems like he returned 20 years back, but taking with him the experience and professionality of a 50 year old king of pop, he's as good as his best eras and even better in some scenes, I couldn't believe my eyes, this man not only didn't grow up, but he was getting younger as well. He made me say to myself, THIS IS HIM, This is MJ, a miracle that can't be repeated. Then I closed my eyes and felt a great pain in my heart that this miracle is OVER. please MJ fans, keep MJ miracle lives in our hearts, never let the legacy die as the body, make it live forever, and may the king of music rest in peace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Jackson is the King of Pop!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like to start by saying that those who have canned this documentary or said that it was a waste of money to buy tickets to see it, you seriously need to get your head out of your rear end and stick it somewhere else where the sun don't shine.This was a pre-concert documentary that showed the talents behind the music that has won the heart and soul of generations by an absolute musical genius, Michael Jackson. The time, the effort, the energy, the intricate details and the heart that Michael Jackson and his crew put into it during the rehearsal of the 'This Is It' concert was phenomenon.This documentary shows what he is all about. A humble loving man who looked out for everyone working with him or for him. Checking every beat, every rhythm and every single note, crafting it to its perfection and then channeling out for the audiences delight and satisfaction. No other singer in this world would put in such an effort as he did.His dance moves are legendary, his voice is heart warming, his music is soothing to the soul and his performance on stage is just out of this world. From the primping pop of 'Wanna be Starting Something' to the feel good rhythm of 'The Way You Make me Feel' are just a taste of why Michael Jackson is considered the greater singer/performer of all time. The stage setup, the choreography, the costumes and the pyrotechnic elements on stage set new boundaries of how a concert should be like. It was well ahead of its time and would have stood the test of times for all times.For those of you who are a MJ fan like me and have seen 'This is It' at the movies will agree with what I have mentioned above, and those of you who are not and have seen the film will not deny of what I have said so far.A must see for everyone and may Allah (God) rest the King of Pop's soul in heaven. We love you Michael. You are the best. May you rest in peace!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very interesting experience...and consider I have never been a fan of Jackson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never been a fan of Michael Jackson (1958-2009).In mid-80's, during the peak of his fame, I was interested in a different type of music than the "pop" one.But, sure, even without being a fan of his music, I cannot deny the impact he has had on the popular culture, and even on the worldwide social structure.It may be something impossible nowadays, but unfortunately, 25 years ago, there were radio stations which were exclusively dedicated to "white" music, promoting racial segregation and intolerance.But with the huge success of the disc Thriller, many of those stations had to change their politics in order to satisfy the listeners.I even have to admit that, even though I am not a big fan of "pop", I liked the video-clip from Thriller very much, thanks to John Landis' brilliant direction and the excellent make-up effects from the great Rick Baker.Now, a quarter of century later, the "king of pop" has gone and we have as a honest tribute to him, the documentary This Is It, directed by Kenny Ortega, who had been a Jackson's collaborator from many decades ago, and whose access to the rehearsals of what was going to be Jackson's new tour do not only let us to have a very interesting look to the organization of a monumental event, but also a simultaneously critical and affectionate "eye" to "MJ", his multiple advisers and his dancer's creative process.All that is accompanied by musical interpretations from the artist's biggest hits, which may not feel as polished as they might have been seen on the real tour, but which definitely feel intense and very entertaining.The truth is that that focus results much more interesting than showing a simple concert.Leaving aside his troubled personal life, his obsession with plastic surgery and eccentric behaviour, here is where we can see Jackson's value as an artist, his passion for the music and the amazing charisma which made him one of the most important interpreters from 20th century.But for having achieved that, Ortega avoids any controversial situation; the ones who are going to see This Is It expecting a sensationalistic parade of gossips and scandals will feel disappointed.So, in summary, This Is It did not make me to become into a fan of Jackson, but it made me have an exciting and very entertaining experience, in spite of having a few fails (for example, I think it should have been deeper and more critical on some moments).So, I recommend this movie with confidence, even if you are not a fan of Jackson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Reminder of His Talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there was any doubt on whether or not Michael Jackson is/was the greatest entertainer of all time-Well, this movie just puts that argument to rest. A man at 50 years of age, still dancing effortlessly and with more charisma than any of his well-trained backup dancers and still singing in tune is something special to watch. After 5-10 minutes into the movie you just become sucked into this outsider's view of this man's world. He spoke very little, but when he did speak, you heard him loud and clear.There's no doubt that Michael Jackson was an odd bird, but he was a true music genius. He knows everything there is to know about his music and what he wants. His vision is so clear to him and completely effortless. There are moments when he's dancing and it's as if he can do all of this in his sleep.I was completely fascinated by him and earned a greater respect for him as an artist and as a person.This movie was very tastefully done by Kenny Ortega. You can tell it was edited by someone who loved and respected Michael Jackson. The movie is about celebrating MJ and what he would have continued to bring to the table as an entertainer had he been given the chance. However, thanks to Ortega and all those involved, we still get a chance to see what he was made of and it is a reminder that Michael Jackson is indeed still the King of Pop and he still had that "It" factor even up until the day of his death.Whether you are a MJ fan or not, this movie will move you and you can't help but walk away with respect and appreciation for what is now lost. I've seen it twice already and thinking of seeing it again. It's definitely worth the price of a movie ticket and more. A+!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Docu-film really showcases Michael Jackson in his creativity spirit. He was involved in every aspect of the rehearsal and it was going to be awesome. He goes through most of his number 1 hits adding the right amount of embellishments. This concert was going to be like no other before it, from 3D sterioscopic scenes, to life-like mechanical props, this would have been something else. I really enjoyed seeing this creative genius at work. The amount of planning that was going into this was unbelievable. So many talented individuals on and off stage. Any Michael Jackson fan would enjoy this film without a doubt. The High Definition footage used looks real sharp and the music is top notch. I cannot wait for this come out on Bluray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artistic Commitment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well well well. Just saw the much-talked-about film of the late King of Pop Michael Jackson (less than three hours ago), and let me just say 'Wow'. Look, I've always admired Michaels artistry. There is no question that he is absolutely brilliant on stage. However, in all fairness, I must say that there is nothing really new in this concert rehearsal. Michael Jackson performs the same popular songs, follows the same routine, dances the same choreography, incites the same emotion. If you have seen the HIStory tour footage then you've pretty much seen this. But wait, before you make me walk the plank, let me expound on the highlights of this film. The material is nothing new, fine, but what Michael has done is take the all-too-familiar material to a new heightened level, he has upgraded some dance moves by free-styling and rediscovering the nuances of his past tours. Like for instance when he was singing 'I Just Cant Stop Loving You' with that girl, towards the end he translates the lyrical content with momentary genuineness, unrehearsed but deep and convincing and believable. His charisma can turn an atheist into a believer, you know what I mean. He inspires. Some people were disappointed at not seeing his signature moonwalk. It takes a trained eye to see that there was a moonwalk, two in fact. The first one was when he did his sequence for Billie Jean and the second for Smooth Criminal. The reason why people don't 'see' the moonwalk is because the move is taken from an unpopular and unjustified angle. Well, this was a rehearsal, you know, it's not like he knew he was going to die and so had to make sure that the untrained eye get's to see it. One other thing, the media and fans speak of Jackson as if he is some kind of deity. Look, with all due respect, he ain't one. OK. This film shows that he is all man and all mortal. I mean, even the great Michael Jackson has to rehearse. He's human. He's man. He received correction. The thing about Michael Jackson is that he is dedicated and committed to his work. He slaves for his audiences and utilizes his talent to the full. He's not lazy. And remember, he's done this stuff before, so all he focuses on is to enhance it. Michael is gifted, but many other professional people have contributed to his success. Take for example Kenny Ortega, the band members, take for example the pyrotechnics guys (wow, that flame super-nova thing they do is awesome), the dancers, that guitarist chick Orianthi. Lol, I cant believe Michael was actually coaching Orianthi on how to make her electric guitar scream with more passion and feel, that was too cute. The only thing that peeved me off in this entire film is the part where this one dude does the rap section of 'Black or White', this dude can't rap his way out of a paper bag. He has no credibility and I'm just not convinced. This same dude did played the same part in the Dangerous Tour: Live in Bucharest DVD. He sounds like a sissy and for the love of me, I just don't know why Michael employs him again. I can only guess that its for sentimental reasons. Anyway. Michael Jackson was truly bankable, hence so much money was channeled at making this a phenomenal 50 date event. When all is said and done, his talent was irrefutable. Michael was a man, and what a man. Go see the film already, what you waiting' for..?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I found out the news that they were going to release a movie about Michael Jacksons last rehearsals, I was really excited about it..I bought my tickets a month ago just in case, and when I went to see the film yesterday I was really shocked to see only 15 people in a 400 hundred room.Anyways, the movie was really great. I had goosebumps the whole time. The way Michael was rehearsing is fantastic, he really put all his energy to make this concert perfection. I really regret that I didn't bought his concert tickets when I had the chance, I mean, this show that he was about to give wasn't human...Buy a ticket and go see it, you will regret it if you don't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just finished watching "This Is It" over a half hour ago. I was just completely blown away. This movie got me emotional over how passionate MJ was about his work. The irony too, GEEZ. It really was it. I'm telling you now, if you don't see this film, and if you don't AT LEAST give it a 10/10 rating... you should be ashamed of yourself. I won't give away the magic of the movie, but each song feels like it's own movie, and they're light years beyond your expectation yet have that original feel. Even though I *loved* every song that was sung, I'll choose Smooth Criminal as my favourite because I'm a sucker for old films (woops did I just say that?) That's all I'm going to say. SEE IT, SEE IT!! 2 weeks is more than enough time to drag your butts to the theatre to witness the most epic performance you'll EVER see in your lifetime. Peace out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went to see it today (work related viewing), must admit that it wasn't hallf bad. Some of the rehearsals were amazing and it was weird listening to some fantasticaly sang songs and only the janitor is they're to clap. Lots of cringe worthy moments as well though and I could not stop myself from remembering the classic Cocker incident during earthsong. Jackson's presence was truly amazing and to think that he is 50 is unbelievable. Towards the end of the movie he does appear to be loosing the plot slightly and looks truly knackered. Sadly Billy Jean was a ghost of the original and there was NO moonwalk throughout the movie. when thanking his crew at the end you cant but help think of Moses saying he wont see the promised land. Well worth a view if your an MJ fan 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring, meaningless raw video footage of Michael Jackson. Nothing more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is It tells about preparations of the "last" tour of Michael Jackson and his rehearsals. The footage of the document is new material never been shown before to the world.I have never been particular MJ fan nor listen his music. But because he is some sort of cornerstone of music history you gotta know him even if your IQ is less than average. So I know most of the songs by MJ, who doesn't?It was great to see how the show would have been. I loved especially how the stage and props were made for Thriller and Smooth Criminal. However, because MJ does not have "real" meaning for me I don't understand how I should somehow be moved while watching this document... Also the document does not tell much about MJ's personality or character. Watch Oprah's review of MJ instead of this.Of course the movie is some sort of way to remember Jacko, and it's such a shame the tour never took place considering the fact how much effort, money and love were put in to it. The movie itself didn't affect me practically any ways though, and the only reason is because I only thing MJ was only a great guy and historical milestone.I know that Michael Jackson was talented as hell and he has been developing the world music in its current form. He is in so many ways the great historical human being, but not a god. That's why I don't understand why so many people think him as god. For real. Also really confusing thing is that this document would not be such a huge success and would not cause such a great hype without Jacko being dead. This is why I want to review the movie as it was published before MJ's death: boring, meaningless raw video footage of Michael Jackson. Nothing more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not a cinematic masterpiece, but thats not the point of the film anyway. It's a refreshing, be it final, view of Michael as an artist, performer and human being. He looked like he was pouring all of his creative energy into the stage show, and if it had gone as planned, it probably would've been one of the most spectacular of all time. No matter how many "4 year old wiener" jokes you make, you can't deny MJ's astounding vocal abilities (its to bad we didn't get to see more of his full potential in This Is It), his natural stage presence, and the fact that he's the Picasso of dance. There would be no modern dance as we know it without him. He was an overall amazing performer and artist on every level and I hope that people remember him as he is in this film, rather than all that other stuff, because it's his art thats left a huge impression on the world, not his media scandals. Overall, very interesting watch, a little funny, a little sad, but nice to see the King of Pop as himself, the King of Pop.</fullReview>

We sat in awe of this man's talent. I LOVED the funny moments and him working with his band members. You really feel like you're in right there with them. It's like they allow you to be a part of their very private and intimate setting. I'm so happy that I watched it on the big screen. It was definitely worth it. If you're a fan and are thinking about not going because you think it might be too sad, please reconsider. It's not a sad movie at all...in fact, you'll feel MJ's energy through out the movie. I hate watching movies more than once...but this one's different. I can't wait to go and watch this movie again. MJ still had it! LOVE You Michael!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must begin by saying that the world has lost one of the greatest artists of a life time... MJ is not only a dancer or a singer,, he is an absolute genius.. the movie was made and edited in a very professional way and it was a great wonderful tribute to MJ.... I was very thrilled to watch the movie and i was more than excited while watching it.. i had tears in my eyes, because it is a shame to lose someone like MJ... He showed us in the movie what does a TRUE ARTIST really mean. With all the technology that the world has made, yet MJ was using the true talent that he posses. words can't describe his talent and the way the movie was done.. We all wish that this concert were held because it would've been a great hit. MJ is a true believer and we all believed in him no matter what. this movie proved the great talent that he has and proved the amazing things that he can and could've done. Although am sad that the concert is off but i am happy to watch the preparations through the movie, the Director "Ortiga" made it in a wonderful way to satisfy all of MJ's fans. He showed what a kind and honest and hard-worker MJ is. the way he dances and sings was amazing... the dancers were chosen carefully and they contributed to the dances with a nice twist. the scenes of the concert were really fantastic and very well-prepared. If i keep on writing i won't stop. so let me say that YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE.. and GOD REST HIS SOUL IN PEACE. LET'S ALL FOLLOW HIS ADVICES AND CONTINUE WITH THIS MESSAGE IN SAVING THE WORLD AND LOVING EACH OTHER. RIP (F).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really nice with small disappointments, but this is MJ, what else do I ask for?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Came back from the official premiere in China. Thanks to the time difference, I was one of the earliest to see this on this planet. There isn't any real storyline in this film but I still put *spoiler* there just in case people want to discover the flow of the film themselves. The experience of the film was great in general. Time just flew during the 114 minutes, one song after another. There were really a lot of innovations there, so even most of the songs are heard hundred of times, I was still holding my breath during the film. Like the background screen film for The Way You Make Me Feel, The Way You Make Me Feel, and of course, Thriller 3D!! That is MJ! You couldn't believe he was already 50 when he was dancing on the floor!!The small disappointments to me: 1. Because of the shooting equipments, video quality of some footage was a little bit low. 2. The crew didn't wear the final costumes. I just couldn't imagine how fantastic it would be if they do. 3. I was expecting more behind-the-scene stuff, like how the 3D film ideas was conceptualized and made into production, etc. But those parts weren't that long. It's like 3-5 minutes for each song.What I'm going to do next is 1) to see this once more time in IMAX; 2) to buy the DVD when it comes out. Please include those 3D films completely!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this yesterday, and I must say it was a very good film. Michael Jackson is very energetic and in good shape in the movie, so it is strange that he suddenly died. In a way, his death reminds a bit of the death of Bruce Lee although Jackson did not die as young as Bruce did. Anyway, there is some great music in this film, and it is interesting to see Jackson's dance steps and updates to his songs. For example he has added a big spider to his Thriller song and some new lyrics also. I am not a big fan of Michael Jackson but this movie really touched me, and made me wonder what happened to him. Anyway, this film is highly recommended.</fullReview>

At the end it wasn't any doctors no conspiracy he died cause of his own big dream he didn't want to let his fans down quite admirable You need to get a hand to that I never thought a Hollywood celebrity or an US superstar could honestly care so much for his fans as to simply to die for them The movie is about the best sacrifice any entertainer of our times I think its more than enough to just simply forget about all his wrong doings ! He also proved to his haters that he is not some kinda devil but simply someone who was special and someone who can't be so easily understood I think it will take some time before we properly understand his legacy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Move over "Just Do It". "This Is It" is now destined to be the 2nd greatest string of 3 words to ever inspire (after "I love you" and its variants).Dubbed as the "Greatest concert that never happened", this movie will be talked about for many years to come and "This Is It" will have its place in personal promises, campaign speeches, marketing slogans, love songs and many a battle cry.The movie, composed of a carefully stitched series of rehearsals for Jackson's summer 2009 London concerts, is reality concert at its best. While Michael knew he was being filmed during rehearsal, surely, he did not know that this would be his last curtain call.I watched the movie out of curiosity but came out awed. Now I know why Michael Jackson is considered as a musical genius and a true artist by his multitude of supporters, and even by his worst critics. I must confess that while I heard his music before, I was never a real fan. I could listen to his songs or watch his MTVs several times without tiring of it but I never sought out to buy an album or listen to it out of my own free will. But after seeing this movie, I realize that it is not really his unique music or upbeat dance moves that earned him the monicker "king of pop". Rather it was his boundless imagination and creative passion to inspire people to shine their brightest even when it was just practice. Michael reassured his team that it was OK to be human and make mistakes; "that's what rehearsals are for". And yet, he never compromised. Each dance move, rhythmic beat, hand gesture and sequined costume was part of a grander scheme to win the hearts and minds of his audience.I feel that "This is It!", in more ways than one is far superior to another commercialized literary invention: Nike's "Just Do It!". "This is It" announces to the oneself and to the rest of the world that what is about to happen next is the culmination of a series of carefully thought out actions, perhaps because there is no promise of a second chance. "Just Do It" pushes action over too much thought, which may be a reflection of today's video game mindset where people think they have multiple lives and pause and restart buttons when things go wrong. This is It! emerges from within. Just Do It! is something that is often driven from the outside. This is It vs. Just Do It. Quality vs. Quantity, Thought vs. Action. Reality vs. Image. Internal vs. External. Great vs. Average. Forever vs. Now.This is It! reminds me to stop my unconscious quest for the all too common epitaph of the "Greatest dad who was never home" or the "Greatest husband I wish I knew."Today is not a simple dress rehearsal for me for the rest of my life. Today could be the last chance for me to lovingly kiss my wife and thankfully embrace my 3 children. Today may be the last chance I have to ask forgiveness from my Lord God for my sins of commission and omission. I will not let this day go to waste by doing things half-heartedly thinking that this is just practice and that the real game is still to come. I will not withhold my dance of joy to the time when I am rich, or think I'm rich. I will live this day with utmost passion and zest and thankfulness. I will not conserve my energy for another day for that day is not promised me. All I have is today. "This is it!" ... Bong De Ungria</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I'm not exactly a fan of MJ. I love his greatest hits and that's about it. But I always treasured his talent and dedication when it came to performing. This movie shows you just two hours of what must have been months of rehearsals and after watching them I'm even more convinced that he was actually murdered. Just like they did with Elvis, John Lennon and other major artists when there was too much money involved. If this incredibly gifted man would have made a comeback this big (and you don't even get to see the enormity of it, like he says "just to make an idea...") he would have casted a long lasting shadow over most of the so-called artists and performers that regularly appeared on MTV. And guess what, the music industry couldn't accept that and they had to do something about it.Many people question his ability to go through 50 shows without collapsing. Let me say that after watching this movie I can guarantee that he surely would have! His energy and enthusiasm were truly a divine gift and watching much younger dancers looking up to him while practicing is really saying it all. Others say he was in it for the money. Well, despite the fact that all the concert tickets were already sold out, he was still concerned about giving the people a fabulous show. He invested a lot in pyrotechnics, giant screens, actors, dancers and God knows what else, he wanted to deliver something you've never seen before. You can see it and most of all FEEL it during the movie.After watching this material, I respect the artist more than I ever had and I hope that some of the haters will go out and watch this with an open mind as well, they'll surely come out of the theater with a different perspective of what this man and his work were all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must see for Michael fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't been an MJ fan for years, but my childhood was saturated by his music, and I thought it would be interesting to watch. I had to comment on the film because people have been saying that the film showed Michael to be a perfectionist (in a bad way) and a Prima Donna. This is completely untrue. There was a part in the film where Michael complained about his ear-piece but he was gentlemanly and courteous. As a musician I can understand that. And he was not a Prima Donna at all, in fact he was often very conscious of upsetting people when he was critical so he criticised in a way which was kind and probably brought out the best in people - which is a great way to be. The reason I gave it a 7 was rather than a 10 because there was too much unnecessary footage of dancers which I found completely irrelevant to the film. The dancers interviews, however, was very interesting and saddening at the same time, since they were never able to perform with Michael in the end. You will not see Michael perform at his best. He was constantly saving his voice for the 'real' performance (which sadly did not happen), there were a couple of occasions when he accidentally let himself go which gave us a glimpse of what might have been. It was a sad film but very enlightening as to how Michael really was, I wished it contained more information about the 'message' he was sending out and a little more footage of the man himself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poor old Michael Jackson. He didn't deserve to die so soon. But he left us quite a legacy. I love his music; always did, always will. He was the sound track to my college years, to my twenties. This Is It casts an intriguing light on the star, a driven perfectionist who lived in a bubble much of his life. Looking back over Jackson's years as a star - virtually his entire life - to be honest the only thing that surprises me is that he wasn't even nuttier than he actually became. How can anyone be expected to live the life that he led, to lose their childhood, never be able to just walk the dog around the block without Papparazzi, and be even passingly 'normal'? I was pleasantly surprised at how well he came across ? almost unassuming at times. And he obviously watched the news and world events. He knew what was going on outside his bubble, even while he lived inside it.As the whole world and his dog knows by now, This Is It has been patched together from video footage shot during rehearsals for Jackson's come back concerts in London. The movie works on several levels; at its most basic, it's a fascinating insight into the process of putting a modern stage show together, the creative process, the hours of sheer slogging hard work interspersed with flashes of brilliance, the endless repetition until everyone gets it right, so it will look totally spontaneous on the night. We get to see the clever stitching together of sound, light, video, costumes, dance and singing, all anchored by a great, great band, fabulous dancers and Jackson's astonishing stage presence. It would have been quite a show. And of course on another level completely, it's a fascinating and poignant last look at one of the world's star performers, the King of Pop. On stage, he just oozes charisma. Michael Jackson was probably going back on stage because he was broke, although of course, that's never said on screen. He could have taken the easy route, a flaccid re-enactment of earlier set pieces, he knew the fans would have turned up and paid, just to watch him tie his shoe laces. But he never took advantage of his fans, he never lapsed into cynicism. Michael was determined to finish on a high note, he gave this show his all, to give everyone full value. And what we see is most definitely not an over the hill, sad ex-star past his sell by date, trying to relive the glory years. Jackson is sharp, fit, into everything. Acting against a Green Screen, peering over the shoulder of the director, rehearsing his dancers, keeping his band up to scratch, polite, restrained but insistent, he never raises his voice but then he never has to. Everyone idolizes him, a star so bright that when word went out that auditions were being held for dancers, they quite literally came from all over the world. What we see is the best of the best; he could attract them. OK, he's not performing hand springs or twirling on his head. He never did. And the man is ? was - fifty years old. But he is still turning on a dime, dancing like an angel, and giving the kids dancing with him a serious run for their money. Conscious of preserving his voice during the rehearsals, he doesn't always sing at 110%, but when he does, it's all still there. The favorite songs, sung as they were recorded, just as the fans would want to hear them, the same old songs, but sounding sharp, contemporary and perfectly delivered. His music is standing the test of time, and sounds as good today as it did in the 80s. I am a fan, and wanted to think the best of him, but I was actually quite pleasantly surprised at how good he looked and sounded. I was horribly afraid that he would look like a pathetic has-been. He didn't. For me Smooth Criminal probably worked best of all the pieces, some of the fitted together footage for other songs doesn't work quite so well. But every song, every set piece, was an individual show in itself. The only low note for me in the whole movie, was how thin Jackson looked. Was he starving himself to try and keep the years at bay? Who knows? He certainly had plenty of energy. I just got the feeling, sitting back in my seat, watching him perform with such perfection, that if someone had given him a decent meal and a beer occasionally, he might have slept better, and he might still be with us. Instead he lived on a knife edge. And one day he fell off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Must See for All Fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit I was one who ran to the box office the day the tickets went on sale so I could make sure to get in to see the movie. And am I ever glad I did! The movie was a wonderful look into Michael Jackson's creative process. It was great to see him going through the songs and even stopping from time to time to try and explain when something didn't seem right.This was going to be a phenomenal concert, one that perhaps would have been the best ever put on. The effects, the pieces with the green screen uses, all of it. It all came together and even in its imperfect form, it was still dazzling. I can only imagine what it all would have looked like in one solid run through as opposed to stringing bits of rehearsal together to get a full song. It was still great though. Creative and unique, and I was left speechless at the end. I definitely recommend this movie for all Michael Jackson fans, and maybe even to those who didn't understand what the hype was all about. The man was pure genius and was always, always looking for ways to improve. You'll see that in "This is It."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful and picturesque; An essential tribute and terrific conclusion to a glorious era.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was excellent. I am a young Michael Jackson fan, yet I have all his albums. This film showcases the exceptional skills he possessed, and the ambition he had for this concert. It may have never happened, yet this film made you understand just how grand it would have been. The songs are great, each of them sung in full. The best part was Thriller in 3D. I want to say more, but too many thoughts are in my head about this film and I do not have much time to write this review. I would tell you more about it, but think its best if you experience this masterpiece for yourself.Ultimately, an excellent tribute to a worldwide icon-10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did Michael still had it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Jackson's "This Is It" is a perfect example of the genius that this man was. It is good that this movie came out so people can see, even at 50 years of age, that MJ still had it; more than ever. Was he as good as the 80's or 90's? No. He was much better. You will witness the extraordinary man that had one vision: to create the best show ever.Spellbinding, moving, funny and at some points unbelievable, this documentary-film captures the one and only King of Pop doing what he did best. To entertain the world through his amazing talent and rare persona. His vision to make this planet a better place is clearly stated throughout this film which makes you feel disgusted of how the world treated him back. You will also see three new clips which were gonna be shown during the concerts, including "Thriller" and "Smooth Criminal".Whatever anyone thinks about MJ, one thing is for sure: This man was simply the greatest entertainer of the 20th century and up to 2009 of the 21st. And this film makes that fact quite clear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>just saw it. His voice was great, MJ even explained in the film that he was holding back as to not strain his voice. His moves, well, at first i thought he was really stiff, and not performing well, but you can see he was not as sharp, but that was held back also, he was just pitching his moves, after all, he doesn't really need to go for it, but could he of hit 50 dates at the o2? i don't know. Its' not until he goes for it during Billie Jean where you Can see he still had it. Not something i would get on DVD, but you can expect more footage to come at some point with the release of more of the 3d footage. Overall its worth seeing, more so if you are a fan.</fullReview>

This is the happy, beautiful and precious soul I've known. I am glad I saw it again in the movie. But we cannot deny that Michael was not respected and taken care of very well at that time, even the arranged scenes shown it. So I will never stop getting out the truth behind why and who KILL Michael. Michael, love you forever, and follow your steps to the holy place where there's only divine love and dedication.

		<shortDescription>Michael Jackson's This Is It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Jackson planned what was to be his big comeback with his fifty date concerts performing some of his greatest songs at the London O2 arena. Then the world was shocked to hear, eighteen days before the event was to debut, that the King of Pop had died at his rented mansion, suffering a cardiac arrest. As a tribute to him, and as it had been filmed, 100 hours of rehearsal footage at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California (where the memorial was held), accompanied with dancing auditions and backstage interviews with all the crew involved, was compiled into this documentary. Directed and choreographed by Michael's friend Kenny Ortega (High School Musical), it would have been a big hit, and Michael seemed to be in good health and spirit, with his great singing and wonderful dance moves. Highlights in this film for the fans, with no negative material whatsoever, include Michael placed in Gilda with Rita Hayworth and The Big Sleep with Humpherey Bogart for the "Smooth Criminal" film, the re-imagined 3D zombie sequence for the "Thriller" film, and the beautiful tropical jungle footage for the "Earth Song" film. Songs featured also include "They Don't Care About Us", "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'", "Bad", "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough", "Human Nature", "The Way You Make Me Feel", "I'll Be There", "I Want You Back", "Shake Your Body (Down To The Ground)", "I Just Can't Stop Loving You", "Beat It", "Black Or White", "Billie Jean", "Man in the Mirror" (the most popular song after his death), "Heal the World", and of course the title song. I can see why the critics give this film three stars out of five, there is a little something lacking that makes it a fantastic film, but for the fans (me included), there is just enough to be impressed with and admire. Michael Jackson was number 14 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 6 on The Ultimate Pop Star. Good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revealing the Tragic Truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being 42 years old, I grew up along with Michael Jackson. I am a music lover and fan of Michael for decades, but never a fanatic. Like many, I'd grown weary of Michael's weirdness and written him off as a delusional, prima donna superstar that thought none of the rules applied to him; a man that had squandered his enormous talent.When the 50 shows at London's O2 were announced, I immediately doubted they would ever happen; that Michael would never do a show because he no longer had the ability to dance and sing as he had.With Michael's tragic death, news surfaced of the level of his drug addictions and his homosexuality. Suddenly, everything made sense. Here we had a man who never had a childhood, that genuinely loves children. He was driven into seclusion by his own guilt; guilt about his addiction and about his sexual orientation. Everyone believed he was a child molestor because he is so effeminate, loved to be around children, and the two court cases. Those claims have proved untrue or were outright recanted."This Is It" demonstrated beyond a doubt that if Michael could have gotten clean from drugs, all of his talent would have resurfaced. The two hour movie pieced together many rehearsals. On some days, the old Michael was there and sounded brilliant and I believed he could have done the shows. On other days, his body was there, but not his soul.It was sad to see such a talent wrecked by the evils of drug-addiction. I imagine many of Elvis' fans felt the same way shortly before his death."This Is It" is a captivating musicmentary. It works on so many levels. It is a brilliant revue of all of Michael's greatest songs. It is a glimpse of what might of been, and it is profound statement of the evils of drug addiction. It is sad that no one in his life was willing to risk their spot on the gravy train in order to save his life and intervene.One sad fact is certain, "This Is It."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intimacy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Movie obviously is only for people being interested in Michael Jackson.I'm not a big Michael Jackson Fan myself. I only own about 2 CD's, but I always enjoyed his music whenever playing on the radio or elsewhere. Thou I gotta admit I always kinda was intrigued by his personality or that we know off thru the news and the media. I strongly believe this person one of his biggest creations. The Jacko, always leaving us rather hazy about who he truly has been. To not destroy your anticipations this movie doesn't change that. But it definitely adds a new layer for me. I went to see this movie with the low expectation of seeing nothing more then a collection of bonus footage, a "Making Of" usually to be Bonus Content on a DVD. 'This Is It' is pretty obviously made from this kind of material. But maybe because there was important material still missing, it is surprisingly something else then a collection of backstage footage, that makes money because the show itself didn't. It is filled with footage adding a strange feeling of intimacy I didn't expect there and I didn't expect the Michael Jackson to be like.Of course this raises the question after seeing this movie: What's missing? What wasn't shown to the public and to what level has it been palliated? 'This Is It' being a peak through the curtain doesn't reveal much behind it. It keeps the mystery of Michael Jackson alive and I'm glad it does. At the same level it's bringing you closer to a person you feel you could never be close to. It shows a loving, kind, shy and especially lovable Michael Jackson. It honors the Legend and is a noticeable homage.It is enjoyable, interesting and certainly something different.=============== One Word on my Rating: As I am not good with ratings, I gave this movie 7 Stars comparing this to other Average Movie Ratings I'd compare this movie with on IMDb. This is not a personal Rating, but more to give you an idea of where I'd place this movie compared to others.</fullReview>

In preparation for the concert series, the pop singer had been collaborating with numerous high profile figures, such as fashion designer Christian Audigier, choreographer Kenny Ortega and bodybuilder Lou Ferrigno. Prior to Jackson's death, Allgood Entertainment had planned to sue the musician for $40 million, claiming that he had breached a contract with them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good premise, could have been better...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers in this review...Before I begin I'm not the biggest of Jackson's fans, I saw this more out of curiosity to see what this concert could have been like had it gone through.This Is It is a premise that could have been better executed. Here we are left with a documentary of sorts that gives a making of what the This Is It concert would have been like. This movie proves that Jackson could still dance. He could still sing. Tabloid fodder aside he looked more than capable of performing this show (in one of the scenes I believe the prequel video he was making to Smooth Criminal, the date could be seen as only two weeks before his death). The dance moves he performs would likely have been difficult to perform had he been sickly or on powerful drugs at the time of rehearsals. Jackson was, most likely, mostly ready for this show.I do like the idea that they tried to show what went into the rehearsal. However I don't like the arrangement.They took some 140hrs of footage and spliced it down into a 2 hour movie. Keep in mind at least 20 minutes of this movie is not actual parts of Jackson dancing or singing. The splicing, at times, appears to have been done for nothing more than a better camera angle, often times sacrificing video quality. Or what may have been a more enjoyable set of dance moves was used. This is all fine and well, however I think perhaps if I were doing this I'd have selected the best possible rendition of the song from the available material. Based on the different outfits used in some takes, I'd say as many as 5 separate versions of some of the songs were filmed, possibly many more.I'd have grouped all the making of stuff into a segment at the beginning of the film. Not spliced it between songs. I'd have left the songs run, in their entirety in an effort to create the best possible rendition of what the concert would have been like.I'm not entirely sure if they used the best possible variations for the film, just the ones that fit the film better. I know the clip AEG leaked of "The Don't Care about Us" appeared to have been a better rendition that what the final product of the movie was.I'm sure they could get more out of that footage if they wanted to, and I don't think I'm stretching it too far to say there is more stuff that could have been release off all those tapes. The CD set they released to accompany the movie is nothing more than a best of collection and not a soundtrack.If you watch this with a jaded eye you'll likely realize that there is likely more than they're showing you, and it probably is something you want to see, it simply isn't shown for the time allotted, or the whole thing was hastily done for a quick box office buck before the buzz dies off. I'm sure Sony won't rest on the extra footage either, you'll end up with a deluxe DVD or Blu-ray with hours of extra footage simply to sell more product, CDs will be made of the actual recordings etc.This all leaves me with a somewhat empty feeling, what is there is decent, not stellar (likely due in part to the speed at which they tried to deliver), some memorable (Jackson's dancing at times is amazing even at 50, the Billie Jean performance on here certainly quite impressive). The movie also drags, thats not to say it is not interesting, I think the order of the songs isn't entirely the greatest, whether this was the intended concert set in order, or put together that way for a reason I don't know, but they play many more popular songs up front and not again until the end leaving a rather long middle if you are a fan of his more popular stuff.Now I don't aim to be overly critical, but I think they could have done more with it, I'll leave it at 7 of 10 stars and hope the Blu-ray release has the extras to fill in what I think they actually had to work with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you're a fan you'll love it. If not you won't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filmed record of the rehearsals for what would have been Michael Jackson's grand comeback shows is grand viewing for those who are his fans. Actually as long as you don't completely hate the man odds are you will come away impressed at what he was capable of doing. It's a grand spectacle in progress and at times truly breathtaking. As several reviews have stated the nice thing about this film is that we really get to watch the dance numbers. Since it was shot for Jackson and never intended for mass viewing the footage is not your typical flashy film presentation. You get wondrous long takes of the dancing without cutaways so you see what the show would have been like. Its more the way these things should be filmed. Personally, I like the film, but I don't love it. I'm not really a Michael Jackson and for me a little bit of this goes a long way. My interest in the film came and went depending on what the music was. If you have any affection for Michael Jackson this is worth a look. If you don't like him stay away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good music from MJ and the director of High School Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I start, this contains minor spoilers (at least, as much as it's possible to spoil the "plot" of a musical documentary!)Also, I should point out that I'd avoided all mention of the movie, and almost all of the clips, so didn't know what to expect. I had low expectations, but it was slightly better than I thought. The cinema was under a third full (mind you, they had it on every half-hour in most of the screens). I'll break this review down into sections as per the track order:Wanna Be Startin' Somethin': The first thing I noticed was that the sound quality was actually pretty good. Even though the Staples is known for having crap sound, and even though my cinema didn't have SDDS (meaning that we had to settle for the inferior Dolby version). I thought the drums were nice, and the instrument separation was good. It also struck me that, although I don't see much dancing in general, there were several moves here that I'd never seen by MJ or anybody else.Jam: Seemed to be sung live was well. I'm not sure what sources they cobbled the sound together from, but they had a fairly complete vocal track, apart from the lines that simply weren't sung.They Don't Care About Us: Definitely mimed, and a similar medley to what had been used in previous tours. The special effects during this segment were nothing short of jaw-dropping - they have to be seen to be believed.Human Nature: Nice song (in fact the one all the girls were singing as they left the cinema). By this point the changes of aspect ratio and overall size were starting to annoy me.Smooth Criminal: There was a nice bit of insight into the video sequences. Overall quite good, although I'm not sure how it all would have fitted together as a live show.Way You Make Me Feel: slightly long and drawn out, but otherwise good. Reminded me a bit of the Madison Square Garden 30th anniversary show.Shake Your Body (Down To The Ground)/I Want You Back/I'll Be There: This whole J5 sequence was OK, but it always sounds tired. He's been doing the same medley with the same ad-libs for over 20 years now.I Just Can't Stop Loving You: Fairly good. By this point, I had stopped trying to remember which songs were sung live and which were mimed. It looked like there was more chemistry with this singer than with Sheryl Crow or any other previous co-singer.Thriller: I really enjoyed this bit, especially with all the 3D stuff. Too bad Threatened wasn't played for longer.Beat It: This was OK, but was an example of the flow being interrupted just to fit in some crane footage they wanted to use. However, it was interesting to see the girl dancers.Black Or White: Fairly good. Slightly different from the album version, and a good insight into how the performance would have worked with two lead guitarists.Earth Song: Extremely powerful. I liked the symphonic introduction, and the jungle footage in the background had a good effect.Billie Jean: unless I blinked and missed it, there was no moonwalk... It also seemed a bit half-hearted, but let's remember that this is all rehearsal footage.Man In The Mirror: Not much to say about this one. Some parts of the song were missed out, but otherwise good, if a little bit straightforward.This Is It/Heal The World: I sat through the whole credits, and read as much as possible (couldn't believe how many logos there were!). Whatever you do, don't leave at this point, or you'll miss some good moments. Bsides, it's disrespectful to leave during the credits to any movie.There were also sections on Bad and Who Is it and In The Closet. And there are some great bits on pole dancing and acrobatics- I enjoyed the funny part where she was teaching them how to grab their crotch!To sum up, I liked it. I'm not sure I'll see it at the cinema again, especially as nobody wants to go with me, but it's worth seeing once. I'd probably get the DVD (or Blu-ray, if it's the same price) - what I'd like is a seamless branching option where you can cut the dialogue and listen to it as an album (that's what the soundtrack CD should have been).Overall, they showed restraint and good taste, for the most part. It had quite a good feel-good factor, maybe even for non-fans (of which there weren't any in this cinema, except maybe one or two guys who were probably dragged by their girlfriends). Maybe the environmental stuff near the end was laid on a bit thick.For those of you who think that a review just boils down to a number - If this were anybody else, I'd give it 50%. However, because it's Jackson, I have to give it 60%. However, this assumes that it's judged as a standalone movie. IF they had been in a position to release a full live concert performance Blu-ray of the finished show, then this would have made an EXCELLENT bit of bonus material. I guess that's how I see it. It's something that should have been supplementary to a tour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THIS IS IT - Brilliant as a Money-Making Machine; Not as a Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Thriller, to Bad, to Dangerous, to baboon poo crazy, Michael Jackson went from being the most brilliant performer on the planet to being the oddest. From the largest selling album of all time, to the most groundbreaking music videos ever created, to rumours in the press, to court cases taken by alleged victims, the self styled King of Pop, led a life that was fed, at first, by media adulation driven by the critical success and commercial brilliance that characterized his early career and, latterly, by the media obsession with the sad little soap opera that his life had become. Jackson, like many before him, bears witness to the horrifying maxim that those whom the God's wish to destroy they first call promising. His last two decades were, from this fan's point of view, at least, filled with too much madness to the detriment of the music and this film, unfortunately, follows that path entirely. Too much madness and not enough music.If Jackson were still alive than doubtless the footage recorded here would see the light of day, but only as an extra on the live concert DVD. It would never have been released as a movie and there's good reason for that ? it's simply not strong enough.I'm a huge fan of Michael Jackson, Billy Jean is the best pop song of all time, but, seriously, who wants to watch the best performer on the planet rehearsing? I want to watch him perform! Rehearsals are merely dry runs for the real thing. This is a concert movie without a concert, and where's the point in that? That's like watching THE GODFATHER (1972) without Marlon Brando. It's like eating a banana split without the ice cream. There's no pay off.There's no denying Jackson's brilliance, but, damn it, everyone on the planet knows that Jackson could sing and dance! There's no fire in the film, there's no screaming crowds, there's no adoration, and without that there's nothing to whip him into full frenzy. All you're left with is the sad knowledge that you're watching a man that lived to perform, getting ready to perform, and in the back of your mind you know that he'll never actually do it.THIS IS IT was most definitely made for the fans. It was made to wring money out of them and it's working perfectly. As someone who had tickets to go see Jackson in the O2 in London, I was looking forward to seeing the film. All it did, however, was remind me that the greatest pop performer the world has ever seen will never be seen again.My opinion notwithstanding, fans will, for the most part, I suppose, enjoy it. Those obsessed with Jackson will claim it proves he was back to his best, and it certainly contains moments when Jackson appears to be in full flight, but these are all too fleeting and are, naturally enough, interrupted because that is, after all, what happens in rehearsals! All the marketing for the movie claims it will only be in theatres for two weeks. And that's probably true. But that, I suspect, is because they want to rush the DVD out in time for Christmas, grab some more money.As a money-making machine, then, THIS IS IT is it. It will undoubtedly rake in the millions. As a great Jackson film, however, or as a great concert film, a great documentary, or even simply a great film, THIS IS IT isn't even at the races.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wouldn't call myself a big MJ fan, but I do like some of his music. However this is not about how much you either love or hate Michael. This is about how the movie was. So the movie is made out of tons of rehearsal clips which I though was a good idea. No doubt it was made for squeezing the last bit of money out of his fans. But which movie isn't made for profit these days? What I really hated about this movie was that it tried to manipulate my thoughts of MJ. "He was a great guy and he just got misunderstood" they shouldn't try to convince you how great or for a matter of fact how bad he was. They should be focused on the music and the tour he was gonna give. More music and less drama would be preferred. Now I was with a friend, so I sat through the whole movie, but there was times where I just felt like walking out. But when it was finally done EVERYONE in the cinema started clapping, cheering and some even cried. I guess they were just moved by the whole "he was a great man" thing. Anyways don't judge the movie on my thoughts, if you like him, or even if you dislike him, but still wants to see the movie go see it! Just remember to judge it as a movie on not from your opinion on MJLast to be fair I want to say "what can you expect from a dead man?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very disappointed with this? movie? It is not a documentary about Michael Jackson's preparations for his comeback tour. And, it is not really a concert movie. It doesn't really show much of what goes into putting together a concert or (in this case) a world tour. I would have liked to see more of the prep work that went into deciding which songs to include and which were rejected. I did enjoy most of the music even though Michael does state several times that he is holding back to rest his voice for the tour. I found the whole show to be a bit choppy and slightly disjointed. For me the guitar player with the hard to pronounce name (Orianthi) was the best part of the entire show. But, if you are a die-hard Michael Jackson fan you should enjoy seeing him on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfortunately, this was like watching bad surgery....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILER: Knew we were in trouble when a cut-out of Jackson was used in front of the Bulldozer scene, and the thought crossed...how many times was it used when he was missing from rehearsals. He didn't rehearse with the musicians and seemed upset when they didn't "follow" him, he didn't rehearse with the dancers...just waltzed back and forth while they did all the routines around him. His singing of the songs was many times out-of-tune or screaming/growling...like an aged rocker who should stay retired. This was tiring to watch, bits and clips as if he couldn't get through an entire song without breaking. So they pieced them together....and in some cases he came off a routine wheezing with asthma. A double was used to go through the crashing window, and climbing the rafters or sliding down the stairs...(with face covered.) And the "remake" of Thriller was still in the computer as was the Klatu robot. Three days of rehearsal does not a tour make.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even WWE promos looked BETTER than THIS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh hi, This is my first day of my November and all the good things happened in my life occurred in this month, I wanted to start and celebrate it by watching a BIG THING, thus I witnessed Micheal JACKSON'S (ie NOC-01-2009 01:00pm)THIS IS IT . And in a one-liner I'll say it's a RAW CUT version without any sweetener.After a large fall the KING OF POP decided to make a GREAT COMEBACK with a concert named THIS IS IT, but due to faith or destiny he died without fulfilling it. This film shows the final days he spent on that concert with his rehearsals both on stage and behind the scenes.Directed by Kenny Ortega who designed the original concert, failed to capture MJ's final performance for the screen. As the viewers expected we see MJ good dance numbers, the new assembled dance members, the new musicians (but miss to see an UNHEALTHY JACKSON, which strongly favors the argument that producers used BODYDOUBLES)and nothing more.The problem with this film is, it just flat, no characters, no narrations, no developments. Just badly edited, badly photographed, and badly MANIPULATED. It just a Tele-play of some urban dancers and their warming up.Even WWE promos looked better than this. I thought this film will milk the audience by Manipulating his memories with the actual unseen footage, but no, none of that happened, it just a flat cut.The opening sequence shows sneak interviews with the dancers who auditioned for MJ's concert. (WOW, I though OK cool, they are going for ARNOLD'S PUMPING IRON DOCUMENTARY Take, by describing from DANCERS /PARTICIPANTS point of view, Showing how MJ planned the concert, how is executed and how he left off) BUT when the movie pickups from their it just reduced into mediocre DVD EXTRA feature which was done by a 10 year old. (even a 10 year old can do better!) A bad setback to a TRUE FAN, or a NON-AVERAGE-FAN like me. Even at some point I doubt that the filmmakers used BODY DOUBLES for creating dramatic points for the movie. Especially opening sequence where MJ sat with director Kenny Ortega for selecting the dancers, and the much more elaborate dance sequence for THRILLER, which shows a different body-language MJ. Using Harsh Back ground Lights covering Jackson's face, edited with original Jackson footage I think the producers really want to polish his last performance, but the outcome was simply pathetic.They should have at least seen the WWE produced homage videos, even with single photograph how they capture the emotions of their long lost WRESTLERS.I remember some of my friends tried to get off the cinemas because of the lagging coverage of the movies. Even the screen aspect ratio seemed so small that it's like watching some 70's PROJECTOR porn video. This documentary or Docu-DRAMA sucked a lot, because of it's bad quality and bad execution.Anything good was , hmmm... no, there is nothing good in this movie except it's TRAILER, and the hype it made. This movie got all the awkward movements like MJ infamous PRIVATE AREA touching pose rehearsed by his fellow dancers, and we miss SLASH the guitarist, in-place it's a WHITE BLOND WOMAN (yeah like us, Jackson loved WHITE TRASH). Above all they forgot to add HIS Signature MOONWALK, sorry I don't know why the PRODUCERS left that in a hurry.Yeah it's a documentary, but what I got was Kenny Ortega's RAW CUT version prepared in 8 hours with no essential score or subtitles cards. May be a DIE HARD fan should reedit this whole mess with new presentation and release it on YOUTUBE.I gave this one 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a piece of crap!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was excited to see "This is it" because I was a Michael Jackson fan. Unfortunately all you see is a OK artist at this point. It was like watching the extras of a concert DVD. It really isn't worth watching in the movies. Wait for it on DVD.Michael Jackson looked bad in the movie physically. The music was nostalgic. The dancers were great but this was a waist of time.If you are a Michael Jackson fan, go right ahead you'll enjoy it. With this was two hours I will never get back.I would have rather watched the Jacksons movie that plays all the time on VH-1.</fullReview>
