		<shortDescription>Much better than the critics would have you believe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always enjoyed movies based on actual events or real people, so I was anticipating going to see this movie. I did a little research on the history it depicts and it was a part of the Civil War that I knew nothing about. I was quite disappointed when the reviews came out and most of the critics rated it very low. If you are looking for a war drama that is non stop action with lots of battles, massive explosions and bloody scenes from start to finish, you will be disappointed. If you like a movie that has good writing, an actual story and good acting, you will like it.The movie starts pretty much like any Civil War movie with battles, death and bloody bodies, but it progresses past that to the point where some people rebel against the Confederacy for the atrocities they commit against the southern farmers. The story is well told with some actual dates and facts flashed on the screen from time to time which sort of gives it the feel of a documentary. It helps keep things in perspective without being intrusive.If I had anything to complain about, it would be then length and scope of the film. The movie ran about 2-1/2 hours. At about 2 hours, I thought it was over but then it moved into the Klan, voting intimidation and general mistreatment of the freed slaves as well as having a 100 year tie in to future generation. It was as if they tried to jam these events in to make it more politically acceptable to Hollywood. I just felt that they went beyond what the movie was actually to be about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Story of a Southern Unionist rebellion and Reconstruction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had read Prof. Bynum's excellent books about the Jones County rebellion and so had been looking forward to the movie. Though it, inevitably, changes the story (you'd need a dozen hours to tell it completely), it remains faithful to the spirit of the rebellion and the characters of Newton and Rachel Knight.There were a number of Unionist uprisings in the South during the Civil War (a fact that was carefully expunged from my history textbooks, growing up in the South, maybe to justify all the monuments celebrating the glorious Olde South that lurk around public parks and buildings to intimidate black Southerners - I guess). What other purpose could they possibly serve? To celebrate a defeat?This movie finally points out the obvious: the Confederacy lost the war, but the planter class which owned the Confederacy did their damnedest to win the peace. Instead of being lynched like Mussolini, Confederate leaders returned to their lives, their plantations, just like the war had never happened. Even the slaves they lost were returned to them in the form of unpaid sharecroppers. The misery of the lives of freedmen is one of the strongest images to take away from this film, their alleged freedom snatched from them. No 40 acres and a mule to serve as some form reparation, they went on to endure a century of domestic terrorism at the hand of the KKK.The movie itself is beautifully and sensitively acted and filmed. There are scenes of great brutality but which are never gratuitous. There are also scenes of great beauty. There are scenes which have enormous relevance to politics in America today where racism is the hallmark of one Presidential candidate and income inequality the hallmark of another.Claims by the radical left that this movie is about a "white savior" are just silly. If anything, Gary Ross has eliminated most of the real-life incidents which dealt with Newton Knight's own actions on behalf of freedmen, probably to make the film more palatable to the radical left who, like the extreme right-wing can never be satisfied anyway. I do wish the radical left, rather than criticizing well-intentioned liberals like Gary Ross, would attack the real enemy. The State of Mississippi still incorporates the Confederate flag in its state flag... and social justice warriors are quibbling about degrees of "white saviordom"? Matthew McConaughey hasn't put a foot wrong since Lincoln Lawyer and his performance here is among his best work. American actors are rarely convincing playing period roles but he totally inhabits the role - scraggly beard, greasy hair, terrible teeth and attitude. He looks like the daguerrotype of a tired and desperate Civil War soldier. Gugu Mbatha-Raw has flown too long under the radar: stunningly touching as an early 19th century biracial heiress in Belle and totally believable as a pop star headed for a nervous breakdown in Beyond the Lights, she brings a luminous quality to Rachel a resourceful woman who defined her own path despite the oppression of racist Southern culture.Mahershala Ali's character won't be found in Prof. Bynum's books. The names of the maroons who fought with the Knight Company have been lost to history, so he is a composite character invented by Gary Ross. His character travels from runaway slave to armed insurgent to voting rights activist in Reconstruction. Ali imbues his character with wit, charm, warmth and extraordinary courage.Keri Russell is fine in a small role. She gives her heartbroken character dignity and resilience.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Civil Wars for the Rich</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>9.25 of 10. The many shades of slave and involuntary servitude come to light in this story. A film that's true enough that it deserves to be something shown to students to help their interest and expand their understanding of American history, but too gruesome, violent, and explicit in language for the typical school.It may also be a little too quiet and slow moving for some, but the depth to which the film explores obscure American Civil War facts and events, both during and after, makes one curiouser and curiouser to see where it goes.This is a rare film that you can watch a trailer of, or not, and not have it ruin the film. In fact, it would be very difficult to anyone to write a spoiler for this. It's also something you want to watch from beginning to end, or at least until the credits shift to white text on black. It may not be the ideal theater film, but it definitely is worthy of a hard copy for your book/DVD shelf.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Historical Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm surprised to see that this movie is currently averaging 6.5/10 stars--I found it to be worthy of an eight, and I even flirted with ranking it even higher.The movie tells of a counter-rebellion in a Mississippi town during the Civil War, and is based on a true story. The film is done in a style that emulates "Twelve Years A Slave", and as such it deals with topics of slavery and secession in a way that is poignant but also constructive.In fairness, there are a few things that the film could be rightly critiqued for. The opening scenes of the film are fairly gory and filled with wartime violence, but fortunately that does not dominate the movie. As it progresses, the plot of the film does meander a bit, including a fast forward to a scene from some 85 years after the majority of the film that is interspersed throughout the rest of the movie. That technique felt a bit forced at times, but at the end of the film it made more sense why it had been used. Additionally, the movie tells its main tale over the course of more than a decade, which makes for a bit of an odd cinematic journey--but, in my view, none of these issues are so problematic that they greatly take away from the movie. Rather, what we have here is a film that was desperately trying to be Oscar worthy, and that perhaps pushes the creative envelope a tad bit too far.But again, there is more good here than bad. The story that the movie has to tell is both engaging and important--engaging in that it captures your attention and makes you care about the subject matter in a captivating way, and important in that it draws attention to historical facts that you probably were not aware of. I know it certainly highlighted some elements of Reconstruction that were new to me.Regarding acting, this was perhaps not McConaughey's best role, but it's also not his worst. The supporting cast turns out a strong performance, and all in all the movie is well made.That said, I'm going with 8/10 stars on this one. It's not the best Civil War flick ever made, and perhaps pales in comparison with other recent historical dramas like "Twelve Years" and "The Revenant", but it's nevertheless a great movie that deserves a "Very Good" score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great story, good acting, worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the movie and would have rated it an 8 but for some pacing issues, including how they awkwardly managed the flash forward scenes to the sub-plot with Newton Knight's descendant.I'm not a history buff, but also not opposed to learn about compelling stories, and this was one. Who knew that there was this sub-war going on in the middle of the Civil War, or about this Lincoln-esque southern guy willing to fight the good fight? Knight was an inspiring guy who somehow saw forest through the trees and had courage to do right in a world with wrong going on all around him.The acting was quite good. I particularly enjoyed fresh faces like Mahershala Ali (Moses) and Gugu-Mbatha Raw (Rachel). The script was not full of period clichés or overly polish, things I appreciated in a movie like Tombstone, but could have been a distraction in Free State which fortunately kept it real.Matthew McConaughey was excellent in the lead as the gritty Newton Knight. Not as gritty as his brother Rooster, but the grit suits him. Very believable. But this is not a movie that shines due to his good looks, rather from his good acting.Some of the more critical reviews made comment about FSoJ as "hopelessly adrift", "trips over its own themes as it stumbles aimlessly," "is confusing", and "It's not that the story itself is hard to follow, but Gary Ross' script and direction fail to make clear key personal relationships in the film, and throughout its 2 ? hours, it makes the audience wonder where the story is going and whether this movie has much of a point at all." Wow! All I can tell you is that I did not know the story, and there were some moments where it fumbles, but I kept up with it just fine. For me the movie's strengths far outweighed its weaknesses. Definitely not an average or sub-par movie ? the subject matter alone puts it ahead of so many other films.At times I questioned the casting on some of the supporting roles, but that may be Hollywood conditioning thing, and on reflection this cast probably showed what people were like back in that day.After the movie I read up on the Davis Knight story. He was the great grandson who was embattled in a miscegenation trial in 1940s Mississippi. He was 1/8 African American, looked white (in the movie) and married a white woman; a crime back in the day in Mississippi. Have to wonder why they didn't prosecute the white wife. Hmm.It goes to show you how much times have changed: now days in Mississippi Batman can marry Superman, dogs can marry cats, and democrats can marry republicans. You won't see any of that in Raqqa. It's a crazy mixed up world folks.To sum things up, it's not a perfect movie, and there were some issues making it hard to track at times, but a fascinating sub-plot to the real Civil War, it kept my interest, and the acting was good. Any movie that has me reading up on its story after the film has got to be worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rebellion against the rebellion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A powerful action-drama about a local Mississippi rebellion against the Confederate rebellion, brought about by Southern corruption, conscripting men, and confiscating supplies and livestock, without reimbursement, in order to support the army in its fight for the Southern plantation system. The last straw for the main character, Newton Knight, superbly played by Matthew McConaughey, was the passing of the 20 slave law that exempted 1 white man for every 20 slaves?in order to prevent a slave rebellion what with so many white males being off to war. It's a gritty depiction of the sordid underbelly of an already corrupt slave economy. It's a reminder, as if we needed one, of the reprehensible conditions some of our ancestors (on both sides) imposed on their society; but neither justifies either hate or guilt this far removed from it or the Jim Crow laws. It also depicts the courageous good things that others got right. The end of the movie balances things with a political statement when it shows a mixed-race group, armed with guns I must add, marching into town on election day and demanding Republican ballots. It's easy to forget that Lincoln and the Abolitionists were Republicans; while Klansmen (including "former" Klansmen) occupied some of our highest offices, and were allied with Democrats into the 21st Century.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's an interesting film to come out during the month of June. On the surface, it appears to be Oscar bait. But it has its fair share of issues. However, they shouldn't be enough to hinder any enjoyment of the film.Amidst the impressive set pieces and Confederate South backdrop, Free State of Jones follows Newton Knight, played by Matthew McConaughey, a deserted soldier who starts an uprising against his former Confederate army. He leads a group of escaped slaves and runaway farm workers under the credo that no man shall be owned, and poor men should not be losing their lives so the rich can get richer.It's a truly powerful film about freedom and an earnest man who believes in equality--even on a subconscious level. Yet, it's interesting to note that everything between Knight and his comrades is all good. There is a minor spat between him and four of his men, but it lasts all of about ten minutes of screen time. Other than that, there isn't much conflict within his rule.There is, however, much outside hostility. That's the whole point of the movie. The action scenes are both eye-opening and jaw dropping. About as real as any Civil War film can be. And there are several scenes that are so lifelike that even the snootiest critic must acknowledge its integrity.The script isn't perfect. Some potential nuances are left on the table. Certain inner struggles that Knight faces are sped through, when they would have significantly benefited the character's development. We don't catch enough inward glimpses. At times, the circumstances seem overcome too easily. And it's not McConaughey's fault. I'm not sure if I can imagine anyone else playing the part. But the main story is told the right way. It serves its purpose as we come closer to understanding the struggle of the slaves and impoverished farmers. It's not just a fight for freedom, but for equality--which this movie proves may not always be the same thing.At 139 minutes, it never feels long. By the end, you still feel like there should have been more.Twizard Rating: 91</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moving, Authentic, Important</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Free State of Jones" is a moving, authentic, important film. Matthew McConaughey gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Newton Knight, an historic figure. I forgot I was watching Matthew McConaughey and felt that I was watching Newton Knight. I've really never seen a performance quite like McConaughey's here. His Newt Knight is the most manly man in any room ? or swamp ? and yet he is also as tender as a mother. In the early Civil War battle scenes, he plays a nurse. Knight is not shown mowing down the enemy with impressive, explosive gunfire. Rather, he is shown risking enemy fire in order to save men's lives, or to retrieve and bury the corpse of a boy shot in battle on his first day. My tears flowed freely during these scenes. Later, Knight himself cries after one of his men is hanged. But Knight gets his revenge, an eye-for-an-eye revenge scene that I won't soon forget. Newton Knight was a white Mississippi farmer. He was the grandson of a slaveholder, but Knight owned no slaves himself. He served in the Confederate army, but deserted in 1862, after serving for almost a year. He was outraged by the Twenty Negro Law, that allowed families who owned twenty slaves to exempt one family member from service for every twenty slaves they owned. Knight and other deserters formed The Free State of Jones, declaring their loyalty to the Union, and flying the stars and stripes rather than the stars and bars. After the war, Knight worked for Reconstruction and married Rachel, a freed slave woman. His children also married cross-racially. He died in 1922. As might be expected, he is a controversial figure in Mississippi. Fans of the Confederacy denounce him as a traitor. Others celebrate him as one white Southerner who had a conscience and resisted white supremacy. Newt Knight was clearly someone with a bucketload of charisma. His power inspired men to fight to the death against their own nation. McConaughey radiates charisma in this role. He is masterful and yet intimate. I'd follow this Newt Knight into battle and feel proud to do so. "Free State of Jones" is receiving negative reviews. It's easy to see why. There is something in this film to anger multiple grievance mongers. First, race hustlers will hate this movie. Race hustlers want the official story to be that all whites are supremacists and all blacks are heroic. A film that depicts a white man who worked for black rights is taboo. Race hustlers anathematized "Mississippi Burning" and "The Help" for the same reason. Such a shame that the race hustlers' ideological blindfolds make it impossible for them to appreciate great art. Liberals might hate this film for a couple of other reasons. I don't know if I've seen a movie where almost every scene hinges on how guns are used. Almost everyone is armed, and uses those weapons to keep breathing and to settle disputes. Even little girls have guns and use them heroically. Second amendment fans may love this film. It depicts what they dream of: oppressed citizenry taking up arms to defeat their own government. In addition to clinging to their guns, these rebels cling to their God and their Bibles. This is one of the most religious American films I've seen in a while. It's an historical fact that Newt Knight was a devoutly religious Primitive Baptist ? he didn't drink, for example. The film drives home Knight's Christianity. He is shown in a long scene using a quill to record a birth in his Bible. In one heartbreaking scene, a slave who has been sexually molested survives psychologically by reciting verses from Genesis. "Free State of Jones" practices a muscular Christianity. One eye-for-an-eye scene takes place in a church. Republicans will be torn about "Free State of Jones." On the one hand, Knight, like many populist leaders, preaches against economic inequality. "No man should be poor just so that someone else can be rich." I can hear theater seats squeak as Republicans head for the exits. Knight's words, though, reflect the facts. Poor white Southerners were sabotaged by the slave economy and they knew it. That's why they deserted. But Republicans, if they sit through the entire film, will see how the Republican Party was the favored choice of freed slaves in the post-Civil-War era. There is a narrative problem in the film. The viewer expects "Free State of Jones" to end after the Civil War. I actually began tying my sneakers, readying to leave the theater. But the film keeps going in what feels like an anti-climax. Gary Ross, the filmmaker, wants to make a point: the Civil War was *not* the happy ending. The KKK rose up, and Jim Crow became entrenched. Black men who tried to exercise their right to vote were lynched. This is an important point, but the film should have been better structured so its narrative flow didn't stop before the film itself did. "Free State of Jones" was clearly made by sticklers for authenticity. Everyone looks dirty and tired. The clothes look like clothes people wore in the nineteenth century. A confederate officer's uniform looks baggy and tacky, not sparkling and admirable. Scenes are shot in lamplight. I loved this aspect of the film, as will Civil War re-enactors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid and engaging enough movie, but also a bit overlong.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interesting film, starts out really, really well, nicely setting up why main character Newton Knight felt the way he did about fighting in the Civil War and why he felt like he had no choice but to run away. Those early battle scenes followed by the scenes of him back at home and seeing how terrible life is for the women at home were very effective at setting a mood for the rebellion that he's going to lead...and it did a really good job I think drawing you into the movie itself.Indeed the scenes that immediately follow of Knight on the run, hiding out in the swamp land with runaway slaves while being joined by fellow former Confederate soldiers who also felt like they had no choice but to run from the War and resist fighting in the name of the South were very interesting in setting up the contrast between Knight's position that all men are equal including escaped slaves and various other white soldiers who even hiding out from the Confederacy still nursed hatred and prejudice for the slaves that were alongside them hiding out in the swamp lands (and eventually in the town that became the Free State of Jones)It was an interesting dynamic, and the first half of the film I thought really did a good job of playing up that idea both dramatically and cinematically. Unfortunately the second half of the film was less effective at dramatizing the ideas they wanted to get across. It was still an interesting movie I thought, certainly different enough than the usual Civil War set stories that we usually see on film, but once The Civil War ends and we spend a half hour (if not more) seeing how the various citizens who made up the Free State of Jones essentially disassemble, the movie kind of starts to lose focus a bit.Now that last half hour or so was still interesting to me, but it didn't seem to be as tightly focused as the half that the move spent following Knight and his men during the Civil War itself and how they managed to defy the Confederacy and the various regiments and troops sent to roust them. There are various things happening as Knight seeks to keep the movement that he started during the war going but the movie's point that the white folk who were on Knight's side during the war wanted to move on with their lives and didn't want to bother themselves by standing up alongside Knight (despite Knight's best efforts) for the rights for former slaves to vote freely while well made, didn't seem to resonate as strongly as the movie's other points.All in all it was still a more interesting movie than I honestly thought it would be going in--I kind of thought from the ads for it that it was going to be yet another dull historical film, but there were honestly some very interesting ideas in here that got me into the story of the film, and kept me interested in where the story of the film was going to go after the war itself ended. On the other hand, its no "Glory" or "Gettysburg" or "Little Big Man" in terms of civil war set films that are gripping and incredibly well told but its still a fairly solidly put together enough film on its own and worth checking out if you're even slightly interested in the subject matter--uneven last half hour included.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'FREE STATE OF JONES': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new Civil War drama flick, starring Matthew McConaughey and directed by Gary Ross (who also helmed 'THE HUNGER GAMES', 'PLEASANTVILLE' and 'SEABISCUIT'). Ross also co-wrote the movie, with first time feature screenwriter Leonard Hartman. The film is loosely based on the life of Newton Knight; who lead a resistance group, of deserters and slaves, against the local Confederate Government (during the Civil War). It also costars Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Mahershala Ali, Keri Russell and Jacob Lofland (who also costarred with McConaughey in 2012's outstanding 'MUD'). The film received poor reviews from critics, and it also bombed at the Box Office. I found it to be good, but somewhat disappointing as well.The film is set during the Civil War, and it tells the story of Newton Knight (McConaughey). Knight was a Southern farmer, who deserted the army and fled into the Mississippi swamps (in Jones County). There he befriended several runaway slaves, and later lead a militia (of other deserters and slaves) against the corrupt local government. The movie is a fictional account of his dramatic adventures. The film has several great scenes, scattered throughout a meandering (and very depressing) historical fiction tale. It's either too long, or the producers cut too much out of the movie; because (either way) the film's pacing is severely off. It does have many exciting action scenes though, some hard-hitting drama, and some inspiring rebellious moments. McConaughey (once again) gives a great performance, and Ross's direction is decent. The script and editing could have used a little more work though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/YnZSF_6sbsA</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible Forgotten Story..Therefore Important: A Must See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think, to many southerners like myself, the story told in the movie Free State of Jones was part of a hidden history. Growing up this stuff was omitted from our collective education. It's not hard to see why. It's a very ugly and insidious part of history. It's our nations most terrible war from which healing has been extremely longstanding?even still 150 years on. However, to achieve a freedom from future tyranny I'd say the movie's timetable works. The time is right because what lingers needs the transparency that allows a fuller healing through the art of the story told. To never repeat the mistakes of the past we must learn, and that involves honesty.So, here we have a very different Civil War drama based on actual events. Instead of centering on great battles it explores the human drama that corrupt elements rather than any particular battle caused. While it's certainly true crimes were committed on both sides, the desperate elements operating within the Confederate movement were particularly ominous. Illegal conscription and seizing of property from those without a voice ran rampant. This is a climate which created many a defection, and here a subversive movement.Newton Knight was turned in an instant and it galvanized what would follow. Knight's defection from the Confederate Army results in his spearheading a group of slaves and small farmers to secede from the Confederacy and form a "Free State of Jones" This is a powerful story which cost many lives ultimately prevailing when the Union won the war. Though it prevailed, the freedom it was promised was slow to come. Afterwards, even with new constitutional rights granted, norms were steeped in old traditions. A messy time for sure which was purposely written out of the collective history. I think this movie serves the basics well without getting mired in diatribes of moralities. Even with the story's slow pace the viewer gets a powerful history lesson. The characters ring true and their life and death struggle is eloquently unraveled.Not since Matthew McConaughey came on the scene in the movie "A Time To Kill" has he had a more important role. I think it's one of his, if not his best, performance. He's not so much acting as inhabiting a man whose voice was silenced long ago. He carries that voice to a whole new generation and it speaks volumes. Perhaps the movie is a bit slow paced and long, even using the clunky device of segueing to a much later date's court case at odd times. But, these are small criticisms that do not take away from a forgotten history. The segueing part even reinforces how so much was to take so long to truly change. Overall, a masterfully constructed important story with great period feel and realism. I recommend it for all as it does entertain and enlighten. Yes, this many years on there's still a powerful lesson we should never forget and continue to seek that all important truest expression of freedom so many have given so much for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense and Absorbing, So Much to Like</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>139 minutes, rated R, mostly for intense violence, murder, brutality, disturbing graphic scenes, many of Civil War killed and wounded. Undoubtedly the real thing was still a million times worse. Very little sex or nudity.Whether it is his acting or TV commercials, McConaughey is intense and brooding. Acting highlights are delivered by many of the cast with most unknown to me. Stand out performances are given by McConaughey, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, and especially Mahershala Ali as "Moses". Photography, sets, costumes, weapons and landscapes are meticulous and a visual joy.At times the dialogue is sparse, and although I like movies with a slow and deliberate pace, there are a few times when scenes ? especially in the swamp ? were protracted for reasons difficult to grasp. Numerous flash forwards by about 100 years are at first jarring and difficult to absorb. As they continue they become more understandable, but no less out of place, even obtrusive.Basis in historical facts makes the movie believable and realistic; the list of historical consultants in the ending credits is impressive. The movie struggled for a conclusive ending, any ending, and finally just stopped after a couple post scripts.The movie wallows in helplessness and hopelessness, it is forever depressing. Very difficult for the audience to find a bright moment, a hero, or even a belief that things will get better. Whether re-visited once or often, the ability of our Nation to survive the Civil War and Reconstruction remains truly astounding. Anything focusing on this momentous period of our history can never be regarded lightly.Notwithstanding my somewhat lengthy list of nits, I found the movie intensely and personally enjoyable, absorbing . . . maybe somewhat due to the new, reclining leather lounge seats at our favorite theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great war story intercut with boring weird genealogy stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie and thought it should have had a wider release. Its run was so short and there were so few showings that Tom and I had to go all the way across town to see it, and it's apparently disappearing from Las Vegas next week. However, it would have been a better movie if it had been shorter. It included a bunch of stuff that was not necessary to the story.If the script had been edited down to just the stuff that actually relates to the title, the Free State of Jones and how it come to be, it would have been an excellent example of the war movie genre. The stirring victory could have been the third-to-last scene, with a couple of scenes of how things came out later -- the whole section about voter registration and voting could easily have been edited together into one scene, and the stuff about how agriculture was handled after the war could have been cut together into another one scene, and then the movie could have ended on another high note with Knight rescuing the child. The stuff about Knight's descendants could have been thrown onto the screen in text on the end, like many historical movies do. There were already several scenes that began with lots of text on the screen, especially towards the end, so that would have fit nicely with the rest of the movie. The first time they cut away from the middle of exciting fight scenes and character motivation scenes to show a different group of characters in a different century sitting around talking about ancestors and laws I literally turned to Tom and whispered, "What the hell?" We shrugged at each other. If I had been watching this on TV instead of in the theater I would have checked to make sure I was still on the same channel. Subsequent cuts away from the real story to this descendant stuff were not as confusing, but were still totally unnecessary to the story and interrupted it weirdly. The movie was way too long, including stuff that should have been edited out in the script stage, not just with the intercuts to the future but also with the stuff that occurred after there was no more Free State of Jones, after the end of the war. This was 2 different movies with the same characters glued back to back, plus a third of another different one with different characters chopped into it. Despite all that, the main story was so good I STILL think it's a great war movie. Before I went to see this, I was a little bit concerned it might be another "white savior" movie like Dances With Wolves and its science fiction reboot Avatar, but it isn't. The main character isn't motivated by being some other culture's new Messiah, he's just a man fighting for his own reasons and his own family. This movie was a fascinating look at a part of our history that I knew nothing about. Even Tom had not known about the Free State of Jones before, and he's been something of a Civil War buff. Why did we not know about this before? Why is this not taught in school? We knew about Texas being its own country once, so why not this? Everyone who cares about American history should see this. Since this is the end of its theatrical run, I guess most people will have to see it in a recorded medium or on TV. Fun inside joke to pull: from now on the actor is just named McConna because the gh is silent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was great, a gripping story that even tho it's slow pace, keep you interested in finding out what is going to happened next. I would recommend that any school that wan't to expand the minds of its pupils would add it to social or history lessons, no matter where you are from.So the next part of this review is for 8th - 9th grade teachers: This is a movie will be giving you (and hopefully your pupils) new/different thoughts on the subject of racism, sexism, and place in life based on who is in power and who is not, and what that actually means. This is not done in a groundbreaking change your mind sort of way, but a calm questioning way. "Does colour matter or is culture the problem/solution? What is a good culture and what is not? Is my culture a good or bad one?" or "For something a man would be killed, women were treated with anything between scorn to beaten and/or raped to equal punishment. Why was that? And what do the difference in action there actually mean?". These were just two of the questions I think my younger me would have asked himself if shown this movie. An older me with more knowledge of the rest of the world, so many many more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true story about the muddiness of Southern Bravery and Corruption and the disheartening Truth about Race and Racism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FREE STATE OF JONES, A REVIEW AND A COUPLE OF ASIDESMy father grew up in Soso, Mississippi. My mother passed away in January of this year. So when the movie came out, and he said he thought he would like to see it, I offered to go with him. He liked that, so today, on my parents 62nd wedding anniversary, which we did not mention, but I am certain was on his mind as much as mine, we went.The Movies of Lake Worth is in a little strip shopping center out near the Florida Turnpike. It was nice that I could pull up near the curb and let my 84 year old father out with his walker. Nicer still that the walk to the theater where it was showing was the first door inside. The rows were spacious so he could even push the walker in front of him, and we sat.My father has often talked about the Knight N___gs, of course being an old white man from Mississippi, he uses the word. Funny thing, he doesn't use the "N-word" in conversation, but i guess because the community held the Knights in a "Special" place, this was the title he knows to call them by. He recently told me that his mother, born in 1910 was picking black berries or strawberries and she and her family stopped at the Knight house to get water. That was apparently the only time anyone in his family had anything to do with the Knights.The movie does a good job of not sugar coating anything, from the battlefield scenes to the trial for interracial marriage (shades of the gay marriage struggle in Mississippi today), to the killings of both white and black folks. The saddest part of the story is how a handful of runaway slaves helped Newton and then many more whites, but in all too common southern white fashion, the white folks, when the war was over and the deserters were safe, they turned on the blacks, even the ones who had saved their lives.I know the British, the Belgians, the Germans, and 100 other countries, including the US Army has been guilty of equally disappointing human behavior, but this is a story about my people. Some of the people on both sides of the story are probably my ancestors. I know some fought in the Civil War, as confederates. Some probably hid out in the swamp and then betrayed those who helped them when it was time to bring Mississippi out of the dark.The movie doesn't shy away, it doesn't spare anybody. There are two things I wonder about though.Knight comes off as being nearly a saint. Maybe he was. Really, with the exception of Rachel and Moses, the Black folks don't have a lot of leadership. Again, maybe because of the times, they didn't, maybe it was understood the being Black and "uppity" was a good way to get killed. I just wonder if it was as much the brave smart white Newt, or if he took a bit of opportunity. Or, more likely, Hollywood has a big bankable white male star and they wanted to give him even more glory than the story had.I don't know. The whole Free State of Jones is a history so hard to find much truth in. In fact, Mississippi is a place to find much truth in. It is my birth state, but I find more heartache than joy in it. I enjoyed the time with my dad, and it was interesting to see some kind of truth about a bizarre piece of history we have a tangential connection to.My father's only comment was, "Some people say it was so bad back than, but it was." I think he is right about that.I was disappointed the theater 100% white people, and with the exception of a 20 something young man and woman who could have been his young mother or older girlfriend, everybody was closer to my dad's age than even my 56 years.If you are interested in an unvarnished view of parts of American history that you may not know much about, go see the movie. It was well done. It might even be close to the truth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Astonishing, frightening, and real - unforgettable!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew nothing about it when I went to the theater. Now I know: the Free State of Jones really happened, and most everything in this movie really happened. There really was a Mr. Newton Knight of Jones County, Mississippi, who had a white wife, and then a black wife named Rachel, and a guerrilla army of escaped slaves and Confederate Army deserters, who functioned as probably the first racially integrated army ever, in the swamps of Mississippi, during the Civil War. It was all real.They took over a portion of the State of Mississippi, for two years, against Confederate Army attacks. They held, for a while, three counties, and the largest town in the area, Ellisville Mississippi, and raised the Union flag (that's the American flag) over the courthouse there. Knight and his small army were still wreaking havoc on their bitter enemies -- the Confederacy, the slaveholders, and King Cotton -- when the war ended.They did all this with virtually no help from the Union Army -- William Techumseh Sherman was in the area, and knew Knight's rebellion was happening, but he either didn't trust Knight and his counter-rebels, or couldn't believe it, but in any case he spurned Knight's requests for arms and gave virtually no assistance, and did not even allow them to join the Union Army. All this is in the movie.Given this amazing story, it would be hard to miss turning out quite a show. And quite a show it is. Writer/Director Gary Ross says after "Seabiscuit," he was directing and screen writing "Hunger Games" and doing other odd jobs while working on this project -- his real passion for the last ten years - learning the history of Newton Knight and the counter-rebellion in Jones County, Mississippi, 1863-1865. This was Gary Ross' special project and he has created a wonderful, monumental film. Matthew McConaughey does a great job as Knight, a backwoodsman who evolved dramatically in his life. McConaughey starts off a subsistence farmer, gets drafted, then made a good soldier (he rose to sergeant), but eventually starts to see what a hideous racket the war is, and how evil slavery is. Gugu Mbatha-Raw does a fine job as Rachel. Mahershala Ali (Hunger Games) is also very good in his supporting role as Moses.The combat scenes are realistic, and wrenching, as are the depictions of the rapes, tortures, dog maulings, hangings, family separations ("How far is Texas," asks Mahershala Ali, as Moses the escaped slave). And the film continues into the anarchic "Reconstruction" era, when hooded terrorists reduced many newly "freed" blacks to a condition, in some ways, worse than slavery. When they were slaves, their lives at least had money value.From the impressive history professors and professional historians listed as consultants in the end credits, the film appears well researched. Unfortunately, the list of consultants has not made it into IMDb as of this writing -- can someone please add this?) Some reviewers are lukewarm. They say, not enough character development. Not enough love story. Too long. Explanatory historical facts pop up between scenes. Flash forwards confuse (the film jumps to the 1940's trial of Newton and Rachel Knight's grandson, who was actually convicted under Mississippi law of being "1/8 black" marrying a "white" woman. You can't make this stuff up). Some reactions are outright negative -- why? Maybe because Free State of Jones, despite a great script, fantastic sets, a story by turns astonishing and frightening, is not exactly entertaining. Because it's too real. We've created a comfortable myth of the Civil War, in which men became brothers again once all people were free. But the myth doesn't hold up to the reality. The Civil War erupted along huge differences -- deep rifts in this nation's society, which will not heal, unless we grasp the legacy of slavery, and sectarianism, which persist to harm us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the film aspires to epic-grade cinema but settles for adventure entertainment with convoluted timeframes that distract rather than illuminate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Historical dramas can be risky: if you get the history right the drama can suffer or if you get the drama right the history suffers. Try getting both and you may get neither. This is the case with The Free State of Jones (2016). Like many films about American folk heroes, it is a tale that celebrates rugged individualism in one man's battle against overwhelming odds with an emphasis on entertainment at the expense of historical insight or political perspective.The narrative covers historical events in Jones County, Mississippi during the American Civil War of the 1860s interspersed with a 1950s courtroom drama. Based loosely on real events, it depicts the life of legendary Newt Knight (Matthew McConaughey) who deserted the battlefield with the Confederate Army and formed a militia that declared the Free State of Jones. Motivated by the injustice of military exemptions for the wealthy, the massive loss of life in protecting the assets of the rich, and the rampant bigotry of slavery, Knight rose to become a Robin Hood figure who stopped the Confederates from stripping farms to supply troops in battle. Hunted as a traitor, he survived the war hiding in impenetrable swampland and later continued his civil rights advocacy. On a chapter by chapter basis, the film is a great adventure story, but overall its structure defies historical logic with its piecemeal timeframes, narrative threads left hanging, and little if any causal interpretation of the larger tide of history. This patchwork montage is complicated by frequent flash-forwards to a descendant of Knight on trial for marrying a white woman while being of one- eighth African American descent.McConaughey has a commanding if not convincing presence, while the period sets, costumes, battles and sub-plots are produced to high standards. The film is action rather than character- driven, and the many dramatic embellishments humanise a period piece based on Civil War history. Knight's script often has him sounding like a messiah, interrupted by his remorseless willingness to destroy those who threatened him or his followers. At two hours and nineteen minutes the film calls for more editing, and the time spent on melodrama is at the expense of a better paced story. Little attention is paid to the historical impact of the breakaway "Free State of Jones" despite its centrality to the narrative. The film aspires to epic-grade cinema but settles for adventure entertainment with convoluted timeframes that distract rather than illuminate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>trying to do too much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Newton Knight (Matthew McConaughey) serves as a medic in the Confederate army. He is disillusioned with a law that allows anyone with 20 slaves to avoid the draft. After a local boy is killed, he deserts to bring the body back for his mother to bury. The local farmers are suffering from a 10% tax and Newton starts to fight back. He gets hunted by dogs and rescued by slaves led by Moses Washington. He organizes a rebellion and declares the Free State of Jones with escaped slaves, deserters, and local farmers. He starts living with former slave Rachel (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) and they're later joined by Newton's wife Serena (Keri Russell). After the war, he fights for local blacks' civil rights. The movie is also interspersed with a modern court case against Davis Knight, a descendant of Newton, who is considered black tracing his lineage back to Rachel and therefore a criminal for marrying his white wife.There is no doubt that this is a sincere film. It does try to cover too much story and fails to distill the movie to one compelling idea. There are a few ideas competiting at the same time. There is no real fault with the actors. The directions are fine in the sense that they move the story along in a functional way. This material may be more fitting for a longer mini-series or a shorter TV drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard about this movie, I was definitely looking forward to seeing it. Then I read several negative reviews by critics and had second thoughts. But now that I have seen the film, I am so glad I did and don't get the bad reviews. The film deals with an alliance of poor whites and runaway slaves against the rich Southern slaveholders who wanted the whites to fight and die to preserve their wealth. Newton Knight, a white deserter, decides fighting for others' slaves is wrong and also comes up with a set of values for his "army" that is bedrock decent. Matthew McConaughey is very effective as Knight, as is Gugu Mbatha-Raw as his black spouse Rachel. The plot is well-paced and some of the photography is just gorgeous. My only reservation is that they could have cut 20 minutes off the length. It was important that a viewer learn the awful fate of the black "freedmen" after Union troops left the South in the 1870's but these minutes felt somewhat tacked on to the strong human story that preceded it. See the movie anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real Historic Drama Not For The Critics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are times when shameful dark corners of American History are exposed for what they are. In this era of the remake, at least this one is the first time around. Ironically, the trailers at this one run for the remake of The Birth Of A Nation. That is because the remake is not even using the novel of Dixon's and is a feature for Armie Hammer of fully written dramatic fiction. The silent The Birth of a Nation is based on Thomas Dixon Jr. novel "The Klansman" which is a Romantic work of fiction made into a classic by D W Griffith.I went out and looked at this Smithsonian reference for some information about this story Newton Knight. http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/true-story-free-state-jones- 180958111/?no-istUnlike other films based upon real characters during the Civil War like John Wayne's Dark Command (1940), this film has a very realistic dramatic feel to it. The film has a large cast but other than Newton Knight, this is a cast of little recognition, yet. Considering this film, some of the folks here could become stars later on. The story is really a drama with few punches pulled about how terrible it was to be in Jones County, Ms during the Civil War. The shame of the real crisis that was the United States and the Confederate States comes through strongly. There was very much wrong with the country and Newton Knight was a leader who lived through it. He becomes that leader not by choice, but by circumstances.He takes refuge in a swamp to get away from evil Confederate soldiers during the war and then after it, he has more trouble wih the Klu Klux Klan, and the Union which won the war. He is portrayed here as a very not typical Southerner, who deserts the Confederate Army and is shocked at what he finds back home when he gets there.The reason I feel this straight drama is not for the critics is that it is told a bit long and most of them are looking for more action. This movie is more drama and story telling and it is done right. I actually feel this movie is better being long as it gets to tell the story better.Is it totally true? At times the script takes some leaps away from fact, but the facts here are not all clear in the history books. That is the way true history happens and what is more important is the events that happened here and the shame that is portrayed with an uneasy feeling of fact. If you like drama and perhaps dog meat, it is very much worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A subdued, spiritual epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did NOT anticipate I'd be saying this, but Free State of Jones is two or three times the movie I'd thought it would be. It comes very near to being an excellent movie, brushing up against it, even.The film was marketed as if it were simply the story of some Confederate deserters, led by Matthew McConaughey's Newton Knight, who established a "free state" and resisted the graycoats. And that is the movie, at least for around half its running time.After that, the film takes us through the 10 years or so after the war, where good, simple people strained mightily under a sociopolitical system which was infuriatingly slow to evolve, all in the aim of leading good, simple lives where what you earn is yours and "every man is a man." Being the 1870's American South, however, foul injustices are constantly visited on supposedly free men and women, ranging from forced apprenticeship of freedmen to horrific lynchings. It is a quietly powerful film, which neither fetishes nor shrinks from awful violence, be it physical, political, social, or all three at once. This is a film of much greater scope than the trailers and TV spots would have you believe. I contend that it's a much better film than critics would apparently have you believe. While there are some unfortunately thin characterizations when it comes to the film's various villains, and a few moments don't ring quite as true as they ought to, the things that do work are shocking in their power. Instead of the Hollywoodized, heightened drama I was certain would drag "Jones" down, Gary Ross directs more than one key event to be as anticlimactic and unadorned as mundane reality actually is. This makes the human drama so much more penetrating and effective than it might have been otherwise. Nearly all the leads give nuanced, rock solid performances. McConaughey, Gugu Mbatha- Raw as Rachel, and Mahershala Ali as Moses were especially vivid. The cinematography is mostly utilitarian and unobtrusive, and yet it manages to be subtly compelling. For the most part, it's a very well written movie, though the first flash forward to a mid-20th century Alabama courtroom was a bit jarring. That subplot (which briefly illustrates the fate of one of Knight's descendants accused of miscegenation) doesn't quite gel with the rest of the film, but is nevertheless passable, I suppose. In spite of some minor shortcomings, this is a richly spiritual, thoughtful, compassionate film. Do yourself a favor and see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great historical drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, this was a must see movie. Not only was it very well done, but it filled in the color in a very sketchy outline I had of the historical period which included the Civil War in Mississippi and the Reconstruction period thereafter. As expected there was violence. It was a violent period. But it was never gratuitous nor meant to scare. I don't much like horror or movies which build up an intense fear around a scene until they reach the horrible climax. This movie had scenes which were not, in my opinion, appropriate for children, but there was no sex, and the violence, if this can be said of any violence, was present but handled in as tasteful a manner as could be expected given the nature of the subject. The acting was superb. Matthew McConaughey continues to earn my respect as a fine actor, and the supporting cast was great. The message was timely and undeniable. I shaved one point out only because it was so low key at the ending. But then again, I was not really disappointed in that... I still was left thinking about it all night long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Movie Star Historical Fiction but a little too long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a film claims to be "Based on a True Story", I always approach with a heavy dose of skepticism, and while Free State of Jones may not have strictly stuck to the facts, the story was one that I'm glad I learned about through the film. Matthew McConaughey plays the main character Newton Knight, an actual Confederate deserter who history has told various tales about so the truth may never be known. Knight is the focus of the film, tight close-up focus at points, as he leaves the army after seeing his nephew die and return to find his farm plundered by the Confederate army and tax collector.McConaughey has proved on numerous occasions that he can carry a film and that is no different here as he is a great actor to watch at his craft. However, the box office blunder of this film may take away from some of his star power as the pull of audiences was not high in a highly competitive summer. Still, he does a great job a grieving man caught up in a war that has nothing to do with him or his beliefs. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com</fullReview>

If only because, with that beard, he was the proverbial dead ringer when compared to actual newspaper photographs of the real Knight from that time!

		<fullReview>I made it to the local multi-plex to see this over the weekend. I remember the first trailer for this I saw on YouTube -- I actually thought it was a remake of "The Outlaw Josey Wales" at first. LOL And I must say, it's nice to see a big sprawling historical epic playing in wide release among the big summer blockbusters. Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey stars in this true story of a Civil War nurse who decides he's had enough of the class inequality in 1860's southern America, and takes it upon himself to not only become a deserter, but start his own independent nation, the "Free State of Jones". Be prepared for some *SPOILERS* just to be warned. I found this to be a pretty well-done film overall, and would definitely like to look into the back-story of this movie. My only issues with it were it had some "flash-aheads" that seemed sorta un-even comparing them to the rest of the movie's tone, and again *SPOILER* the ending was rather odd -- it really didn't come to a conclusion, it just sorta stopped-???

		<shortDescription>A film so noble it almost makes up for an inert and clumsy story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A part of me really wants to give Free State of Jones a more positive review. Viewed only on a technical critique, the environment looks beautiful, the acting screams Oscar caliber, and the underrated Gary Ross offers his boldest and grittiest angle for a film to date without cowering to obnoxious shaky cam like last time. Viewed on the subtext, Ross also tackles his noblest of ideas. Setting during the American Civil War, the film draws parallels in the real world, inasmuch as the Confederate army leeching off the poor countries in the false pretense of "winning the war" calls back to the modern paranoia about the rich leaders leeching off our benefits. Even though it's been done before, doubly so with the added dose of racism, the film takes a fresh new angle, even if it boils down to Matthew McConaughey's real life character resorting to more like Robin Hood than a more complicated figure. Adding multiple other commentary on racial suppression that spans to almost a century on top of that, and this film would almost take care of itself. Viewed as a functioning story, however, it just doesn't work. For all its willingness to go headfirst into these ideas, the movie struggles to find any focus or any coherence. You see, the film occasionally cuts back and forth between huge gaps of time in order to view many ways the corrupt "white Confederates" horribly harass the working class, but without any strong rhythm to do so. More troubling, the film gets too relaxed with itself and doesn't supply enough enjoyment, issuing way too much downtime with only a few sprinkles of tension in order to advance the plot. And once said plot already resolves itself once the "Free State" has been obtained, we still have an extra half hour of meandering. I get that they want to transition to life after the war, (that court case, KKK burning houses, retrieving a lost son from outside of the state) but the way they arrange these events so haphazardly leaves very little investment. This, in hindsight, would work if said connective tissue allows us to flesh out McConaughey's character outside of a clearly glorified "steal from the rich" archetype, but there's not much else to chew on with this character outside of a weirdly offensive speech that claims that his bankrupt status is on the same level of slaves dealing with lynching and whipping. I don't know how unaware Ross is with that self-centered claim, but the way this character plays as a blank slate savior of the oppressed makes his ulterior motives so uncomfortable. Despite the films noble intentions intertwined with ultra-real set piece battles, Free State of Jones is way too clumsy and inert for me to recommend. It takes the racial issues and the One Percent parallels without any consideration to add anything connecting to all of it. It inspires itself as both a Confederate war epic and a Robin Hood tale but doesn't have enough steam to go all the way with it. I appreciate this film and it's by far the most original out of the summer schedule, but that is as far as this film offers.

		<shortDescription>One of the Best American Civil War Movies!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hunger Games" writer &amp; director Gary Ross' impressive American Civil War epic "Free State of Jones," starring Matthew McConaughey, ranks as the best theatrical release of summer 2016. Ostensibly, this factual American Civil War period drama breaks ranks not only with traditional sagas about the Civil War but also is relevant to contemporary racial issues. Essentially, Hollywood specializes in two types of Civil War movies. First, you have those about Union battlefield victories, like "Gettysburg" (1993) and "The Horse Soldiers" (1959). Second, you have those about Confederate triumphs on and off the battlefield, such as "The Raid" (1954), about the Saint Albans foray in Vermont. These movies tend to alienate Northern and Southern audiences. Presumably, part of the reason for the scant number of American Civil War movies is the polarities they generate. Southerners abhor having defeat rubbed into their noses. Similarly, the politically correct loathe notorious pro-Southern movies like "Gods and Generals" (2003) that applaud 'the Lost Cause' of the Confederacy. If "Free State of Jones" achieves anything of distinction, it shows that not all native-born Southern whites whistled "Dixie" during the Civil War. Consequently, "Free State of Jones" qualifies as a revisionist film. Forget about that travesty of a movie "Tap Roots" (1948) that Universal Pictures based loosely on the Jones County insurrection that the Matthew McConaughey movie commemorates. The only recent major theatrical Civil War movie that has shown the seamier side of the South was writer &amp; director Anthony Minghella's "Cold Mountain" (2003), starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renée Zellweger. Kidman portrayed a destitute wife in "Cold Mountain" who contended with despicable Confederate soldiers assigned to patrol the home-front where she resided. These unsavory Confederates terrorized poor Southern families and intimidated widows when they were not engaged actively in searching for and executing deserters. The male protagonist in "Cold Mountain" was a Confederate deserter (Jude Law) struggling to get home to his wife. Along the way, the Jude Law character joined runaway slaves and they helped him conceal himself from pugnacious Confederate patrols. Similarly, Ross' "Free State of Jones" follows the exploits of rebellious Confederate Army medic Newton Knight (Matthew McConaughey of "Interstellar") who deserted and embarked on a home-front campaign against the Confederacy that tied down troops that could have been more strategically employed against Union forces. Historically, "Free State of Jones" is one of the few accurate films about the Civil War. According to Mississippi History Now, the Mississippi Historical Society's on-line publication, Knight lived in Jones County, and Jones County owned the least number of slaves in the state. Most Civil War historians will tell you the non-slave owning sections of the old South, principally the hill counties, espoused Unionist sentiments. Unfortunately, anybody who shirked their duty to serve in the army often found themselves in front of a firing squad. Mississippi History Now states that "on May 13, 1862, Newt Knight enlisted as a private with his friends and neighbors into Company F of the Seventh Battalion, Mississippi Infantry in Jasper County. They enlisted together so they could avoid being drafted away to serve with strangers. After the war, Newt claimed that he only agreed to serve as an orderly to care for the sick and wounded." Eventually, Knight assembled a home-grown militia of Confederate deserters and fugitive African-American slaves and mounted a resistance movement against the Confederacy. When the army wasn't tangling with Knight and his militia, they preyed on impoverished Southerners and imposed heavy taxes on them to benefit the Confederate cause. The Army appropriated crops and livestock and left the widows to starve. Historian Rudy H. Leverett, in his book "Legend of the Free State of Jones," points out that Knight and his militia clashed 14 times with Confederate soldiers. Ross stages these violent encounters with enough cinematic blood and thunder to justify an R-rating. Meantime, according to Mississippi History Now, the controversial "Twenty Negro Law" prompted Newton to desert from the Confederacy. Newton's friend and fellow soldier Jasper Collins hated this law, too. If he owned 20 slaves or more, a planter was exempt from military service. Reportedly, Collins uttered the immortal words, "This law ? makes it a rich man's war and a poor man's fight." Basically, Ross turns Newton Knight into a Robin Hood figure that united escaped slaves and disenfranchised white Southerners. Moreover, Ross has turned the Confederate Army into the equivalent of Robin Hood's infamous adversary--the cruel Sheriff of Nottingham. At the same time, Knight trained vulnerable women and children in the art of self-defense. In one memorable scene, Knight arms adolescent girls with weapons, and these girls convince a Confederate patrol to skedaddle. Eventually, after several savage skirmishes, Knight strangles a prominent Confederate officer with his bare hands in the film's single instance of vengeance. After the war, Knight conducted a campaign for racial inequality for African-Americans despite overwhelming opposition from intractable whites.Rarely does Hollywood illuminate the plight of the poor white farmers who opposed both the Confederacy and the wealthy slave owners who sought to preserve 'the peculiar institution.' Before "Cold Mountain," "Tap Roots" (1948) and "Shenandoah" (1965) were the only movies that tackled anti-Confederate sentiment. Although inspired by Newton Knight's deeds, "Tap Roots" shared more in common with "Gone with the Wind" (1939), while "Shenandoah" (1965) depicted an obstinate Virginian patriarch (James Stewart) who refused to let his sons participate in the war. Ultimately, the thing that distinguishes good movies from bad is good films offer something new and refreshing. "Free State of Jones" presents a historical narrative of far greater depth and complexity than previous Civil War movies. In our woebegone, politically correct era, when holier-than-thou factions harangue Southerners discriminately about flying the Confederate Star and Bars battle flag, "Free State of Jones" rejects the notion that every Southerner subscribed to slavery and succession. Altogether, Gary Ross' "Free State of Jones" isn't comparable to Sergio Leone's "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly," but this authentic actioneer displays more than enough of those sentiments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of best films I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was a tremendous tour de force. It spoke of the terrible inner thirst for justice and righteousness that is within the hearts of that tiny percentage of people who possess it.it speaks to the anguish of soul at the misery of evil people, the torment to humanity that even just a few of them do, and that it is usually the best of humanity who they violate. I saw on the message boards the ranting and bitter domineering raging tirade by a user about the scene where his first wife, played by Keri Russel, is taken back under the protagonist's wing after she returns from her time away. I disagree with the user who rented about this. I found this to be one of the most appropriate and realistic scenes of the film. Of anything, it should make everyone wish they could return to that time, when good people still had proper sensibilities. The user who posted that rant exemplifies everything that had gone wrong in society since the time this film is set in. This film is a near masterpiece. One of the best films I've ever seen. A 9 is an extremely high rating for me. Only about 20 of the many thousands of films I've seen gets a 9 or above.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Free State of Jones should have been a swashbuckling Civil War Robin Hood epic. Instead I felt like I was at school</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was in the eight grade when I went on a week long trip to the east coast with many students to the east coast on an educational trip. We went to Williamsburg, Virginia and Washington D.C. but we also went to Gettysburg. This was my first hand glace at seeing the fields of where the Civil War was fought. Given the size and scope, I was surprised by how much space both sides had. This was where I learned about ones contribution to the war when the confederacy would be able to simple come onto one's property to take what they need.That to me defines everything that goes against America's dreams and ideals. The government should not have to take from people that are supposedly free. I know your thinking that I'm making some commentary about the troubles of today's government, but I'm mostly referring to the cruelty of the South during the war. If slavery wasn't awful enough, then common man has to suffer as well. Today's film refers to someone on the lines that didn't agree with their own cause, which is something you don't hear about too often. Does Free State of Jones make enough of an impact to tell an interesting part of the Civil War?During the early parts of the Civil War, a farmer/medic confederate solider Newton Knight (played by Matthew McConaughey) is feeling disenchanted by what his side is fighting for. He feels that the only ones benefiting are the rich ones who by rule, don't have to serve as long as they have the right amount of slaves. After his son is shot on the field, he deserts his post to return home to Jones County, Mississippi. It's here he teaches his family how to use guns against fellow confederates who want to take their share. On the run, Newton is able to escape into a swamp along with fellow runaway slaves. He learns a lot from runaways like Moses Washington (played by Mahershala Ali) and Rachel (played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw) about their desire to walk the streets like any other white person. Through the passage of time, more deserters of the confederacy join Newton in the swamps. It's he who decides to form a militia, and uses his experience to help capturing a large part of land in order to declare their own free state. We get a glace at their lives through the War and parts of the Reconstruction. What we have here should be an interesting part of history. This should be like a Civil War Robin Hood with plenty of action. What's strange about Free State of Jones is that it's simply boring. Instead of action, we are given speeches about race, speeches about being free, speeches about strategy, speeches about relationships, speeches about farming; pretty much a movie with speeches. I think much of the focus was more on being historically accurate then being an entertaining movie. Director Gary Ross (Pleasentville, Seabiscuit, The Hunger Games) took a strange turn within his writing and directing by not only giving us a visually dull film, but an uninterested script as well. Aside from a lot of speech dialogue, the presentation also makes random jumps to months, years, and even decades latter for another story that could have been cut. McConaughey is clearly trying as is most of the newcomer's, but with a script this dull, no one could have saved it. Free State of Jones needed to be a fun, swashbuckling tale of a man who fought his own system for the common people. I can't even imagine a Civil War expert getting into this.I'll give this three confederate uniforms out of five. If you're an insomniac, then Free State of Jones will help you fall asleep. Rather then being a sweeping epic, I felt like I was at school with one of the most boring history lessons ever given.</fullReview>

It wasn't till the Confederates gave an exemption from military service to landowners - that Newton quit in disgust.The "Union Army" had similar requirements, that's how Andrew Carnegie paid $27 to avoid military service.Newton wanted zero to do with either army! (Source for all the above - The Barnes Review)! Newton was not a hero! He left his wife and family, then married one of his slaves and insisted on staying on the same farm as his "former" family. This doesn't make Newton a Hero, Your guess as to what it does make him.Hollywood loves to twist History and make it palatable for theatre audiences.. but this is really ridiculous!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You cannot own a child of God."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a shame that this little-known story from the American Civil War couldn't have been presented in a better film. While it is far from a horrible film, it is a disappointing one for certain. A lot of the weakness boils down to the screenplay for the film. While the film covers over fourteen years of time, it does so in a way that is downright dull at times. The filmmakers chose to devote most of the film's screen time in the first hour to the buildup to the events leading to the creation of the Free State. While this does give us time to get to know Knight, the people he would come to lead, and how the situation affects them, it spends a little too long getting there. It is just a series of meetings between people, discussions and speeches about how things are, and what should be done about it, and long glances and walks from place to place.When events do finally move toward driving Confederates out of Jones County, it is done, and over very quickly. What should've been the main focus of the film takes up just twenty or so minutes of screen time. The last forty minutes or so of the film deals with Reconstruction, and how Knight attempted to fight the return of slavery in, albeit by another name, and getting men of color the right to vote. While this part of the story is compelling, it feels by this point that the filmmakers are just wanting to tell as much of Knight's story as possible in one film. This ends up hurting the film, as it starts to feel like too much on the plate.What's more, the filmmakers also chose to include a subplot with one of Knight's descendants in 1947. The subplot tells of Davis Knight and his getting married. However, because Davis was the great-great-grandson of Knight and his wife Rachel (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), a black woman, that made him 1/8 black, and therefore, a black person not eligible to marry a white in Mississippi at that time. He was sent to prison for this "crime," but the conviction was eventually overturned. While it is also a compelling and powerful story, it deserves to be told in its own film, and not in a film whose focus was on a completely different story altogether.And therein lies the central problem of Free State of Jones. At the end of the day, the film attempts to tell three different stories in its 139-minute running time, making it a film with very little focus. For those who might not be familiar with the era and its people, this might make the film difficult to follow. And despite these different stories, the story drags from time to time. It definitely feels more like something that should've been a History Channel docudrama, with historian interview thrown in (Replacing the film's use of text titles to explain events).However, despite these issues, there is much to admire in the film. It's beautifully-shot, and has a very powerful cast. McConaughey does a fantastic job as Newton Knight, bringing this character to life with a realism that does make you admire what he stood for. Mbatha-Raw gives a very effective performance as Rachel, the slave and healer who eventually becomes Knight's wife, and joins him in his quest. Mahershala Ali, as the runaway slave Moses, gives the film's most subtle performance, understating his character's desire to be treated as a man despite the color of his skin.In probably the film's most powerful moment, when Knight asks Moses why he wants to be free, he gives the film's greatest sentiment: "Because you cannot own a child of God." It is this scene, and the interaction between the characters, that really makes Free State of Jones come alive. We understand these people, and care for them. So, when brutal acts come to them, we are saddened and angered by their loss.The few action scenes are well-shot and edited, giving the film a visceral impact. The recreation of the fighting around Corinth, is well-staged, exciting, and brutal. There are a few historical quibbles (Formations seem to not be consistent between shots, in addition to uniforms and equipment looking a little inaccurate), but it conveys the brutality of war, and its impact on the individual.However, despite all the good it has going for it, this is not a film I can fully recommend. While it does have great performances, and some great technical merits in how it's shot, Free State of Jones squanders its opportunity to tell a powerful story by delivering a film that lacks a focused narrative, and is boring at times. Only those with a real interest in the period, and learning more about this story, will find something to appreciate. But even for history buffs like myself, it leaves a lot to be desired. In the end, Free State of Jones is neither a good experience, nor a bad one. It's just a middling experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's an interesting film to come out during the month of June. On the surface, it appears to be Oscar bait. But it has its fair share of issues. However, they shouldn't be enough to hinder any enjoyment of the film.Amidst the impressive set pieces and Confederate South backdrop, Free State of Jones follows Newton Knight, played by Matthew McConaughey, a deserted soldier who starts an uprising against his former Confederate army. He leads a group of escaped slaves and runaway farm workers under the credo that no man shall be owned, and poor men should not be losing their lives so the rich can get richer.It's a truly powerful film about freedom and an earnest man who believes in equality--even on a subconscious level. Yet, it's interesting to note that everything between Knight and his comrades is all good. There is a minor spat between him and four of his men, but it lasts all of about ten minutes of screen time. Other than that, there isn't much conflict within his rule.There is, however, much outside hostility. That's the whole point of the movie. The action scenes are both eye-opening and jaw dropping. About as real as any Civil War film can be. And there are several scenes that are so lifelike that even the snootiest critic must acknowledge its integrity.The script isn't perfect. Some potential nuances are left on the table. Certain inner struggles that Knight faces are sped through, when they would have significantly benefited the character's development. We don't catch enough inward glimpses. At times, the circumstances seem overcome too easily. And it's not McConaughey's fault. I'm not sure if I can imagine anyone else playing the part. But the main story is told the right way. It serves its purpose as we come closer to understanding the struggle of the slaves and impoverished farmers. It's not just a fight for freedom, but for equality--which this movie proves may not always be the same thing.At 139 minutes, it never feels long. By the end, you still feel like there should have been more.Twizard Rating: 91</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Civil War period piece has its moments, but doesn't quite pack a punch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Civil War was one of the most grueling periods in American history, and according to many left a crimson stain on our country. For a time of racial prejudice, slavery, and mass segregation, this period is a reminder of our country's blood-stained past. This historical drama based on true events captures the brutal hardships of the South trying to fight for Civil Rights that many southerners, particularly the African-Americans were stripped away from, and the human cost that took a tool on those fighting. Whil this film sadly doesn't quite leave a powerful impact or strike the emotional core it should have, director Gary Ross (of The Hunger Games Saga) fortunately captures some smart, if deeply flawed portrayal of a story that defined this long-gone period. The film tells the story of Newton Knight (played by Matthew McConaughey), a poor conservative farmer raising his family in Deep South Mississippi during the height of the 1860s Civil War. Struck by poverty and the racial prejudice by the hands of the Confederacy who bound society in a deteriorating state, Newton launches an uprising against the Confederacy leading local slaves and farmers of Jones County including former slave Moses (played by Mahershala Ali) and poor nurse Rachel (played by Guga Mbatha Raw) in a fight for Civil Rights that longs far after the conclusion of Civil War.There is plenty of powerful (possibly Oscar-worthy) potential to be given from his historical-based drama, from the cast performances, to the writing, to the gripping emotional atmosphere that could have left a strong impact on viewers as they walk out of the theaters. Some of these efforts pay off but others are wasted on it's sluggish plot. Considering the engrossing performance Academy Award winner Matthew McConaughey embraces in the lead role, the movie does supplement some energy. The opening scene featuring the Battle of Corinth where we watch soldiers brutally shot, blown to pieces, and the imagery of the gruesome medical operations following the bloodshed realistically capture the horrors of active combat. At the same time, these opening minutes are so rushed and ends before it can leave an impact. From there on, the plot drags through a series of seemingly non-stop speeches by Newton Knight, with only occasional battle scenes between Knight's army and the Confederate soldiers that are over within a minute or two; and it all operates in a way that feels more like episodes of an HBO mini-series than a feature length movie. In addition, the plot becomes interspersed with scenes of Newton Knight's great grandson following through a court case after being charged with miscegenation that while intriguing, serve very little to the story. Though there is a some sequences that genuinely capture some poignant Civil War elements such as the lynching of former slaves and executions, the film just doesn't quite capture the energy to contend for a powerful story.Free State of Jones may have it's moments of authenticity and spirit as well as a brilliantly compelling performance by Matthew McConaughey, the film doesn't quite pack the punch it could have. This is not say the film is a total misfire, after all there are some truly memorable aspects to be experienced. In the end, the film feels like a missed opportunity.</fullReview>

And, that is I had a hard time hearing much of what Matthew McConaughey's character said in the first half of the movie, and The Missus tells me she had "a little" trouble also... We saw the film at a Regal Theater in eastern Pennsylvania, so I doubt it was an issue of quality, because later on the 'problem' pretty much evaporated - by about the halfway point it was no longer a problem for me...

When they seek him out and come to his new home and new life, he treats her with disdain and coldness, offering them a shack to sleep in out back. Leaving them to fight a war, only to find a new wife in the process, shows Newt as a low-life, dishonorable man. All other great things this movie could've been has subsequently become irrelevant in light of this man's poor character. One other thing to note... the flash-forward to the future trial was the most awkward and confusing thing I've seen in a movie. That whole side story was unnecessary and distracting.</fullReview>

Truths include: Whites enslaved blacks. Whites emancipated blacks. Whites betrayed emancipation. Whites terrorized blacks and effectively re-enslaved blacks through Jim Crow. Laws were used to enslave, emancipate and re- enslave. In the 1960s, whites again laws were used to "free" blacks. Since then, whites have worked to reverse the legislation of the 1960s. Racism has been a central theme in American history. The film attempts to portray the life of one Southern man, Newton Knight, his family and community within this historical context. There is nothing the film can do to alter the historical realities. Because it does not attempt to, it has been criticized. As a Southern White Male, I find the fact that the film doesn't attempt to alter the historical realities a cause for praise, not criticism. After a hundred plus years of propaganda like Birth of a Nation and Gone with the Wind, surely a propaganda film of another order is in order. But The Free State of Jones should not be criticized because it's not that film. Free State is an "historical drama", told well, with exceptional acting, terrific cinematography and, I would argue, very good editing. I gave it 10 stars, not for what it wasn't but for what it is. A story well told.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a good movie to be had with the material that was covered in Gary Ross' film, FREE STATE OF JONES, but this movie is not it. Long, languid and disjointed, this experience is only held together by yet another strong Matthew McConaughey performance.FREE STATE OF JONES is based on the true-life story of Newton Knight, a Confederate deserter who leads a rebellion against the Confederacy towards the end of the Civil War and starts his own nation.Based on that description and the trailers to this movie, I was expecting a battle filled epic adventure about one man's stand against the establishment. What we get instead is a slow moving character study of Knight and his life before, during and AFTER his rebellion.Based on a story by Leonard Hartman, Director and Screenwriter Ross spends the 2 hour and 16 minutes of this movie to tell many, many stories - all centered around Knight - to help flesh out his character. And, in the hands of McConaughey, this character does come to life. Unfortunately, what was sacrificed by this was the fleshing out of ANY of the supporting characters. The consequence of this is that we are not emotionally invested in any of these characters, so when something happens to them, we just shrug and move on - much like Newton Knight himself.Director Ross moves (or doesn't move) this film at a deliberate pace, so there are quite a few long, slow, quiet scenes of Knight thinking or Knight and another character talking and reacting to each other. The few action scenes that there are in this movie are perfunctory and the coda to this movie (the part that takes place after THE FREE STATE OF JONES part of the film is complete) takes up a good 1/3 of the films' length at the end showing how the freed slaves were not really free and McConaughey's Knight must again seethe and react to these injustices with long stares into the distance and a few beautifully written words that sums things up.There is, potentially, an interesting movie in here. One that either needs to be much shorter (focusing on THE FREE STATE OF JONES portion of this film) or much longer (to flesh out the supporting characters). Instead, I got a film that felt like I was reading the CLIFF'S NOTES version of things. I got the gist of what happened, I just didn't get the emotion.6 (out 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I try not to overanalyze movies. I'm mainly concerned with their entertainment value, regardless of what kind of movie it is. However, at some point, I have to ask what the filmmakers are trying to accomplish. In short, why was this movie made? I mean, beyond their goal to entertain audiences and make money (because, the entertainment industry is a business, after all), what's the point of the film? Are they trying to entertain us by inspiring us, by educating us, by giving us some thrilling action or just an interesting story with engaging characters? "Free State of Jones" (R, 2:19) seems to have all those goals in mind. Maybe it's too many goals, because the film only accomplishes each of them moderately well.The movie is based on the true story of Newton Knight, a Mississippian who served in the Civil War until he became disillusioned, deserted the confederate army and organized a bunch of people back home to rebel against the rebellion. Knight's story is an interesting one, but like too many Hollywood portrayals of real-life events, this particular cinematic treatment takes a lot of liberties with the facts. It even leaves out what I would consider to be some of the more interesting aspects of Knight's story, while making the story it does tell a little too muddled to be very inspiring, educational or even all that interesting, as told.As the film opens, Knight (Matthew McConaughey) is dividing his time between fighting on the front lines and carrying wounded comrades to nearby field hospitals. When his young cousin, Daniel (Jacob Lofland), gets drafted and shows up at Knight's unit during the Second Battle of Corinth (Mississippi, fall 1862), Knight does his best to keep the lad safe. That doesn't last long? and neither does Daniel's army career. After we see Knight complain about military exemptions for wealthy slave holders, what happens to Daniel is the last straw. At risk to his own life, Knight leaves the battlefield and heads home.Knight hides out in a swamp (where cavalry troops do not operate effectively) with former slaves, who include Moses Washington (Mahershala Ali) and Rachel (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), along with a growing number of fellow deserters. Knight organizes this unlikely team into a pseudo-military unit which fights against Confederate Army attempts to take livestock and provisions from the locals, round up deserters and kill those who get in their way. The Knight Company becomes a de facto collection of Unionists fighting behind enemy lines and eventually takes control of several Mississippi counties.Knight's cause of defending all honest, hard-working people against their oppressors continues after the war ends. He works against new laws which effectively continue slavery under different conditions, he works with the federal Reconstruction government in Mississippi and supports black voting rights. He and his compatriots take these actions at great personal risk. Knight further raises his own risk by starting a family with a former slave, leading to a chain of events which we see play out in a series of flash-forward scenes in a Mississippi courtroom over eight decades after the Civil War has ended."Free State of Jones" is reasonably entertaining, but trips over its own themes as it stumbles aimlessly through a dozen years of rebellious activities and their long-term repercussions. First of all, the movie is confusing. It's not that the story itself is hard to follow, but Gary Ross' script and direction fail to make clear key personal relationships in the film, and throughout its 2 ? hours, it makes the audience wonder where the story is going and whether this movie has much of a point at all. Historians disagree over Knight's activities, motivations and character, but this portrayal of his life does little to shed light on his story. The movie lacks a strong narrative thread and the 1940s' legal drama that we see play out is more distracting than enlightening. McConaughey and his co-stars do quality work and this depiction of their life and times is somewhat interesting and educational, but the film lacks the cohesion and narrative heft to drive home its many points or deliver on the promise of the truth behind its story.

		<shortDescription>Well-intended but falls well short of compelling viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Free State of Jones" (2016 release; 140 min.) brings the story of Newton Knight. As the movie opens, we are reminded that this is "based on actual events in Jones County, Mississippi, 1862-1876", and we dive straight into a horrible battle between the Union and the Confederate, where Knight is helping out with the sick and wounded. It isn't long before Night is outraged at the state of things (among others by the so-called Twenty Negro Law, which exempts anyone owning at least 20 slaves from having to enlist), that he goes AWOL and goes into hiding in the nearby swamps. At this point we're 15 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie writer-director Gary Ross (The Hunger Games, Seabiscuit, etc.). Here he tackles an interesting footnote in the Civil War, namely how one man starts a movement in the deep south that runs counter to the prevailing sentiments. By all means this could've and should've made for a fascinating film. Alas, it wasn't to be, for several reasons. First, the movie tries to ride the coattails of "Twleve Years a Slave" by having us revolt and be morally outraged. When in "12 Years" that was beautifully achieved, "Free State" simply falls flat and as a result we don't become emotionally invested in anything we witness. Not to mention that the characterizations are over-simplified. The Confederate: bad!! rich people: bad!! etc. The second reason is that with a running time approaching 2 1/2 hrs., the movie is simply way too long for its own good. Would've been much tighter with a 30 min. trim. Matthew McConaughey as Newton comes across like the Civil War version of Britain's Robin Hood. Gugu Mbatha-Raw, in the role of Rachel, truly shines. Bottom line: this movie is clearly well-intended, and while there are certainly some good parts in it, the overall result falls far short of compelling viewing. The difference in quality with "!2 Years a Slave" is stark..."Free State of Jones" opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended by a big crowd, but I saw at least 2 people leave the screening midway through, and not return. I stayed to the very end, but ultimately left a bit disappointed. If you are a Civil War buff, this is worthwhile seeking out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "must-see" for anyone puzzled about why the American South . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . has remained so Ignorant and Backward for century after century. FREE STATE OF JONES documents how the Lazy Racist Rich People of the South set out to deliberately purge their already shallow Gene Pool of ALL Righteous Folks during and immediately after the U.S. Civil War. Unlike in GONE WITH THE WIND, which is intentionally 99% False and Historically Untrue, JONES reveals that the Laziest, Richest, and Most Racist Rebels SAT OUT the entire Civil War in the safety of their Plantations and Town Houses, given one "Family Deferment" from the Conferderate Army for each 20 Black People that they "owned." Racist Slavery has continued in one form or another down there until Today, with the genitalia of any Brave Souls bucking the Racists literally cut off (as indicated here) to prevent there from being ANYBODY worth salvaging in the South, which is dragging down ALL of America, like a millstone tied to a lynch noose around our collective necks. The Bible teaches us "An Eye for an Eye" and "Sins of the Fathers Are Paid Back for Seven Generations," so wherever YOU live, keep a ledger of vehicles and homes decorated with the Rebel Traitors' Flag and license plates signifying this Mark of the Beast and Devil's Alliance. THE PURGE is coming soon, when ALL of America will be converted into a FREE STATE OF JONES.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's actually not bad and thankfully not good enough for Matthew McConaughey to use it to get an Oscar nod</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So the movie is not as bad as I thought it would be. It was getting a lot of bad publicity from critics and viewers, but what I saw was not really half bad. I felt like I learned something (or at least it built the foundation for me to seek more info)Matthew McConaughey plays a soldier for the confederate army who deserts his post when he gets fed up of him and his kin folk dying so that rich people can get richer off of having slaves pick their Cotton for them. On the run, he was no better than the slaves (or at least that's what the movie wants you to think), but back in those days only a white man could have gotten away with declaring the land that he was hiding on his own country where all children of God as the movie puts it are free to work hard on the land they tend to and have no other man tell them what to do with it. In and interesting side story mixed in this one, Matthew McConaughey's character, Newton Knight has a decedent who is on trail because in the 1950s, Mississippi was so racist that they would not allow a white man with a drop of black blood in him marry a white women and the prosecutor had evidence that Knight may have fathered a baby with a black woman giving this man that blood.McConaughey is real good at playing a simple man who firmly stands by his high moral code, and no matter what the story content is this movie is all about McConaughey being the center of attention.It was a cool story about what America was like after slavery ended. Though not completely historically accurate, though I should point out that as weird as it seems in 2016, the Republicans were the good guys (they did free the slaves, after all) and the Democrat were all about the Triple K. It's cool yet messed up how things have not changed so much since 1862 and the movie comes out at a time when we need to reflect upon this.Too bad the movie itself is not all that good to be reflecting on. It's too long and not constructed well, using historical narrations that make the movie look unfinished. It was a lot of good info over shadowed by the leading man who needed to be focus on far too much. It's not bad but I would wait to catch it on Netflix or something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Little Known Historical Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Free State of Jones", starring Matthew McConaughey-Interstellar, The Wedding Planner; Gugu Mbatha-Raw-Concussion, Jupiter Ascending; Keri Russell-The Americans_tv, Honey I Blew Up the Kid and Mahershala Ali- House of Cards_tv, Predators.This is based on a true story-most people have not even heard about, including me-about a southern farmer named Newton Knight, that deserted the Confederacy army during the American Civil War and then went on to fight for the slaves' rights to vote and be equal men. He also seceded from the Confederacy and declared Jones County, Mississippi a free and independent state. Matthew plays Newt, who left his wife, Keri, when he deserted and went into hiding. He met up with some slaves, who were also on the run, including Gugu and Mahershala, whom he befriended. Matthew's desertion was spurred on by his nephew's death during a battle and Matthew just got discouraged with fighting for the rich plantation owners and not having anything to show for it. After becoming semi- famous as an outlaw, Keri came back into the picture-she had no place to stay-and moved in with Matthew &amp; Gugu, his new squeeze. That's right, all three lived on the same homestead, so I guess Matthew/Newt was considered to be one of the first 'players'. There is also a side story, sort of a flash forward, that tells about a descendant of Matthew's that had some legal problems in the courts, because of his mixed heritage. It's rated "R" for battle scenes and disturbing images and has a running time of 2 hours &amp; 19 minutes. If you are a history buff, you will probably like it. It's not one that I would buy on DVD-once was enough-but it would be a good rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Speeches - The Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You saw the trailers for this movie. You remember how cool it looked? How it looked like it was about a ragtag group of people trying to fight for their freedom, their independence, and their dignity? Yeah, those scenes took up maybe about ten minutes of this movie. If you go into this movie expecting a fast paced action epic, that is definitely not what you are going to get.Now, I knew this before watching this film. I knew it was not going to be an action heavy movie. But I didn't care, I was still excited to see my boy Matthew McConaughey on the big screen again. And you know what? He didn't disappoint. In fact, he was fantastic. Matthew McConaughey is a great actor, and he was great in this movie, delivering an intense and emotional performance that sent chills through me. However, he just didn't have much to do, other than deliver funeral speeches and motivational speeches, ad infinitum, for two hours and twenty minutes. And I'm not exaggerating.Now, the one thing this movie did very well was being bleak, dark, and hopeless. This was a dark time in American history, and the movie shouldn't have been any different. This film did pay its respects to the time period by portraying history as realistically, and as brutally, as they could, and also by not making this film the sweeping action period piece it was advertised as being. Making this a bloody action movie would have cheapened the experience and made it less powerful, and on one hand I respect the direction that Gary Ross went with this film. On the other hand though, this movie was basically a two hour long compilation of Matthew McConaughey delivering speeches to groups of people repeatedly. And unfortunately, because of this, I was so incredibly bored by this film; and not because I don't like dialogue driven movies, but because this particular movie moved at a snails pace and tread almost zero ground, feeling more like a made for TV film than a major motion picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of Talk Plus Some Gratuitous Animal Abuse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are arguably some 80 million dog and cat owners in the United States, and probably twice as many people who consider themselves to be dog and cat lovers. So it's interesting that the main character of this movie is a man not likely to have ever won any humanitarian award for kindness toward animals. More about this later."Free State of Jones" purports, in its trailer, to be an inspiring story about ordinary people rising up to help defeat the forces of oppression. Something like 1989's "Glory" for example, which provided a good pace of action and drama. Not so the case with "Jones". While it begins with a Civil War battle sequence involving Mathew McConaughey's historical character, Newton Knight, after the first half-hour it grinds down from a charge to slow march. Much of the middle third has Knight giving speeches and inspirational pep-talks to his growing band of freed slaves and poor whites, interspersed by an occasional skirmish or two and flash-forwards to a criminal trial taking place in the same county in the 1940s.There is also gratuitous violence toward animals, particularly Man's Best Friend. One disturbing scene involves him stabbing a dog to death, albeit a tracker who was in the process of chewing his leg. Another involves him and his band of irregulars ambushing a group of slave-hunters and their bloodhounds, then grilling up the dogs for dinner.A third scene involves the Free Staters rather graphically carving up a roasted pig that is impaled, head to butt, on a spit.Granted, this was the Civil War and yes, the Rebs did have a fondness for sicking dogs on runaway slaves and civil rights activists, a practice that was carried on well into the 1960s. But there are certain conventions, heretofore observed in the film industry, such as not showing graphic violence being done to young children, or bringing agonizing death to dogs even if they're chewing off your leg.The net result of McConaughey's dispatching of the attacking dog with less than surgical precision left me not so endeared towards his character for the rest of the film. It also didn't help that he uses the "n"-word rather liberally despite his character being pro-emancipation."Jones" meanders on for roughly 2-1/4 hours. It could have had about 25 minutes cut from it.I don't recommend this film for anyone who gets easily impatient waiting around for something to happen, nor for anyone who is disturbed by graphic depictions of violence against animals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Suited for a Mini-Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Biopics are generally difficult to make. Making a cohesive story based on a life that spanned 84 years is borderline impossible, especially for someone with the legacy of Newton Knight. Free State of Jones fails to put together said story, and never succeeds to reach the gravitas that the source material seemed to exude.It's hard not to be a fan of the material Matthew McConaughey is pursuing these days. Although the 'McConaissance' is pretty much over, he's still a world class talent of an actor and is sure to give us another Oscar caliber performance soon enough. While this wasn't necessarily the film to do so, he's not at all the issue. I wasn't emotionally connected with many, if any, of the characters but McConaughey certainly adds plenty of credibility to the scenes he's in.I've liked quite a few of Gary Ross' films, but this won't go down as one for the positive end. Knight's story is a hefty one and it seems like Ross and his writers didn't have a grasp as to how they wanted to approach such a story. The film jumps around in time quite a bit and it never quite settles on the part of Knight's life that's most compelling. I liked the material I watched and the actor's portrayals, but it's hard to truly get invested in a story with choppy editing and a confusing direction.The film runs to just under 2 and a half hours long, but it felt like three. I couldn't help but think something like Free State of Jones is much better served as a mini-series. The more the film flashed forward in time, cut away in the middle of a big battle, or pushed characters away right when they started getting interesting, the more I began to dislike the film and Ross' direction.With formidable performances from McConaughey and up-and-comer Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Free State of Jones is far from the worst film of 2016. But it may very well be the most disappointing film I've seen this year. With juicy source material and plenty of talent on and off screen, there was a good chance for an academy award level picture here, but it wasn't meant to be.+McConaughey &amp; Gugu-Sloppy editing-Confusing direction-Didn't know what to focus on4.1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Go see it.Think about it.The timing of the release of this movie ought to be fortuitous, I fear it will be torpedoed - as I see a trend in so many mainstream media reviews. Like 300, like 13 Hours - I see there are concepts in this story that have to raise bile in the mouths of "Liberals" ... and I understand that Newton Knight and his company are the villains in the Family History of others - who are also my fellow Americans.I'm a Killgore, and one "L" or two, there are White Kilgore's, there are Black Kilgore's, and I don't mean to draw lines but intend to stretch out my arms ... because of our Revolution, because of Slavery, and our Civil War and Emancipation and Reconstruction - people who are connected whether they know it or not, whether some like it or not, we are connected and always will be. Another part of my genealogy is Hayes, as in Rutherford B. Hayes, 19th President of my country (look him up.) James Kilgore of the S.L.A. is part of the family too, we're the same generation - just VERY different, but I'm mindful we come from the same place.This film is a much needed reminder of WHY our Bill of Rights HAD to include the Second Amendment, and that WE need to keep it today and ALWAYS. The millions of Americans supporting Black Lives Matter and/or Senator Sanders for President ought to swoon over this movie - but will the truth that the Freedmen voted Republican cause heads to spin ?Put this film together with Spielberg's LINCOLN and Zwick's GLORY, and remember Juneteenth !</fullReview>
