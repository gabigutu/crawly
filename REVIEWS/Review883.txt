		<shortDescription>Wonderful mystery/romance from the master of suspense!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I wouldn't include 'Spellbound' in my top five favourite Alfred Hitchcock movies it's still wonderfully entertaining. Of course it had dated badly in some ways, but not enough to spoil a modern viewer's enjoyment. Psychoanalysis was still quite a cinematic novelty at the time, but this means that we have to put up with an awkward opening sequence, complete with "explanations" on the screen, and a few pretty hokey moments throughout, but hey, I can live with that, and the amateurish filmed skiing scene. These few flaws, quite a rarity for Hitchcock, are still small potatoes. The legendary Salvador Dali designed dream sequence allegedly used very little of the great surrealists outlandish ideas, but even so it's striking and memorable. I also really enjoyed the inventive score by Miklos Rozsa, which utilized the eerie sound of the theremin, later used in the science fiction classic 'The Day The Earth Stood Still', and The Beach Boys psychedelic pop masterpiece 'Good Vibrations'. Now the best thing about 'Spellbound' and what really makes it into a wonderfully entertaining mystery/romance is Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck. These two Golden Age superstars are both absolutely wonderful individually, but together they are magical, and one of THE great romantic couples in movie history. 'Spellbound' may not be Hitchcock's very best work, but I still highly recommended it. I can't see how anyone could not enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amnesia,Freud and Dali.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Could this one be the most underrated of all Hitchcock's American movies/What?only 7.6?And however,you've got plenty of movies for the price of one!Come on ,wake up,and give this triumph its due!1.It's a mystery movie:Peck suffers from amnesia,he may or may not be a criminal,only snatches of memory come back and he can't put them together.Some clues appear,the "lines" vision is the most famous.2.It's a movie full of suspense;great scenes:the letter which Bergman tries to hide,the news papers at the railway station.3.It's a chase movie:Bergman and Peck escape from the nursing home and search a shrink's colleague help.4.It's a dreamlike movie:not only for the Dali's -too often unfairly dismissed-dream.Actually, the whole story is wrapped in a supernatural,eerie atmosphere.5.It's a romantic story:the scenes outside the nursing home in country landscapes are wonderfully and lovingly filmed.6.It's a movie of redemption:Bergman falls in love with her patient,and she's got to struggle -thanks Mister Freud- to help Peck to recover hisfull memory.7.It's a technically astounding movie,as in every Hitch movie:it features the shortest color scene (it's a black and white movie)in cinema.And I won't tell you when it appears,watch out.8.It's a movie from the Master of suspense,and I trade you "a lapse of memory","shattered" and "the third day " for "Spellbound"!It deserves to be in the top 250!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fine, Distinctive Film Despite Its Implausible Aspects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Spellbound" is one of Hitchcock's hardest films to evaluate, because its plot and credibility are so heavily dependent on theories of psychoanalysis that are usually considered to be implausible, at the very best. But if you can accept, for the sake of entertainment, the more dubious plot devices, what remains is a fine film dominated by the great director's usual creativity and technical mastery. Although it's hard to get away from the implausibilities, it's a fine movie in all other respects.Gregory Peck stars as an amnesia case, and Ingrid Bergman as a psychoanalyst trying to unravel his mysterious - and possibly murderous - past. Most of the other characters are also psychoanalysts or patients, and the plot revolves around the ways that Bergman's character uses Freudian theories to solve the mystery. Whether you can enjoy the story depends on how willing you are to suspend disbelief concerning the wilder aspects of these theories, but if you are willing to do so, it's quite nicely done in most parts, with some fine scenes and a couple of good plot twists. It is also worth watching for the famous Salvador Dali dream sequence, which is very creatively done and fascinating to watch. Peck and Bergman also create interesting and sympathetic characters, who make the viewer want to know what will happen to them.Overall, this is a distinctive film, and well worth seeing for any Hitchcock fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific! Powerful mystery leads to romance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock weaves his spell binding magic into this Francis Beeding novel. In some opinions, this is Hitchcock's best project from the 40's. Powerful stars and a great story line keeps your interest until the final shot.An amnesia patient(Gregory Peck)is believed to be a psychotic killer. Bits and pieces of his memory about a childhood accident makes him believe that he is a murderer. Ingrid Bergman plays a young psychiatrist, who helps Peck unravel his past and regain his memory and mental health. During this process, the lovely doctor tries not to fall in love with her needy patient. She takes him to her old professor(Michael Chekhov) for help. He is reluctant to get involved with solving the mystery to clear the patient's name.Brilliant camera work and being filmed in black &amp; white really helped the story line. There is an eye opening dream sequence designed by Salvador Dali that is down right mystic.The strong and talented cast also includes: Regis Toomey, Leo G. Carroll and Rhonda Fleming. This film is worth the time to watch again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually stylish but hopelessly silly oddity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw this film on the large screen after having not seen it for over 10 years. My memories of it were not that fond -- I recalled it as an unusually melodramatic and not very convincing thriller enlivened by a very attractive cast.What I had forgotten about was how almost impossibly silly all the psychoanalytical claptrap is, especially in the first couple of reels, which thereby make us feel very quickly that we're not quite in the mature, masterful grip of Hitch's usual wit and taste. Yes, I know this was made in the 40's, but the first 20 to 30 minutes of the film have more sexist moments and infantile behavior by supposed doctors than one would ever expect from either Hitch or Ben Hecht.So who's to blame? One guess -- David O. Selznick! That being said (along with the fact that the story doesn't really add up to much of anything, since all the premises on which it's based seem so shaky, naive and downright goofy), the film has some things going for it. About midway through the picture, when Michael Chekhov appears as Dr. Brulov, the film suddenly kicks into what we might call "classic British Hitch mode," with the kind of understated wit and ensemble playing the director had been doing so well since the early 30's. It almost becomes another (and far more palatable) film at this point. The scenes with Bergman, Peck and Chekhov are the highlight of the film, and I have to admit that I'm even kind of fond of the hotel lobby scene, with the appealingly breezy Bill Goodwin (of "Burns and Allen" radio fame) as the house detective. Peck has never been more handsome, in a strangely fragile way.Also worth a look are the brief but truly unusual Dali-designed dream sequences. There is something to be said for Miklos Rozsa's score as well: although it edges a bit far into soupy overscoring, the expressive main theme has quality, and his use of the theremin (which he also employed in his score for THE LOST WEEKEND at virtually the same time) is striking and represented "something new" in film music.One could easily make excuses for this film based on "it was only 1945" or "what people knew about psychoanalysis was still naive", etc., but even taken in context of its time it's a pretty silly film without the kind of sustained surety of style leavened with simultaneous suspense, intelligence, taste and humor that he had already proved he could do so well from more than ten years earlier. Given a standard he had already given us with examples from THE 39 STEPS or YOUNG AND INNOCENT through THE LADY VANISHES in the UK, or FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT and SHADOW OF A DOUBT here in the US, this film seems not up to his true capacities, and like his other Selznick-produced American film, REBECCA, seems both overfussy and filled with emphases and spoonfeeding of details which Hitch himself would never have given us.You need only compare this film with his very next one, NOTORIOUS, to be painfully aware how much better Hitchcock on his own -- using his own standards of pace, momentum and the ADULT treatment of script themes -- could be when not under the thumb of Selznick. Thank God he didn't have to work for him any more after this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Freudian fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A world in which Freudian psycho-analysis works as it's supposed to is rather like a world in which magic works - so call this film a fantasy. There's nothing whatever wrong with fantasy. Indeed, there's nothing better. Hitchcock announces at the very beginning that the story takes place in a Freudian world; thereafter he plays perfectly fair with us.He even chose the right collaborators for a fantasy. The dream sequences were designed by Salvador Dali. (Anyone whose dreams really do look like Dali paintings maybe COULD do with some psycho-analysis.) They're not frightening - dream sequences rarely are - but they are at any rate more interesting than the usual dreams we might have or hear about. The music was by Miklós Rózsa, maybe the best of the composers who settled in Hollywood, certainly the most vividly overpowering. He was exactly the right choice for this film - however much Hitchcock disliked the score, or said that he did.The story follows a confused Gregory Peck, who cannot remember key episodes of his recent (and not so recent) past, and who may, just possibly, be a dangerous criminal. Ingrid Bergman is a second-generation disciple of Freud who despite her professional caution finds herself falling in love with him. Perhaps it sounds cardboard already, but the performances invest the characters with more life than my descriptions did. Peck in particular is highly sympathetic. He comes across as not at all mad, not even mentally disturbed - just a man who can't remember one or two things and has an odd aversion to things like parallel lines. (That?s right - parallel lines.) Anyway, as I said, it's a fantasy: the forces of psychoanalysis must unravel the mystery before it's too late. (Why there's a "too late" is too complicated to go into.) The usual kind of Hitchcock suspense isn't there but the man WAS capable of moving outside his home genre now and then. Remember, his other fantasy was "The Birds".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Implausible, but great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies, despite what I must reluctantly admit is a preposterous plot. But what a great cast -- Gregory Peck, the beautiful Ingrid Bergman, and various familiar character actors. Wallace Ford has an entertaining scene as an obnoxious hotel guest trying to pick up Ingrid Bergman, but who gets chased off twice by the house detective. Even though the plot elements are often unbelievable, it doesn't matter, as far as I'm concerned; the pacing is just right, the script is literate, and the dramatic tension sustains the viewer's interest to the end.And for my money, this movie contains one of the most, if not THE most, romantic scenes ever put on film: Gregory Peck and Ingrid Bergman, having met only a day or two before, admit to each other that they've fallen in love. He walks slowly toward her and she lifts her face to him and closes her eyes. The scene dissolves to a series of lovely doors opening slowly down a hall, to the accompaniment of Miklos Rosza's incomparably beautiful "Spellbound Theme". Now THAT'S romantic! I highly recommend "Spellbound" to any classic movie fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If Hitchcock dealt with psychological themes in 'Shadow of a Doubt' and 'Suspicion', with 'Spellbound' he was facing the affairs of the mind? Most of his film took place in a mental asylum, where the Swedish star was the best-looking doctor you have ever seen? Cool, seductive, and attractive in front of Hitchcock's eyes?When Gregory Peck arrived as the new head doctor, she fell in love with him; but soon his staring eyes, his long pauses and the heavy shadows surrounding him led her, like us, to suspect that he was not 'Dr. Anthony Edwards' at all, but was really a mental case himself who had assumed the identity of the doctor? In that case, what had happened to the real doctor?Gregory Peck could not say, because he was suffering from amnesia and could not remember his past? While we begin to wonder, he became convinced that he was a murderer and took fight, sought by the police? Convinced of his innocence ? but needing to persuade her patient to prove it ? Ingrid Bergman caught up with Peck and took him for shelter to a psychoanalyst who tried to solve the truth in his dreams?'Spellbound' is a harmless and suspenseful piece of cinema? Hitchcock touches were splendid, and the stars shined magically? The psychiatric window-dressing was impressive, and surrealist artist Salvador Dali was hired to paint the dream sequences... This was not, incidentally, Salvador Dali's introduction to the cinema: in 1929 he had collaborated in writing 'Un Chien Andalou' with the man whose cinematic imagination has always flowered in the gardens of the unconscious mind: Luis Bu?uel.Rhonda Fleming made her film debut here, and Norman Lloyd, last seen as he fell from the Statue of Liberty in 'Saboteur', made a brief appearance as a patient?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ease of the analysis is hard to swallow but the tension is well maintained</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The head of the famous Green Manors mental asylum is being replaced by a younger psychiatrist, Dr Edwards. When Edwards arrives he falls for Dr Petersen and she for him. However, after exhibiting some very strange reactions, Edwards is exposed as a fraud - an amnesiac who has deep issues and may or may not have killed the real Edwards prior to taking up his job. Blinded by her love for him, Petersen flees the police with him and protects him as she tries to uncover the truth locked deep within his mind.As someone who watches way too many films for my own good I probably should have seen Spellbound many years ago. Making up for lost time I watched it recently unsure of even the basic plot. I was surprised by the twist (which I guess for 99% of those watching this, won't be a twist) that Edwards was not who he claimed (thought) to be. The psychoanalysis against the clock scenario was a bit too tidy, but it does work well. I'm not a big believer of this world of therapy so some of the scenes stuck in my throat but it was proof of Hitchcock's ability that he managed to make them tense.The example that came to my mind was the film Blackjack by John Woo in which Dolph Lungren is scared of the colour white! In that movie I was almost in fits of laughter when Lungren is stopped in his tracks by the bad guys spilling lots of milk everywhere! Here there was no such reaction to Edwards' similar fear. The director really manages to bring out tension and paranoia in every scene ? there was nary a moment where I wasn't involved in the film, it was hard to know whether Edwards was a killer, a nut or what! Some of the imagry is a little obvious (doors opening) but most is good and the Dali dream sequences are pretty cool.Of course part of this is down to Peck playing just perfect. Some of his bug eyed reactions to lines etc would have been comical had he not been able to follow through, but he did. It is to his credit that I was kept guessing as to his intentions right through the film. Bergman is also good but has to carry lines such as `I believe him because I could never feel this way for a man with badness in him' (I'm paraphrasing), the romantic side of the film is harder to carry but she does it well. Support is good, but Leo G Carroll looks very young indeed and took me by surprise when I saw him!Overall I enjoyed this film even though there was so much that could have been a mess. It is to Hitchcock's credit that he cranks the tension up well and never lets it get silly (as it could easily have been in lesser hands). Some of it is a little too easy (isn't this deep seated stuff meant to take years rather than days?) but this aside it moves swiftly along and is a very interesting way to make a thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dream Sequence Makes This Movie Worthy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Green Manors mental institution, Dr. Constance Petersen (Ingrid Bergman) is initiating her career of psychoanalyst and is considered a cold woman that has no time for love by her colleagues. When the head of the hospital Dr. Murchison (Leo G. Carroll) is forced to retire by the board after a breakdown, his replacement is the successful Dr. Anthony Edwardes (Gregory Peck) that is so young that surprises the other doctors in his arrival. Constance and Edwardes immediately fall in love for each other, but in a couple of days later it is disclosed that the man that supposes to be Dr. Edwardes in indeed an impostor that seems to be a paranoid amnesiac with guilty complex that might have killed the famous psychoanalyst. He goes away from Green Manors to the Empire State Hotel in New York and leaves a message to Dr. Constance that decides to find him. She sneaks and travels to New York, where she meets him lodged with the identity of John Brown. Dr. Constance decides to heal him recovering his memory and discover the fate of the true Dr. Anthony Edwardes."Spellbound" is far from being among my favorite Hitchcock's movies, but there is at least one unforgettable moment in this suspenseful but dull romance: the sequence of John Ballantine's dream based on designs of Salvador Dali. Ingrid Bergman performs a psychoanalyst vulnerable in many moments and with unacceptable attitudes, like for example, prioritizing to open her correspondence that giving attention to her mentally ill patient Mr. Garmes or her juvenile rapture with Gregory Peck's character. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Spellbound ? Quando Fala o Coraç?o" ("Spellbound ? When the Heart Speaks")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good night and sweet dreams...which we'll analyse at breakfast.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps the best of Alfred Hitchcock's collaborations with producer David O. Selznick, "Spellbound" stars Ingrid Bergman as Dr. Constance Petersen, a compassionate but sexually guarded psychotherapist who falls for Dr Edwardes (Gregory Peck), a new doctor who arrives at Green Manors, the mental asylum at which she works.With a creepy, near-supernatural score by Miklos Rozsa, the film oscillates between melodrama and horror. These horrors are largely psychological, but Hitchcock's direction, and Rozsa's score, lend the film a near-paranormal edge. Like "Vertigo", "Spellbound" at times feels like a ghost story or perhaps even a story about ghostly possessions. The issue of "possession" itself becomes the bedrock of Hitchcock's plot. Peck's character is an impostor who has taken possession of Dr Edwardes' persona. From here on, the film becomes another of Hitchcock's Kafkaesque "wrong man" rides. The real Dr Edwardes has turned up dead and law enforcement officials believe Peck to be the murderer. Peck, now revealed to be amnesic, thus goes on the run. He is supported by Constance, who attempts to prove his innocence. With the help of another famous psychoanalyst, she delves into Peck's unconscious and comes out with some semblance of truth. It turns out, she discovers, that Peck has been repressing a very specific childhood trauma: as a kid, he accidentally killed his brother. The film ends with another revelation: the true murderer of Dr Edwardes was an ageing psychoanalyst who himself feared being dispossessed by a younger man.While Peck's an overly stiff actor, Bergman is as magnificent as ever, affording her character a range of subtle facial gestures, and a pleasant mix of intelligence, yearning and vulnerability. Hitchcock, meanwhile, hated hiring Peck, but Selznick kept saddling the director with him; Selznick thought the actor's good looks would bring in big money.The film sports a now famous "dream sequence". It was designed by Salvador Dali, the famous surrealist, but directed by William Cameron Menzies, a man who's been unfairly forgotten by history. The first person to be given the film credits of "art director" and "production designer", Menzies is today most well known for directing the surrealist/expressionist "Invaders From Mars". He was also responsible for a number of pioneering, early special effects, and as art director was responsible for the overall "look" of a number of famous films, most notably "Gone With the Wind", which he storyboarded, colour co-ordinated and co directed. "Spellbound's" dream sequence was originally about 20 minutes long, but was highly censored by Selznick. It contains the animated shadow of a gigantic bird; Hitchcock was himself, reportedly, ornithophobic.Like most of Hitchcock's films, our female hero is treated with much condescension by men. One great scene at a train station finds Constance turning this to her advantage; feigning naivety and playing to a detective's inflated ego, she weasels her way into a hotel room. The rest of the film both mocks and pays tribute to psychoanalysis. One eccentric character's playfully modelled on Freud, for example, the film's psychoanalytical jargon is comically overwrought, and Hitchcock manages to both turn his villain into a psychoanalyst whilst also respectfully turning psychoanalysis into that which solves the film's central crime. Elsewhere the film mistakes psychoanalysis for kitschy "dream reading". In Hitchcock's hands, psychoanalysts are nothing but art critics who decode or ascribe meaning to various warped visions.In Jean-Luc Godard's mammoth "Histoire(s) du cinema", there's a passage in which he pauses to muse about Hitchcock. Hitch, Godard essentially says, is less about content than "decor"; bits of scenery, camera work, clothing, props and moments. You see that with "Spellbound". What you remember are various fragments: powerful point-of-view shots, a subjective shot of a character drinking milk, snow-capped streets, and a shockingly frank scene in which a child is impaled on a fence.Upon release, "Spellbound" was embraced by critics and audiences. Today it's typically viewed as being second tier Hitchcock. It's ultimately a potboiler, tarnished by silly Freudian symbolism, but elevated by exquisite direction and some strong moments of comedy and horror.7.9/10 ? Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Psychiatry isn't as simple as Spellbound would have you believe, the reasons for one's neuroses sure can't get cured with two or three sessions with Ingrid Bergman. But certain events can definitely be explained and it all seems quite reasonable when the explanations come from Alfred Hitchcock.Spellbound gave both Gregory Peck and Ingrid Bergman their first Hitchcock films and their only film together. Peck arrives at a sanitarium to take the place of director Leo G. Carroll. But after a short time, the other psychiatrists realize that he's not all he seems.In fact he's not a psychiatrist at all, but in fact a mental patient who has stolen the doctor's identity. The doctor has disappeared and in all likelihood been murdered. Peck flees the sanitarium, but Ingrid doesn't believe he's guilty of anything and she pursues and finds him and together they try to unravel what's locked up in his mind.Back when I was in college I took an introductory psychology course to fill up my electives and Spellbound got to mean something to me then. I had a professor who I wasn't quite sure didn't belong in an asylum run by Leo G. Carroll. It was a running joke in the class that we were all in the midst of a Spellbound like drama that this man had killed the real professor and that at any time the men with the nets were going to drag our teacher away.Episodes in Peck's life from childhood and the war and the trauma of seeing what happened to the real doctor have made him an amnesia case out of Peck. It's up to Ingrid to unravel it all by trying to interpret some recurring dreams.The dream sequences involve some sets courtesy of Salvador Dali and it's the main reason that Spellbound is remembered today as opposed to being just another of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpieces. For fans of the great painter this film is a must.Spellbound got a whole slew of nominations including Best Picture, Best Director and several more in technical categories. Spellbound and Alfred Hitchcock came up short against The Lost Weekend and Billy Wilder. Michael Chekov got a Best Supporting Actor nomination but lost to James Dunn for A Tree Grows In Brooklyn. Chekov plays Ingrid Bergman's mentor and he's right out of central casting as a Viennese Freudian psychiatrist.Spellbound took home one award for Miklos Rosza's score and it will linger with you a long time after you've seen Spellbound.Rhonda Fleming got her first critical notice as a homicidal mental patient, it's a brief but telling role. John Emery who is probably best known for being Tallulah Bankhead's husband plays a wolfish analyst on the make for Ingrid Bergman and plays it well.When Bergman finally unravels it all, her final confrontation scene with the villain is one of Hitchcock's masterpieces. Talk about coolness under fire.Though simplistic in its treatment of psychiatry, Spellbound will leave you just that when you see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Credit Ingrid With The Save</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's much that's wrong with "Spellbound," but it has a way of keeping you watching.Dr. Constance Petersen (Ingrid Bergman) is a resident analyst at Green Manors, a psychiatric institution in Vermont. She's a thorough professional, though seen as too cool by patients and peers alike. Her poise is shattered when she meets her new boss (Gregory Peck), who goes by the name of Dr. Edwardes. At once both suspicious and swept off her feet by this handsome stranger, Constance soon finds herself deep in a mystery that puts both her life and sanity at risk.Bergman's performance is easily the best thing in the film. She's at the peak of her acclaimed radiance yet quite human, too, alternately projecting aloofness, compassion, and sheer terror. This is one of Hitch's "women's pictures," and one of his better ones, presenting us with a main character both strikingly independent and far from being in charge of her situation.Hitch and scripter Ben Hecht have some perverse fun with the romance between Constance and Edwardes, and Bergman is terrific playing along. Her big romantic scene with Peck ends with her saying but a single word, and what a word: "Liverwurst." Bergman almost glows as she sighs the line, which is what sells it as both comic and endearing. Here and throughout the film, Bergman is just so much fun to watch.A big problem for me is that she shares too many great moments with Gregory Peck, here at his most stiff and insufferable. Much of this is the product of a flawed script that requires him to drift off into a trance-like state any time there's a flash of white on-screen. Still, Peck's struggle to sell this makes for hard viewing. If you want an actor playing a shrink to render believable a line like: "We'll look at some sane trees, normal grass, and clouds without complexes," you need someone who had less starch in his collar than Peck had.Much of "Spellbound" feels a bit too on the nose as the story develops. The famous dream sequence designed by Salvador Dalí is interesting but entirely too literal in communicating plot points. The patients at Green Manors we briefly meet all speak out their phobias for instant analysis. ("I hate men. I loathe them.") There are drawn-out exposition scenes; a rather superfluous voice-over bit that almost spoils an otherwise fantastic ending; and more of an obvious focus on symbolism from Hitch even without Dalí, such as a couple's first kiss being accompanied with an over-the-top image of multiple doors flying open.Constance's diagnosis of "Edwardes" problem feels pat even by doctrinaire Freudian terms, and the final cure, when it comes, is laughably simplistic. Did anyone really ever think amnesia was merely "a trick of the mind for staying sane"?At some level, though, you can't attack "Spellbound" for being dime- store Freud because the hooey sort of works in the context of the movie. Even if you agree with Rhonda Fleming's Mary character that "this whole thing is ridiculous," you have to allow for psychiatry's magic efficacy in this film the same way you allow for Jedi mind tricks in "Star Wars." Doing so has its payoff at the end, when another overly literal dream analysis session turns into a killer's standoff, precisely because of that silly Freud stuff.Hitchcock is masterful in his compositions here, and delivers a wonderful series of set-pieces. Bergman's great performance is wonderfully supported by Leo G. Carroll, Michael Chekhov, and John Emery as my favorite character in the movie, Constance's dogged but unsuccessful suitor Dr. Fleurot, who memorably dubs her "Miss Frozen Puss." Humor and suspense are kept in fresh supply, which helps a bit in swallowing the various, badly delivered Peck lines ("Will you love me just as much when I'm normal?" "If there's anything I hate, it's a smug woman!")Most of all, it gives us a memorable central performance from Bergman, who makes us believe in what she's doing by the power of her character's dangerous commitment. "I couldn't feel this way toward a man who is bad." Ultimately, you may disagree with Constance, but as played by Bergman you care enough about her to stick around to the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my favourite Hitchcock movies, ever since I first saw it in my youth. The dream scene is fascinating, the solve-by-shrink setting highly original, and all actors do well, not only the good ones like Leo Carroll but also the unknown ones like Michael Chekhov (I had to copy and paste this) and the limited ones like Gregory Peck. Ingrid Bergman is more radiant than ever; in spectacles she's simply irresistible. I'm not blind to the flaws though. The plot, for one, is full of loose ends. A depressed psychiatrist shooting with a revolver, from behind a tree, a downhill skier in such a way that the victim falls into an abyss, come on! Some ski run and some marksman! As for skiing, the protagonists clumsily crouching in front of a screen, seconds before the very climax of the movie, is simply hilarious. Call me old-fashioned, but I think a work of art should show craftsmanship, and Hitchcock should not be allowed to get away with this. True, it's a long time ago, but so are 'Bicycle Thieves' and 'The Third Man'!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish, fun, glowing Bergman, split Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One often non-admitted aspect of Hitchcock's directing is that it could be very mainstream when it wanted to be. Even the second The Man Who Knew Too Much had a mainstream feel quite different from Lifeboat or 39 Steps, or the first version itself. Hitchcock's films were usually, in the end, story-telling over style or cinema, but he swayed from the psychical to the mundane within any film, and certainly across films.In the context of that analysis Spellbound has a dual personality. Some might argue this springs from Selznick crossed with Hitchcock. I would argue that it is more a cross of The Farmer's Wife with Psycho; that is, it exposes Hitchcock's love of the extended conceit (however unbelievable in a practical sense) with an exploration of the human mind in unusual contexts, always with an emphasis on how the main characters make decisions and do or do not abide by those choices--usually an emphatic, even driving "do abide." Notice that Bergman's character is named, in fact, Constance, possibly just a Germanic hint, as Bergman was often cast as German, or possibly a play on "constant" or loyal.This take on the film apologizes a little for Bergman's era-based woman-in-love performance by regarding it as a display of determination to see through her choices to the end. A wonderful, and antithetically feminist scene where Bergman is bothered by two men and ends up using one of them for information legitimizes this interpretation...this brilliant scientist is taken for being a pretty schoolteacher, and instead of being offended, plays it toward her cause to follow through on her choice.Honestly, I have a harder time with Peck here. He is at his most beautiful, in the sense of "a beautiful, messed up man," but I can't read his inner struggles, and between him and Hitchcock all I get are mug shots with deep gazes, no breathlessness, panic, or fighting with an angel (even though the last doesn't go unmentioned). Perhaps I am foolishly responding poorly to a more fragile, even feminine Peck, but Mr. Chekhov as the father figure really outshines Peck so much that there are moments where one might slip into thinking, "Constance, look elsewhere."As for the Freudian aspects of the film a lot of dialog goes into apologizing for how unrealistic they are. But then, is gun play ever realistic in a film? Is love? Are waistlines or biceps? Spellbound may "throw bullets" compared to real psychoanalysis, and it may not really be the top of the game for anyone involved (other than Chekhov), but it doesn't violate our trust of Hitchcock, and he didn't lose sight of those core Hitchcock questions we love to see the characters he brings to us struggling with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bergman and Peck in double identity movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spellbound is one of Hitchcock's classic love stories with a plot that revolves around the theme of psychoanalysis and mental illness. In fact, Ingrid Bergman is a professional analyst named Dr. Constance Petersen who works with men and women coping with psychological illness. She is known as a cold and academic woman who has limited interest in the affections of men. This changes completely when Gregory Peck, posing as a Dr. Edwardes, arrives on the scene and she is completely swept away. The topic of mental illness is not new to director, Alfred Hitchcock, who deals with it in other films such as Suspicion, Psycho, Shadow of a Doubt and Marnie. When Peck is uncovered as an impostor, he leaves the clinic and Dr. Petersen follows him. The two are madly in love and the scenes where they appear alone at the start of the film are accompanied by shrill violins and opening doors, designed to stir the hearts of a 1940's audience. There are no bedroom scenes as such but the passion here is far more evident than in any modern romance. Bergman and Peck are about 30 at the time of the movie and at the height of their appeal so their pairing on the screen was very smart casting. Leo G. Carroll is excellent in the role of Dr. Murchisson, the retiring head of the residence.The mystery is the identity of the male lead Greogory Peck and the identity of the murderer of the real Dr. Edwardes. When Bergman follows Peck to a hotel in upstate New York, she is determined to find out his real identity and later on, the murderer of the real Dr. Edwardes. Bergman and Peck go from hotel to train station to ski slope with visits with one of Bergman's professional colleagues, Dr. Brulo, played by Michael Chekhov. There is a dream sequence inspired by Slavador Dali. Hitchcock's imagination always lent added style to his movies. There are twists and turns as the lovestruck couple go from elation and joy to sudden reversals when Peck has his periodic breakdowns. It is a joy to watch these two giants of the screen when they are together. There are some awkwardly filmed scenes where the back projection does not work well, particularly on the ski hill, and the violin music is irritating. However, there is one pivotal scene at the end that is first rate. The scenes in the railway stations and hotel lobbies are well executed and entertaining. All in all, a great movie for those who like Bergman and Peck and one of Hitchcock's interesting forays into psychoanalysis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good- the music certainly is outstanding!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Spellbound for the first time this morning, and overall I was very impressed. While Spellbound is far from his best film, it is in general very well done, and I would definitely watch it again for a number of reasons. Hitchcock's direction is noteworthy, maybe not as tight as it usually is, but still noteworthy. The film is shot with breathtaking black and white cinematography, particularly the scene in the countryside, in fact the only scene where it didn't quite work was in the skiing scene, it looked rushed and a tad too amateurish. On a more positive note, the music score by Miklos Rosza was absolutely outstanding; it is without a doubt one of the best film scores I have ever heard, and in my opinion one of the more memorable scores in any Hitchcock film. From the beautiful sweeping title theme, to some truly haunting parts in especially the scene with the sleepwalking. The final solution is exceedingly clever and unpredictable, and the dream sequence by Salvador Dali while short was essential to the plot and very effective. Speaking of the plot, mixed with psychological nuances and a young doctor's struggles to help her patient/ lover and prove his innocence, has its usual twists and turns and is pretty suspenseful. I will admit some of it is implausible, and the script may just lack the sophistication of the scripts of Hitchcocks like Vertigo or Rebecca, but on the whole it was cleverly crafted. The performances are in general very good; Gregory Peck is disappointingly one-note, but as the beautiful but cold Constance Peterson Sweedish beauty Ingrid Bergman is a revelation. The standout supporting turns come from Michael Chekov as Alex and Leo G. Carroll as Murchison, both add a lot to the film and do very well, and Hitchcock himself makes a cameo. All in all, has its flaws, and is definitely not Hitchcock's best, but I do recommend it. And I do think that along with StageFright it is one of the more undervalued Hitchcock movies. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitchcock marshaled some strong forces for this dark exploration of the psyche, with A-list leads in Gregory Peck and Ingrid Bergman, plus crack writer Ben Hecht and perhaps most famously Surrealist artist Salvador Dali to create Peck's defining dream sequence. It's still Hitchcock's film though.And a very watchable one at that. It has its faults, with almost every scene carrying some expository message, none more so than when Bergman's psychiatric nurse pieces together not only how the real Dr Edwardes' was murdered but where and by whom, glaring plot-gaps, plus it just has too many words, but helped along by some typically stylish direction from the Master, with some memorable set-pieces along the way, it's still a reasonably gripping and exciting noir-esque movie.No matter that Peck and Bergman don't seem right for their parts, they play out the fantastic plot with conviction and almost have you think they mean it while U.N.C.L.E.'s Mr Waverley Leo G Carroll is excellent as the displaced hospital governor.As for those set-pieces, nothing outdoes Dali's memorable sequence containing many of his artistic talismen, such as soft constructions, masked figures and eerie landscapes, but Hitch gets in his tuppenceworth too with Bergman's doors-opening first kiss, another suspense-ful drink of milk (after "Suspicion") and the subjective finishing shot (literally) which must have blown away (again, literally) its original audience. However there are also many less showy, subtle touches with unusual camera angles and fluid camera movements sewn seamlessly into the whole.To make implausible material like this work takes no little skill and Hitchcock does a grand job in taking his audience along with him, leaving them if not exactly spellbound, then certainly entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Spellbinding Experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the first films in Hollywood to deal with the subject of psychoanalysis, Alfred Hitchcock's Spellbound is an expertly crafted psychological thriller that works equally well as a brain teaser for its viewers. It tells the story of a psychiatrist who protects the identity of an amnesia patient, disguised as the new head of a mental asylum, and covers her attempts to recover his memory.Cleverly directed by Alfred Hitchcock, the film is full of twists &amp; turns throughout its runtime and repeatedly plays a dream sequence that toys with viewers' mind like a strong puzzle asking to be solved. Cinematography is a stunning work of film-noir, editing keeps the tension alive from start to finish &amp; thanks to its terrific use of music, it manages to keep the viewers at the age of their seats for the majority of its runtime.And also worth mentioning are its brilliant performances from Gregory Peck, Michael Chekov &amp; the immensely beautiful Ingrid Bergman amongst whom Bergman impressed me the most for I was completely in awe of her. On an overall scale, Spellbound is a spellbinding tale by the master of suspense that never lets out the entertainment factor for its viewers &amp; keeps them invested in its story with a sense of self-generated curiosity. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie revolves around psychiatric theories about a man with amnesia that may or may not be linked to a murder, the psychiatric part is extremely clumsy and laughable at times. The thing that holds it all together is a young Ingrid Bergman looking absolutely delightful and fierce playing her role with a good amount of fire. When nothing else is happening, at least their is Ingrid.. meow! Ingrid plays the role of a murder suspect's therapist trying to uncover the truth about his involvement in the murder of another psychiatrist and clear his name before the cops get wise and track them down. This movie is very dated, but it's also very enjoyable if you watch it within the context of the limitations of the period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alfred Hitchcock casts a Minor Spell with Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stolid psychoanalyst Ingrid Bergman (as Constance Peterson) falls head over heels in love at first sight with handsome Gregory Peck (as Anthony Edwardes). Young Mr. Peck is the newly arriving young director at the Vermont insane asylum, where Ms. Bergman dispenses lay analysis. Soon, it becomes obvious that Peck is harboring a very dark secret - he is an amnesiac (John Ballantine) suspected of murdering the asylum's real director, and taking his place. Love-struck Bergman assumes the identity of Peck's wife, and endeavors to prove he is not guilty. Soon, Peck's fragile psyche will have you questioning not only Peck's innocence, but also Bergman's sanity? Alfred Hitchcock's obvious directorial touches make "Spellbound" a good watch. Surrealistic artist Salvador Dali contributes a psychotic dream sequence, and composer Miklós Rózsa's eerie theremin-enhanced soundtrack adds some suspense. Bergman and Peck look, and act, splendid for the master, basking in beautiful black-and-white photography from George Barnes. Michael Chekhov (as Alex Brulov) and Leo G. Carroll (as Murchison) are good supporting doctors. Pretty Rhonda Fleming (as Mary Carmichael) is a nymphomaniac who, sadly, isn't left alone with Peck. The film's "Achilles' heel" is its ludicrous psychobabble.******** Spellbound (10/31/45) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Ingrid Bergman Gregory Peck, Michael Chekhov, Leo G. Carroll</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Involving murder mystery.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once you accept the basic premise that psychoanalysis "works," you wind up with a pretty good, thoroughly Hitchcockian murder mystery. Not one of his comic thrillers like "The Man Who Knew Too Much," and not a gloomy "The Wrong Man" either. More like "Shadow of a Doubt" but less subtle and more theory dependent. Everything moves along normally at first, but then the character of the central figure turns out to have a secret and he falls apart.Instead of a detective like Sherlock Holmes tracking down clues -- the ash of a trichinopoly cigar or something -- there is a psychiatrist, Ingrid Bergman, unraveling the mystery of the new doctor, Gregory Peck, who takes over the management of the rather classy funny farm at which she works -- Green Manors. It doesn't take long to find out that Peck may be a doctor, but he's also an amnesic and a fake, and that he may be crazy as a bedbug and a murderer to boot.With the help of her elderly friend and mentor, Dr. Brulov (Michael Chekhov), Bergman sets about unraveling the enigma of Peck's true identity by using the traditional tools of psychoanalysis -- the analysis of his phobias and dreams. The dream we see depicted on the screen is pretty good, too; it's designed by Salvador Dali and it looks it. I think Dali might have been a little crazy himself.Psychoanalysis, though, has been -- not "discredited." But maybe consigned to a particular historical period -- turn-of-the-century Europe. The propulsive force behind neurosis and anxiety was some forbidden sexual act (or impulse, even if stifled). My guess: That's not our chief problem today. We'd be better off with Adler than Freud -- "it's not about sex, it's about power." Be that as it may, given the premise, the story is still a bit confused. True that Peck is haunted by his accidental killing of his brother in childhood, but that's a canard because it has nothing to do with the murder story. But the plot has a strong climax. Just when everything seems neatly wrapped up, the conundrum solved, wrapped up in gift packaging and accompanied by a psychiatrist's monster bill, a slip of the villain's tongue reveals a great big new complication. Not a Freudian slip, just your ordinary parapraxis.Ingrid Berman is a beautiful woman, large boned and with generous features, but girlish in a coy way. Hitchcock was personally attracted to her for the rest of his life and never made mean remarks about her as he did with some of his other actresses -- Vera Miles, Eva Marie Saint. Gregory Peck is startlingly young and bony here, and although he handles it well, it's not a Gregory Peck part. He doesn't radiate sincerity. He has to play a character that is confused and weak. Weak not like his General Savage in "Twelve O'Clock High", but weak in a feminine fashion. He faints several times, drops tea cups, his eyes bulge with shock. The laughs are provided by Michael Chekhov, the bespectacled, brilliant Russian shrink who smokes a pipe and makes wisecracks about his patients, his friends, the police, women in general, everybody in general. I liked him the moment he was introduced -- entering a room, removing his fedora to reveal a reckless and upright cowlick of white hair that must have half-filled his hat. "You are amnesic. You don't know who you are. You don't know if you are comink or goink. But you DO know that Freud is 'hooey'! Hmmph -- wiseguy." In Peck's dream, he skis at a place called -- he can't quite remember the name -- Angel Valley? No -- GABRIEL VALLEY! I skied at a place called Heavenly Valley in California. I wonder if that's where the writer got the idea for the name. Well -- I define "skiing" most generously. I spent all my time gracefully gliding downhill backwards and filling in spill holes. Saw this as a child, as a matter of fact, in the Mayfair Theater. Scared the pants off me. Especially Miklos Rosza's fully blown, lush, romantic, symphonic, and thoroughly spooky score. Nobody had heard a theramin before. And then there's that bloody red BANG at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Hitchcock Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film you can watch over and over again and it will entertain you over and over. The great acting of Ingrid Bergman, (Dr. Constance) who is a psychologist and meets up with John Ballantine, (Gregory Peck) who has become a amnesia patient in the hospital and Dr. Constance tries to help him remember his past. John has been accused of murdering a physician on a skiing outing and is believed to have pushed him off a cliff. This story has many flashbacks and John Ballantine is helped by another Doctor Alexander, (Michael Chekhovi) who has great doubts about John being innocent of this crime because he is falling in love with Dr. Constance and he is afraid for her life. You will see John Ballantine, walking around in a bathroom with an open straight razor and coming into the bedroom of Constance. You will naturally see Alfred Hitchcock appearing in some scenes in this film, which is his trademark. This is truly a great film Classic. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding Miklos Rozsa score and cinematography....not one of Hitchcock's best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first exposure to this film was by the marvelous, Oscar-winning music score by Miklos Rozsa, which I have collected over the years in three different versions on CD (symphonic suite, piano concerto, and slow jazz band with piano version). For years I have wanted to see this film. Looks like I finally got my chance, thanks to the man-made structures we call public libraries.Thankfully, the film's complete score is now on the Criterion Collection DVD, preserving the original overture and exit music. But enough of my raving about the music score for now?the film is suspenseful in places and very well-acted (especially from Russian method actor Michael Chekhov in an Oscar-nominated supporting role as a friendly old psychiatrist), but the absorbing story is very silly and contrived in places. It's another one of those "innocent man on the run" scenarios which Hitchcock used so often in his films, using simplistic psychoanalysis?and a classic dream sequence designed by oddball artist Salivor Dali?as a way to solve the mysterious, unseen murder of the head of a mental institution this time. It's also one of Hitchcock's rare ventures into the "whodunit" style here.Now about the film's two stars: Gregory Peck gives an underplayed performance here as a mentally disturbed victim believed to be a psychopathic murderer, but he is very melodramatic and comical when he starts having panic attacks. Helping psychiatrist Ingrid Bergman is gorgeous here, especially in glasses and white lab coat, and gives her usual impeccable performance. They do look well together since they are such young, good-looking people.Now about my favorite parts of the film: the imaginative Oscar-nominated black-and-white cinematography by George Barnes and the outstanding, unforgettable Oscar-winning music score by Miklos Rozsa. Two of my favorite filmed moments include a strange tracking shot of a traumatic childhood flashback and a single point-of-view take near the end of the film which is technically astonishing...and only two frames of the shot are tinted in color for maximum effect (I won't give it away). As for the music score, it's beautifully lush and romantic for the most part, and it uses the thermion for maximum effect during the suspenseful moments and the dream sequence. The score for the film is especially effective as a piano concerto, otherwise known to concert music lovers as "The Spellbound Concerto." Worth watching, but for me it is the highly addictive music score that will remain in the memory. Hitchcock scored better hits in the 1940s with FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT (1940), SHADOW OF A DOUBT (1943), and NOTORIOUS (1946).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far one the best Hitchcock thrillers of the 40's along with Shadow Of A Doubt. Although I have read many complaints of Gregory Peck's performance, I think he did an outstanding job. The facial expressions of an amnesiac were classic. Ingrid Bergman also did a wonderful job as a psychiatrist. And Hitchcock's directing in this is near perfection. The skiing scene did have some awful backgrounds but as a whole, this is one of the few Hitchcock movies to absolutely frighten me. The quick shot of red (in a black and white movie) is definitely worth mentioning. As for the dream sequence, I don't see what was so fascinating about it but everything else is outstanding. I was spellbound (no pun intended) for 2 hours watching this movie. Also of interest to viewers, if you are going to buy this, pay the extra money and buy the Criterion edition, you will be rewarded greatly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Professor, you're suffering from mogo on the go-go".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a good many of Hitchcock's films I find that you have to accept some premises that stretch credibility for the story to work. For example, in "Shadow of a Doubt" the viewer is asked to believe that a strong athletic Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotton) is somehow outmaneuvered by his young niece (Theresa Wright) into a situation whereby he falls off a train trying to kill her. Or how about all the machinations Ray Milland goes through in "Dial M For Murder" to get his wife Grace Kelly's key to their apartment when he could have just gone out and had one made from his own.What you have in "Spellbound" is an amnesiac portrayed by Gregory Peck who doesn't know who he is, has tortuous thoughts of possibly killing someone, and subsequently assumes that man's identity to take the head position at a psychiatric institution. Now I don't really know how amnesia affects someone other than loss of memory, but how is it that John Ballantine (Peck) shows up at Green Manors to impersonate Dr. Edwardes in the first place? See what I mean? Getting beyond all that, I guess you could say that "Spellbound" eventually gets off the ground as a fairly intriguing story, particularly in the second half when Ballantine and Dr. Petersen (Ingrid Bergman) make their way to the home of Dr. Alex Brulov (Michael Chekhov) and he puts both characters through their paces. Chekhov is particularly direct with Dr. Petersen, finding fault with her personal involvement in a patient and willingness to overlook the inconsistencies in Ballantine's behavior - "We are speaking of a schizophrenic, and not a valentine".Where the story really held my interest was the build up to and eventual interpretation of the Dali dream sequence wherein Dr. Petersen finally confronts Dr. Murchison (Leo G. Carroll) about his involvement with the death of Edwardes. That's the kind of stuff that earned Hitchcock his nickname as the Master of Suspense. But did it strike anyone else as odd that Murchison hung around at Green Manors after he 'retired'? Or that most of the other doctors on the staff looked even older than he did? Just wondering.A couple of other interesting components of the film for me - I was really struck by the creative camera work used to view through the bottom of the milk glass when Brulov drugged Ballantine. And at the finale when Murchison realized the jig was up and offed himself, I wasn't quite sure I saw what I saw with that momentary flash of red and had to play it back to be sure. That was really very cool.But you know what was really incredible? It seems there was a time when you could take a train from New York City to Philadelphia for $3.39 (plus tax of course)! That, and the idea that a doctor and her amnesiac lover could travel around the country without a change of clothes!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite Good Early Psycho-Therapy Drama...And Dali Too!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPELLBOUND is one of Hitchcock's experiments that worked. If ROPE demonstrates some kind of technical experiment of minor interest that Hitch decided test out (nine minute filmed sequences without breaks), SPELLBOUND was an experiment regarding dreams and psycho-analysis used in solving a murder mystery.It wasn't the first to set part of the action in a mental institution. PRIVATE WORLDS had done so in the 1930s. And the supernatural film THE UNINVITED actually suggested something less than clean or healthy in the running of a mental institution. But both films did not go into a case history as closely. Due to the time limitations for a typical Hitchcock film (roughly two hours) the psycho-babble today does not impress people: it takes years of therapy to get some grasp on the emotional problems confronted by Gregory Peck here. But unless one wanted a series of films over a period of twenty years (say one a year) detailing the actual speed of real psychotherapy, you had to accept Hitch's consolidated fictional approach to counseling.The plot deals with Gregory Peck arriving at a rest home in upstate New York that is run by Leo G. Carroll. Carroll is overworked, and is expecting his replacement. Peck shows up claiming to be the replacement. On the staff of the home is Ingrid Bergman, John Emery, and Steven Geray, and Bergman notices the new doctor is certainly acting peculiarly at dinner (he is upset looking at parallel lines his fork makes in the dinner table cloth). Eventually the new doctor flees the asylum, and Bergman follows him. She is also aware that he has been unmasked as an impostor - he is not the missing new head of the asylum. Bergman links up with Peck, who is suffering whenever he tries to recall certain past events. She is trying to get him to work with her, but he resents her efforts (though when not concentrating on his past and mental state he and she are falling in love). She is also aware that she and Peck are being sought by the police regarding the disappearance of the actual new head of the asylum.Eventually she gets him up to the home of her mentor (Michael Chekhov) and they analyze a dream that Peck tells them of. Although part of the dream is sexual (Peck sees Bergman as a waitress in a gambling club), most of it deals with his relationship with the missing man. And it becomes more interesting as the dream is designed by artist Salvator Dali, complete with melted wheels, eyes staring from walls (and being cut open) and mysterious, threatening men, wearing bandages around their faces. Soon the dream is interpreted enough for it to lead Bergman and Peck to a skiing resort, where the dream seems to find the solution to Peck's angst. But he is also arrested - the missing man has turned up shot to death, and Peck is the chief suspect. Bergman believes he is innocent now, and we wonder if she will prove it in the last ten minutes of the film.Like all Hitchcock films, once one sees it the mystery is no longer a mystery. Years ago my sister, wanting to see something else while I was watching SPELLBOUND looked at the television screen and said "....... is the murderer!" I have never quite recovered from her spoiling the conclusion of the film for me.The performances are all good, including one by noted Russian actor and teacher Michael Chekhov. When I studied acting in high school I had to read his book TO THE ACTOR, and it is interesting to see he was a really fine actor. In fact, his performance as Bergman's wise old mentor was given the ultimate accolade when Mel Brooks highlighted it in his Hitchcock spoof HIGH ANXIETY, with Howard Morris playing Professor Olman ("Little Old Man" Brooks keeps calling him in the film). Morris even kept the little white beard that Chekhov wore on his face in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spellbound (1945) **** (out of 4) Alfred Hitchcock's classic (and underrated going by IMDb scores) thriller about a psychiatrist (Ingrid Bergman) who falls in love with another doctor (Gregory Peck) but then learns the man isn't really a doctor but suffers from amnesia and might have killed the man he was pretending to be. This was only my second time viewing this and the first time in God knows how many years but I really loved every single second of the film so there's no question I'll be watching it a lot more in upcoming years. I thought the film had a high level of suspense running from start to finish with the usual great style from Hitchcock. the brilliant music score also helps things wonderfully, especially during the highly intense ski scene. Both Bergman and Peck are terrific together and they really sell the story and make us care about the two characters. As great as those two our the film belongs to Michael Chekhov who adds great comic support. The love scene was also highly passionate and the dream sequence packs a nice punch as well. The crowd I watched this with seemed to be really involved like I was as there were all sorts of little "tense" noises as you could hear people gasping and holding their breathe.</fullReview>

I think he was a very good director but feel his reputation is greatly inflated. A far more successful director would be William Wyler--whose quality and consistency of work is unmatched in America. As examples of not so hot Hitchcock movies, I name this one and especially the Paradine Case (a wretchedly dull Gregory Peck "drama"), Marnie and Jamaica Inn (among others).Secondly, I need to point out that I have extensive training in individual and group psychotherapy and this ruins the movie for me BUT might not ruin it for the average viewer. Many of the theories espoused in the movie are complete psychological "mumbo jumbo" and the behavior of Ingrid Bergman (as Peck's therapist) would result in her having her license to practice stripped in all 50 states (and probably result in criminal prosecution).So what did I like? First, though brief, I like the dream sequence created by Salvador Dali for the film. It's weird and wacky but cool. I like to show it to my Psychology students for insight into both dream interpretation and the analytic approach to therapy (that is no longer in vogue). Second, I like the nutty character portrayed by Leo G. Carroll. He's only in the movie here and there, but he's malevolent and calculating.Unfortunately, despite their amazing talents, this movie does nothing to improve the reputations of Peck, Bergman or Hitchcock when viewed today. Ingrid Bergman plays a female therapist that hardly seems professional, but is instead a hyper-emotional and rather silly woman--hardly a shining example for women's rights. Peck plays a guy who spends most of the movie behaving "flaky"--and that's about about deep as his role is allowed to progress. Maybe at the time this was seen as slick stuff, but today it just seems silly and so full of holes and inconsistencies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock had the brilliant idea of using surrealist legend Salvador Dali to design the sequences of delusion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its directed by the genius Hitchcock n its one of his most underrated films. It was Hitchcocks darkest and most surreal movie so far. The dream episodes in Spellbound were designed by Salvador Dali. A brilliant idea to unite two great artists. The cast includes Michael Chekhov (Chekhovs students included Marilyn Monroe, Anthony Quinn, Clint Eastwood, Yul Brynner. Johnny Depp and Anthony Hopkins have cited Chekhovs book as highly influential on their acting). Leo G. Carroll (Rebecca, Suspicion, The Paradine Case, Strangers on a Train and North by Northwest). Rhonda Fleming (Out of the Past, Serpent of the Nile, Gunfight at the O.K. Corral). Regis Toomey (The Big Sleep, Evil Town). The story has many flashbacks, twists n turns. Unforgettable Oscar-winning music score by Miklos Rozsa. The romance angle became more enjoyable after not expecting so much of a thriller. Peck gives one of the most wooden performances of his career. Bergman gives a dynamic performance that diverts all attention and accolades in her direction. Also enjoyable is the wonderful Leo G. Carroll, an unheralded character actor. Cinematography by George Barnes. Editing by Hal C. Kern. Screenplay by Angus MacPhail n Ben Hecht.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thinking person's film; unique in a number of ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a number of reasons this is one of my favorite Hitchcock films.My review is based on the Blu Ray edition of the film, and let me begin by commenting about that. If you already have the DVD version, I don't think you're going to gain much by moving to the Blu Ray edition. Some have questioned whether Ingrid Bergman was an appropriate choice as a psychiatrist. I have no problems with her portrayal, in fact I rather enjoyed it. I also thought that she and Gregory Peck had great chemistry in this film...and of course, they did have a brief affair according to Peck after Bergman died.Gregory Peck is excellent here...as always. This was only Peck's fourth film, but he was already reaching the peak of his career with a number of strong performances around this time.Leo G. Carroll, one of Hitchcock's favorite supporting actors, is here, and I enjoyed his portrayal as the departing head of the psychiatric institution.Michael Chekhov is wonderful as the professor-mentor of Ingrid Bergman. It's a charming portrayal of an old-world psychiatrist.An interesting small part is played by Rhonda Fleming as a psychiatric patient who lusts over men but hates them.Of course, the highlight of the film is the dream sequence which was designed by Salvador Dali. Unfortunately in the final editing for release the almost 20 minute dream sequence was cut to about 2 minutes. Personally, my only real criticism about this film is that the balance between action suspense and dialog is decidedly on the side of dialog. However, it's good dialog. And, it's through memory flashes and dialog that Peck's character slowly begins to piece together the mystery in his life, It's really quite intriguing how Hitchcock very slowly and gradually leads the characters and the audience into discovering the truth. Incidentally, the musical score is excellent here, though rather repetitive. To me, at least, the ending was a surprise.I give this film an "8", albeit a weak "8". What puts it beyond a "7" for me is that the film is relatively unique, particularly for the mid-1940s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully Done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story follows a confused and frustrated Gregory Peck who cannot remember huge and important parts of his past, from recent to years ago, and who finds out with horror that he could be a very dangerous criminal. Ingrid Bergman is a psychologist who is very interested in him as a patient but despite her necessary professional caution finds herself falling in love with him, and she just can't help herself or keep away from him. The director is obviously wonderful but so is the acting in this movie. Peck in particular is highly sympathetic. He comes across as not crazy or even mentally disturbed but just like what he is, a man who can't remember a few things and who has other strange things going on with his psyche like a bizarre fear of parallel lines. Hopefully he can figure it out with Bergman's help before it is too late!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Inception" of the 40's ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are three good things about "Spellbound": a gorgeous young Gregory Peck, a memorable dream sequence and the kind of killer supporting performances that deprives the lead roles from their last bits of believability, whether Michael Chekov as the scene-stealing Dr. Tchekov or Leo G. Carrel as the enigmatic Doctor I-forgot-his-name. The rest is typical Hitchcock, which is not to diminish the film's merit but not saying much either.Like I said in the title, the film is like an "Inception" made in the 40's, using all Christopher Nolan's darlings: a mystery, a psychological thriller and naturally, a romance as the driving subplot. Wouldn't we, after all, expect a love at first sight, between two of the most attractive stars of the 40's: Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck? Bergman plays Dr. Constance Petersen, a cold and emotionless psychiatrist who works in Green Manors institute. This is how her character is set-up anyway, with her glasses and snobbish attitude, she stands on a symbolical pedestal, constantly -allow me the word- erected by her colleagues' seductive moves. Who'd blame them? she's the only female of the staff, and not the least.Granted Hitchcock is not the most subtle director when it comes to romance, it's still frustrating to see the distinguished Constance Petersen turn into an enamored teenager as soon as the institute's new Head makes his entrance, but who'd blame her either? It's Gregory Peck for cinematic Gods' sake! Peck as gorgeous as ever, and his beauty is so distracting (should I specify I'm a straight male) that you forgive all the little flaws on the characterization department, and gosh, there are some! Peck as Dr. Edwards strikes as too young a man, much more, there's something in his eyes obviously betraying a hidden trauma. His first dinner with the staff provides the first hints: all it takes for Petersen is to draw some lines with a fork on the tablecloth to hit a sensitive chord in Peck, who suddenly becomes more aggressive. The mystery picks up and Edwards turns into an intriguing subject for Constance ? it's up to us to wonder whether it's for professional psychoanalysis or something else tickling her body.Sinning again with obviousness, it doesn't take much time before the second incident occurs and reveals an unconcealed wound in Peck, a trauma that nourished a guilt complex with subsequent amnesia, something medically typical; take the word from the experts. Later, Constance discovers that the playboy is not the real Edwards, who mysteriously disappeared, and she can't (or doesn't want to) believe the impostor who claims to have murdered the doctor. Naturally, we don't believe it either, which lessens the intensity of the mystery, since when something is too obvious to the point of being claimed several times, we know the psychoanalysis is meant to clear the doubts, so Petersen finally allows herself to love her patient. "Spellbound" acknowledges its tribute to the virtues of psychoanalysis, the treatment of Freud's discipline is rather rudimentary, but it does provide an interesting touch of surrealism notably through the iconic dream sequence."Spellbound" is renowned for the dream part, designed by Salvador Dali himself. And those who saw "Un Chien Andalou" will immediately recognize a wink to the infamous eye-cutting moment of Bunuel's masterpiece. The sequence lasted more than twenty minutes but the original cut severely shortened it, only leaving the hints that could be associated with Edwards' murder. "Spellbound" makes a good effort conveying the fact that our deepest torments and fears are hidden in our dreams, I, myself, had three of the most bizarre dreams last night, including me baby-sitting myself as a baby, and I wonder how a psychiatrist would interpret it. Nevertheless, the dream is the film's highlight, even more because it's cleverly used by Hitchcock to deliver some of the keys of the mystery. As a surrealist thriller, "Spellbound" has a way of itself to grab our attention and can be strangely effective.Finally, there's the performance of Michael Chekov earning him a deserved Oscar-nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Chekov allows us to be more magnanimous toward Bergman and Peck, not that they weren't good, but this is not Bergman from "Gaslight" or Peck from "Gentlemen's Agreement", both are diluted in two-dimensional personalities, as professional doctors with facades that don't fool us. We're as sure of Peck's innocence than Bergman's capability of emotions, their performances are quite bland and lack this extra spice that could have been induced by the suspicion on Peck's guilt. This is why one of the few powerful moments of "Spellbound" still involves Chekov, when he gives a glass of milk to Edwards, letting us wondering what kind of reaction it will inspire to a man traumatized by whiteness and holding a razor.I guess I'm only severe with "Spellbound" because it had the right ingredients of a great psychological thriller but didn't make much of them. The mystery around Peck was interesting, but the real thrills came from the last confrontation between Bergman and Carrell in one of the most sumptuous Hitchcockian climaxes, proving that he's still the Master of Suspense through the fantastic shot of a pointing revolver on Bergman becoming a sitting duck from the gun's perspective, and the conclusion which pays a magnificent tribute to "The Great Train Robbbery", with probably the same shocking effect.Now, did we learn that much about psychiatry or Freud? I don't think so, but the film is fair in its approach of a science that was still new and revolutionary at that time. "Spellbound" is not the most spell-binding of all Hitchcock's films and the tag-line "will he kiss or kill me" seems to underestimate our intelligence. But it's fun to regard "Spellbound" as an ancestor of "Inception", with the same flaws in the romantic subplot, better looks from the male lead role, but definitely, a less impressive skiing scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A handsome new doctor arrives to take charge of a sanatorium and psychiatrist Ingrid Bergman finds herself becoming aware of the inconsistencies in his back story. Hitchcock received his third Oscar nomination as best director for this fascinating tale of a disturbed amnesiac. The basic story device - an amnesia patient is suspected of murder and seeking to find the truth - is a staple of the mystery genre, but Hitchcock takes the familiar and turns it into a classic of romantic mood, suspenseful escape and split-second timing. Much has been made of Dali's involvement to add surrealistic visuals to the dream sequences, but these are really just window dressing. It's a Hitchcock film. And a very good one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasant surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film Spellbound has a very distinctive Alfred Hitchcock touch. This can be recognized very early on when the camera focuses on the scratching of a hand from a patient. Hitchcock is known for his well thought out camera angles that add so much to the plot. He would draw out frames of a film before the day of shooting would even begin. This was done because all of the scenes have been perfected in Hitchcock's mind. After watching a documentary on David O. Selznick and Alfred Hitchcock I learned there was a debate over the Salvador Dali dream sequence being removed or remaining in Spellbound. After the conclusion of the film I was pleased that the sequence remained. While confusing at first, this abstract portrayal of the dream state neatly tied everything together. Needless to say, I was very pleased with this film. While my first choice for a movie would not be one from the 1940's, much less in black and white, I will expand my horizon from now on and explore other films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spellbinding:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Described by its creator as "just another manhunt story wrapped in a pseudo-psychoanalysis", "Spellbound" is spellbinding. One of the reasons I wanted to see it was, of course, the nightmare dream sequences designed by Salvador Dali but the movie offers so much more. Young and beautiful Ingrid Bergman plays the psychiatrist, Dr. Constance Petersen who fells in love with the new director of a mental institution she works for, Dr. Edwards (29 -years-old Gregory Peck in his early screen appearance was so handsome that I had difficulties following the plot twists watching him and Bergman on the screen together :)). Dr. Edwards soon turns to be an impostor, an amnesiac, and a suspect in the murder of a real Dr. Anthony Edwards. It is up to Dr. Peterson, the psychiatrist and the woman in love to discover the truth about 'J.B.', John Ballantine aka John Brown and his role in the Dr. Edwards' murder. Very dark, very moody, with Hitchcock's subtle touches of humor (provided by Michael Chekhov as Dr. Brulov), with dramatic and unsettling music score (Miklós Rózsa received Oscar for the Best Music), "Spellbound" is a classic and one of the Master's finest films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entrancing mystery involving romance, psychology, and Hitch, Peck, and Bergman!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Francis Beeding's novel, Spellbound is a film that, like other Alfred Hitchcock/David Selznik features, has dated after so many years, but holds an appeal to it that is undeniable due in large part to a balanced story/screenplay by Ben Hecht, the master's skills, and two A-list performances by Gregory Peck and Ingrid Bergman. Bergman plays Constance, a young psycho-analyst who at the start of the film doesn't put that much emotion into her job, which distances herself somewhat from her patients. Enter Dr. Anthony Edwards (funny name), played by a young Peck, whom we discover is not all that well, and may have a guilt complex about a murder that took place. As both Constance and Edwards (really J.B.) investigate, the audience gets taken on another murder mystery with consistent Hitchcockian intrigue, and with a good dosage of romance by the leads.There's much to reccomend in a film like this, first by the performances, which are magnetic despite dialog that occasionally veers to unbelievable territory (then again that's 1945 Hollywood for you), and by the feel of the film. Hitch makes great use of supporting characters like Dr. Murchison (Carroll) and Dr. Brulov (Chekob), Miklos Rozsa's music, and by a well-known dream sequence by surrealist legend Salvador Dali, who supplies some indelible images to Peck's description of a dream. While it was cut short from it's original length (would've been great to see ants, a quasi-tribute to Un Chien Andalou perhaps), it still remains one of his and Hitchcock's more memorable movie moments. Both entertaining and, here and there, thought provoking. Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat of an intro to hitch for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Hitchcock movie I've seen was Vertigo. I was amazed by it and started to look for his other works. I decided to buy either this or Notorious. Spellbound seemed to be right up my alley because of the Psychology angle. The promise of a Salvador Dali art-directed sequence sounded really cool too.I can't help but say I was disappointed the first time around. The characters had to explain every little detail about how psycho-analysis works. A little bit would have been interesting, but the writers went overkill. There wasn't as much suspense as I had hoped. The Salvador Dali sequence wasn't what I had hoped for. There seemed to be little about it that was dreamlike. I have to agree with another poster that the explanation of the wheel in the dream is the most cockamamie thing I've ever heard.The second time I saw Spellbound I had much more appreciation. The romance angle became more enjoyable after not expecting so much of a thriller. Ingrid Bergman is absolutely luminous. I really liked her character's mentor. I kept expecting him to say "Do. Or do not. There is no try." You just need to realize that pop-psych was a very new phenomenon. Nowadays we take ideas like Oedipus Complex for granted when we hear about them. Still, the movie has the tendency to sound like a big infomercial for psychoanalysts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hitchcock's best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are very few things that I love more than a great Alfred Hitchcock movie, and Spellbound surely ranks as one of his best. An engaging take on psychoanalysis (one of the first films to ever tackle the subject), the narrative follows Dr. Constance Petersen (Ingrid Bergman) as she tries to help uncover the truth of a man suffering from amnesia who is potentially responsible for murder (Gregory Peck). Like the best Hitchcock films, the premise is a simple one but it's his direction that makes it such an appealing journey. We follow Constance and the mysterious man, who goes by the proxy John Brown, as they try to solve the mystery of not only his amnesia but of the murder that he thinks he has committed.The film is endlessly watchable, thanks in part to Hitchcock's performance but also thanks to the superb chemistry between Bergman and Peck. Both actors work so well together, as lovers and as actors, creating a character dynamic that I could have continued watching for many more hours. They craft an immediately believable romance, but as their relationship deepens along their journey they never lose their spark. There wasn't a dull moment here. Bergman presented Petersen as a strong woman losing her focus out of love but always trying to remain in control of herself, while Peck was heartbreaking as the amnesiac who is convinced he has done something terrible but is tortured with the fact that he can't remember it. Michael Chekhov gained a well-deserved Oscar nomination for his supporting turn as Dr. Alexander Brulov, the psychiatrist who mentored Constance that the couple go to see for guidance when they're on the run.With a lovely charm, some great Hitchcock comedy, an interesting take on the complexities of psychoanalysis and plenty of suspenseful scenes, Spellbound is a real winner. There's also the magnificently memorable dream sequence, designed by none other than Salvador Dali, which is hypnotic and leaves a powerful impression. This is a relatively simple film when it comes down to it, but I love every moment of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Rather like embracing a text book"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinema works best as even-handed, non-egotistical collaboration. Total control by one individual can be hit-or-miss, depending on their proficiency. But what is almost always disastrous is the collision between two dominating personalities. Of the four features produced by David O. Selznick and directed by Alfred Hitchcock, Spellbound is probably the one in which suffers most from them treading on each other's toes.Selznick was a rare kind of producer, who rather than simply trying to come up with the most successful money-making formulas, also used his pictures as showcases for his own favourite themes. Spellbound was the result of a passing interest in psychoanalysis, and while Hitch was apparently not against the idea of doing a shrink flick, Selznick's influence places too much emphasis on it. It's also ridiculously laudatory, the foreword and opening scenes giving you the impression that psychoanalysis is as straightforward and effective as prescribing a dose of antibiotics.The structure of Spellbound is also not ideally suited to the Hitchcockian mode of suspense, which was based upon revealing the identity of the villain to the audience and then creating tension from making us wonder when and how they will strike again. Sometimes, as in Shadow of a Doubt or Rear Window, the killer would not be identified with certainty, but Hitch would immerse us in the suspicions of the central character, and this worked just as well. In some respects it looks as if Spellbound is an example of the latter. There appear to have been some attempts to create suspense out of the possibility that Gregory Peck's character is a murderer, and there are some typical Hitchcock moments like the business with the razor that play upon this. The trouble is, all those point-of-view shots placing us inside Peck's innocent confusion make it impossible for us to accept him as a killer, not even one who has forgotten his crimes. As such these tense moments, while nicely constructed in themselves, have no impact. The final "twist", when it arrives in the last five minutes seems tacked on, and does not shock or satisfy in any way.Spellbound is also an example of why we don't see many outstanding acting performances in Hitchcock movies. It's not just because Hitch didn't give any coaching to his cast members (neither did William Wyler, and his pictures are always superbly acted), it's just that his films are too technical to show off the actors to the best of their abilities. Ingrid Bergman was an exceptional actress, but because of the way Hitch works, the key moments in her performance are cut up into fleeting reaction shots, close-ups of hands and so forth. The best impression we get of her acting is in a fairly mundane scene, when she is fending off the unwanted attentions of Wallace Ford, a moment Hitchcock allows to play out in a mid-shot unbroken take. Spellbound does contain one of the few Oscar-nominated performances in a Hitchcock picture ? Michael Chekhov as Dr Brulov. He is not bad, although due to the nature of his part he gets the benefit of more conventional shots which capture his best ? hence why he got a nod while Ms Bergman didn't.The one Oscar that Spellbound did win was for the Miklos Rozsa score, although it's inferior to his work on The Lost Weekend, which was also nominated. His music for Spellbound is a little overbearing, and is incredibly heavy in the romantic scenes. It's also very sweepingly sentimental, which jars somewhat with Hitch's rather aggressive styling of these moments. Still, there is some intelligent orchestration, and it is rather effective the way it suddenly breaks into a minor key version of the love theme on the theremin when something triggers Peck's memories.In spite of all its flaws, Spellbound is still a very watchable picture. The screenplay is by the reliable Ben Hecht, and it moves forward at a solid pace. Hitchcock's to-the-point style of direction may not have been flattering to the cast, but at least it makes the story clear and easy to digest. However, this process of unravelling a mystery does not provide him with opportunities for suspense, or at least not his kind of suspense. Selznick got his "psycho", but this is a mediocre entry for the master.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effectively exciting thriller from Hitchcock.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock, working for the infamously fussy producer David O. Selznick, fashions an interesting and exciting thriller with this adaptation of the novel "The House of Dr. Edwardes". In one of the first films ever to deal with psychoanalysis, Hitchcock creates an air of solid mystery and suspense, cleverly disguising plot-holes and occasional wooden performances. The film's pace, and the enthralling performance of lead actress Ingrid Berman, go a long way in compensating for weaknesses in other departments.The head of a mental institution, Dr Murchison (Leo G. Carroll), resigns from his post, and a replacement doctor takes up the vacant position. Dr. Edwardes (Gregory Peck) is the new guy, but even though he seems outwardly very good at his job, he is prone to weird dizzy spells that no-one can quite explain. Fellow doctor Constance Peterson (Ingrid Bergman), a gifted and much-revered psychiatrist, slowly finds herself falling in love with Edwardes. But it doesn't take her long to realise that he is not who he claims to be?. in fact, her new lover is actually a mental patient who has assumed Dr Edwardes' identity. Worse still, he has no recollection of what has happened to the real Dr Edwardes. It seems possible that he might have killed him, and the shock of what he has done may have triggered some form of amnesia that prevents him from being able to remember the location of the murder, or even the details of how it was carried out. Constance is certain that her new lover could not possibly have committed something as foul as murder, so she hides him from the police and tries to help him recall the truth of what happened to Dr Edwardes. To this end, she begs her friend Dr Alex Brulov (Michael Chekhov) to analyse her lover's tormented dreams, hoping that he can somehow unlock the truth that is lost in his amnesiac mind.Peck is guilty of one of the most wooden performances of his career, and he really hinders this film. Thankfully, Bergman ? as already mentioned ? gives a dynamic performance that diverts all attention and accolades in her direction. Also enjoyable is the wonderful Leo G. Carroll, an unheralded character actor who always milks a character for all its worth. Hitchcock directs the film enthusiastically, showing his flair for innovation in a memorable dream sequence (designed by Salvador Dali) and a clever twist climax. The plot itself is melodramatic and improbable in the extreme, but one doesn't have time to dwell on the absurdities thanks to Hitchcock's lightning pacing. Miklos Rozsa rounds off the proceedings with a sweeping score that adds to the film's considerable atmosphere. Hitchcock purists might not rank this one in the very top tier of the director's work, but it is certainly a front runner in his second tier offerings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bound to disappoint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the Alfred Hitchcock legacy is discussed, Spellbound usually is mentioned prominently, partly, I suppose, because, like Vertigo, it fits in so nicely with the themes and imagery that we have come to understand as "Hitchcockian." But taken out of that context, it would seem that this is a film that has not aged well. Of all of his films, this one might properly be described as klutzy. The infamous Salvador Dali sequence, perhaps boldly imaginative at the time, now seems just plain hokey (though, if had been done in color, that might have helped considerably). Some of Hitch's camera tricks seem rather obvious as well. But I think the biggest problem is that much of the film has become cliched. The patient with the convenient amnesia, the woman who takes off her glasses and is suddenly beautiful and the doctor who falls madly in love with her patient are clearly plot contrivances. Worse is a plot that speculates that the interpretation of one dream can, not only sum up a mental patient's psychological problem, but cure him and also solve a murder, all in one fell swoop. Surely, even in 1945, this would have seemed to be a ridiculous, overly simplified view of psychoanalysis.As is, the film is lacking suspense and tritely melodramatic. Bergman is, as always, a pleasure, though she fails to convince that she is a psychoanalyist. Peck, as also apparent in The Paradine Case, lacks the charisma to be a Hitchcock leading man. And in the end, had someone other than Hitchcock directed the film, Spellbound would likely have been a largely forgotten oddity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Which match is worse: Bergman and Peck or Selznick and Hitchcock?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good-looking, but terminal, highly disappointing Alfred Hitchcock melodrama-cum-thriller involving a miscast Ingrid Bergman playing psychoanalyst to amnesiac Gregory Peck, who has been posing as a medical director. Naturally, this being a star-crossed lovers tale in disguise, Bergman falls in love with Peck, but we're never able to ascertain why (it plays like a convenient plot contrivance). The film takes at least 40 minutes to get going, and even then it's rather stuffy. Bergman has one fine sequence in the lobby of a New York hotel, but Peck's wide-eyed recollections and dramatic fainting spells become almost unintentionally funny. David O. Selznick leaves his mark on the production end, and the picture looks incredibly handsome, but the script is weak. The corny preamble could've been dropped entirely. Mikos Kozsa actually won an Oscar for his blaring background music. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quaint Hitchcock with some magical moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will remember "Spellbound" not for the story but for the use of cinematic tools to entertain the viewer. Hitchcock always had a yen for kissing scenes ("Notorious," "Torn Curtain," "Marnie", "Rear Window," etc.). Here instead of the close-up, he uses the camera to fade into a series of 7 doors opening as if the camera was rushing in through them to signify the adrenaline rush of the first kiss between the two lead characters. It was inventive for its time, though you could say the simile was overwrought.The second startling scene was the accidental fall of the child on the sharp iron barriers of the house was graphic but few remember it. I thought that was great cinema, to show the gory end without any blood!The third scene in the film was the attempted pick-up of the leading lady by a stranger in the hotel lobby captured by a static camera and the interruption by the hotel detective. This was Ben Hecht and Hitchcock at work providing another magical interlude.The fourth magical moment is the use of color to signify blood briefly after a gun shot in a black and white movie.The fifth magical moment was the envelop lying on the floor, seen by the leading lady but not others even as they step on it, except for one gentleman.Finally, there is the famous Dali painting sequence--which is remarkably close to Dali/Bunuel's work in "Un Chien Andalou." There is more of the typical Hitchcock in this film: wrong man chased by the police ("The 39 steps", "Saboteur," etc.) obsession with food and drinks (the meal scene where the leading lady draws an image with a fork, and the value of drinking milk at night eschewed by the foxy old psychiatrist). There is sexist humor too "Women make the best psycho-analysts until they fall in love, after which they become the best patients." This is true of men as well! The film is not the best of Hitchcock but his stamp is all over it. His master move was to cast Ingrid Bergman, who is simply a treat to watch and admire, in the lead role. Ms Bergman lifted up this movie. So also was the commendable casting of Michael Chekov as the old psycho-analyst. These factors negate the illogical emergency surgery conducted by a team of psycho-analysts and the awful staged ski sequences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Spellbound" has become one of my favorite Hitchcock movies. I think Gregory Peck is excellent in this movie as John Ballantine, the amnesiac who receives help from Dr. Constance Peterson (Ingrid Bergman). But John has more problems than amnesia. He cannot stand to see dark lines on a white background. For example, a blanket, a robe, and a tablecloth. But he remembers what had happened to him thanks to Constance and her former teacher, another psychologist named Dr. Brulov.There is also a wonderful performance by Leo G. Carroll, who plays Dr. Murchison. He has also been one of my favorite actors, and he's brilliant in this movie.So the bottom line is, you should really see this movie, and not just for Gregory Peck's handsome face, or Ingrid Bergman's beauty. I think it's one of Hitch's best suspense movies. By the way, Gregory Peck does look very, very handsome in this movie, so for those girls out there who still think you might not want to see it, it's worth it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Middle of the Road Hitchcock Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not every director has their A-game each and every time out. For the great Alfred Hitchcock, Spellbound is one of those times. With a plot that takes a while to become interesting and an unlikable performance from Gregory Peck, Spellbound is just a middle of the road installment for Hitchcock's filmography.Hitchock was at his prime in the 1950's, but he was no slacker in the 1940's either. With Rope, Notorious, Rebecca, Lifeboat, and Shadow of a Doubt, he continued to make great films year after year. Spellbound just wasn't one of them. The premise is classic Hitchcock. A psychiatrist gets caught up in the troubling case of a co-worker who is wanted for questioning about a murder. Throw in the fact that the two become romantically involved and you have your prototypical Hitchcock mystery suspense.Much like most of Hitchcock's films, once you think you know what's going on, yet another plot twist unravels. So to its credit, Spellbound is unpredictable, and it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat at certain times. But it also drags out its plot for seemingly 15 minutes too long. It's hard for a mystery of his to be boring, but the case of John B (Peck) took a long time to get interesting. I always find Gregory Peck compelling, but I think he was caught in between making his character a charming love interest and a dangerous psychopath. So he ends up falling somewhere in an awkward middle ground. However, Ingrid Bergman and Michael Chekhov were great together as two doctors trying to get to the bottom of the case. In fact, Chekhov elevates the film to a whole new level once he appears. Bergman brought the most out of a pretty thinly written character and cemented herself once again among the great Hitchcock performances.Spellbound lacks the subtly of Hitchcock's later dramas, but there's still the same old intrigue and reveals that make his films so appealing. With a more evened out story and a smoother performance from Peck, this could have been a classic.+Bergman and Chekhov+Last hour is utterly unpredictable-First act drags-Peck is caught in acting hell6.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Women make the best psychoanalysts until they fall in love."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fact that it is too large space in the film set for a psychiatric practice or form of psychoanalysis is intriguing and interesting. However, later it can be seen that other elements do not come to the fore which is certainly a negative impact on my perception. SPELLBOUND is a film about a charming woman, a psychiatrist who suppresses his profession and for the love of the patient embarks on a journey common deep emotional psychoanalysis.The story is solid round and good. The suspense is present, but I think Hitch made an exception and paid attention to the relationship between the character more than usual. That is why we are movie seems long and witnessed choppy. Expect the unexpected. This film is too obvious. The acting is solid. Dialogues are, given the subject matter, could be better. Set design is excellent. Large wooden hand. Sequences containing "glass" or "gun" are certainly innovative and fascinating.I can not help feeling by which I of this film expecting more. Romance is at times very strong and presence, while in another vision I have a feeling that this is a done romantic illusions. The director did not convince me not the one nor the other. The two main characters are psychologically and physically persecuted. Hitch is "pursue" additional bewitched with symbolic effects.Ingrid Bergman as Dr. Constance Petersen is charming and dominant in every sense. In this case, a woman in love is a very strong and determined. I think that Bergman did not receive enough stimulation from other actors. Otherwise her performance was brilliant. Constance is strong support in the story. Gregory Peck as Dr. Anthony Edwardes/John Ballantyne is in a subordinate position. The dominant actor is difficult to fit into such a situation. Paired with Bergman does not act badly. I think it is no match for the psychological drama in which he can take over the dominant role. He was 29 and it is somewhat understandably.I have a feeling that I watched pretty good movie where something's wrong.</fullReview>

At the heart of that, is a smoothly designed romance that falls into place perfectly with the film embracing the complexities of mental pathology, along with love; all the while delivering a fluid viewing with excellent, really very good dialog, both technical/complex at times and meaningful, as the story and plot consistently remain at a high level whether early on laying the foundation, or during any of the later events up til the conclusion at the end.

		<shortDescription>The usual female contradictions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This finds itself to be severely dated. Psychoanalysis and Freud have both been long swept aside so the core of the film feels a little silly, and all the mind-boggling symbolism and trance-like states that Peck is struck by all seem bizarre, and not in the right way. Psychoanalysis subscribes diligently to the theory that repressed childhood trauma sticks with you long after it is over, so we have that creepy POV shot of the brother being impaled by the fence, and Peck is triggered by symbols along the way that mimic this; lines etched by forks, lines in couches, bars speeding by from a train. But he is also strangely struck by other things like sharp knives cutting meat and a phantom burning in his hand, which seems less coherent and more just another attempt to link violence to his troubled state of mind. The few moments of tension draw attention to themselves overtly with cutaways to closeups and furtive glances - it's all a little too theatrical. Dali's clever (and laboriously constructed) surrealist sequence seems like a vague stab in the dark for some sort of connection, which is of course brilliantly and deductively deciphered by Bergman. If it was the intention to empower her character the film goes about it the wrong way by drawing attention to her gender all too often. This was of course unavoidable in the 40s as a female in a male-dominated profession, but it begins to feel like overkill when every single colleague is unsubtly trying to flirt and demean her at the same time (even Petersen's mentor dismisses any rational point she tries to make). Unsurprisingly Petersen is also privy to a little romance; why else would you cast Ingrid Bergman, after all. It becomes futile to slap spectacles on that face and make her a respected physician, because the script doesn't call for logic, but passion as a means to unravel the mystery behind Edwardes' amnesia. Everything seems to point to his guilt (even he admits it himself), but Petersen is determined to get to the bottom of the case, not because she wants justice, but because she is head over heels in love with the dashing Gregory Peck. Rather insulting, even is she is somehow right. The double mental and sexual metaphor of the 'locked doors of the mind' and the vagina is straight up silly. They both try to convince themselves they are professionals and it isn't about love (which is also unethical), but from that first glance and catch of the eye, and the way the soundtrack always blooms as they embrace, this is less psychological thriller and more romance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To all closet male oglers, I was spellbound just looking at Ingrid Bergman who is at her most beautiful in this movie. The film can be watched simply to ogle at her. Peck looked young and wiry. He came across as younger than Bergman's character. The chemistry between them was great. The background score during the romantic scenes was very affecting.There is a role reversal in the film. Bergman plays the pivotal role (usually played by males) and it is she who is sexually attracted to Peck's mentally ill character and goes out her way at great personal risk to save him.There are the usual bunch of curious bit characters that you see in Hitch movies - the nymphomaniac at the beginning of the film who scratches film, the lecher at the hotel and Bergman's strange mentor who mouths weird dialogs like "any husband of Constance is my husband".There is a dream sequence designed by Dali. It was too arty for what was a pretty over the top film. The story and plot are preposterous, I wonder whether Hitch took it all too seriously. But the way Hitchcock directs it, its pretty entertaining.Not the best Hitchcock, but even when he's not at his best, it is very very watchable.The film begins and ends with the background score being played for a few minutes.Best Regards, Pimpin.(7/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even when Hitchcock stretches the bounds of reality, it is still such a trip. As Ingrid Bergman does everything she can to validate her feelings for an amnesiac with whom she has fallen in love, she puts herself in grave danger. Not only does she not know what lurks in the mind of Gregory Peck's character, but she does know that the police could be around every corner. Of course, everything here is Freudian and assumes that psychoanalysis is the only answer. Enter Salvador Dali. Imagine being a movie director who can call in one of our greatest artists and surrealists to do a part of his film. This set of scenes from the unconscious mind is about as memorable as anything that has ever been done in the movies. Some might call it pretty schmaltzy and convenient, but it is still remarkable. Of course, we know that all will be well. Hollywood at the time was pretty predictable. Nevertheless, watching great actors like Bergman and Peck play off one another makes it worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Behind Bars of Guilt Complex</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with its obvious echoes of the style the master of suspense was so renowned for, SPELLBOUND is a slightly different movie of his. Except for the Expressionistic character of Hitchcock's movies both in their visual schemes and thematic concerns, it is a "tale of psychiatry, love and murder" (Robert Snow). Bearing this in mind, we might quote Francois Truffaut who said about the director that he "gets the maximum effect from the minimum elements." This maximum effect in SPELLBOUND finds its fullest realization in its psychoanalysis, a true novelty for the 1940s.The psychoanalysis here, as dated as it may seem, occurs to symbolize a particularly modern approach not only to the screen adaptation of a literary piece (the film is based upon a 1927 novel THE HOUSE OF DR EDWARDES by Hilary Saint George Saunders and John Palmer) but primarily to addressing of the versatile needs and expectations of its viewers. Certain dated visuals do not, indeed, shadow the dynamic effect of appeal, understanding, interest that the movie still instills after all these decades. All its artistic equipment, including the terrific soundtrack by Miklos Rozsa (not Bergman) known for the instrument of theremin, brilliant details of images, namely the opening doors that appear to symbolize the opening of hidden worlds of characters in a totally new, yet undiscovered manner (Selznick's idea), the ultra-popular dream sequence designed by Salvador Dali (I will mention later) constitute the great merit of the film and its director who could "infuse the simple story with compelling camera work and great pacing that keeps us guessing until the final pieces drop into place" (Robert Snow). However, the major strength of SPELLBOUND lies elsewhere...Carter B Horsley in one of his reviews on Hitchcock's films stated memorably that the Master of Suspense could boast three major points: "immense influence, sardonic and mischievous with and the magnetism of his cast." The two first points would never exist without the last one, that is the leading and supporting cast who make SPELLBOUND a true feat of acing.As the story imprisons its characters within the spheres of psychoanalytical approach which reinforces the duality of human nature, the actors deserve full credit. Ingrid Bergman as Constance Petersen and Gregory Peck as John Ballatyne) make a brilliant couple of a doctor and her patient developing various emotions and feelings that come and go in their growing relationship. With certain liberties taken with its original literary source and highly adapted to the medium needs by Ben Hecht, the cast supply us with an authentic insight into situations and states of mind therein depicted. As the story develops 'emotional problems of the sane,' (which we read at the beginning), they handle the task to prompt the audience to psychoanalyze the characters. Of course, we, supplied already with incomparable experience within that field after years of its popularity, do that differently than viewers of the 1940s did that. Anyway, that inspiration still works. Roger Ebert rightly pointed out about Ingrid Bergman that she "subtly combined the noble and the carnal" Some of the very best moments of theirs include the railway station moment, the kiss, Peck's first entrance and the visit at Dr Alexander Brulov's played magnificently by Michael Checkov. With his weird English accent and his cutting remarks, he makes for supreme wit and thrill as well as adds clever intellectual resonance to the story.The minor point of criticism might refer to the skiing sequence which surely occurs dates and a bit laughable and the performance of Leo G. Caroll as Dr Murchison who, on the one hand, does not call our attention on the true villain (and rightly so) but, on the other hand, becomes a bit too suspicious with his forged respectability, calmness and conventionality.Something needs to be mentioned about Dali sequence. Initially planned as a 22 minute sequence and finally cut to 2 minutes, it is still the most intriguing, nightmarish, mysterious almost part of the movie that is impossible to be skipped. Robert Snow rightly calls it 'cool' stating further that "the backgrounds have that stark, painted quality of Dali's surrealist works." Much more could be said about this excellent movie but the word limit, unfortunately, does not allow that. Putting it in a nutshell, it is one of a little less famous Hitchcock but, surely, highly worth seeing as a tremendous depiction of any sane man put behind bars of guilt complex.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Banishing The Devils Of Unreason</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the mid-1940s, public awareness of Freudian theories had grown to the point where the time was right to make a thriller in which psychoanalysis featured strongly and Alfred Hitchcock's "Spellbound" does just that. Its plot involves murder, romance and a false identity but also focuses on amnesia, a guilt complex and the manifestations of a childhood trauma. This combination of story elements works well in creating interest and suspense, as well as providing scope for the considerable amount of visual flair that's evident, especially in a dream sequence (that was designed by Salvador Dali), an imaginatively staged suicide and a vision of a series of doors opening symbolically, in a scene where a couple kiss.By today's standards, what transpires in terms of dream analysis and the simplicity with which patients can overcome their problems through psychoanalysis, seems simplistic and dumbed-down but fortunately doesn't detract too greatly from the enjoyment of watching this movie which achieved great commercial success and was nominated for 6 Academy Awards.When Dr Murchison (Leo G Carroll), the director of Green Manors mental institution in Vermont, has to retire after suffering a period of nervous exhaustion, Dr Anthony Edwardes (Gregory Peck) is appointed to succeed him. All the members of staff are immediately surprised by how young their new boss is and when he's introduced to Dr Constance Petersen (Ingrid Bergman) there's an obvious mutual attraction. As the couple get to know each other, it quickly becomes apparent that Edwardes gets very agitated and dizzy every time he sees a series of parallel lines and soon Constance also discovers that he's an impostor.After Constance asks him about his identity, he admits that he's suffering from memory loss and doesn't know who he is, but is certain that he killed the real Dr Edwardes. He discovers from the cigarette case in his jacket pocket, that his initials must be J.B. and that night leaves Constance a note to inform her that he's left the institution to go to the Empire State Hotel in New York. The police start to investigate the real Dr Edwardes' disappearance and want to locate "J.B.". Constance is convinced that the man she loves is innocent and after pursuing him to his hotel takes him to Rochester to meet her elderly mentor, Dr Brulov (Michael Chekhov).At Brulov's residence, J.B. describes one of his dreams which Constance and Brulov then interpret to unravel the mystery of J.B.'s real identity, the source of his guilt complex and what he believes happened to the real Dr Edwardes.Surrealists and psychoanalysts share a preoccupation with the workings of the unconscious mind and Salvador Dali's contribution to this movie is a real highlight as is the suicide scene near the end which ends with a gun firing towards the audience and a red flash (the only colour seen in this black and white movie).Ingrid Bergman is outstanding as the psychoanalyst who's very dedicated and well-respected but general regarded by her colleagues as being frigid until her new boss arrives on the scene. Gregory Peck does well as the mysterious amnesiac and Michael Chekhov is wonderfully eccentric as Constance's old professor who, at one point, says "Good night and sweet dreams.........which we'll analyse at breakfast".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Psychoanalysis made its way onto the screen many times and certainly in the early days, Hollywood hardly ever achieved anything worth much. Film-Noir was a common Genre that ventured in and out of this World, but even there where much is forbidden the elusive Practice and descriptions of Psychiatry were forever searching for expository verbiage and most of the time it was rendered ridiculous and pedestrian.Even with masters like Hitchcock and Writer Ben Hecht it was a discipline that defied explanatory sentences and were much too deep to be believed in short Scenes or even whole Movies. The hopelessly dated stuff like "Guilt Complex", here the term used over and over, is just is too simple to explain the complexities of the mind and the relation to the plot.The Dream analysis is also contrived to the point that it surrenders all believability. So this Film that so seriously tries to make it all fit and function as steps and paths for the Story to unfold is pathetically forced and can be too much to sustain. There is enough here to be interesting and is quite a different ride than most Movies of the time, and it is framed with conviction and confidence showing us many Artistic and bizarre touches.The highly touted Dali sequence was unparalleled at the time and there is a rousing Music Score and attractive Actors and their is enough sexual symbolism that the audience can create a checklist for some fun. Overall, there is enough here for an entertaining diversion and it is a rather remarkable effort from all involved and it is an example why a Hitchcock Film is not like anything else. It is a wonder.</fullReview>

There is also a good performance from Chekhov as Bergman's mentor. The film takes a while to get going, but ends up being absorbing. The Dali dream sequence is famous, but it's rather contrived in terms of how it fits into the story. Rozsa's Oscar winning score is good on its own terms, but is too loud and overbearing as used here. As meticulous as Hitchcock was, he sometimes put in inexplicably poorly executed action scenes. Here it's the skiing scene, featuring laughably bad use of back screen projection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A man running away from the police, running away from his subconscious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review contains minor spoilers, I'm not ruining the ending.Spellbound (1945) directed by the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock, must be one of his most underrated American films. It was Hitchcock's darkest and most surreal movie so far. A survey of psychoanalysis.The movie builds around a young doctor Constance Petersen (Ingrid Bergman) who is very good in her work, but self-contained in her personal, love life. The mental institution she works in gets a new manager Dr. Edwardes (Gregory Peck), or at least that's what we think he is. Eventually we find out that Edwardes isn't the man he says he is, he has had an amnesia and can't even remember his own name, only his initials J.B. All he knows is that he is suspected from the murder of Anthony Edwardes.On the run Constance is trying to get into J.B's head and figure out whether he murdered Edwardes or not. She's sure that he has a guilt complex, that he just thinks he killed Edwardes, because of a trauma. Then the run begins, the run where J.B is trying to run away from his subconsciousness.Alfred Hitchcock often used stripes of shadow as symbols of darkness and guiltiness. Here he also uses the stripes (which are an important part of the plot) as symbols of guilt, guilt complex. And how brilliantly he does, another great sample of Hitchcock's visual talent.The dream episodes in Spellbound were designed by Salvador Dali and his input gave a lot of visual power to this movie. What a brilliant idea to unite two great artists. This is truly a good example of Hitchcock's talent to mix romance and comedy with excitement. No one can do it as well as he did. You can even sense some film-noir elements in this gem.Spellbound is an early survey of psychoanalysis, though it's not the first, let's not forgot Fritz Lang here. It's well-acted, directed and the input of Salvador Dali just made it even better.So set yourself ready for an early psychological thriller by the master of suspense. Full of exciting twists, funny and sympathetic characters.9/10 It's hard to put Hitchcock's movies in order, because they all are so good. But if I did this would be in the top-10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreams, Salvador Dalí and Miklos Rozsa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Critics and fans don't Spellbound rank amongst Alfred Hitchcock's best movies, but for me this movie was a jewel of film-making. What other movie combines psychoanalysis, Salvador Dalí, dreams and Miklos Rozsa's eerie music? As far as I know, only this one.Like in most Hitchcock movies, a good deal of disbelief is necessary; no other director made it so clear that he made cinema about fiction and not about real life. In this piece of fantasy Ingrid Bergman plays Dr. Constance Petersen, a psychiatrist who helps an amnesic man (Gregory Peck) evade the police while she tries to heal his mind to solve a murder and prove his innocence. For the amnesic man, J.B., is also accused of having killed and impersonated one Dr. Edwardes.The central scene of this movie of course is Salvador Dalí's famous dream sequence in which every aspect of it symbolises something involved in the murder of Dr. Edwardes. Dr. Petersen and her former mentor, Dr. Brulov (Michael Chekhov) must interpret and decipher it like a riddle. It's a spectacular idea, and one that I have only seen repeated again in David Lynch's Twin Peaks.Apart from these flights of surrealism, the movie is of course a great cat-and-mouse story as the couple tries to always keep one step ahead of the police, while slowly falling in love with each other (this is Hitchcock, after all, always disguising simple love stories as complex mysteries). It's also fascinating because at certain, tense moments we're left wondering whether J.B. really is a killer or not.Finally it has Miklos Rozsa's sounds of eeriness. I've discovered that the unusual sound of the main theme is achieved by an instrument called Theremin, invented just a few years before the movie. It's so striking that it has become forever connected with horror, fear and mystery in cinema, as exemplified by its use in Bernard Hermann's score for the otherworldly sci-fi movie The Day The Earth Stood Still. Rozsa used it also in The Lost Weekend.Watching this movie at night alone in my living room, I felt scared several times. Even with the lights on this movie still delivers tension and suspense after sixty-four years. I can only imagine what it must be to watch it in a dark theatre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another solid '40's Hitchcock movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion Hitchcock didn't do his very best work in the '40's but that of course doesn't mean that he made bad movies during that time period. On the contrary, quite obviously. In a way '40's thrillers are all more or less the same but an Hitchcock genre movie is always something special to watch and better and more effective than the usual genre movie from the same time period.The movie begins like so many other genre movies and is slow but steady with its build up. However when you are watching an Hitchcock movie you just know that things are never fully the way they seem and the movie has some surprising twists in its story, even though some of them are obvious because of the now days somewhat outdated way of story-telling within this movie. It's a quite solid story actually and I don't really understand some people's criticism that the story is too far fetched and not credible enough. Especially the movie its last 20 minutes are so are excellent for its genre and time period and are also one of the reason why this movie is better and distinct itself from other genre movies made during the same decade.As you can expect the movie is filled with some trademark Hitchcock moments, in which different and original movie making techniques also play some key roles. The movie has some real memorable moments, of which the dream sequence, designed by Salvador Dalí, is of course the best- and most legendary example. A character on the run is a very often reoccurring element within an Hitchcock movie. However in this movie there is a character who is mainly on the run for himself, as he suffers from amnesia while being haunted by some vague memories about something awful he thinks he has done. This makes the movie also really interesting. It's a thriller with early psychological elements. Also something that would later return in multiple other Hitchcock movies.I was also impressed by the movie its acting. Although I always enjoy a good '40's movie I just also can't deny that its acting by todays standards is simply too over-the-top and emotional. Outdated to put it boldly. However the acting in this movie stands the test of time well and Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck really give away some fine performances. It actually was one of Peck's first acting roles and he was still in his late 20's at the time of this production. 2 years later he and Hitchock also did the movie "The Paradine Case" together, which wasn't a very big success. A shame they didn't do more movies together, fore Gregory Peck suited the role just as fine as for instance a James Stewart or Cary Grant-, actors Hitchock would later work with during his career.The movie got nominated for 6 Oscar's, including one's for best picture and best directing. It only won one, for it's musical score though. The movie truly deserved that award, fore Miklós Rózsa's musical score is one of the best out of his long career. It's also truly one of his most memorable scores.Simply just one fine solid genre movie!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Just another manhunt wrapped up in pseudo-psychoanalysis"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...this is how Alfred Hitchcock himself referred to the film. While it has its flaws, I still found this film very entertaining. The movie starts a little slow but does build up steam, so stick with it.There is a great cast here. I love both leads - Peck and Bergman. Were there two more beautiful people to play opposite each other? I don't think I can think of a single pair that can compete. The way the cinematography capitalized on their physical beauty by utilizing extreme close-ups was masterful. That is one of my favorite aspects of the film. So beautiful are the images that I could almost watch this with the volume completely turned down. But that would be a huge mistake because then you would miss the evocative and haunting music score that is almost as much a lead character in the film as Peck or Bergman - and why it won an Oscar, deservedly so. But not only is the music a treat for your ears , but I also love Peck and Bergman's voices. Peck's is so deep and masculine. And Bergman's is so soft and reassuring, with her beautiful accent.Now, for my few complaints about the film. Peck's fainting spells were a little melodramatic and not at all realistic. They almost became laughable. There is very poorly done ski scene that has horrible rear projection - I'm shocked that Selznick or Hitch signed off on it. But apart from these few complaints, this is a great mystery/suspense tale that I think was very unique in the way it was told. I know many have commented on the simplistic treatment of psychoanalysis and the nice, tidy conclusions. But I think Hitchcock himself answered this best. When Selznick's technical adviser on the film (his personal psychotherapist) disagreed with Hitch over how therapy works, Hitch responded, "My dear, it's only a movie." Great answer!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish And Romantic Forties Thriller Classic Of Psychotic Psychiatrist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr Anthony Edwardes is the new chief of staff at a psychiatric rest home, but seems to have some serious mental problems of his own. When Dr Constance Petersen discovers he is an imposter who may have killed Edwardes, she does not report him to the police but instead tries to cure his amnesia and discover the real truth ?Spellbound (along with Foreign Correspondent and Rope) is one of Hitchcock's very best thrillers from his prolific forties period. Although it is perhaps a little heavily laden with wordy psychiatric explanations, it exemplifies the very best aspects of his work - a taut, suspenseful story, intriguing star performances filled with sexual repression, and several bravura set-piece moments (the Salvador Dali dream sequence, the chilling scene where Peck wanders the house armed with a straight-razor, the point-of-view shot of the pistol with the stylish flash of colour). It's also filled with humour ("Good night, and sweet dreams, which we'll analyse at breakfast.") and romance - Bergman is literally besotted with Peck and delivers what I think is the richest and most enigmatic performance of her career. She gives off intelligence, vulnerability, passion and sorrow in palpable waves and lights up the entire movie with her presence, a striking contrast with many of the ultra-glamorous but rather vacuous blondes in much of Hitchcock's work. Peck is great too, in the somewhat thankless role of Mr Mystery, and the excellent support cast feature several fine turns, notably Carroll as the heavy, Chekhov as the amusing Dr Brulov, and Fleming (The Spiral Staircase, Out Of The Past) as the saucy man-hater. Featuring a memorably lush string score by the ubiquitous Miklós Rósza and a great script by Ben Hecht, this a terrific early example of the psycho-sexual thriller subgenre, influencing such later films as Cape Fear, Play Misty For Me and Basic Instinct. Hitch appears in the hotel, smoking a cigar and coming out of an elevator.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>psychoanalysis as thriller theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many of Hitchcock's films include dream elements and deal with the caprices of the human memory. 'Spellbound' approaches these themes from the angle of psychoanalysis which was quite an innovative approach in the American cinema at that time. Although the Freudian logic dominates this story of an amnesic patient (Gregory Peck) disguising himself as the chief of a psychiatric clinic and falling in love with the doctor (Ingrid Bergman) who will do everything to save him when he is accused of murder and to recover his sanity, the charm of the movie relies more in the classic Hitchcock elements and in the famous dream scene designed by Salvador Dali. This is considered one of the weaker films of Hitchcock, but there is a lot to enjoy here, especially the radiant Bergman who is at here best, and even if the relation with Peck is not credible and there are some flat dialogs - the film overall ages well and is worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You cannot keep bumping your head against reality and saying it is not there."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't imagine that the workings of the human mind were well-trod cinema territory back in 1945. Though many works of Surrealism had undoubtedly touched upon the concept {such as Jean Cocteau's 'The Blood of a Poet (1930)'}, as far as popular Hollywood entertainment was concerned, the brain represented unexplored terrain. It's only fitting that Alfred Hitchcock would be the director to break the mould, given his well-documented fondness for experimenting with new ideas and techniques {his previous film, 'Lifeboat (1944),' for example, is notable for a plot that unfolds entirely on a small boat in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean}. From 1939, the year of the director's arrival in Hollywood following his British success, producer David O. Selznick had a contract with Hitchcock, one that had since spawned only a single film for Selznick {the Best Picture Oscar-winning 'Rebecca (1940)'}. In order for Hitchcock to fulfil his contractual obligations, the Selznick suggested that Hitchcock direct a movie based on the producer's own successful experience with psychoanalysis.Despite Hitchcock later dismissing 'Spellbound (1945)' as "just another manhunt story wrapped in pseudo-psychology," I'm willing to slide the film into the director's top ten, albeit in the latter section of the list. Rather than delivering the nail-biting suspense for which Hitchcock was best known, the film offers a lighthearted romance and adventure story, mixed with some memory-orientated mystery and intrigue. What happens when you fall in love with a man who might be a cold-blooded murderer? Even more tantalisingly, what if you yourself suffer amnesia and are faced with the very real possibility that you've killed a man? Gregory Peck, in only his fourth film role, is terrifically sharp, handsome and charming as Dr. Anthony Edwardes, the newly-arrived psychoanalyst at a well-regarded mental hospital? or, more accurately, as the man who is unknowingly impersonating Dr. Edwardes. Ingrid Bergman, in the first of her three collaborations with the Master of Suspense, is especially lovely as Dr. Constance Petersen, an intelligent but detached psychiatrist who uncovers warmth and happiness in her affection for a suspected murderer.As Peck and Bergman navigate an implausible but absurdly entertaining plot, which delves rather deeply into some simplistic notions of Freudian psychoanalysis, the audience is treated with some of the finest examples of the director's flair for visual storytelling, despite a horrifically-dated skiing episode that demonstrates the shortcomings of rear-projection. The couple's definitive romantic encounter, for example, is climaxed with the symbolic opening of successive doors, a unique and imaginative metaphor that adds another layer to the emotion. The black-and-white photography is punctuated only once by colour, as a guilty gun-man turns the weapon on himself and momentarily spatters the camera with blood {this effect was present in the original prints, and was restored for the DVD release}. Of course, the true masterpiece sequence is to be found in Peck's nightmarish dream, a twisted message from his subconscious which needs only to be deciphered to reveal the secrets of the story. Selznick disagreed with Hitchcock's decision to hire Surrealist artist Salvador Dali for these scenes, but the end result is positively astonishing, highly reminiscent of the German Expressionism that reached its creative extreme with 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920).'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The audience by the screen effect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Spellbound" (1945) directed by Alfred Hitchcock as movie has a dream made from sketches elaborated by Dali, where it is supposed staying the interpretation of the sickness whose main character was affected. For instance the scene where himself is making his best in skiing down a snowed mountain during a trip, it is repeatedly matter of his own obsession. Having by this path in his imaginative mind, a place for troubles of true perceptive vision, as it was instead like a fake projection of a self distinguished substitution of memory and like that it is one of the very known moments of the story in this movie. Besides, Hitchcock put the question about what ought truly maybe meaning that if he had as character a past problem, that took the attention for his personality of dandy. Otherwise, which means that his psychiatrist woman and also his lover has been convinced that he was not a murder, but only affected by the culpability as human being. Whose forgotten foolish mind from a child event, happened as a scene reconstituted and explained in why his recently behavior was like that, but not conscious of himself behind the others and outside of his own mind. If the fog in the mind is quite subject of controversy in this same story of analyze, against his own power of cure for the others, because the forced medication like it is well done in such a house of lost memory, to bring up to the remembrance of personality as if it was in a catalog of artificial dreams for the cure of his own ancient practicer, show us barely enough and without such an exaggeration, that this kind of happening as mystery of the recent past itinerary of this character is so troubled in itself, that the margin between criminal intention for murdering someone in such a legal activity like that is very short indeed, for another step about professional irresponsibility without a precise aim to kill the colleague. As it was in question here just after the war was finished and Hitchcock's feelings remind in these nests of selected liquidation of human beings like it was made in many circumstances like that, even where he is as director at the time when it was made that movie with the drawings of the culpability of the main character by such a transfer of ethical responsibility. The scene which is very impressive still now, it is when the director of the house for mental cure, a doctor who points a pistol against the couple but after some lines between him and them returns it against himself and shooting, as well it was to the audience by the screen effect of the shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much-Maligned Hitchcock Classic Has Enough Cinematic Bravado to Satisfy Fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is one scene in Alfred Hitchcock's 1945 classic that epitomizes what's both cinematically unique and logically wrong about the whole venture. Late in the story, comely therapist Dr. Constance Petersen and her inadvertent patient John Brown (or is it Dr. Anthony Edwardes?) set off skiing on an empty, pristine slope in Gabriel Valley. The two attractive stars are obviously shot standing still against an aggressive wind machine in front of a moving screen matte of the Alpine scenery. It's really a concurrently thrilling and silly-looking shot designed to build suspense, and it's easy to dismiss its artifice until it all ends in a key revelation. The rest of the movie suffers from the same conflicting dilemma, i.e., isolated moments of cinematic bravado that interweave with a preposterous Baroque-level storyline.Written by Ben Hecht and Angus MacPhail, the plot begins with the staff of a country asylum awaiting the arrival of Dr. Edwardes to replace the retiring Dr. Murchison. Enter a man who thinks he's Edwardes until it becomes clear that the real Edwardes has been murdered. In the meantime, the normally reserved Dr. Petersen has become drawn to the young Edwardes doppelganger, who becomes her patient and then her lover. When he is accused of the murder, the couple go on the lam in her desperate hope of finding the truth about his identity and who the murderer really is. Just like Hitchcock's first American picture, the 1940 classic "Rebecca", this film was produced by David O. Selznick in his trademark glossy manner, but this time, Selznick appears more confident about his director's abilities as Hitchcock's atmospheric touches are more abundant here. There is even a surreal dream sequence designed by Salvador Dali and one hilariously effective metaphor of doors opening when the lovers kiss. George Barnes' deep-focus cinematography, Miklos Rozsa's evocative music (though a bit too macabre at times) and James Basevi's art direction are all first-rate.As Petersen, Ingrid Bergman is saddled with a role that has her explaining and probing ad nauseam, but somehow her natural luminescence comes through her professional exterior. Gregory Peck, on the other hand, is more problematic as the traumatized hero since he has to convince us that he could be a murderer when his young and naturally stalwart manner makes such dire emotions rather incredible. Smaller roles are filled expertly with layered work from Leo G. Carroll as Murchison and Michael Chekhof as Peterson's eccentric mentor. In the impressive Hitchcock canon, it is a highly stylized but ultimately middling effort. The double-sided Criterion Collection DVD, however, is an unequivocally superb package starting with a pristine print transfer. It contains an informative commentary track by film scholar Marian Keane, a multi-media feature ("A Nightmare Ordered by Telephone") on the Dali dream sequence, a 1973 audio interview with Rosza and a 1948 radio broadcast with Joseph Cotton and Alida Valli in the lead roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock, Dali and Freud...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...An interesting combination if there ever was one. 'Spellbound' is definitely an intriguing film. While it never quite reaches the great heights it promises, there are many amazing sequences here to enjoy.The convoluted and tricky storyline concerning psychoanalysis makes the film different, but also proves to be it's downfall (that's a little harsh I suppose, as it is a very good film). The Freudian subtext is hard to grasp if you are completely unfamiliar with Freudian theory,and a lot hinges on whether or not the viewer believes in Freud's teachings. It's original though, and adds an extra element of suspense to the film. This film, made in 1945, came at a time when Freudian theory was very much in vogue (The Seventh Veil and Leave Her To Heaven both being released in the same year). Hitchcock, a leader in film-making, played up the matters of the mind, but this is ultimately a glossy romantic spectacle. It's dark, but not dark enough to be truly chilling. Selznick was the producer after all, so of course it has that studio gloss.Still, this film contains some of the best visual touches you'll see in a Hitchcock film. Peck's dream sequence was designed by Dali, and the effect is stunning. His character's strange neuroses throughout the film (his freak-out over seeing parallel lines on a train track, fork etc) are filmed beautifully. The 'thawing of Ingrid Bergman' (or so I like to refer to it as) through the discovery of love with Peck's character is conveyed to the audience through the opening of doors as she receives Peck's kiss. It's perhaps one of Hitch's too obvious, unsubtle moments, but it's still a powerful technique regardless.Ingrid Bergman gives a great performance as the doctor. She shares great chemistry with her colleague-turned-patient (a romance overstepping the boundaries of professionalism?). Peck, in an early role, does very well, but is flat in a couple of scenes. Put it down to inexperience- in a few years time he would be carrying productions bigger than this.The film maintains it's suspense throughout, is appropriately romantic, and provides a marvellous Bergman performance.8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The style is pure Hitchcock, but the story is utterly ridiculous in this psychological drama. Gregory Peck plays a psychiatric patient tormented by something in his past that he's buried in his subconscious; Ingrid Bergman plays the noble suffering love interest who stands by him. It's all very over-heated and over-done, filled with psychobabble so obvious and simplified that a third grader could understand it.Ah well....this came out in a year when Hollywood seemed to discover the science of psychiatry, and it unleashed a slew of movies that dealt with the neuroses plaguing their protagonists. "Spellbound" is silly to be sure, but it has some of those priceless Hitchcockian moments that make his films memorable when the same movie by any other director would have long since been forgotten. The highlight in this one is a long and surreal dream sequence that had production design by Salvador Dali. It's a stunner.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated but enjoyable effort from Hitchcock, Bergman--and Dalí!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, "Spellbound" is more a guilty pleasure than a true Hitchcock masterpiece. As other reviewers have mentioned, it's a dated movie, both in its attitude toward psychoanalysis and toward gender roles. The movie has a blind faith in Freudian-style analysis, and because concepts like repressed memories were new to a 1945 audience, the characters explain them relentlessly. (Somebody needs to count just how many times the words "guilt complex" are said in this movie.) Overall the film is a little too talky, the dialogue a little too on-the-nose. As for gender issues, Ingrid Bergman, in the role of the sole female psychiatrist at a mental hospital, has to put up with sexual harassment from her male colleagues, who consider her "repressed"--until she falls quite abruptly in love with a mysterious character played by Gregory Peck.On the other hand, this means you've got two attractive stars enacting a romance that is slick and sweeping in the best Old Hollywood tradition, accompanied by a swoony musical score that is guaranteed to get stuck in your head. And Hitchcock manages to create some very suspenseful sequences (and to employ some great visuals and special effects) amidst all the talk.Peck doesn't give one of his greatest performances, but his role is nearly impossible to play as written, requiring him to fluctuate between being a romantic leading man, a fearful and confused amnesiac, and a menacing might-be killer. Bergman does a good job as the determined psychoanalyst whose repressions melt away in the face of love--who else can melt like Ingrid Bergman? Michael Chekhov gives an amusing performance as Bergman's crotchety-but-lovable mentor. (As a side note, Chekhov was Stanislavsky's most brilliant student and a renowned actor in Russia. I wonder how he felt about playing a stock character role like he does here--though he certainly seems to have fun with it.)The dream sequence, designed by Salvador Dalí, is definitely part of "Spellbound"'s over-literal approach to psychoanalysis, but is also fascinating in its own right?I've certainly never seen anything else like it! The Criterion DVD (now unfortunately out of print) has a good featurette about the making of this sequence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Superior Film Technically, and a Fascinating Mystery-Romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a famous film, whose main components are classics of film-making--an interesting love story, a classic mystery and psychological complications--for nearly all concerned... This is an "A" effort in B/W in every respect. Some of the sets for the flashback sequences were designed by Salvador Dali; the direction is by Alfred Hitchcock and the lighting,art direction, Miklos Rozsa's famous musical score, sets and actors all lend heightened abilities to the narrative. The interesting element of "Spellbound" to me has always been its plot line. the plot theme is fidelity, ranging from the heroine's belief in her mentally-troubled love, that young man's loyalty to priorities even at his worst moments of doubt, and the sincerity of all the doctors, save one, to the honesty of their profession-- helping minds back to reality. As the heroine, Ingrid Bermgan is lovely and very professional; she almost makes an audience believe she is an emotionally- inexperienced spinster. Gregory Peck is handsome and promising and frequently effective as the man who wanders into her life in need of her help. Leo G. Carroll has yet another feature film part that he brings to intelligent life as the acting head of a sanatorium who is Bergman's adviser. others in the cast are given less to do but are uniformly good; and young Rhonda Fleming has a brief part as a lethal but lovely patient. The famous use of parallel lines is employed like a leitmotif throughout the film; this image is what always sets Peck's mind off its amnesiac second identity's track, and what each time provides clues as Bergman keeps Peck from the police, risks her life, and tries to cause him to remember who he is, what really happened to the doctor he is suspected of having murdered, and finally to discover what is the whole truth about the man in whom she so deeply believes. That the filmmaker, Hitchcock, managed to make this film dramatic and never glossy, and to keep its story centered on Bergman's purposes both as a psychiatric professional and a woman is a fine accomplishment. The film can be watched many times, I suggest, precisely because despite its lack of outdoor sets and overt physical actions, its internal logical, dialogue and relationships are quite compellingly worked out. A superior noir thriller, with the expected Hitchcockian focus and sustained interest.</fullReview>

The overly simplified meanings of dreams and symbolism stands to be Hitchcock's greatest cypher into his vivid films. The entire movie is filmed as a tongue in cheek jib at psychoanylitics, Freud and science in general. The movie's dark comedic aspect is still full of Hitch's signature "McGuffen's", the symbols that seem to embody everything yet as soon as they are used they are thrown away. This movie is a distinct departure from his other works as anytime Hitchcock explores the mind on a literal level, you can be sure the master of suspense is playing a coy game with your senses. The Salvador Dali dream sequence is perfectly woven into Hitchcock's dreamscape, showing the two innovator's similarities in turning the world upside down. This is mandatory Hitchcock viewing and a very interesting exploration into the mind of the master.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Great film by Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spellbound 1945 Great picture from Selnick Studio's and Alfred Hitchcock. Two people responsible for this great flick. Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck. This movie's plot is a good one. The young woman doctor helping a man with a lost memory. The dialoque is great. Gregory Peck portrays a man lost and sometimes very much in control. There's one thing for sure. He loves his doctor. The flow of the movie is good it keeps you in suspense. The supporting cast had a good read on all aspects of the film, Spellbound is a must see and warrants a ten rating on a scale of 1-10. David O. Selsnick produced a fine picture. Its ashame that the Academy didn't give more awards to this picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing, if ultimately dated thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is more than a You've Got Mail for those interested in the mind. Hitchcock uses the character of the psychoanalytic method for disinterring surprising information to fashion a thriller with unforeseen twists. It is inconsistent though, largely in its pacing: this may well be a further trapping of the subject matter, analysis being a combination of long stretches of inert chat interspersed with traumatic, even explosive episodes.SPOILER Of course to even things out, Hitchcock runs a manhunt alongside Peck's pursuit of his real identity. Peck is pretty but almost out of place here, stilted and given a poor wardrobe. The joy of the film is Bergman's shrink: she does everything, including humour, and looks good throughout.The film is full of nascent Hitchcockisms but is curiously bound by 40s studio vernacular, down to soft-focus close-up and a cut-n-paste romantic score. It's more than this though. A curious (if predictable in 21st century retrospect) contribution from Dali in the dream sequence and the Bergman's non-clinical reaction to falling in love as unanalysable drive the film beyond matinée advert for therapy. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>** HERE BE SPOILERS **Dr. Constance Peterson (Bergman) works at Green Manors mental asylum. There is going to be a change in management and the chief psychiatrist is to be replaced by a new one, one Dr. Edwardes (Peck). However, this Dr. Edwardes behave very peculiar and Constance discovers that the man is a fraud. He is not Dr. Edwardes but a man with amnesia with no recollection of who he is (maybe he is someone with initials J B) or why he is posting himself as the known psychiatrist. But Constance doesn't discover this until after she has fallen in love with the man. She is convinced she can cure and save him, but he himself (and others) are convinced he has murdered the real Edwardes and taken his place. So he flees, and she goes after. Hunted by the police, they themselves must solve the labyrinth in J B's mind to find out if he killed Edwardes or not.A interesting movie, above all for the interesting shots representing psychoanalytic themes. Not to mention the dream-scene designed by artist Salvador Dalí. But there is also the murder mystery. Both are well done and interesting and brought together they create a pretty unique movie theme. One can tell that Hitchcock is behind the steering wheel, with nice cinematic tricks (and a cameo). The cast is good with Bergman and Peck in the leads but I liked Chekov as Peterson's old friend/teacher(?) most. A most entertaining, cunning and sympathetic character. As the movie is a mystery/thriller there is no loss that it is filmed in black and white, but fully enjoyable as it is. The only major flaw is that it got a little predictable as it drew to its conclusion.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great direction, great acting, but definitely not Hitchcock's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock is known for his unique style of directing, which involves many unusual camera angles, letting his camera "act", and building up intense amounts of suspense. This film is Hitchcock during his prime, but, unfortunately, the theme is oversimplified to the point of making the film far less that what it could have been. Sure, psychoanalysis is not a subject easily fit into a two-hour film, but maybe it shouldn't be compressed into that; it should either be done right, in a film entirely dedicated to depicting a true-to-life psychoanalysis, or at least treated with more respect and thought than it is here. The "dream interpretation" scene in this film will seem a mockery to any true psychologist or psychiatrist. Very little is done to make it appear the way it is in real life, and, like I said earlier, it is oversimplified to the point of being fed to a mainstream crowd with no problems(think the hacking scenes of Swordfish). Apart from that somewhat minor criticism, I really enjoyed this movie, and so would any horror/Hitchcock fan. It's very much his style, and is a prime example of his excellent film-making. He was indeed an incredibly talented director. I love the way he slowly builds up a story, only to suddenly introduce a character or an event and have the rest of the movie revolve around that character or event. The story is very good in this one, and if it hadn't been oversimplified, it could easily have gotten a perfect score, in my opinion. The plot is very good, it has a good pace, and the way the story slowly unravels is excellent. The acting is great, both of the leads do exceptionally well, and most of the supporting cast is good. The characters are well-written, credible and well-cast. The suspense is very good, and the intensity of some scenes will leave you as a nervous wreck. The mystery was great, and kept you guessing to the very end. The film's editing is also very good, some of the best in a Hitchcock film, and that's saying a lot. The special effects are surprisingly good, for such an old film. The cinematography is every bit as excellent as just about every other Hitchcock film. A few final notes; though I did find the interpretation scene a little too simplified, I enjoyed the dream sequence itself immensely. Some of Hitchcock's best directed work, in terms of 'spooky and disturbing' factor. Though I normally loathe romance subplots, I found this one to be sufficiently credible and entertaining, and it didn't feel out of place. Finally, despite the subject and theme of psychoanalysis being terribly simplified, I enjoyed the various scenes of such analysis in the film, as well as the various twists related to it. Very good job on that, Mr. Hitchcock. All in all, a very good Hitchcock mystery-thriller that most fans of such will enjoy, even if it is just a little oversimplified. I recommend it to any fan of Hitchcock and the genres of mystery and thriller. I guess most people who have more than just a little awareness on the subject of psychoanalysis should take it with a grain of salt, or not see it at all. As said by Alfred Hitchcock when David O. Selznick's psychotherapist confronted him during production, in regards to a fallacy in the depiction of the therapy; "My dear, it's only a movie." 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>another classic from Hitch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ingrid Bergman just makes me drool. She doesn't just possess sexiness with looks. She conveys it in everyway known to show it without stripping naked. She has every aspect needed to show a female role the right way. The way she accepts love in Hitchcock's "Spellbound" is another pure example of why she was one of the greatest(if not the greatest)actresses to ever grace the screen. The analyst she portrays in this film is in constant torment. She is fighting her analytical mind against a love for Gregory Peck's amnesiac. Peck plays a man who is troubled by images that trigger something forgotten. What normally triggers him are white lines. Whether on Bergman's sweater or cut into a tablecloth, white lines haunt Peck's amnesiac. He says that he committed murder. He knows this. It's up to Bergman and an aging teacher of hers to find the answer to a troubling mind riddle(created with surreal excellence in the famous dream sequence by Salvador Dali). The film has a strong story. Even when you think the film is solved, it has other elements not addressed at the moment. The dreams of Peck are very well defined and puzzlingly astounding. Everything that occurs to solve how a man died come down to the dream. Hitch shows his clever camerawork once again with two brilliantly shot scenes. One is through a milk glass that Peck is drinking when it appears that he is about to kill Bergman's teacher friend. The other is a suicide at the end when we find out who killed the Doctor Anthony Edwards. The film has the usual Hitch thriller sequences, such as trying to dodge police and getting away from a setting before being caught. This is a lot of fun, but the romance at the center between Peck and Bergman is the true delight. Hitch also shows out when it comes to how they lock eyes. Hitch is the definate master. You only need to see this film. *****/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a 24 year old Hitchcock fan, I must say this film was very underrated. I bought it with the criterion 5 pack and I gave it an 8/10 vote. The twists at the end are very nice and make sense, I loved the idea of giving us 3 different endings before we see what really happened to Dr. Edwards. The romance is laid on thick, but the mystery around Peck is good. I especially enjoy the sequence when Peck is about to shave and instead has one of his white line fits and instead goes downstairs with his razor looking like he is going to kill someone. The suspense of that sequence and when Bergman comes downstairs to see her friend doctor appear to be dead, is excellent. My friends are also young for this old type of movie and they both enjoyed it (22 and 25). MUST see for Hitch fans and romance/suspense fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, its been said before. But what the heck, once more won't hurt. If for any other reason, see this movie just for the Dali dream sequence. Possibly, it's the one time the overarchingly loud musical score fits in well alongside the narration and the visuals. The tension builds appropriately, and the camera work is perfect. It the first truly engaging moment in this flick and at the end you're left trying to figure out what means what. The stylishness of it almost seems out of place in an otherwise ho-hum movie. Everything comes together here, taking surrealism from canvas to celluloid. If youre a fan of this genre you cant afford to miss it.As for the rest of the film, thankfully the last 1/3 of the movie picks up the pace with a couple of classic Hitch twists thrown in for good measure. Ya, it's dated as people love to point out, but Hitch wasn't making movies for 2003. Yes, the music is constantly blaring, but that just about describes 90% of this genre of movie made during the 30's and 40's anyway, so why fuss? Still, required viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two primary elements make this movie so enjoyable. First there is the mystery suspense element. Is 'Dr. Edwardes' guilty and can his innocence or his guilt be determined before it is too late? Will Constance and John live fall in love and live happily ever after? I think the leads allow men to fantasize what it would be like to cared for, believed in, and loved by someone like Ingrid Bergman and women to fantasize what it would be like to care for, love and be loved by someone like Gregory Peck. The usual innovative visual style and trademark touches of The Master are replete throughout. The score is also unusually haunting. Another winner from The Master, 9/10. I also want to say that the early scene with Rhonda Fleming (Out of the Past) is not extraneous. Besides giving screentime to Ms. Fleming, we learn more about the credentials of Constance and appreciate the discipline of psychoanalysis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Spellbound" after all these years continues to hold the attention, thanks to solid performances of the entire cast, secure direction, production design, and scoring.Miklos Rozsa's score (with uncredited Audrey Granville's assistance) benefits from a terrific main "theme A." Due to the extensive number of music cues however, it could have also been enhanced by strong "B" and "C" themes. The ear simply gets tired of hearing Main theme "A" returning intact so often, beautiful and haunting as it is. This is particularly notable when one includes both the Prelude and Exit music (on the DVD). Michael Chekov's appearance is most refreshing, yet it's the two stars, Peck and Bergman, that carry numerous long scenes together, both playing off one another with remarkable balance, rapport, and compatibility.One of Hitchcock's top films of the forties.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's Spellbound is a classic, suitable for all ages, that will keep any viewer surprisingly close to the edge of their seat for a film so tame by today's standards. Spellbound has all the action beats in the right places, and plays along at a good pace after picking up very close to the beginning. Each suspenseful moment is relevant both to the plot, and to the audience.The acting is dead-on for every character; their performances blend together very nicely and the setup is perfect. The writing is where this movie, like most classics, shine: I didn't expect to be so drawn in to a movie nearing 60 years of age.If you're looking for a pleasant surprise of a movie, with elements of mystery, romance, drama, and a lot of suspense, then you will greatly enjoy Spellbound.

		<fullReview>Spellbound is basically a story about psychoanalysis, a murder and all that covered by a love story. But not comparable to any movies of the 90s that deal with amnesia and murder mysteries. This one is unique. You know this is a Hitchcock movie after the first 5 minutes, the shadows will tell you for sure. If you have seen one of Hitchcock's movies in black and white, you'll know what I mean. The acting is pretty good, although I was a little disappointed by Bergmann but the camera work compensates this in a way. The plot starts really slow (just like in many movies of the mid-40s) but takes a few unexpected turns towards the end and keeps actually getting better. And there's always a little room for a small funny line that might make you smile.A major flaw however is the quite annoying music that alters between being too cheesy and too dramatic and it is way too loud in comparisson to the voices. There is another thing, you will have to keep in mind, when watching this movie: it's from 1945!! The views on women and psychoanalysis may seem out of date or even silly today I don't want to spoil too much, so I'll just say this much.If you like Dalí, you will like this one. 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spellbound is not one of Hitchcock's best, it has plenty of good things about it but it is a little dated. The first way it has dated is we probably do psychiatry a little different now than like it is in the movie. The second thing is near the end with the Gun and the Big Hand, this was probably pretty effective in the 40s but now it seems kind of dumb.Ingrid Bergman is great as a caring psychiatrist. Michael Chekhov is a scene stealer for what little portion of the movie hes in. Gregory Peck is ok, when hes suppose to be scared he does that quite well but hes not that good when hes talking. Their is a dream sequence in the movie, which was designed by Salvador Dali and it is fantastic, my favorite part of the movie. The Score is very creepy. One flaw i found, some people dont think this is a flaw but I do, at the end when Dr. Peterson's(Ingrid Bergman) boss says that more than revealing thing about the doctor who was killed, it kind of took the suspense away and made the movie drag. I guess it was necessary but I kind of wish it could have been done differently. Overall, Spellbound has kind of dated, but its still entertaining and a pretty good movie. 8.25 out of 10. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is badly dated. Parading as romantic suspense, with a Hecht script and a top cast, it falters on every level. Hitch tries to do what he eventually succeeded in doing with Vertigo. I won't bother with the plot--designed for afternoon soaps, complete with an amnesiac who may be a murderer, a beautiful psychiatrist and a lot of almost mock-Freudian drivel.Gregory Peck in an early, wooden performance, and Ingrid Bergman are oil and water together--no sparks at all, though Ingrid as always is a delight to look at. Add a half-saccharine, half King Kong score (Where is Bernard Hermann when you need him?) which remains in irritating high relief throughout, and you have it--I swore the film lasted about four hours.The noir-ish lighting and shadows are of the era and quite good. The obvious technical gaffe of back-screening the skiing sequence is something I'd excuse if the rest of the film had merit. In the Hitchcock pantheon this one ranks near the bottom.</fullReview>

Even her wizened mentor condones her bizarre mixture of therapy and (implied) sex. Some interesting dream sequences supposedly designed by Salvadore Dali. Very well photographed by George Barnes. The score by Rozsa is one of the best ever written for films, but unfortunately Hitchcock seems to prefer blasting the sweeping stirring movements than in using the piece's other, more subtle moments.

		<fullReview>This is one of the few Hitchcock films I hadn't seen until quite recently. I entered into the film cautiously having heard mixed reviews of it but was more than pleasantly surprised.This is a brilliant little Hitchcock thriller with all the usual plot devices (a murder, police hunt, memory loss etc) but all given an extra dimension by the psycho-analysis threads running through the story.The cast are more or less superb. It takes a while to get used to Ingrid Bergman as a psycho-analyst but this is easier to do later in the film when she ditches her specs and white coat. Leo G. Carroll is a pleasant, mild-mannered doc whose quiet politeness becomes all the more ominous when it turns out he's the bad guy. The only real disappointment here is Gregory Peck who is somewhat wooden in an early screen role.Of course, one of the main highlights of the movie is the impressive dream sequence designed by Salvador Dali. Without resorting to horror effects these sequences come over as being realistically dream-like through use of huge, distorted shapes and mysterious, faceless men.Hitch is firing on all cylinders direction wise too and the scene where Dr. Murchison shoots himself includes the token "great shot" of the film.If you haven't already seen Spellbound and are put off by its mixed reviews - don't be. All the classic Hitchcock elements are here plus a little extra for the brainiacs to chew on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 1945 Look at Psychology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starring Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck, this 1945 movie reflects the nation's love affair with Freudian psychology and gives me a clearer understanding of way our culture looked at psychology in those days. Looking back now, it all seems rather naive, but way back in 1945, it was a way of explaining the mysteries of behavior and a breakthrough in modern thought.Ingrid Bergman plays the lone female psychologist among her male peers. They work at an upscale mental hospital in Vermont. When Gregory Peck comes on staff as her boss, they immediately fall in love. But in classic Hitchcock form, all is not what it seems. Gregory Peck is gets strange fainting spells and is suffering from amnesia. He is not who he appears and has no memory of who he really is. Perhaps he has murdered the real doctor and taken his identity. They flee from the police.Bergman must now discover who Gregory Peck really is, have him remember his childhood trauma, cure him, and then find the true murderer. She does this with class in this interesting role which portrays her as a strong woman, and which is counter to the kinds of sexist attitudes which I thought were typical at the time.The story holds my interest but certainly was not one of Hitchcock's best. It just hints at the kind of tension that Hitchcock later mastered, moves much too slowly, and keeps taking time to explain to the audience just what psychology is and how it helps people. Bergman is a good actress and lights up every scene. Gregory Peck is weaker, and the role he plays casts him as wimp. It's a role that some men might have declined to play during that period of time, and it is to his credit that he took it on.A film like this makes me realize just how far the pendulum has swung in our attitudes towards psychology in general and how much of the Freudian logic is still etched deeply on our consciousness. For that reason, I recommend it as glimpse of a bygone era, and to experience Ingrid Bergman at a high point in her career.</fullReview>

Now, for that Ski scene...it was so badly photographed with her suspecting glances at Peck as they supposedly going at fast speed. Nothing was ever mentioned in their previous skiing experiences.

		<fullReview>"Spellbound" explores the mystery of Dr. Anthony Edwardes (Gregory Peck) and his relationship with more than colleague-related friend Dr. Constance Petersen (Ingrid Bergman). When discovered as an impostor and an amnesia victim, a chase ensues and only Constance can prove both his innocence and regain his memory. This film appears like a Hitchcock film; a case of mysterious identity, plot twists, and developed characters. However, it does not feel like one. A lot of this is due to the visual style. The venetian blinds, unique lighting, foreboding music, and even the bizarre visual imagery poses as film noir. This does give the movie some advantages, but it does not have the energy to keep it going.A great thriller relies on thrills, suspense, action, and mostly a great, interesting plot. "Spellbound" lacks all of these ingredients. It feels more like a drawn out drama rather than psychologically thriller that it has been often considered. After awhile, it becomes dull with Peck's constant fainting and overly sentimental music. "Spellbound" is an okay film, but to call it one of Hitchcock's best is far from the truth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock examines the mind; with mixed results.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The secrets of who you are and what has made you run away from yourself - all these secrets are buried in your brain. But, you don't want to look at them." &nbsp; Spellbound reminds me of Marnie in a lot of ways, which is not necessarily a good thing. Both movies deal with repressed memories, emotional trauma, and complicated relationships between the afflicted, and the person attempting to help them. Both movies also share an inability to keep my interest for the entire running time. &nbsp;Unlike Marnie, the gender roles are reversed in Spellbound. Ingrid Bergman plays Dr. Constance Peterson, a psychoanalyst who ends up going on the run with an amnesiac (Gregory Peck) who may have killed a man and stolen his identity. And, she also happens to be in love with him. I watched Spellbound hoping for another brilliant Bergman performance, as she gave in Notorious. But here, she's trapped in a character that is dull and frumpy for most of the movie. I genuinely hope that those glasses that she wore were burned after Spellbound was completed, because anything that can make a beautiful woman look that ugly,&nbsp;needs to burn.&nbsp;I just didn't find the first 2/3's of Spellbound to be very compelling. The sporadic (and not very successful) attempts at clever and light-hearted dialogue clashed with the tone of the movie, the plot moved in jerks and fits, and I couldn't bring myself to sympathize with Peck's character, or even care what ultimately happens to him.The dream sequences were pretty cool and surreal, but we only get a disappointingly brief taste of them. Between this and Marnie, it's clear that psychoanalysis and Hitchcock do not make for a combination that I enjoy much. I will acknowledge that the final twenty minutes are a great improvement over the rest of the film, but that only raises my opinion somewhat. Spellbound avoids Marnie's level of mediocrity, but it's still a long way down from my favorite Hitchcock movies.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who really needs mental help? The doctor or the patient?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to Hitchcock, the psychiatric doctors who analyze those who lay on couches are sometimes the nuttier of the two, OR equally as troubled. Whether or not this is true, God only knows. But for repressed psychiatrist Ingrid Bergman, the minute she meets new head psych Gregory Peck, the sparks begin to fly. Once she finds out he has troubles of his own, her psychiatric abilities go into overtime, making her his lover, mentor, and somewhat motherly in this outstanding psychological thriller. It is as soon as they see each other the sparks fly, and within minutes, his psychological issues are revealed for his colleagues and the audience to observe. It's apparent that he's possibly as psychotic as the female patient who declares her hatred for men to Bergman, then flirting with one while scratching their arms with her cat-like nails.Peck immediately displays a hatred to the color white and anything with straight line patterns. It's soon revealed, of course, that he isn't the doctor, but a victim of amnesia who may or may not have killed the real head shrink. Before she can even pack, Bergman goes off on the lamb to help him, which instantly allerts the police to her involvement with him. They elude the police at both Penn Station and Grand Central, and end up at Bergman's mentor's home, where the mystery begins to unfold. A very graphic flashback of Peck's childhood reveals the initial reason for his psychosis, and after very soon, it becomes very clear to Bergman whom the real villain is. Michael Chekhov plays Bergman's mentor, who happened to know the real head shrink, while Leo G. Carroll is the psychiatrist he is replacing. Peck and Bergman are an outstanding pair; I don't know if I'd want someone so quietly troubled as Bergman to analyze me, but for shear performances, this is film acting at its best, with two then captivatingly beautiful people at their height.The finale is as gripping as anything Hitchcock has ever done, with a huge surprise twist that comes totally out of nowhere but makes perfect sense. One of the great things in Hitchcock's films is that his writers didn't write for movie characters-they wrote for real people. The characters in these movies don't talk in those polite classic terms that dominated 95 percent of the movies of this era. They are often confused and awkward in their verbal revelation of their thoughts, just like human beings many times are. There's no predictability in the way the characters communicate. While psychiatry has come along way since 1945, it still gives thought to the wonderment if analysis always works for everybody, and if any human being can really fully understand how the human mind works or if it can ever be totally cured. And with new neurosis being discovered since then (most notably Bi-Polarism), I'll give credit to the person who said they never trust anybody who claims to be sane. So if you want to really dig into your own analysis of the psychiatric profession and the human mind, watch this movie with someone whose opinion on the same subject you are interested in, then discuss. This is one of those rare movies that really can send your brain to work, yet have a lot of fun with at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitchcock's 'pieces of a puzzle' movie is very similar to "Vertigo" in that its narrative is gradually slotted together until the end picture is complete.Gregory Peck is admirable as John Brown, the doctor suffering from amnesia and a terrible guilt complex. Bergman though, as his psychoanalyst lover, is a little too dramatic in her role, as is the music and the mood.Unlike "Vertigo", "Spellbound" suffers not from over length or poor editing, but from disjointedness, as the plot unsatisfactorily unfolds itself in fits and starts.Still an entertainment due to the clever story and Salvador Dali's wonderful dream imagery, but perhaps not the master's forte, and certainly not one of his finest. Spoilt by overdone drama and romance.Sunday, August 1, 1993 - T.V.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILER ALERT** Very dated but still interesting psychological mystery/drama about a man who completely lost it, his memory, and assumed another mans identity who we later get to learn, when he gets his memory back, was murdered in what was thought at first to be a skiing accident. Dr. Tony Edwards, Gregory Peck, is the darling of the tight knit and very exclusive psychoanalysis community and is due to replace one of the most eminent pioneer in psychoanalysis, who studied with the great man of modern psychology Freud himself, Dr. Murchison ,Leo G. Carroll.Showing up at the Green Manson Sanitarium to take over the job as its #1 head-shrinker Dr. Edwards surprises everyone there in how young he looks. That also the fact that he amassed a body of work on psychology, mostly specializing in the complexities and labyrinth of the guilt complex, that would have taken at least twenty years to complete. Edwards looks like he's old enough to have just completed high school.It later turns out that Dr. Edwards is not only an impostor but a mental case himself. He always freaks out every time he sees something as harmless as a white napkin, with fork lines on it, or a pin-strip shirt or coat. Before you know it Dr. Edwards suddenly takes off, in the dead of night, for New York City where It later comes out all his psychological problems began. During his short stay, which lasted just about a day, at Green Manors the very cute and adorable as well as sensitive Dr. Edwards, or whoever he really is, got both psychologically as well as romantically involved with the ice cold psychoanalysts Dr. Constance Peterson, Ingrid Bergman. Who after reading a note that he left her followed him down, from rural Vermont, to the Big Apple in order to get to the bottom of his fears and apprehensions about anything white, with track marks on it. Dr. Peterson also wants to rekindle her hot as a pistol relationship with the cute Dr. Edwards or whoever he really is. Constance finds out that the so-called Dr. Edwards, when she finally finds him, is in fact someone else who turns out to be a mentally disturbed GI. Who was suffering from a case of server shell-shock and was in fact seeing the real Dr. Edwards in order to get help.Hiding whoever he, Dr. Edwards, is out at her former collage professor's Dr. Brulov, Michael Checkov, home in upstate New York Constance has Brulov help her get, whoever the hell he is, his memory back. It turns out that the tall dark and mysterious stranger is a John Ballintine who indeed, like Constance suspected, was being treated by Dr. Edwards! Putting Ballintine under hypnosis he reveals, in a spaced out Salvador Dali dream sequence, what turned his weak and guilt-ridden brain almost into mush from what he went through. Not only with his relations with Dr. Edwards but also his kid brother whom he accidentally killed and held himself responsible, even though he was completely cleared of it, for it ever since.Interpreting Ballintines far out dream it comes out that Dr. Edwards was actually killed in a skiing accident when he went out on the slops with Ballintine, this seemed to have been part of Dr. Edwards treatment of his psychosis, which is the reason for Ballintines many unexplained freak-outs. The big shocker to all this is that it's later found out at Dr. Edwards autopsy is that he was shot in the back before he fell some 500 feet, off the slopes, to his death! Could Ballintine be the man who shot him!The ending was a bit too unbelievable and was obviously it's screen writers, Ben Hecht, attempt to smooth everything out. The totally mind bending final tries to get the guilty party to not only to admit, thus clearing Ballintine, his crime. There's also the fact that the state has an almost impossible case against him with the only evidence, the murder weapon, that can convict him in the killers hands and him having no trouble at all in disposing it. Were then startled to see the killer suddenly gets a glint of conscience, or guilt feeling,and then mindlessly turns his gun on himself and blowing his brains out! With that the movie "Spellbound" has a what can be called a happy but not too convincing ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This really could go either way. I'm being lenient I think to many people by giving this an eight, and I completely understand the people that tear it to shreds. But I have a soft spot saved for Hitchcock's 'Spellbound', as I do for all of his pictures. There is always SOMETHING, if the actor is miscast, maybe the script will make up for it, if the picture is dull, perhaps the cinematography is great, if all else fails there will no doubt be some clever editing to help you through it. Hitchcock always tried to cover every open door by letting the audience know that no matter what, what you are watching is a Hitchcock picture. In this case, the film is worth watching for the production design and the extended dream sequences created by Salvador Dali, however lacks in story line and Gregory Peck was , in my opinion, terribly miscast. Even Ingrid Bergman, who is rarely in a film that is below her, gives a laughable performance, literally, like when Peck asks nonchalantly before a picnic, 'what's for lunch?' and she responds, beaming, 'Liverwurst!' then fades to black. I could never tell if this was meant to be funny or not, but it certainly brings a lot of laughs in a film that is supposed to be taken seriously. Still, it is very interesting for it's technical achievements, and camera-work, and for Dali's contribution which was almost novelty but quite surreal unlike anything else found in a Hitchcock film.</fullReview>

Ingrid Bergman is a delight as always, she never gave a bad performance, but Gregory Peck was probably not the best choice to play John Ballantine. A fine actor, yes. Mr. Excitement, no! Unlike the well paced Notorious, Spellbound at times almost grinds to a dead halt. Toss out the childish psychological mumbo jumbo, and you still have a good film worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bergman shows how to outwit the hotel detective.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Early American Hitchcock, this film uses two of the most notable features of mid-40s Hollywood: psychiatrists and background music. The film is now outmoded, being more of a curio than entertainment and offers little for the student of the cinema. It is also flawed by being two long (just nine minutes short of two hours), having an, at times, transparent plot and an unconvincing skiing sequence in which one gets the impression of the two Stars siting in front of giant fans blowing their hair into wild disorder. Somehow Hitch seemed at times content with the technically incompetent, as in the ludicrous backdrops of his 1964 'Marnie'. But why; does it hark back to his days when British studios were financially impoverished? In the 1940s any film with psychiatry as a theme was a sure winner, another one was the Bette Davis, Paul Henreid classic 'Now Voyager' with trick cyclist Claude Rains. Both films were widely acclaimed in their day but sadly Spellbound has not stood the test of time. The characterisation of Bergman's former professor of psychiatry as a small bearded and bespectacled man with a high pitched German accent is now seen as over the top but passed muster then. In the development of the cinema soundtrack, background music had, by the mid-1940s, come to be regarded as of major importance by producers but in this film it overwhelms to the point of distraction: obviously outstandingly successful by contemporary standards as it won an Oscar. For me the best scene is one of the byways of the film in which the hotel detective tries to chat up Ingrid Bergman but she uses her female wiles, leading him on to commit the indiscretion of disclosing a guest's room number (Gregory Peck, of course). Ingrid throughout most of this film plays the psychiatrist part with typical Swedish reserve approaching aloofness but in this couple of minutes the genius of Hitchcock succeeds in showing us another Bergman - the comedienne. As she coyly but, at the same time flirtatiously, leads the detective into believing that she is a school teacher and marvels at his prowess in using psychiatry to weigh up suspicious characters, Hitch gives us an hilarious moment of pure comedy. OK for whiling away a rainy afternoon but not much else, unless you are an hotel detective fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SLIGHT SPOILERS!!Obviously, in 1945 the notion of seeing a psychiatrist was a far cry from how common it is today. Still under intense scrutiny in the states, this decidedly unamusing psychiatric practice serves as a backdrop to the suspense and romance of Spellbound. Having eagerly awaited the newest addition to the psychiatric staff of Vermont's Green Manors Sanitarium, veteran 'shrinks' Dr. Murchison (Leo G. Carroll) and in particular Dr. Constance Peterson (Ingrid Bergman) are delighted with charming Dr. Edwards (Gregory Peck) who has arrived to become the chief of staff. Murchison and the other male doctors seem impressed with Edward's ability and Peterson seems impressed with Edward's handsome good looks. Soon the hard nosed and somewhat repressed Dr. Peterson (auburn haired siren Ingrid Bergman) is head over heels for her new boss, Edwards.As Dr. Peterson lets her hair down and becomes romantically involved with Edwards, she begins to notice that all is not what it seems with him.. Seems that Edwards, her boss/beau, has lost bits of his memory, including the details of the murder he might have committed! When Edward's identity comes known to the authorities he flees, followed by the lovesick Dr. Peterson, devoted to helping him remember and hoping to prove her spellbound lover innocent. A wild chase ensues from city to mountain-top. Detectives and psychiatrists abound, hunting down Edwards and trying to find out who the mysterious 'JB' is.In his late 1960's interview with Francios Truffaut, Hitchcock notes that there are problems with Spellbound and that parts of it do not work to his liking. To some degree he is right - the film feels a tad too long and there's perhaps too much 'psychobabble'. To a larger degree there's plenty to enjoy about this sordid romantic nightmare and Ingrid Bergman is terrific as the lonely woman in a 'male' profession. Gregory Peck, while suitably clean-cut isn't the best choice but he certainly makes Edward's sympathetic. Always solid Leo G. Carroll has a great time with the stuffy Dr. Murchison and Micheal Checkov as Peterson's former nutty professor nearly steals the show.Spellbound seems to be best know for the beautiful dream sequence designed for Hitchcock by surrealist Salvador Dali. There's no mistaking the work of the master Dali and the sequence is totally unique. Hitchcock wanted to avoid the standard use of the out of focus shots and dissolves to obtain a 'dream-like' state for the dream scene. After studying Dali's work - full of light and a sense of the absurd Hitchcock was thrilled that Dali agreed to the project. In addition to the dream sequence, there's lots to be said for the unfolding of the intricate mystery involving JB and Edwards which we as the audience figure out before Dr. Peterson. It is precisely that knowledge that makes the last act so suspenseful. Will our heroine figure out the puzzle before she's put into grave danger? While it's a minor Hitchcock film, it's certainly pleasurable to watch with plenty of fun twists. Look for the wonderful (if not totally over the top) kiss sequence where 7 doors are thrown open as a LOUD form of symbolism!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw Spellbound and came away incredibly impressed!First of all, the collection of talent here, with Ingrid Bergman, Gregory Peck and Alfred Hitchcock doing a movie that features a dreamscape based off the work of Salvador Dali, that's just amazing...Hitchcock's direction is absolutely spectacular, what with the camera shots from behind the milk glass and handgun. The use of light and dark, especially in a B+W movie that focuses on the main character's fear of white, is phenomenal. Hitchcock has rarely directed a finer movie, with possible exceptions being PSYCHO and REAR WINDOW. Hitch definitely deserved the Academy Award he was nominated for.Bergman is as stunningly beautiful as ever, and Peck plays his role as the psychotic lover perfectly. Not only is the acting fantastic, but the plot is extraordinary, full of the typical Hitchcockian twists. Add to that the stunning backgrounds provided by Salvador Dali as we venture into Peck's character's mind, and you have here a movie that is certainly in Hitchcock's top 3, and in the movie world's top 20.10 of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to give 'Spellbound' a mixed review.Psychoanalysis was becoming popular in the post-war years of the '40s and one of its most active participants was David O. Selznick himself who was then undergoing emotional turmoil over switching his affections from his wife (Irene Selznick) to Jennifer Jones, whom he later married. As producer of 'Spellbound', he worked with Hitchcock to produce this absorbing story.He even engaged Salvador Dali to design a dream sequence--much of which was cut and only a fragment of which remains in the finished movie. But for all his good intentions, he made a couple of fatal mistakes. Gregory Peck, then at the peak of popularity as a matinee idol, was the wrong actor to play the amnesiac. Peck himself has admitted he could have used some prompting from Hitch to get inside the character. Joseph Cotten would have been a better choice since he specialized in playing tormented leads and would have done a workmanlike job. Peck undoubtedly did not receive the attention Hitch gave to Bergman.The other fatal mistake was the simplistic theory behind Peck's mental illness--it stretches credibility to the limits and furnishes an explanation that bears little scrutiny. The climactic scene on a ski slope is almost laughable in its absurdity.And yet--despite these flaws, 'Spellbound' is an absorbing and unusual blend of psychiatry and romance. Ingrid Bergman is luminous as the straight-laced psychiatrist--but again, her willingness to toss all doubts aside and trust Peck enough to clear his name is not entirely believable.But--as I started to say--despite its weaknesses, the film is quite absorbing and keeps you wondering just how the all the pieces of the puzzle will fit together. See it for entertainment, but don't expect to find the psychological explanations anything but simplistic. Indeed, they are totally unsatisfactory. Peck and Bergman were at their physical peak and make a handsome couple.Miklos Rozsa deserves all the credit he received for his Oscar-winning score, eerily reminiscent (in places) of his music for 'The Lost Weekend'. As usual, it gives added distinction to a psychological melodrama that never reaches its full potential.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are many things about this film which are silly. The character Dr Petersen on being told that one of her mental patients tried to murder one of her colleagues and cut his own throat says bathetically, "Is it bad?" (!!!) and a newspaper headline saying in practical summary of the plot, 'Police Hunt Dr Petersen Believed Aiding Madman Wanted in Edwardes Mystery' and of course the totally beautiful Ingrid Bergman as an unlikely psychotherapist. (Mind you the house detective of the hotel in which she is looking for the hero tags her as a librarian! I wish...). And Gregory Peck seeming much too young to be a distinguished psychiatrist.Yet like a lot of Hitchcock films one can't keep from watching. The theme of whiteness is visually strong and the Dali inspired dream sequence is eye catching. Many of the supporting actors like in many of the Hitchcock's films are perfect, visually and orally. Leo G Carroll is probably best known for 'The Man from Uncle' unfortunately but here as in other films he brings real class with an inimitable voice and delivery.Perhaps Bergman and Peck aren't suitable for the roles and the music score over emphatic but the film has lots of the director's unique touches and the photography by George Barnes, especially in the clinic scenes, is masterly. There was no one like Hitchcock certainly and though not one of his best films there is enough going on to keep one interested.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not having seen this film in years, I decided to watch it again, and frankly, after seeing it, another time, I wonder what made me go back to it. I saw it in DVD format that looked great because of the way it has been preserved.Most of the plot seems ridiculous by today's standards. The mere idea that the new director for the clinic is young Dr. Edwards, who falls in love after the second encounter with a staff member seems preposterous. Even a great director like Alfred Hitchcock could not overcome the problems presented by a silly screen play of this movie.Maybe the Dali dream sequence might have been ahead of its time, but seeing it today, it just doesn't add anything to the story. Sure, it's a nice diversion, but that's about it. There are many holes in the plot that perhaps went unnoticed when the film came out in 1945, but since a great deal of the US population has had, at one time, or another, a brush with either a psychiatrist, or an analyst, it might not present a problem for the viewer, as amnesia is the staple of most soap operas.The skiing scenes are plain laughable, even for the time when the film was new. We cannot believe this couple walked to the top of the mountain in those pre ski lift days, in their street shoes and no overcoats. It must have been freezing in that mountain!!! Oh well, if we accept that, then everything else it possible."Spellbound", without the luminous presence of Ingrid Bergman, would have been long forgotten, right after it opened. Gregory Peck, for some reason, doesn't have the charisma that was his trade mark in later years. Perhaps the actor did not trust the director, or maybe Hitchcock's guidance to Mr. Peck was not clear.In the end, the film holds one's interest but in the final analysis, when we think about details that don't make sense, that's when we realize we've been had.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>flawed psychological thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Freud had only recently passed from the scene when this film was made, and the plot is evidence of the rather simplistic popular understanding of the early psychoanalysis. It now seems hopelessly naive to assume that merely uncovering the demons of one's past will effectively erase the emotional pain they have produced and thereby "cure" the patient. Yet this is the premiss of the film.The plot looks both backward and forward in Hitchcock's development as a director. Backward: to his favourite 1930s plotline, as found in "The 39 Steps" and "Young and Innocent", of a man fleeing the law and attempting to clear his name of a crime he did not commit. Forward: to the likes of "Psycho" and "Marnie" in the 1960s, where the mystery revolves around uncovering the psychological motivations of a person's actions. Was this the first of Hitch's psychological thrillers? It may well have been.In this case Peck plays the recently arrived director of a hospital for the mentally ill, who doesn't quite know what he's supposed to know to perform his new role. It soon becomes clear he is not the man he claims to be. In the meantime, of course, the previously dedicated and workaholic Bergman is uncharacteristically smitten with him and, like Nova Pilbeam in "Young and Innocent", runs off with him to help him clear both his name and his head. If there is any suspense in this film, it is found in Bergman risking her career to help a man who she thinks is probably not a criminal but cannot be absolutely certain of it. The plotline is, of course, utterly ridiculous, without the slightest hint of credibility. But Bergman and Peck are sufficiently good actors to make it work.They are aided by the efforts of Salvador Dali, who put together the famous dream sequence, and of Miklós Rózsa, who composed a great score that is simultaneously romantic and eerie. Without these men's contribution, this film would likely be judged one of Hitch's lesser efforts.</fullReview>

They are as attractive as any film couple I've ever seen. Bergman is a psychiatrist and Peck the well-respected doctor who is the new boss at the clinic where Bergman works. He is troubled by strange dreams, which are presented in sequences designed by Salvador Dali.

		<shortDescription>Rather ironic that a film titled "Spellbound" doesn't keep me spellbound, isn't it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly expected to be a little spellbound by Alfred Hitchcock's 1945 mystery "Spellbound" given that they are some talented talents behind it. I mean this film's got stars Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck, and director Alfred Hitchcock behind it. Given that I have reasonably high expectations based on their work, I wanted to get into this film for the sake of those people involved. Unfortunately, such talented people as these can't save a disappointingly dull film such as "Spellbound". In the film, we follow a psychiatrist (Ingrid Bergman) at a mental hospital who is considered by her fellow doctors as one of the best. She and her fellow peers welcome the new director (Gregory Peck) of the hospital, but fairly soon, she begins to notice some peculiar aspects about him. She notices that he has a unusual fear of seeing dark parallel lines and a white background together. In addition, she eventually finds out that he isn't who he claims to be and that he has a serious case of amnesia. When she also learns that he accidentally committed a murder, she tries to cure him of his mental struggles by learning more about his past. I should mention the few aspects of this picture that I found were decent. One thing is that there are a few eye-catching shots that I thought were well executed. There's a shot in which is similar to the type of camera shots you see in today's first person shooter video games, where someone is pointing a gun at one of the main leads and we see through their point of view. I thought that shot and similar shots like that were worthy of praising. I also don't find the performances from the leads that bad and I thought they were doing whatever they could to keep the film moving. So what did I think made "Spellbound" as disappointing as I'm claiming it to be? Well, my problem with "Spellbound" can be summarized as such: it's boring beyond belief. Why do I find it boring? I thought the direction seemed to indicate that everything that was happening in the plot was not the slightest bit interesting. The screenplay by Ben Hecht didn't give its characters anything fascinating to talk about and hardly did anything to get us invested in following the plot. This film is basically trying to force us to avoid emotionally attaching to it as much as possible. What's worse is that it succeeds well at doing just that. About 10 to 20 minutes into watching this film, that's the point where I completely lost interest in following the narrative since it is told in such a lifeless manner between the boring conversations the characters have and the boring things that are being captured on film. I believe this is definitely one of Alfred Hitchcock's weakest films because of its lack of emotional involvement, because of its uninspiring direction, because of its lame script, and because of the fact that the story that was being told wasn't that good to begin with. Maybe I didn't pick up on something in the main plot, maybe I followed it just fine enough, either way I expected much more from the talents involved that what I got. Unless you're a hardcore Hitchcock fan and just want to look at it for the sake of seeing all his flicks, I'd definitely say there are much better Hitchcock films to check out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty dull Hitchcock outing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not one of my favourite Hitchcocks. This psychological drama draws on familiar territory for the director: it's about a supposedly wronged man, on the run for murder, the victim of a conspiracy that he must unravel before the police close the net. The twist is that the mystery lies inside his amnesic mind, and his new love interest must attempt to solve the clues and puzzle out the truth before it's too late.My main problem with this film is the story, or lack thereof. It's just too slender to sustain a feature-length production, and the denouement, when it comes, is largely routine (save for a shocking childhood flashback) and could have been explained a lot earlier. There are extraneous characters galore and long, drawn-out sequences where nothing much happens. I found Hitchcock's trademark tension to be thin on the ground, and I was expecting a lot more from the man who made the likes of FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT and NORTH BY NORTHWEST.On the plus side, the film boasts a central pair of good performances from both Gregory Peck and Ingrid Bergman, and a fine supporting turn for THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E.'s Leo G. Carroll. It's just a shame their talents couldn't have been put to use in a better production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too simplistic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Spellbound" is probably one of Hitchcock's most uneven films. It has some brilliant scenes (like the point-of-view shot near the end) that showcase Hitchcock's mastery and imagination, but it also has too many talky sequences and it takes too much time to reach its less-than-satisfying conclusion. Hitchcock relies heavily on psychological theories for his explanations, but I think that those explanations are far too simplistic. The "decoding" of the weird dream sequences is also too literal: every image has a definite and obvious meaning - does that ever happen in YOUR dreams? The low point is, for me, the explanation that the movie provides for the wheel's presence in the dream.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Clinic Full Of Doctors Who Smoke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since 1945, sweeping changes in psychotherapy and attitudes toward smoking have rendered this film terribly dated. Further, Gregory Peck's acting is mediocre, at best. And the film gets off to a slow, and weak, start. These none too trivial problems aside, "Spellbound" does, eventually, become an effective psycho-thriller, thanks to a strange premise and a jarring end.The story centers on the character Peck plays, and his past behavior. Is he innocent or guilty? Is he Jekyll or Hyde? Sometimes he seems like one, sometimes the other. The music affirms this psychological tug of war, as it swings from cold and creepy when Peck's character seems villainous, to warm and romantic when he seems victimized. Which should we trust: our heart's intuition that he's innocent, or our brain's logic that tells us he's guilty? Back and forth we go. Hitchcock teases us. The mystery is solved at the film's end, which is both effective and unique.If I had been Hitchcock, I would have dumped the film's corny prologue, and replaced it with a slightly altered version of the final dramatic scene. Everything would be deliberately out of focus except the object in the hand. With that powerful opening gambit, I would then have told the entire story in flashbacks, from the viewpoint of Gregory Peck's character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dali Scene Cool; Rest Is So-So</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film centered around psychology and the interpretation of dreams. One very neat scene shows a short dream sequence a la Salvador Dali and one of his wild paintings. I wish the rest of the film was as cool as that, although I usually enjoy looking at Ingrid Bergman's face, too. She's very pretty in here: a real pleasure to this male's eye. I also enjoyed listening to the older psychiatrist in this film played by Michael Chekov. I liked the fact he said he was from Rochester, New York, which is only about 50 miles from where I live.Otherwise, it had a bunch of typical Alfred Hitchcock traits such as very little action; an innocent man being framed, God never being a solution to anything - complete secular viewpoints about everything.Overall, I thought the movie was "fair" but not a "keeper" because stories in which nice people are slowly driven insane do not appeal to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Hitchcock Home Run</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's Spellbound is as suspenseful as his other suspense classics for example Dial M for Murder, Rear Window, Vertigo,and not so much with The Birds,and North by Northwest. The movie stars Ingrid Bergman as a doctor who tries to protect an amnesia patient (played by Gregory Peck) who is accused of murder while she is attempting to recover his memory. This was one of Hitchcock's greatest movies because he used his very own famous suspenseful directorial style and a always makes his actors give top notch performances (just like Bergmanand Peck gave in this movie). The movie was worth it's running time because not only Hitchcock likes to make two hour movies it is also that he doesn't waste your time when you watch one of his movies, it is that he makes his audiences suffer through his movies. The other reason why i really enjoyed this movie is because that Hitchcock really showed how much of a suspense master he really is and that no one will ever replace him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spellbound: One heck of a solid picture, but unfortunately, Spellbound only sets its sights in the middle of my radar and never reaches for anything higher. It's satisfied with being satisfactory. Bergman is dependable with her acting here, but Gregory Peck is the real star in my opinion. It's either a hit or miss performance; for me, he gave an arresting performance. Michael Chekhov is lively in his supporting role, too. Hitchcock doesn't attack the material, almost like his focus wasn't there the entire time, but he doesn't do anything wrong. The film's strongest area is the score; the dramatic music echoes the motivations of the characters. The twisty ending is a nice way to conclude the picture. Spellbound is good, but no where near great. It's uncanny to me that Hitchcock was nominated for his work here, but not for Vertigo, The Birds, or any other wonderful work.

		<shortDescription>Spellbound vs. Mirage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Mirage" on television shortly after its theatrical release (1965) and I never quite forgot it, especially the part about the stairs that lead to nowhere, and the dream scene where the two men are standing under the tree on the lawn. My earliest recollection of seeing "Spellbound" was a decade or two later. Both movies feature Gregory Peck in the role of an amnesiac that may have committed a murder, and even though I was greatly intrigued by the similarity, I was keenly aware of the fact that it was not the same movie that I remembered from the '60s. These two movies are each intriguing in their own right, and the unlikely similarity between them only adds to that intrigue. Eventually I saw "Mirage" again just a couple of years after seeing "Spellbound", and I was glad at having finally untangled these two movies in my mind.Another similarity shared by these two movies is that in both movies, the character played by Gregory Peck is befriended by a charming young woman, played by Ingrid Bergman in "Spellbound" and by Diane Baker in "Mirage". Both movies also incorporate the use of surreal dream sequences. "Spellbound" is of course noted for its use of dream sequences that were created by Salvidor Dali."Spellbound" has the feel of a Hitchcock movie from an earlier era, whereas "Mirage" has the feel of a movie made in the middle '60s, and one that could have been made by Hitchcock at that later date. They are both good movies, but personally I prefer "Mirage", and I think that "Spellbound" would be largely forgotten were it not for the inclusion of the Dali dream sequences and for the fact that Hitchcock directed it. The dream sequences in "Spellbound" are far more surreal than the dream sequences in "Mirage", and they are brought to consciousness through psychoanalysis. In "Mirage" the plot is more intricate (which is to be expected of a movie that was made in the '60s as compared to one made in the '40s) and the dream sequences, which occur as spontaneous flashbacks, are more involved with the unfolding of that more intricate plot. In "Mirage", the character makes a couple of hasty visits to a psychiatrist while trying to understand what is going on with his mind, and it is during the first such visit that he comes to grips with the fact that he is suffering from amnesia. The psychiatrist helps him to understand what is going on with his mind, but there is no psychoanalysis. Interestingly, whereas psychiatry is treated with due respect in the movie made in the '40s, the psychiatrist is practically made fun of in the movie made in the '60s.Both movies are certainly entertaining to watch, and anyone who has found either of these two movies enjoyable will almost certainly enjoy the other one as well. You may also derive some satisfaction from the untangling of your memories of these two uncannily similar movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technical Hitch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally I've always found Hitchcock to be vastly overrated which is not, of course, the same as saying he made bad films so much as the competent films he did make have been inflated out of proportion by academics and film snobs. That said this is a fairly reasonable entry that still works on an Entertainment level 60 years on. I doubt however that even 60 years ago the regular film-goer would have accepted the handsome, clean-cut Gregory Peck as a murderer or even, come to that, Ingrid Bergman as a psychiatrist. I think that like a modern audience they would have realized almost at once that Peck had either been 'framed' for the alleged murder or else there would turn out to be an equally plausible explanation. It's easy to detect what have been described as Hitchcock 'touches'; holed up with Bergman in the Rochester house of her mentor Peck has one of his 'turns' and goes downstairs clutching a straight razor, the elderly mentor is in his study enjoying some late night cookies and milk. He offers Peack a glass of the same cue Close Up of the razor in Peck's hand. Dissolve to: Bergman waking, realizing Peck is missing, panicking and rushing downstairs to find elderly mentor slumped in chair and no sign of Peck. Okay it has its moments but don't tell me that YOU believed for one moment that Peck had killed the mentor. How right you were. Mentor is only sleeping and confides to Bergman he knew from the start that Peck was ill, clocked the razor in his hand and slipped him a bromide in the milk. This is the kind of film that Hitch made again and again; innocent man is somehow implicated in a murder and is obliged to go on the run either with or will soon meet a beautiful girl to accompany him and help him - see The 39 Steps, North By North-West etc. I don't suppose there's too much wrong with repeating yourself especially if you do it with charismatic stars and Peck and Bergman would be hard to beat in that category. Of course you have to gloss over the fact that Bergman's psychiatrist would not logically fall in love at first sight with someone clearly disturbed who is quickly revealed to be an impostor and perhaps even a murderer and would be even less unprofessional as to abandon her patients in the clinic in which she works and lives to (a) find Peck who has fled to New York and (b) go on the run with him. If you can suspend your disbelief in respect of these points then there is much to enjoy here not least the dramatic score by Miklos Rosza and the surreal dream sequence designed by Salvador Dali.</fullReview>

It is also the only film that called upon the talents of Miklos Rosza (The Lost Weekend), as well as Salvador Dali for the visual look of the film. Apart from these extras, the film in itself was not a Hitchcock or a Selznick film. It was probably more a Gregory Peck film (if you are a Gregory Peck fan) as it is the first commercial film that Peck appears in to lift his career. His association with Hitchcock could only advance his career rather than Hitchcock's and Selznick's, and for this reason it should be a part of the Gregory Peck cannon rather than the Hitchcock cannon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite spellbinding...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film deals with psychology and `psychoanalysis'. Ingrid Bergman plays a promising young psychologist, Dr. Peterson, who believes she can help Mr. Ballantine (Gregory Peck) who is at first believed to be the head of their psychological clinic. However we soon realize that he is a troubled man in no way qualified to head a psychological clinic. He is terrified by black and white stripes. He responds fearfully towards white. The physicians realize that he is not the new head of their clinic, but Dr. Peterson has befriended him and believes she can get to the reason for his amnesia and lack of knowledge about himself or his past. He has been calling himself Mr. Ballantine but as his fellow physicians realize he isn't, he absconds and is pursued, first of all by Bergman in order to help him, and then by the authorities. She quite capably outwits a hotel security chief in order to track Ballantine to his hotel room and then is able to escape with him to the mountains of New England where they stay at the home of her mentor, Dr. Chekhov (Dr. Alex Brulov). It is there that he gets to the heart of what is bothering him. The doctors prod him into revealing dreams which they interpret. They try to provoke him to remember the last time he saw Mr. Ballantine. By recalling this ending and through interpreting his dreams, the doctors are able to re-construct his last days with the doctor. In this way, they are also able to determine what happened to the real Dr. Ballantine. When they are able to do this, his memory returns to him. The performances are uniformly excellent. Brulov is feisty and edgy. Bergman infuses her character with restraint and excellent judgment. She is very sympathetic towards the man, but also knows when to push him in order to prompt a memory. She obviously loves him, but it does not interfere with her professionalism. Peck is excellent as a man confused by his amnesia. He can't understand what has happened to him and is scared by his potential for violence. Peck also plays second fiddle to a very confident Bergman. He is quite brave to accept a role that does not portray him as confident or admirable. The music is terrific. It really adds to the suspense by signaling the onset of tense scenes and by rather staccato and sharp chords. Hitchcock's direction is excellent. Some of the camera work is tremendous, particularly a first person of Ballantine getting upset. Hitchcock knows we are more scared of what we don't see and we recognize that through his decision not to show too much. He simply tells a story and lets the chips fall where they may. One particularly scary shot is when it appears as though Ballantine will kill Peterson's mentor. He doesn't, but it appears inevitable and one sees how easily Hitchcock can ratchet up the tension. The ending is terrific. There are several plot twists that we don't see coming and yet are quite believable. Hitchcock always allows his viewers to be scared by not telling them things, rather than overloading them with sensory stimuli.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this isn't one of Hitchcock's best films, it is still great and has many great elements. It drags a little during the first half but as Bergman hopelessly falls for criminal Peck, the story gains momentum.The plot relies on the audience suspending its disbelief significantly. Most of the unraveling of the movie's mystery is due to Freudian analysis. Although very intriguing, it is not very plausible that John Ballantine (Gregory Peck) would remember an entire dream which could then be so intricately explained... almost flawlessly by psychoanalyst Bergman. Still, the story is captivating and the dialogue is well written.The score, by Hungarian composer Miklos Rozsa is definitely one of the best of the 40's and was obviously an influence for Bernard Hermann's scores.The acting is superb by all, especially by character actor Leo G. Caroll and the gorgeous Ingrid Bergman. It's not surprising that Hitch decided to use her again as the trashy alcoholic in "Notorious" the next year.And of course, there are the Hitchcock touches... the use of color for a few frames, the kissing/door-opening sequence (you'll understand when you watch it), etc.Overall, a very good film. *** 1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

It was said that Hitch wasn't happy with Peck's performance, but it seemed to me that the only people he did like were Stewart, Grant, Bergman, and Kelly, and that was it - maybe Leo G. Carroll, who BTW gives a fine performance as Dr. Murchison. Keep an eye on his cameo--it is one of his longer ones(40 minutes into the movie) as well as for Norman Lloyd who was also the villain in Saboteur and would be one of the most important people to Hitch when it came to his TV show. It is hard for me to believe that this would be the same guy that played the strict schoolmaster, Mr. Nolan in Dead Poets Society. This movie is a must see for any Hitchcock fan.</fullReview>

An hour and fifty minutes to unravel a small plot without too many twists and turns is even too long in today's movies. Acting: Great performance by Bergman. Awful by Peck. I still believe that he couldn't act his way out of a paper bag, and this one puts the nails in the coffin. Watch the acting at the moment of revelation. It just bites. He was the wrong person for any role, nevertheless this one. Story: Decent story. Mix of "Vertigo" and a straight murder mystery. Not too much substance, and it tries to use to much psycho-babble. It takes forever to get the plot off the ground. The mystery starts about half-hour in. Then all of the discoveries are saved for the last half-hour.Direction: It's Hitchcock. Although not great hitchcock, his shots are great. I like his effect of tinting a couple frames red of gunshot, and looking through camera down gun. His use of Dali's storyboards work wonders, if you like Dali. Strange and hypnotic direction. That is why i almost slept.Overall, this is a boring, and overrated movie. About the only thing worth seeing it for is the humor during the revelation (I was laughing my a** off), and the Dali sequence. Some people even hate that sequence. I can't recommend this movie to anybody. See one of Hitch's older or newer movies, not this one.---3</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stark Staring Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the Hitchcock film with the famous dream sequence designed by Salvador Dali, which is one of the great epiphanies of art direction in the history of Hollywood. The dream sequence portrays a complex dream recounted by Gregory Peck, which turns out to contain the clues needed to unravel a murder mystery. Naturally, Dali not only has lots of eyes painted on cloth, but he has scissors cutting through one, reminiscent of the famous shot in UN CHIEN ANDALOU where he slices an eyeball (a sheep's, I believe) with a razorblade. The distorted wheel symbolizes a revolver, the man with his face wrapped in white cloth like a mummy is the mysterious murderer, winning at '21' and playing at cards with the seven of clubs is Peck's unconscious trying to remind him that he had lunch at the exclusive 21 Club in Manhattan with someone sinister. (Alas! Anyone can go in there now! Exclusive clubs are not the same when they stop shutting people out, and even Groucho Marx who didn't want to join a club which would accept him as a member need feel no qualms now if he were still around.) The film contains another one of those rapturous performances by Ingrid Bergman as the woman who is hopelessly in love. She really was the best at that, and for her romance was everything, and there was rarely any suggestion of sex. Since all women are romantics, Ingrid Bergman was immensely popular with women, especially all women in the heartland of America. I never met a woman who didn't admire Ingrid Bergman. She was no threat to them, she never made them feel inadequate, because she was always so hopelessly and so romantically in love all the time rather than just looking sexy, and she was saying all those things on the screen that they all so longed to say, if they could only find Mr. Right, and it was OK that Ingrid Bergman often found Mr. Right because everybody knew she also often lost him (as in CASABLANCA), so she verified the popular view that you win some and you lose some, which makes people feel better, because they usually lose. Here Ingrid's eyes shine as brightly as ever, and she soars on high, and it is all very fascinating and delightful watching her do it. It is not difficult to believe either, because in this film she is swooning over the amazingly handsome Gregory Peck at his peak. (That's pretty good, 'Peck's peak', I must remember it.) He was really good at looking hypnotised and starey-eyed. He was always the finest actor for amnesia films, his next best after this one being the wonderful MIRAGE (1965) with Diane Baker, which I have watched many times. Here we have Hitchcock pulling out all the stops in every way, and he was never a one not to pull out a stop. The most inspired scene in the film is when Gregory Peck and Ingrid fall into each other's arms in an ecstasy of love and we cut to a shot of a door opening on its own, then another door further down a revealed corridor opening on its own, then another, and then another. Well, it is not corny, it works, and good old Hitch! I hadn't seen this film in so long I had forgotten that. The story is based upon the 'dissociated fugue state with amnesia' theme. (See my reviews of HOME AT SEVEN and I LOVE YOU AGAIN for the psychological background.) These things really happen sometimes, believe me. Here we have a traumatised amnesia victim with a guilt complex who goes into spontaneous trances with his eyes open ('spellbound'), pretty good Hitchcock stuff! Did he really murder Dr. Edwardes whom he impersonated? Is he a dangerous killer, or is he a dangerous person who thinks he is a killer, or is he not a killer and not even a dangerous person, just someone who stares into space and carries a razor around in his hand to frighten people? He and Ingrid go on the run to try to clear him. He thinks he is guilty of killing someone but her heart tells her he is not because she could never love a man who was a killer. They visit her old mentor Alex, played brilliantly by Michael Chekhov, the nephew of Anton Chekhov the playwright and former husband of the amazing actress Olga Chekhova (or Tschechowa), and his wryly endearing and teasing humour towards Ingrid works perfectly. A lot of this in the hands of an inferior director would turn to mush. But with Hitchcock, it soars, and is yet another of his</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little color</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While "Spellbound" is a black-and-white film in an era when color was just catching on, Hitchcock took full advantage of the sparse use of the novelty and shock of seeing color in a colorless film. When Dr. Petersen slowly turns the gun and fires it at himself to commit suicide, a brief (2 frames?) flash of RED splashes onto the screen. This subliminal use of color is intended to add to the shock value of a gun being pointed at the audience and fired. Hitchcock continually experimented with film techniques and tricks, trying to determine what would most effectively enhance the emotions and reactions he was trying to elicit from the audience. Here he is very effective in punctuating that response.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily one of Hitchcock's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frosty psychoanalyst Ingrid Bergman meets Gregory Peck and falls in love (easy to see why)--only to find out he's an amnesiac and maybe a murderer.A great script; impressive dream sequences designed by Salvador Dali; Bergman and Peck so young, beautiful and full of life; Hitchcock's superb direction (some of the sequences are truly astonishing) and an Oscar-wining score by Miklos Rozsa. What more could you ask for? A truly great film. Watch for the burst of color during a gunshot scene. One of Peck's first films. Only debit--Some truly HORRIBLE back projection during a skiing sequence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just to give a different opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie was boring and a complete waste of time and money. It was pretentious and the soundtrack didn't suit the scenes. It was melodramatic and the acting sucked. It was a damn romance not a thriller. Admittedly the last 15 minutes were a slight improvement, but that doesn't change my rating of 4/ 10. Sorry to people who are Hitchcock fans or people who actually liked this film. I don't understand why he developed amnesia when he was about 30 years old as the event that originally initiated it happened when he was like 10. Aside from Ingrid Bergmans characters old analyst all the characters were pathetically weak and painful to watch. Ii reminded me a lot of Georg Wilhelm Pabst's Die Buchse der Pandora. His characters were also weak as hell, irritatingly so. To give a good example of precisely what I didn't like is the relationship development between Constance and John. There was none! It may have been lust, infatuation or something, but love? They didn't know anything about each other, at least it wasn't portrayed in the bulk of the film. Maybe I'm being too harsh, Hitchcock was a very good writer. I did like Rope.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't like "Spellbound". I felt performances by Peck and Bergman were played to dramatic. The film's musical score also seemed to over power the scenes, rather than complimenting them as a supporting character. I felt bombarded by music rather than plot and performance.I don't feel "Spellbound" nor earlier Hitch films contains the Hitch substance that his later films do. "Spellbound" in particular seemed to omit the philosophical underlinings and dark humor of Hitch's later films like "Strangers on a Train", "Rope", "The Trouble with Harry", "Rear Window" to name a few.I didn't like "Spellbound". If you're a 1950's Hitch film fan, it's likely you will not either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dr. Constance Petersen (Ingrid Bergman) is a cold psychoanalyst at the mental hospital Green Manors. The director Dr. Murchison is being forced to retire after a mental breakdown. Dr. Anthony Edwardes (Gregory Peck) is his new replacement but he seems to be suffering from mental disturbances and younger than expected. Constance's icy exterior starts to melt for him but she uncovers that he's an impostor. He claims to have lost his memories.Psychiatrists are not my favorite character tropes. They usually sit and talk in very static scenes. I like the first act here and it sets up something interesting. Once he turns out to be amnesiac, the movie gets stuck and I'm simply sitting there waiting for him to remember. There is an interesting section with surrealistic dreams from artist Salvador Dalí at 90 minutes. However I don't like all the psychobabble. The hour in the middle could have been cut in half. I'm normally a happy Hitchcock fan but this hit me wrong in a couple of ways.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pretty disappointed with this one, tho' its much better than other Freudian hokum Hollywood keeps throwing at us (pun intended!).I saw this movie after 10 years &amp; the vivid scary scenes (the dream, the 180 degree rotating gun, the skiing accident that almost was) are still vivid &amp; scary. Unfortunately the story in between these scenes doesn't stand the strain of scrutiny. Peck &amp; Bergman's romance is most unconvincing. Its amazing that a house full of mind doctors couldn't make out that their new chief has some missing links in his memory. So Peck is either staring silent &amp; bug-eyed (watch out Jeff Goldblum!) at cutlery, fabric &amp; Bergman in that order or giving 'I-have-lost-my-mind-to-you' vibes to poor Ingrid who by this time is so utterly confused that she takes off her specs, looks attractive again &amp; decides she loves Greg the Peck.Perhaps if someone other than Angus Macphail had done the scripting (Eric Ambler? He has written some good amnesiac-on-the-run novels) this would have been a more gripping movie. Macphail's 'Whiskey Galore' was very very funny but this one just ain't it.Music, cinematography etc. are top of the line as always (like when Bergman climbs up the stairs to confront Leo G Carroll) in a Hitchcock movie. Definitely worth a look, but there are better works by Alfred the Great out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spellbound is a good movie with a very well developed storyline and a really impressive cast that all play their characters with great heart and passion.It definitely wasn't what I was expecting it to be,mostly because its directed by Alfred Hitchcock,its suppose to be a thriller but I wasn't very thrilled,I thought the story was really good,but it just wasn't that exciting,and a story like that sounds like they could have made it a lot more mysterious and strange.The best part of the movie was without a doubt the music,which it won an Academy Award for and it really deserved it,the music is truly outstanding and you will have it stuck in your head long after he movie ends.Fans f Alfred Hitchcock shouldn't expect a lot of thrills from Spellbound,but Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck still make it enjoyable.A female psychiatrist falls in love with her amnesiac patient although she is aware he may be a killer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a little disappointed by this for the first hour or so when I watched it for the first time recently. I'd heard all about the Dali dream sequence, and I couldn't turn the TV over until I'd seen it. I'm glad I waited. Up until then, there'd been nothing much to show that it was a Hitchcock movie.The dream sequence, and it's explanations, were great, but the best bit for me was Gregory Peck's sudden revelation of a far earlier horrific experience. That quick glimpse into his long repressed memory sent a shiver down my spine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Was Less Than "Spellbound"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you thought that it was impossible for movie-maker Alfred Hitchcock to direct a dud, well, think again. 'Cause here you have it.On a psychoanalytical level, "Spellbound" was an absolute joke. I mean, I'm certainly no psychiatrist, or anything like that, but even from a layman's perspective, this "terrible-excuse-for-a-romance" was actually quite insulting to any thinking person.In particular, it was the repeated, bug-eyed fainting spells of Gregory Peck's character, coupled with some very silly, "eerie"-sounding background music, that almost reduced "Spellbound" to the dimwitted level of being a typical, Hollywood "Screwball" comedy, 1940's style.Yes. I could certainly go on and on here, finding more and more fault with this movie. But, on a positive note - One thing I can say for "Spellbound" was that it sure did look good. Without a doubt, the camera-work was easily the strongest point of this $1.5 million production.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I'll tell you one thing for certain - Alfred Hitchcock's "Spellbound" definitely didn't hold me spellbound. Far from it. In fact, a number of times throughout the story I actually burst out laughing at how corny, clichéd, and, yes, cockeyed this particular romance was.I guess back in 1945 (with WW2 ending, and everything) they must have figured that no matter how implausible and dumb "Spellbound's" story really was, it couldn't fail to be a success since it starred 2 of Hollywood's most beautiful and adored actors-of-the-day, Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck (both in their prime at 30).And, of course, Spellbound was, indeed, a huge hit when it was first released.For me, though - About the only thing worth watching Spellbound for was its brief dream sequence which was conceived by surrealist artist, Salvador Dali.Unfortunately, this particular episode in the film was cut from its original 20 minutes to only 2 minutes by the film's producer, David Selznick, who, apparently, clashed with Hitchcock often over the direction of this production.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ingrid Bergman did three movies in 1945. She was recognized by the New York Film Critics for this film and the ever enjoyable Bells of St. Mary's. This film was nominated for six Oscars, winning for the music. Bergman got her Oscar nomination for The Bell's of St. Mary's. Unfortunately, Hitchcock and the picture lost out to Billy Wilder and The Lost Weekend.Bergman would go on to do two more films for Hitchcock (Under Capricorn, Notorious), and Peck would do one more (Notorious). Peck would also star with Bergman again in Indiscreet and Notorious.This was an exciting film. The dream sequence by Salvador Dali is not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Characters: 3 Screenplay: 3 Cinematography: 2 Emotional: 2Overall: 3.0Spellbound does a great job combining mystery, suspense, a chase, romance, and psychology. In addition, its Dali-esque dream scenes are spectacular. The acting and chemistry is great. The pacing of the story engaged me to the point of actively looking for clues and trying to predict what will happen. The plot itself is a unrealistic, and its characters are a bit thin and one dimensional. The skiing scene is atrocious, as with the ending scene.

		<shortDescription>All things to all people, the Hitchcock way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A common complaint I read about Spellbound is that it panders, indeed every few minutes Ingrid Bergman sits down with someone to explain and be explained psychiatric babble, guilt complex, amnesia, dreams, every small psychologic detail that is introduced as plot function is laid down bear before the audience at some point, their design and pattern revealed clear and rational like a clock mechanism might work, this is how it works, this is what it does to you. This complaint attempts to shift blame to the handy scapegoat, producer David Selznick. The Spellbound I am repulsed at every attempt to like, that forces me to sift through the cloggings of plot to find an original idea that was intriguing at some point, much like Rear Window then, is the Alfred Hitchcock film.It's that film made by someone who wants to be all things to all people, where the protagonists must fall in love, that love which is the undying foolhardy love of a lifetime (can we start calling this 'movie love'?), where every few scenes, almost mechanically, comic relief must be inserted lest the film be too grim for an audience, where the director speaks about love, fear, madness, sanity, in the same flat tone of voice, never enunciating anything, never with a particular inflection or mannerism, as though a bulldozer has steamrolled through the finished film to rid it of any anomalies. When Bergman falls in love she falls in love with declarations of soaring emotion, when Gregory Peck goes mad he goes mad by babbling incoherencies and fainting and wielding razorblades, and when a character notices a small revealing detail said by the villain that detail is repeated inside her head with thunderous echo.The one Spellbound I would begin to like is the Spellbound that ends with Gregory Peck the killer and Ingrid Bergman shocked to the depths of her soul that she has fallen in love with a man capable of murder. That question is interesting to me, is love a safeguard instinct, a moral compass that we can trust at all times to point north, or do we fall in love against our better judgment with people who can be bad? And more, when we do, what does that say about us? Hitchcock's film is not one that has the balls to end with shattered worlds and burning questions though, in the end Ingrid Bergman is reassured that she didn't love a guilty man. I liked a lot the dream sequence based on Salvador Dali designs, with the masked faces and the eye curtains, which is too bad because two psychiatrists sit down keeping notes in their pads to translate every small detail of that dream.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilariously overdone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The psychoanalyst who falls in love with her patient? Sounds kind of hokey, doesn't it? And it is. One of Hitchcock's real missteps.Ingrid Bergman, who usually does well in every type of part, is seriously miscast as a psychoanalyst. It is obvious from the start that you won't get any real insight into pscychoanalysis, since this is a 40's film, but you would think that an analyst who appears to be very intelligent would have a little more sense than to run off with a suspected murderer played by an even more, out of his element, Gregory Peck.There is an abundance of bad dialog in Bergman's and Peck's sessions, which may have been fresh at the time, but seems so unintentionally hilarious, when you hear it now. You could sort of say that the clichés of a psychiatrist in movies was created here.Still, there is a good performance by the Russian acting teacher, Michael Chekov and a chilling one by the real killer (won't reveal his name here).It is all for naught, though, because Bergman dominates this film with her over the top performance. The plea for justice montage is especially bad. It's almost as Hitchcock pulled one over on the audience by making it so bad that it distracts from the real denouement.Bergman, would deliver one of her greatest performances in a later Hitchcock thriller, Notorious. And I think she herself would have laughed a little about the melodramatics in this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why, but I originally thought this film featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, directed by the great Oscar nominated Sir Alfred Hitchcock, was rubbish, thank God I gave it a third and maybe even final chance. Basically Dr. Anthony Edwards (Gregory Peck) has to come to Green Manors mental hospital to replace Dr. Murchison (Stangers on a Train's Leo G. Carroll) as the head. He is instantly attracted to Dr. Constance Petersen (Ingrid Bergman), but very quickly he is revealing his true identity as an impostor with a dark past changed by paranoia and amnesia. Eventually his real name is revealed as John Ballantine, and when the police are called he and Constance go on the run, and in the process try to determine the reasons for his visions. He and Dr. Alexander 'Alex' Brulov (Oscar nominated Michael Chekhov) work out that he is afraid of the colour white and dark lines because of snow and ski trails (although it could be the bars, which I'll explain in a minute). It is after the description of the recent dreams he has been having, that John and Constance go skiing to unearth more of the past, and it is near the edge of the cliff he remembers the horrific accidentally death of his brother impaled on an iron fence with parallel bars, not the death of the real Dr. Edwards. After John is arrested, Constance works out the identity of the blank face in John's dream as Dr. Murchison, and he reveals himself as the real killer of Dr. Edwards, and after committing suicide (shooting himself), John is released to live happily with Constance. Also starring Rhonda Fleming as Mary Carmichael, John Emery as Dr. Fleurot, Norman Lloyd as Mr. Garmes, Steven Geray as Dr. Graff, Donald Curtis as Harry, Paul Harvey as Dr. Hanish, and Hitchcock's cameo is the man coming out of an elevator at the Empire Hotel, carrying a violin case and smoking a cigarette. I will admit I agree that Peck is a little robotic, compared to the much sympathetic and well cast shrink Bergman, but they do well together. Hitchcock mixes really good psychoanalysis themes, with some good dark paranoia moments, and there is that very interesting dream sequence designed by artist Salvador Dalí, making this a most watchable psychological thriller. It won the Oscar for Best Music for Miklós Rózsa, and it was nominated for Best Picture, Best Cinematography and Best Special Effects. Good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hitchcock film that's aimed at sophisticated audiences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have dismissed every criticism of this film concerning its theme of psychoanalysis. I am a big admirer of Freud, I believe in his work and the treatment he developed.Critics of psychoanalysis plus the opposing theories (I am a psychology undergraduate) do nothing but speak against the concept and offer shallow explanations for the aspects, e.g. dreams, Freud tried to explain and treat. There is no such thing as implausibility or silliness in this film. It's simple, what Gregory Peck's character did was to unconsciously repress any memory he had of, the accident with his brother due to the guilt he felt. In Freud's terms his ego protected him by forcing this traumatic memory out of conscious awareness. No it's not just a theory, it can happen. How many times did we try to be funny when clearly the time was inappropriate? This is one of the defense mechanisms Freud worked hard on.In this film Peck's guilt resurfaces when the real Dr. Edwards plunges to his death. Unable to deal with the emotional burden he decides to impersonate him in order to erase the incident he feels guilty of, at least from his own mind, which is also what Norman Bates decides to do in psycho though his trauma was powerful enough to create a split personality.Here a more mature Hitchcock tells us that many answers can be found by looking in the depths of the human psyche, hence the length of the treatment. The dream sequence is another great example of Freud's theory. All the pieces of the puzzle appear in symbolic form due to their In-acceptance by the patient (Peck in this case). Ingrid Bergman then as the analyst interprets the symbols and solves the riddle. The patient is then taken back to the time when the original trauma occurred, the day Peck's brother died, he deals with it in a more mature way and is then released from the torture.I must say I did not see the plot twist coming and kind of expected Peck to be found guilty of murder. Another great mystery therefore.There is no need to talk about the acting Peck and Bergman are great as usual.Overall being a supporter of psychoanalysis I must say I love the movie due to the fact that it's so different of what Hitch normally did and because of the good demonstration of the kind of treatment psychoanalysis is.I'd like to finish my review with a quote from the X files spoken by Fox Mulder ¨"A dream is an answer to a question we have not yet learned how to ask".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock directed this thriller that stars Ingrid Bergman as Dr. Constance Petersen, who works at the Green Manors Mental Asylum, where its director, Dr. Murchisen(played by Leo G. Carroll) is retiring. His replacement, Dr. Edwards(played by Gregory Peck) acts strangely, and is revealed to be an impostor, who has amnesia, and is wanted by the police for the disappearance of the real Dr. Edwards. Dr. Petersen decides to shield him, so she can learn his real identity, and solve the mystery. Unusual film is overly reliant on visual gimmickry,(the Salvador Dali paintings) to tell the mystery, which is all-too predictable unfortunately. Good cast and direction can't save the far-fetched story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>somewhat disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock, unfortunately, has the title of "master of suspense", and as such, more is expected of him than say Ed Wood.Wit that in mind, the only movie that he directed which can be called "garbage" is THE BIRDS. Still, not all of his other works are classics.This one is supposed to be a mystery suspense think piece. It is about a man with Amnesia, who thinks he may have killed someone.There are images and little tid bits of information that he and his love interest, a lady psychiatrist, try to work with, and it has an air of Sherlock Holmes deduction involved in it.And perhaps it isn't fair to judge this movie by the improvements on this theme in later movies, but the fact is that nearly all movies did improve upon this. MIRAGE was not an idea that held up together, but was much better than this. BLINDFOLD, although not dealing with Amnesia, did a much better job of giving us a "deduction" piecing together of fragments.What really fails here is that one can basically fast forward through 80% of this movie, and come out better for it. It drones on and on, in a dreadfully boring manner that makes it more of a "chick flick" than a think piece. We're given the incredibly handsome man in Peck, and the wallflower in Ingrid whom women can relate to. This is, obviously, Hitchcock's placating the female audience, because he didn't usually drone on in such a dull way.It isn't a bad film. It's very tedious, the sort of movie made for women to watch and men to wrap their arms around their women while the women watch. That's what the film was intended to do, and as such it does become a success, but it is very bland for someone wanting to watch a film. It's just dull.</fullReview>
