		<shortDescription>True story-authentic locations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based pretty much on the actual events &amp; people of a miscarriage of justice that took place in Queens County, New York in the early 50's. The names of most of the people who took part in the event are unchanged in the movie and the location shots where the actual events took place add a touch of dark realism to the movie. The basic plot revolves around a musician who worked at the world famous Stork Club who was mis-identified by witnesses and arrested because he resembled an armed robber. Hitchcock dwells on the slow descent into helplessness and powerlessness that a citizen endures as he wends his way through the NYC (or any other) criminal justice meat grinder. There are chilling shots of his transport , by paddy wagon, into the Ridgewood Felony court and the Long Island City House of Detention. The lawyer he hired, Frank O'Connor, (his real name) went on to become District Attorney of Queens county and was later heavily involved in the infamous Kitty Genovese case. Not your typical Hitchcock film but one well worth seeing if for no other reason than to see one of Henry Fonda's better performances as the quietly stunned Christopher Emmanuel (Manny) Balestrero who sees his life, career and family endangered by forces he has little control over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Sad Drama Based on a True Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In New York, the Catholic Italian musician of the Stork Club Christopher Emanuel "Manny" Balestrero (Henry Fonda) is a simple man, married with his beloved wife Rose (Vera Miles) and having two sons. On 14 January 1953, his wife needs an expensive teeth treatment, and Manny goes to the insurance company, trying to raise a loan. However, he is wrongly identified by a clerk as the man who robbed the place twice, being arrested and sent to jail. His friends pay the bail and he tries to prove his innocence. Meanwhile, Rose has a nervous breakdown, caused by her mistrust on his innocence, and is sent to an institution for treatment. "The Wrong Man" is a very sad and touching story of the injustice against an innocent man, affecting the health of his family. Henry Fonda is amazing in the role of an ordinary man, who accepts passively the situations, believing on God and praying for strength and justice. Vera Miles is fantastic in the role of a wife who believe she has part of the guilty for the action of her beloved husband. This movie was filmed in many authentic locations, and is a very different work of Alfred Hitchcock. Maybe due to the theme be so serious, Hitchcock appears only introducing of the story, and does not have any other small participations as he usually does in his movies. The black and white photography, with shadows, and the score of Bernard Herrmann, complete the magnificence of this great underrated movie. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "O Homem Errado" ("The Wrong Man")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unexpected jewel from the Master</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a terrific, dark, taut thriller from Hitchcock, based on a true story. Not his usual ostentatious style, but it plays on the theme of a wrong man caught up in extraordinary events beyond his control (REAR WINDOW, NORTH BY NORTHWEST, PSYCHO).It may be Hitchcock's most cynical film. Henry Fonda plays a man falsely accused of armed robbery. He is a quiet man, whose life gets turned upside down as a result.Hitchcock spares us nothing of the horror of the predicament of Fonda's situation. He shows many of the details of how Fonda is accused, arrested, and tried in real time, so we are as fully worn down as the protagonist.The plot was quite unbelievable by 1950s standards that Hitch needed all the realism he could muster. For example, Hitchcock himself introduces the film in a prologue, to verify that it is indeed based on a true story. Also, don't look for his trademark cameo - he did shoot a scene where he was a customer in a store, but that scene ended up getting cut. Hitchcock personally interviewed all of the participants in the real live drama. And the doctor at the sanitarium is played not by an actor, but by a real doctor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And Justice for All?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The theme of an innocent man wrongly accused of a crime was a frequent one in Alfred Hitchcock's work, but "The Wrong Man" is very different from most of his other treatments of this theme. It is based upon a true story, and is told in a sober, semi-documentary style rather than the director's more normal thriller style. There are no cliffhangers or chase sequences and no directorial set pieces like the scene with the crop-dusting plane in "North by Northwest" or the shower scene in "Psycho", and the ending is far more downbeat than the normal triumphant finale with the villain dead or in police custody and the hero vindicated and free to marry the beautiful young heroine. (One thing the film does have in common with a more traditional thriller is a suitably eerie musical score from Bernard Herrman who also provided the music for several other Hitchcock films).The central character is Emmanuel Balestrero, a musician employed in a New York nightclub, a devoted husband and the father of two young sons. After visiting an insurance company to borrow some money against his wife's policy, Balestrero is arrested and told that he has been identified as the man who carried out two robberies at the company's offices. He protests his innocence but further witnesses come forward to allege that he was involved in other robberies. He is released on bail, and manages to find a lawyer to take on the case, but has difficulty in establishing an alibi that will clear his name. The action culminates in a trial scene, something of a rarity in Hitchcock's work. Although he was fascinated by the law and the criminal justice system, he preferred to create an atmosphere of physical menace rather than rely on the verbal duels of the traditional courtroom drama.Parallel to the story of Balestrero's fight to establish his innocence is the story of his wife, Rose. Another of Hitchcock's interests, one often reflected in his work, was psychology, often but not always the psychology of the criminal mind. This interest is explored most deeply in "Spellbound", but it also appears in films such as "Strangers on a Train" and "Psycho"; both Bruno Anthony and Norman Bates can be seen as psychological case studies. In "The Wrong Man" the stress of her husband's ordeal affects Rose's mind, and she suffers first from depression, then from paranoia. She suffers a breakdown and is committed to a mental hospital. Vera Miles gives a particularly fine performance as Rose, contrasting with Henry Fonda's baffled but stoical Balestrero.The film is not "scary" in the way that a normal Hitchcock thriller is scary, but is nevertheless frightening. In the average thriller, we feel anxiety on behalf of the hero; here we feel anxiety not only on behalf of Balestrero, who runs the risk of being imprisoned for a crime he did not commit, but also on behalf of society as a whole. This is one Hitchcock film with a serious message, intended to show that miscarriages of justice can occur all too easily. The director emphasised this message in the opening spoken prologue in which he addresses the camera directly, a prologue that replaces his normal cameo appearance. The possibility of an innocent man going to jail is all the more chilling for the fact that no-one has given perjured evidence or deliberately attempted to frame Balestrero. The witnesses genuinely believe that he is the guilty man, and the police remain dispassionate throughout. Certainly, some of the elements of criminal procedure shown would not be permissible today (suspects being arrested without being informed of their rights or of the crime of which they are suspected, interviews being conducted without a written or taped record being kept, two witnesses allowed to be present together during an identification parade), but this does not lessen the film's impact; anyone with any knowledge of the law will be aware that innocent people can still be convicted in the twenty-first century.Apart from "Psycho" this was Hitchcock's last film made in black and white, and he makes good use of the medium, with some striking photography. Particularly notable is his use of close-ups, such as of the witnesses when they think they recognise Balestrero as the robber, or of Vera Miles's face to illustrate Rose's emotional turmoil. This is a stark, sombre film, a memorable departure from the normal Hitchcock style. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's scariest film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE WRONG MAN has to be the scariest film made by Alfred Hitchcock. The driving force is it's realism. Based on a true story, we follow a struggling Queens musician (Henry Fonda) falsly accused of local robberies. We don't have suave Cary Grant dodging cropdusters or Mount Rushmore. There is no darkly funny Robert Walker making quips about murder. It's all frightfully real- the arrest process, the breakdown of Fonda's family (An incredible performance by Vera Miles as his wife) and the grueling courtroom process. The opening hour of unsmiling detectives checking Fonda's story, and watching Fonda become more defenseless is outright chilling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock is the right man for suspense!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very underrated Hitchcock film that features amazing performances from it's two stars, Henry Fonda and (especially) Vera Miles. It is a sad, cynical offering from the Master Of Suspense that has a familiar theme (the title says it all), yet it also is perhaps one of Hitch's most unusual works.The films runs more like a documentary in it's approach, and it feels inherently 'real'. The casting of 'everyman' Fonda in the role of Manny Balestero, a man accused of crimes he did not commit, works very well as we can feel empathy for Fonda and place ourselves in his position. Ditto with Miles. She is so convincing in her role as the mentally fragile wife Rose that her scenes are almost uncomfortable to witness. Portraying a person self-destructing is one of the hardest tasks an actor can face, but Miles does it subtly and movingly. It is a brilliant performance that ranks alongside Bergman's role in 'Notorious' and Wright's 'Charlie' in 'Shadow Of A Doubt' for best female acting honors in a Hitchcock film.'The Wrong Man' has a sentimental, tender yet dark atmosphere. The sentimentality is perhaps due to the fact that the central action revolves around a family grouping in this film.There are no elaborate scenes of courtship and romance as in 'Vertigo' or sexy double entendres seen in 'Notorious'- Instead, we get the feeling that this is a real, normal family we are watching unravel at the seams due to the crimes of another.Appropriately slow-moving to keep in check with Hitch's low-key approach for this one. New York in the 1950's was possibly never photographed so darkly real as it is here. Boasting great performances from the two leads, this is a must-see Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>False imprisonment, the most grievous of wrongs!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The response to possible injustice is all too typical of the criminal justice system... We always hear the stories of innocent persons wrongfully convicted by mistaken identification, false confessions, crime-lab fraud, jailhouse snitches, lying "expert witnesses," incompetent or uninvolved defense attorneys, and police frame-ups... Criminologists have known that eyewitnesses are as likely to be wrong as right... But despite the undeniable fact that an eyewitness is no better than a flip of a coin, police, prosecutors and juries put great weight on eyewitness evidence even in cases where suspects have unshakable alibis...False confessions arise from any number of known reasons... Yet once police get a confession (even ones they invent) prosecutors take for granted the reliability of the confession... The Mexican public, especially "law and order" conservatives, must come to grips with the fact that our criminal justice system increasingly serves causes other than justice... Finding a suspect and convicting him is more important to many police and prosecutors than getting the right man...The ease with which innocents can be railroaded is scary enough... But the obstructions that prosecutors raise to the release of inmates known to be innocent reveals an inhumanity that is frightening...The Mexican justice system is loaded against the wrongfully convicted... Consequently, the wrongfully convicted serve longer terms than the guilty... No one knows how many people are wrongly imprisoned... But in every part of this world, the problem is clearly too large to ignore...'The Wrong Man' concerns Christopher Emmuanuel 'Manny' Balestrero (Henry Fonda), a family man and a New York jazz musician, with a devoted wife and two young boys, wrongly identified by several witnesses as the perpetrator of a number of hold-up... The evidence is against him because he fits the description! The actual criminal looks almost identical to him... In minute detail we watch him being humiliated by the process of justice that is supposed to protect him... From his arrest to his fingerprinting, handcuffing, and jailing, we follow, with real anguish, how an innocent man is intimidated and humiliated... Fonda's characters were often associated with injustice, most notably in 'Let Us Leave,' and 'The Ox-Bow Incident.'By imposing his own highly individual style, Hitchcock treats this incident as if it really was a miracle... For if the picture points out anything, it is that justice can be vindictive and cruel and that anyone could become the wrong man...Vera Miles is well cast as Manny's disturbed wife who slowly loses her sanity while her husband awaits trial... Her slow transformation from an outraged citizen into an apathetic mental case is handled sensitively...Anthony Quayle is excellent as Fonda's attorney, and Harold Stone is very good as Lt. Bowers...Photographed in Black and White, 'The Wrong Man' is a nightmare of reality that could happen to anyone...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>if there are films that are "under-rated", this one wold be near the top of the list</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After sitting through The Wrong Man, it puzzles me greatly why this film isn't seen by more, or rated as highly as some of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpieces. True, he does seem to be subverting his style slightly for the story, which is at the core a tragedy of a man falsely accused (and maybe not with the same tension we'd expect like in Strangers on a Train or Psycho). But to me it shows him really with an experimental edge that just seemed to really strike me. This is Hitchcock going for something Kafkaesque ala the Trial, and on that level the film is downright scary at times. Though Henry Fonda's Manny Balestero is told of his charge after being arrested, the whole 'procedural' nature of the film's story, of how the system can be the damnedest thing, makes it downright gripping. Like with the Master's other films, one can see the suspense at times almost sweating through the frame, and the kind of Cold-War era paranoia that works magnificently (like when Manny is at the insurance office, where the plot thickens), along with the sort of Joseph K. quality to the lead of being presumed guilty more than being presumed innocent.But there is also something very powerful, and challenging, about the casting of the lead. In a sense Hitchcock was one step ahead of Sergio Leone, who would do something similar with Once Upon a Time in the West (though Leone was going for a lot more twisting the genre screws). It's a filmmaker saying, 'look, I'm giving you Henry Fonda, maybe the most, if not one of the most, good-hearted movie stars from the 40's- Grapes of Wrath, My Darling Clementine, The Lady Eve, etc- but I'm putting him in a situation where he's in this strange scenario of not playing himself, or rather being in a society that is brutal and unflinching'.Fonda was the perfect choice considering the material, and while it is based on a true story and Fonda is terrific at his role, that Hitchcock leaves out certain details of his innocence (says the trivia on IMDb) adds a certain level to the subject matter. Maybe he is guilty and we just are too gullible to think it? How long can all this doomed atmosphere continue? On an existential level almost Hitchcock delivers a kind of very recognizable world with the terror on a different but just as engaging level as his 'popular' films.If Fonda is our fatefully unlucky protagonist, Vera Miles is equally compelling as his wife, who can't seem to take what has been going on with her husband. If there is some sense of pitch black satire amid the "true-story" drama of the story, she is the representation of paranoia affecting a seemingly good person. Why this happens exactly to Rose Ballestero, her descent into a kind of closed-off madness, isn't made entirely clear (again, Kafka), and the conclusion to the film brings something that I was hoping would happen, and did, and makes for something far more challenging than if a standard Hollywood director would've tackled the material. Using real locations in NYC, the great many character actors that make up the police and everyday people (there is some very good casting in the insurance office scene), and a musical score that is decidedly vintage Herrmann, Hitchcock uses this sort of documentary realism to heighten his own subjective approach (all the images of prison bars, the film-noir type lighting and staging, the use of space in the rooms). It all works to help the story, which goes against the grain of the 50's era thriller, and it works extremely well.In fact, for my money, I would rank this among my top five or so favorites in Hitchcock's whole oeuvre. It's a bold statement to be sure, but for the particular cinema fan, this brings on entertainment on a truly dramatic scale and, until a certain point I won't mention, is unrelenting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Different Kind of Suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the theme of "The Wrong Man" could apply to several of Hitchcock's more famous thrillers, this movie is unique in holding closely to a series of events as they actually happened. That means there is a lot less of some of the usual Hitchcock features, such as his famous set pieces or his subtle humor. They are replaced by a different kind of suspense, still done with Hitchcock's usual craftsmanship.Henry Fonda and Vera Miles play a factual ordinary couple whose lives are thrown into turmoil when the police confuse the husband with a man who has been committing a series of robberies. The first part of the movie concentrates on the nightmare he undergoes in being interrogated, jailed, and arraigned. Fonda's convincing acting, along with Hitchcock's detail-oriented filming, enable the viewer to feel the anxiety and helplessness of an innocent man being horribly misjudged. In the second part of the movie, as Fonda gets ready to go to trial, the ordeal finally starts to take its toll on his wife.Although this has to be ranked as a minor work compared to Hitchcock's long list of masterpieces, it is a worthwhile film in its own right, as long as you have the right expectations in watching it. It can be quite uncomfortable to watch these things happen when you know that it all really occurred, and Hitchcock uses his skill to help us see just what an ordeal it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusual Hitchcock gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the true story of a quiet family man falsely indicted for armed robbery, "The Wrong Man" may not be in Hitchcock's top echelon, but it contains many of the master's touches and deserves to be better known. What is so unusual for Hitchcock is that he filmed it in a somber documentary style (in keeping with the non-fictional source of the story). He even cut out his traditional cameo, and there is not a flicker of wit anywhere, either in dialogue or image. But the film effectively explores some of Hitchcock's favorite themes (like how easily our seemingly secure lives can be disrupted) and it is marked by some masterful visual touches. Note how effortlessly Hitchcock can film a scene inside a car, seeming to expand the space. I also liked the expressionistic camera movements to suggest Fonda's emotions in a jail cell. Most memorable of all is the dissolve that reveals the real culprit. Francois Truffaut held Hitchcock to task for tainting the pure documentary style of this movie with these more cinematic flourishes, but without them, I think it would have been way too grim to watch (it's pretty grim as it is). Henry Fonda gives a fittingly unshaded performance in the title role. And Bernard Herrmann's score is subtly effective, especially in the title sequence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disquieting, a steely Fonda, and amazing Hitchcock. But it might make you edgy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wrong Man (1956)There's no question Alfred Hitchcock has pulled off something amazing here, a kind of experiment. Entirely based on true events, and without any sense of chase, romance, or high intrigue, and without special effects or even witty dialog, he makes you feel for the main character, Henry Fonda, a man accused of a crime he did not commit.It's often pointed out that Hitchcock had an enormous fear of the police, and of being accused when innocent. This shows up in many of his films, but never more clearly or more painfully than here. To watch is an adventure in frustration, almost to the point you have to turn it off. But of course, you can't just get up and leave. You have to know what happens.And the turns of events are so reasonable and yet so unbearable, you just want to get up there and say, do this, do that! It's weird to say, this is not an enjoyable movie. But it's a very good one, maybe flawless in its attempt to trap you as much as the main character was trapped. The surrounding cast is terribly believable, the cops, the wife, the kids. And it unfolds with such dramatic relentlessness. The camera angles (thanks to Robert Burks) are psychologically intense (and edited for discomfort). And the music (Bernard Herrmann, soon to score Psycho) only adds more tension. Beautifully. As an exercise in precision, and in sticking to the facts, this is as good as a dramatic (non-documentary) film can get. Wikipedia has a small amount of helpful information, and tcm.com has a lot (click on articles or reviews on the left for a range of texts). But of course, watch it straight. See some period New York City scenes (from streets to jails to what looks like the amazing 57th St. bridge at dusk). A wonderful, if not uplifting, movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Journey In Darkness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hard to watch by design, "The Wrong Man" impresses with its technique and stark dissimilarity from what we associate with director Alfred Hitchcock. But novelty does not equal brilliance.Henry Fonda is the title character, a club musician named Manny Balestrero mistakenly pegged for a hold-up man while trying to borrow some money from his wife Rose's (Vera Miles) life insurance policy. The arrest forces Manny to not only prove his innocence but fight to keep his family intact."Bleak and dour" is the best way to describe this movie. "Every step a journey in darkness" is the trailer's tagline, and it is only a slight exaggeration. Hitchcock even does a voice-over telling us how unusual a story this is for him to tackle, because "every word" of it is true.The problem with "The Wrong Man" is the way it makes real life feel like a trip to the dentist's. Fonda feels wrong in the central role, not because he is not a convincing everyman but because he seems so uncomfortable in his own skin. Even before he is charged with anything we watch him regard his surroundings with a strange, strained, sheepish smile. Prison doesn't seem much of a change.Hitchcock fans might enjoy this detour into Kazan territory (minus the method acting) for the way it sets up some unique camera work. Sequences of Fonda's head revolving inside a lens and later of him seen through a cell latch hole get much of the attention, but just as interesting, and more in keeping with the realistic aesthetic, are the numerous POV and high-angle shots that play up the claustrophobia in less showy ways.I have a hard time understanding how people might view "The Wrong Man" as an underrated masterpiece. The central story is too thin, takes way too long to develop, and is resolved with offhanded ease following one of the least interesting trial sequences ever shot. Hitchcock himself seems to lose interest in it, going full-tilt into a second story about Rose's mental meltdown. Miles certainly has effective moments in her spotlight scenes, enough to make one wonder what she would have done with the part she was offered in "Vertigo", but her crack-up as written is too abrupt and capped by a laughably pat end frame.Once you get used to his no-frills performance, Fonda is interesting to watch in his offbeat way, and the secondary players are all good. Especially worthy of notice are Harold J. Stone as the lead detective in the Balestrero case and Doreen Lang as maybe the most awful of the many awful witnesses gathered by police.That the police make so many mistakes is undoubtedly the point Hitchcock wants to make here, and there are times where the frightening arbitrariness of life grabbing one by the throat is made very real. "Just when you thought it was safe to walk into the insurance office" could be this film's tag line.But after a few scenes of this, I was ready to move on. Hitch, alas, was not, and "The Wrong Man" suffers for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Kafka Than Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem that most people have with The Wrong Man is that it's not the Alfred Hitchcock we've come to expect. No unflappable hero like Cary Grant, no cool blonds to accompany the hero like Madeleine Carroll, or Grace Kelly, no McGuffin as Hitchcock always describes the object everyone is after in his films.The object our protagonist, in this case Henry Fonda, is after is to clear his good name. And The Wrong Man is based on the true story of Christopher Emmanuel Balestrero who apart from working odd hours due to his job is your average normal family man. Fonda is a bass fiddle player in the orchestra at the famous swanky Stork Club in Manhattan.Fonda's Kafkaesque nightmare starts when wife Vera Miles needs some ready cash so he goes to borrow on his insurance policy. His dumb luck to walk into the insurance office and look like a man who had held the place up before. Fonda's even wearing the same type clothes.The insurance company calls the police and Detective Harold J. Stone is assigned. Remember this was the days before Miranda warnings were mandatory, otherwise had Fonda called a lawyer right then and there, he might not have gotten in this mess. Stone convinces himself he's got the right man and Fonda is arrested. When the police think they are on the right track it's mighty hard to dissuade them. Back when I was a working person as an investigator for the NYS Crime Victims Board, I handled a couple of claims arising out of the break-in murder of a lesbian woman in Brooklyn in 1995. The woman's partner was also injured by the same man who broke in. However the police were absolutely convinced that the partner herself had a hand in the killing. They told that to one and all who would listen including me in my official capacity. The partner's claim was held up as a result of this.As it turned out the police on a totally different case arrested a man who confessed to the break-in murder/robbery. Now the partner was never arrested as Henry Fonda was, but she was under suspicion by all because the police investigating went on a totally different track. The surviving partner eventually got all that was due her by my agency. So I'm here to tell you that these things can and do happen in real life and the case of Christopher Emmanuel Balestrero was no aberration.Actually though, as good as Fonda is in the part, the best work in the film is done by Vera Miles. She blamed herself and her mismanaging of the household finances as the reason for her husband's troubles. She suffers a complete mental breakdown as a result. Vera's performance was Oscar caliber stuff, it should have been considered by the Academy.Although it would seem a most odd choice for the role, British actor Anthony Quayle played Frank D. O'Connor, former State Senator, who defended Balestrero. O'Connor later worked the other side of the courtroom when he became District Attorney of Queens County, President of the New York City Council and Democratic candidate for Governor in 1966 against Nelson Rockefeller. O'Connor later went to the New York State Supreme Court where he was well respected. I'm sure O'Connor in real life was pleased with the way Anthony Quayle played him.Though a film like this would be more identified with someone like Jules Dassin, Alfred Hitchcock did a fine job. Pity the film was not better received because the movie going public expected certain things from a Hitchcock film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In almost an eerie coincidence I have been through exactly what this man (Fonda) went through. In my case I happened to get onto a railway carriage and sit opposite the victim of a crime a few weeks earlier.For over a year, I like Fonda, watched with no control as people questioned, was it me? For me it was like watching a story of my own experience, the line ups, the very polite police, which they were, Hitchcock got that right, he did not try to make them monsters like many other directors would. The scared victims I saw at the line up. Going to court, the friendly lawyer, who at the same time made me feel I was doing all the legwork. I would also tell him things I felt important which he would brush off, similar to how Fonda was treated.I am sure others who have had this happen to them will understand how scared you feel and as an honest person, I never have fully recovered from my experience.Hats off to Hitch, he really did his homework on this one, nothing was out of place, all this really does happen and still happens, just because one person mistakes your face for a criminal's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No special effects, not a single car chase, but the directing and acting slowly pulls you into a world gone askew. The circumstantial evidence builds against an innocent and sympatheticcharacter, who at one point is almost ready to concede that "jail would beeasier than this meat grinder". The realization is too much for Vera Miles and she cracks under the strain. Why do we now have Miranda rights? A kidwatching this movie today is probably annoyed or bored by the lack of CGI (with the exception of a rotating camera to simulate "the spins"), car chases andexplosions. But if you think being held without real evidence "can't happen here", you haven't been reading the papers: how about the Saudi collegestudent held for two years in jail for putting up a web site for his church?(charges dropped for lack of evidence). And "the wrong men" and women in our society are disproportionately poor. Henry Fonda was lucky: they caught the guy red handed. But Hitchcock makes the point well: the working poor cannot afford a top lawyer, if you're lucky you get one who's smart and inexperienced. If you're not, you get an incompetent one, and end up in jail .I was reminded of the Apu trilogy or DeSica's neo-realism, as this movie turns on facial expressions, the noir lighting, as quietly emotions build and you realize, yes he could serve time for this. I'd put this next to "Blackmail" as one of Hitch's under-rated masterpieces.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock without the gimmicks...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE WRONG MAN is a bleak Alfred Hitchcock movie filmed in suitably low-key style with crisp B&amp;W photography and two very deeply felt performances by HENRY FONDA and VERA MILES.Hitch's fear of police (traumatic experience as a youth) serves him well in crafting the kind of intimidation a man feels when he's unjustly accused of a crime he hasn't committed. Eyewitnesses place him at the scene of the crime and the police are ready to lock him up and put him away in prison.The only one who believes in him (or his innocence) is his wife, VERA MILES, but she begins to undergo serious mental stress as the situation seems to get more and more hopeless. Eventually, she is driven to the brink of insanity and her heart hardens toward her husband. Vera Miles is excellent in the role, subtle and completely believable.What distinguishes THE WRONG MAN from other Hitchcock films is that it's all filmed in a brisk, documentary style that leaves no room for the usual gimmicks. It's about as straightforward in its story-telling manner as any of his films has ever been, based on a true life incident in the life of a man falsely accused.Summing up: Well worth watching, but not unless you're willing to be more than a little depressed by the somber mood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The wrong one is right...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost everything about this Hitchcock move is atypical - audiences keen for his sometimes convoluted, twisty - turny adventure - style would be jolted to reality with this excellent almost docu-drama. Apart from perhaps only two scenes where Hitch flexes his stylised muscles - the "hanging" scene in Henry Fonda's cell and the superimposition of the actual crime perpetrator's face over Fonda's at his moment of darkest despair, the rest is gritty, black and white exposition. Even the title eschews artifice. I wonder if the true story on which the film was based also turned on Fonda's unwitting error in transcribing the spelling mistake in the true robber's demand note, if so, then truth really is stranger than fiction else it would surely count as one of Hitchcock's most outrageous coincidences. Henry Fonda, who actually had hoped he would be starring in a James Stewart / Cary Grant type fast paced romp a la "To Catch a Thief" or "The Man who Knew too Much", adapts wonderfully to the much deeper demands of the lead role. I know this was filmed around the time of his award - winning lead in "12 Angry Men" but this performance is just as deserving. Reacting against the prevailing Actor's school "method" approach, he almost underplays his part and engages the viewer immediately. Vera Miles is also fine as his troubled wife who blames herself for causing her husband's troubles, the policemen parts, played by lesser known actors heighten Fonda's Kafka-type nightmare against anonymous automatons "just doing their job". Even the scenes with their kids are refreshingly schmaltz-free. The religious symbolism is a little heavy - handed at times for my tastes but this excellent film at once broadens and deepens one's appreciation of the Master at the height of his powers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bare bones Hitchcock.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think pretty much every lesser known Hitchcock film has a whole society of people who call it "one of Hitchcock's great unsung masterpieces," and The Wrong Man is no different. The wrong man theme is one of Hitchcock's favorites and he has used it a great many times to create some of his most suspenseful films, and he uses that and almost nothing else to create the considerable suspense in this film. Hitchcock had a genuine fear of the police, and you can see it in many of his films, this one more than most. Henry Fonda delivers a wonderful performance as a regular man who just wants to be a good man and a good husband, but suddenly finds himself embroiled in this case of mistaken identity. The film is structured differently from a lot of his other films, which often showed a man forced into isolation by misplaced accusations, only to slowly reveal himself to be a hero and gradually get the girl, who paid him no attention at the beginning of the film.(spoilers) In this film, Christopher Balestrero (Henry Fonda) is never a hero nor does he try to be, and his wife not only does not gradually grow more and more fond of him despite the accusations against him, but she grows more and more distant due to the accusations. Hitchcock personally introduces the film in his only speaking role in any of his movies (he introduced his television series episodes, but mostly as comic relief), and warns that the movie is completely true and absolutely frightening. It is a successful adaptation of a true story, although clearly highly polished to satisfy the studio. Definitely one of Hitchcock's more notable efforts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's well documented that Alfred Hitchcock believed that anyone could easily find themselves wrongly imprisoned for a crime that they didn't commit and the abiding fear that this induced not only explains his natural interest in bringing the story of "The Wrong Man" to the screen but also provides an insight into why he made the movie in the style that he did. Its straightforward story is presented in an understated way which dispenses with any content which could possibly distract from the sheer horror of the events depicted and his usual cameo appearance is replaced by an introduction in which his heavily shadowed figure emphasises to the audience that the story they are about to see is, in fact, true."The Wrong Man" contains neo-realist and documentary influences and the fact that so many of its scenes were shot in the locations where the actual events took place is evidence of the strong efforts that were made to make the movie as authentic as possible.Manny Balestrero (Henry Fonda) is a modestly paid night club bass player and he and his wife Rose (Vera Miles) have to consistently budget very carefully and cope with periodic financial traumas just in order to get by. When Rose needs to have some expensive dental treatment and the funds aren't readily available, Manny goes to an insurance company's office to check whether it would be possible for them to apply for a loan by using Rose's insurance policy as collateral. The office clerks think they recognise him as the man who'd recently robbed their office and so they report their suspicions to the police.A police car is parked outside Manny's home when he returns from the insurance office and he's immediately taken into custody, questioned and then driven to a series of businesses which have recently been robbed so that the proprietors can give their opinions on whether they consider that Manny is the man who carried out the robberies. The information gathered from these people and the insurance clerks convince the police that Manny is indeed the perpetrator. In a further check, one of the detectives asks Manny to write out a copy of the wording of a note used by the thief in one of the robberies and when Manny misspells the word "drawer" in the same way that the hold up man did, he's duly charged, fingerprinted and put in a cell.Manny's sister and brother-in-law pay his bail and Manny then retains a lawyer called Frank O'Connor (Anthony Quayle) to represent him. O'Connor advises Manny to try to establish where he was at the times when the various robberies were carried out. Manny and Rose fail to locate the three witnesses who could have confirmed where Manny was when the first robbery was carried out as two of the men had since died and the third couldn't be traced. The couple are naturally disappointed but even worse; Rose starts to blame herself for their misfortune and becomes convinced that their predicament is hopeless. She becomes increasingly depressed and has to be admitted to a sanitarium for treatment. Some time later, the real culprit is apprehended and Manny is exonerated but when he informs Rose, she tragically shows no elation or reaction of any type.Henry Fonda is exceptional as a thoroughly decent man who becomes the victim of a great injustice and someone who deals with his ordeal with immense dignity and a considerable amount of stoicism. The way in which he conveys all the fear, confusion and despair that Manny endures is even more noteworthy and commendable because his character is a humble and naturally undemonstrative person.Vera Miles is outstanding as the loyal and well meaning wife who blames herself for Manny's predicament which she feels was caused by her inability to manage the domestic finances more successfully. This and the additional anguish she experiences when she becomes convinced that the battle to prove Manny's innocence is futile, make her so despondent that she suffers a mental breakdown."The Wrong Man" shows just how terrifying the experience of being wrongly identified as a criminal can be and how remote the prospect of justice can seem once a victim is caught up in what seems to be an unstoppable police process where the word of the accused carries no power whatsoever. The fact that everyone else who's connected with the process seems so unconcerned about what's happening just makes the innocent man's predicament even more cruel and the devastating effect the experience has on his life is absolutely harrowing to watch.This is a genuinely frightening and affecting movie in which the story is incredibly powerful but also one which is very under-appreciated compared to so many of Hitchcock's other films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never has this been more abundantly clear than in Alfred Hitchcock's The Wrong Man, a true story about a simple, hard-working musician who is mistaken for being a local robber that has eluded the police for some time. Ripped from the headlines, Hitchcock employs some of the themes he used in nearly every one of his films, including mistaken identity and being accused for something you didn't do.Along with I Confess, a dark mystery about a priest trying to clear his name, this is one of the more serious Hitchcock films that feels more realistic than anything else he did in his long, illustrious career. Shot in black and white at a time when Hitchcock was exploiting the advantages of Vista Vision and Technicolor, he makes the most of the dark and sinister streets of New York City where some of the scenes were shot. The cast also bolsters strong performances from Henry Fonda as the accused Manny and Vera Miles as his supportive wife Rose. This certainly was a sidestep for Hitchcock, but it still works thanks to very good performances, harsh camera work and a story that shows us that even in this country where you are innocent until proved guilty, you sometimes aren't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't aware of this Hitchcock 'true story' until I ran across it today, and it proved to be an edgy and haunting film, especially when one realizes that it could happen to you. Watching it, I was drawn into Manny Balestrero's (Henry Fonda) ordeal, and not so much as a viewer, but as someone undergoing the excruciating uncertainty of what was going to happen if this mess wasn't straightened out. In that regard, the somber musical score adds even more tension to the grim story, and I felt myself getting almost suffocated by Manny's dilemma.You knew it was going to be different from the usual Hitchcock fare when the director appears before the movie to announce that the story was based on an actual event. Hitch's trademark cameo is noticeably absent, and that was by design. The almost documentary style of the film was entirely story boarded to the most minor detail, the way Hitchcock liked to work, so that by the time it got to filming it was almost like a bother to the director. Yet the end product is a haunting and moving story that's as effective as any of Hitchcock's best thrillers.Henry Fonda excels in his portrayal of Manny, coming across as your typical everyday Joe. He has a happy marriage and two kids he adores, but once caught up in the ordeal of finding a lawyer, looking for witnesses that will clear him, and working to pay off his growing debt load, his wife Rose (Vera Miles) slowly succumbs to depression and paranoia. The second half of the film in a way becomes her story, as her condition requires professional help and assignment to a sanitarium rest home. As somber as the tone of the story is already, Rose's declining mental stability would have been the straw to break most men in Manny's situation.The film makes use of overt Catholic symbolism with devices like Manny's rosary at the police station, and a picture of Jesus in the latter part of the story. Balestrero's faith is conveyed to be a factor in the resolution of his legal case, as the real thief that Manny was mistaken for is caught in the same neighborhood committing a similar crime. I thought it would have been much more vindicating for Manny to confront his original accusers the way he did the man who was arrested; I certainly felt like lashing out at those two women for sending this man and his family into a living nightmare.It's not unusual that Alfred Hitchcock would find this real life story a fascinating topic for a movie, considering he dealt with fictional cases of mistaken identity in films like "North By Northwest". All too well though, "The Wrong Man" is one of those stories that help assert the fact that truth sometimes, is stranger than fiction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overlooked Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The name of Alfred Hitchcock, the Master of Suspense, is and will be eternally linked to his most well-known masterpieces such as "Psycho" or "The Birds"; sadly, this has left "The Wrong Man" in the obscurity as an overlooked gem that in fact deserves to be seen and appreciated by film enthusiasts worldwide.The true story of Emmanuel Ballestrero (played superbly by Henry Fonda) and his unfair imprisonment when he is accused of a crime he did not commit, is represented faithfully in Hitchcock's "The Wrong Man", with all its frightening realism.The most important thing about this movie must be the fact that it is based on a real life tragedy, this is a big difference from the rest of the Hitchcock's work. The Master adds more realism to the movie by keeping a low profile direction, almost in a documentary style. Gone are the camera tricks, the contrived plots and the suspense; in "The Wrong Man" we have a scary noir-esquire tale of crime in its more realistic way. In fact, Hitchcock himself decided to turn his cameo into an "introductory speech" because he felt that a cameo would take away the realism of the movie.As I wrote above, the script is very simple, and without plot twists or a clear McGuffin to look at; nevertheless, the master guides us through the suffering of this man as he is humiliated by the police in sheer realism. Hitchcock takes away his characteristic dark humor and gives us a grim tale of injustice, probably fueled by his own terrible fear of police. This fear is latent in every frame, and the fear of imprisonment is particularly shown in all its scary magnitude when Ballestrero is locked for the first time, the camera gives depth to his prison and Fonda's expression is superb.Henry Fonda gives one of his best performances ever, as the quiet every man who works as a musician in a bar. It is a very realistic performance that alone worths the price of the movie. I dare to say that this is probably Fonda's best role. The rest of the cast is average but its understandable because the movie is completely focused on Fonda, all of them give very natural acting that fits the tone of the movie. Notable exception is Vera Miles, who gives a Tour-De-Force in his representation of Ballestrero's wife, who suffers a nervous breakdown when his husband is in jail. Vera's acting is outstanding and her performance shows the mental decay that Mrs. Ballestrero suffered in real life with scary realism.As you probably have noticed, the perfect description for this movie is "scary realism", that is what "The Wrong Man" is, a realistic portrait of a tale of injustice and how a man had to go through hell just because the justice had picked, the Wrong Man 9/10. Overlooked gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hitchcock's best films, and a departure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wrong Man is a unique Hitchcock picture, one that exists in a parallel Hitchcockian universe, a stark procedural drama and exercise in controlled filmmaking combined. The film is technically flawless, and Hitchcock uses editing, sound and image to such an effect that we immediately believe that we are there and that it could happen to us. Chirpy dialogue, colorful characters and staged design often cushion the suspenseful atmosphere found in other Hitchcock films, The Wrong Man provides us with none of those comforts. Instead we are left out in the cold like the protagonist - claustrophobic and drained.I can see why this was Truffaut's favorite Hitchcock picture, any admirer of the craft will immediately latch on to and appreciate the technical proficiency that went into telling this story. Sparse on dialogue, heavy on atmosphere The Wrong Man is relentless and one of the most intense of Hitchcock's films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget it is Hitchcock and appreciate it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this movie would have been universally praised if Hitchcock had used an assumed name to direct it, since a lot of the negative comments are to the effect that it is not a typical Hitchcock. And that is the case, since this is a straightforward telling of what is presented as a true story of a man falsely accused of robberies. And there is no twist at the end. However, there is some truly great work here. Consider the opening credit scenes that have Henry Fonda (as Manny Balestrero) playing the bass in a small orchestra in New York's Stork Club. At the start of the sequence there is a ballroom full of dancers and, as the credits go on, one scene morphs into another with each successive scene having fewer dancers. By the end of the credits we are down to closing time and Manny is heading home. Brilliant opening credits auguring good things to come.The movie has some of the of the best black and white cinematography ever. Whether it is a car moving across a bridge through light and shadows or a close-up of a woman's eye peering suspiciously at us, the cinematography alone held my attention.Fonda and Vera Miles do a great job in playing how a man and his wife react to false accusations, with Fonda playing the innocent who is trying to deal with a bad situation in a most responsible and rational manner and Miles cracking under the pressure. Fonda says a lot with his eye movements--a quick glance to the side or a disbelieving stare tell us a lot. I always wonder who gets the credit for such effective use of what movies can uniquely portray. Is it the director, the cinematographer, the art director, the actor?For me the emotional involvement was established by considering how I would react to such a case of false accusation and arrest. And, equally importantly, how would I handle dealing with a wife buckling under the pressure. Probably not as well as the Fonda character. The backdrops are rather grungy--stark bare walls, crumbling plaster, exposed lamp cords, claustrophobic jail cells, sparsely furnished court rooms. Interesting to note that this was filmed a decade before the Miranda warning requirement. You get so used to seeing that in crime dramas that you miss it when it is not there.The Bernard Hermann score is not as prominent as many of his are. Much of it is played on the bass; a tie-in to Manny's profession?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite its generic title, this is a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the common way of considering Hitchcock's career, The Wrong Man is a generic and somewhat mediocre Hitchcock film. Not true. This is one of Hitchcock's best, made during the same era as many of his other major masterpieces, Rear Window and Vertigo, for instance. This is completely different than any other of his films, which is probably why it is so underrated. This is the only film that Hitchcock tried to make realistic. It's based on a true story: a man is misidentified as an armed robber. The entire film is about how the police treat him, how his wife becomes neurotic and paranoid, and then his trial. It's all done simply, and there is great suspense built up as well as a lot of pathos for Manny, played by Henry Fonda in one of his best performances. His wife is played by Vera Miles, who is convincing as a woman going insane (although I'd rate her higher in Psycho). The courtroom scenes are very probably the most effective ever filmed - I generally despise that basic scene type. Here, they are very suspenseful. Hitchcock dismissed the film as mediocre. I wish he wouldn't have. His direction is as good here as it was anywhere. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well shot and acted crime drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christopher Balestrero (Fonda) is mistaken for a bank robber and has no evidence to support his innocence.The first film of the greatest British director to be based on a true story Alfred Hitchcock gleefully sets the viewer up for the ride by standing in the middle of an unknown place and telling us so. As the screen fades and we meet Henry Fonda in his home with Vera Miles and kids we have a set up for a tantalizing story of mistaken identity and criminal injustice.Initially the build up is fairly sluggish as Christopher is leading a pretty standard family portrayal and after ten minutes or so we follow the main character into the bank to enquire about a loan and then the ante is generated.The bank recognizes the face of Christopher to be the face of a recent robber in the area, and after skilfully denying the application, the bank turn him away. A wonderfully shot pickup at his very home and Chris is involved with the police who order him to walk into stores and back out so the cashiers and workers can identify him. This tactic by the police is certainly different from your stereotyped police perception in modern crime films and as with Hitchcock's fear of the Police, they certainly generate a calm but underlining authority over everyone.The plot continues to spell out challenges for Fonda's character who suffers torment and pain physiologically and physically in the hands of the police in prison. One excellent moment comes when Hitchcock places Fonda against the wall in his cell, giving the feeling of horrible claustrophobia and uses the camera to swivel around and around, giving off haziness and a delicious sense of nausea.Fonda does well in the lead role, capturing the personality of a known innocence but struggling to deal with the new surroundings and predicament he is in. He is however not as captivating in this role as other big names in Hitchcock films, such as Cary Grant.What was a great surprise however was Vera Miles as Chris' wife. In almost a supporting role she is quietly accurate as a troubled wife and her decent into madness would make Hamlet look silly. This spices up an added sense of drama and contributing to the real story scenario, it is a credit to the actress.The plot moves slowly with a few action sequences and bearing in mind this is a real event that was inevitable but for Hitchcock you expect more and the film is almost a sad let down because of it.Nevertheless this is still well shot with a glorious exploration of the law order with some wonderful performances and excellently set up scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The wrong time, the wrong place</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is hard to imagine how anyone of us could be wrongly accused of having committed a crime, when in reality, one is really innocent. This nightmare is what happens to Manny Balestrelo, a bass player at the famous Stork Club of Manhattan. When Manny is introduced to us, we watch him playing at the club; later on, we follow him into a deserted Fifth Avenue subway station as he goes home to Queens. Manny reads the Daily News and the ads for new homes in the suburbs catch his attention. His nightly routine involves stopping for a cup of coffee at the Bickford's that was on the corner of Roosevelt Ave. and 74th Street. There, he would dream about picking the right horses running later in the day. Being a conservative man not making much money, one doubts if he even bets when his budget doesn't allow it.Manny is clearly a family man. He adores his wife Rose and his two sons. Rose is having dental problems. Her four wisdom teeth are giving her problems, something her dentist suggested to have them removed to help with her discomfort. The problem is money. As much as Manny thinks about it, there doesn't seem to be an alternative but to borrow the $300 that are needed against Rose's insurance policy. In order to do that, Manny must go to the office, located right above his usual subway entrance, at the Victor Moore building.Little does he know that upon entering the office, the teller at the window is immediately horrified. The reason, the agency was robbed not too long ago by a man wielding a gun inside his coat pocket like Manny is seeing doing. That bandit made the cashier give him the money in the drawer. Acting discreetly, this teller goes to check with the others in the rear of the office; they all agree this man at the window is the same man that held them up. After the police is notified, Manny is picked up as he was about to enter his house and taken to the 110th Precinct for investigation.Thus, Manny Balestrero's nightmare begins. Being innocent, he goes along with all that is asked of him. Unfortunately, the evidence the detectives have stacked against Manny will work to make him appear he is none other than the criminal that has terrorized the neighborhood. To make matters worse, after the Balestrero's get a kind lawyer to help them, Rose gets into a depression that will land her in an institution. Everything conspires against this man that has told the truth all along.Alfred Hitchcock loved stories like this one in which someone is wrongly accused and has to fight to set things right. This is not the typical film that Hitchcock liked to give the movie going public, and yet, "The Wrong Man" has its own suspense because we know the police and justice have a way of betraying a man like Manny Balestrero. The director even hints that part of Rose's breakdown stems from the fact she might have considered the possibility of Manny, who has had money problems before, being really guilty, something that adds another dimension to the narrative.This is a different kind of Hitchcock film, in that it has a quiet intensity that judging by a lot of the comments submitted to this forum reveal how viewers have no patience when everything points out that Manny Balestrero is doomed from the start. Hitchcock's mastery in telling a story is not to be dismissed lightly, specially by today's audiences that are so used to special effects as a way to make, or break a film. This story, after all, is based on a real incident that happened to real people. In a way Hitchcock style here is almost documentary in the way the story is presented to his audience.Mr. Hitchcock must have suspected the possibilities of Maxwell Anderson's story to be made into a full motion picture. That is why he engaged Mr. Anderson, a notable playwright on his own, to expand on the original idea with the help of Angus MacPhail. As usual, Bernard Herrman created the musical score that adds another layer to the story. Robert Burks, the cinematographer, took his camera out to several Queens and Manhattan locations to make it feel authentic.Henry Fonda underplays his Manny Balestrero, something that works well in the film. Manny appears to be resigned to a fate that will put him away for crimes he didn't commit. This performance will stand among the best of this dignified man, and in a way, points to his triumphal appearance in what would become another milestone in the American cinema, "Twelve Angry Men". Vera Miles does also an excellent job in the way her Rose goes from being a loving and supporting wife, to one that contemplated ideas about her husband not being the man she thought. Her breakdown stems out of her inability to do more for her man.The supporting cast is also first rate. Anthony Quayle a fantastic English actor plays Frank O'Connor, a man that in real life was at the center of the justice system in New York City becoming Queens District Attorney. Harold J. Stone, a character actor in many films and television programs plays the detective investigating Manny. Esther Minciotti who shows up as Balestrero's mother was Ernest Borgnine's mother in "Marty". Nehemiah Persoff is seen briefly as Manny's brother-in-law. Among the uncredited players Werner Klemperer, can be seen as a psychiatrist. Also Bonnie Franklin and Tuesday Weld are the laughing girls answering a door.This is a Hitchcock film to be savored by discerning fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid, Thought-Provoking Drama Of An Innocent Man's Nightmare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Manny Balestrero is the bass player at a nightclub in New York. One night he is picked up by the cops and charged with two robberies after some witnesses identify him and he cannot provide an alibi. How can he prove his innocence ?In sharp contrast to the glamorous, evocative, stylish thrillers of The Man Who Knew Too Much and Vertigo which adjoin it in Hitchcock's career, The Wrong Man is a deliberately ordinary, unsensational, frighteningly plausible story of mistaken identity. It was based on a true story, no details were altered and it was shot in many of the actual locations in New York where it happened (notably The Stork Club, a famous hangout in midtown Manhattan). What Hitchcock and Fonda achieve here is a disturbingly real, almost documentary-like portrayal of how it feels to be criminalised. And although Manny only spends a brief time in confinement, the terrible bewildering process is depicted with intense detail. Even worse than the trauma of the arrest are the after-effects on his life, specifically his wife's nervous breakdown, his fruitless search to clear his name and his endless money worries (bail, lawyers, doctors). Hitchcock had a pathological fear of being arrested (he never drove a car so he wouldn't get a ticket) and his film gently but firmly reminds us that no matter how robust any justice system is, there is always the capacity for honest mistake. Nobody deliberately maligns Manny - even the witnesses who ID him genuinely think they're doing the right thing - but he and his family are cruelly victimised and only escape via good fortune. Both Fonda and Miles are excellent in the leads; his Everyman performance ranks with The Grapes Of Wrath and 12 Angry Men (his next film), and she is even better than in her much more famous subsequent appearance for Hitchcock in Psycho. The great director proves here, as he did so often in his career, what a gifted range he had as a filmmaker, skilfully adapting his style to best suit the drama and the atmosphere of the piece. Unusually in this film he does not make a cameo appearance, but instead appears in shadow to deliver a brief introduction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen a majority of Hitchcock's films, and though "The Wrong Man" may not be in the same league as movies like "Shadow Of A Doubt", "Notorious", "Vertigo" and "Rear Window", it's a classic in it's own right.I have read some of the critic's reviews of this film, stating how it was a failure as a "Neorealist" film. While it is certainly true that the film was inspired by the Italian Neorealistic movement, it was equally inspired by the elements of classic film noir. There are three major elements that makes this film such a chilling, engrossing, uneasy film to watch: 1) Alfred Hitchcock's masterly command of this genre, combined with its stark realism; 2) the way both Hitchcock and Henry Fonda make us identify with the character through his entire ordeal; and 3) the way Hitchcock makes it appears as if this could happen to anyone, given the right set of circumstances.Few circumstances are more compelling than a good man unjustly accused of terrible crimes. And few filmmakers illustrate this concept better than Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Racism glossed over</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What 'The Wrong Man" lacks is the racial context of the era. Manny was the 'wrong man' because he was an ethnic American. In 1950s New York, Italians, Puerto Ricans and other Latinos were not treated equally and were judged by their looks or their accents rather than their actions. The Fifties were also the setting for "West Side Story." first a Broadway play then an award-winning film, and Paul Simon's failed Broadway musical "The Capeman," which like "The Wrong Man" was also based on a true story. This movie is a wonderful reminder why we need laws such as the Miranda Warning given today to any person apprehended by the police: "You have the right to remain silent...call a lawyer, or one will be assigned to you." Thank God for all those "liberal" laws. Let's pray that Bush's Supreme Court will preserve them. Kudos to Hitch for tackling reality!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unique Hitchcock classic, involving and affecting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Henry Fonda is a bass player for a band in the Stork Club in New York City. The club is real and they filmed scenes inside the actual club. Vera Miles is his loving wife and they have two boys. He is wrongfully accused of a crime and we share his experience. That's the basic premise of this movie. It's all based on a true story and as I understand, it's quite accurate. This movie is very different from Hitchcock's other films. He even introduces it himself in person, speaking directly to the audience explaining so.Normally, Hitchcock films revolve around murder, intrigue, suspense, the anticipation of disaster, deception, extreme human emotions like paranoia and obsession, characters doing risky things and hoping to not get caught. The Wrong Man is unique among his films that I've seen. We simply go through the motions of a man being mistakenly arrested. It's a scary concept but one that is obviously realistic. Many innocent people have been put to death or spent years in jail. And this movie delves into the kinds of emotions such a disturbing turn of events could provoke.I think it works because it focuses on Henry Fonda's point of view. We put ourselves in his shoes and feel his growing frustration and apprehension. The cops seem more like mean mob gangsters than righteous police officers. They treat him the way perhaps a violent criminal might deserve. But knowing he's innocent turns the crime back on the police. They take him through some tests and assure him that an innocent man has nothing to worry about. But they are increasingly brusk and it seems clear that they quickly find his innocence laughable.I recognised Herrmann's style early on. It's such great music. I love his motifs. Little slices of melody repeating with harmonic tension coming and going. It just works so well. It really enriches the movie and adds to the atmosphere.I love Hitchcock's direction. It really brings out emotion. We get quiet, close shots. Low angles, shadows. But mainly in key parts, not constantly. The film suddenly becomes dream-like but not in an obvious way. We feel as though time slows down and we meditate on this moment that lasts an eternity. Is that the killer? I can't bear to look. He focuses on what the characters are seeing and how they feel about it. The camera-work reflects their mental states.Fonda's innocent, fearful face is haunting. His wide open eyes. His confused, concerned expression. How is this possible? Is this really happening? He is so calm under the circumstances. They casually deny him the right to first speak to his wife. He's always on time and doesn't want her to be concerned. When he finally gets a temporary break from his ordeal, a relief from having his freedom abruptly taken away, he nearly collapses. Suddenly the weight of it hits him. He didn't have time to feel anxious, he was in survival mode. It reminds me of Tom Hanks at the end of Captain Philips or even the way you seem to sweat more *after* you finish running than during.There is a scene with a lawyer where Vera Miles visibly withers during a shot. It's subtle but powerful. You feel this cold hopelessness fall upon her. Resignation to her husband's fate. Any sane person would go insane in such a situation. There is no way to rationally accept that your loved one will be wrongfully put away in jail and there's nothing you can do about it. We want to feel hope and probably she does as well. But subconsciously she knows the chances are slim. And such thoughts can consume you.The Wrong Man may seem like a simple movie. No complicated plot or side-plots or too many characters. Not many twists really. Its suspense is in the slow torture of everything going wrong for an innocent man with a nice family. It can be hard to watch at times. But it observes the human emotions involved so honestly. We enjoy it because we really feel something and connect with the characters.It raises some moral questions as well. What kind of a legal system allows such errors, such injustices? The unnecessary stress and pain caused could be incalculable. I admire the way this film was made and it was every bit as tense and engaging as Hitchcock's other masterpieces. It is also quite moving and I even feel like I developed a love for the characters. I wanted to hug them and comfort them. I don't know how I would cope in such a situation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different but very underrated Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films(Psycho, Vertigo, Rear Window, Rebecca, Notorious, The Lady Vanishes, Strangers on a Train, Shadow of a Doubt, North By Northwest and The Birds), but one of his most underrated along with I Confess, Sabotage, Stage Fright, Foreign Correspondent and Spellbound(as well as to a lesser extent The Trouble with Harry, which was badly marketed at the time). Certainly better than Juno and the Paycock, Jamaica Inn, Under Capricorn, Topaz and The Paradine Case. The only thing that came across as a flaw was the rushed ending, everything else however was great. The production values are stark but evocative and The Wrong Man generally very well-photographed and atmospheric, loved the close-ups and use of shadows making for some good unsettling moments. There are no gimmicks, witty dialogue, memorable climaxes or Hitchcock cameo so to speak, with Hitchcock directing in a restrained and sombre documentary-like approach. This approach works wonders though, the story- using a familiar theme but doing it differently- is suspenseful, gripping and with genuine bite realism(there are also some sentimental scenes that are very poignant and not cloying or misplaced at all), and aided by Bernard Hermann's unobtrusive and subtly haunting score and tense dialogue. Henry Fonda is superb, he does underplay but he is very believable. Vera Miles is as well and is incredibly moving in the second half. Anthony Quayle is appropriately distinguished and he still performs conscientiously in a role that may have benefited though from having an American actor doing it. In conclusion, a fine film, different for Hitchcock but deserves a lot more attention. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Virtually forgotten, but a worthy addition to the Hitchcock canon nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE WRONG MAN is a virtually forgotten Hitchcock movie, made with a relatively low budget and never spoken about compared to the director's other films from the same era: DIAL M FOR MURDER, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, etc. I never even knew it existed until I saw it on the TV schedules.Having watched it, I can see why it's so unknown. It's played deadly straight - there's no light humour from Cary Grant-alikes or anything to soften the drama. It tells a true story, which is unusual for a Hitchcock film. There's no action, no thrills and explicit scenes of danger or excitement.Instead, this is a tense, realistic piece of human drama about a miscarriage of justice perpetrated by the New York Police Department on an unsuspecting man. Yes, Hitchcock was very fond of the 'wrong man' type story, but this is the narrative at its most pure and undiluted, a thorough exploration of the flaws in the justice system.Henry Fonda is outstanding as the innocent man caught up in a growing nightmare, and he's lent excellent support by both Vera Miles as his suffering wife and Anthony Quayle as his inexperienced lawyer. The tale is gripping throughout, from the first case of mistaken identity, through one of the most horrifying courtroom scenes I've ever witnessed, to the bittersweet conclusion. THE WRONG MAN is a great film - one of the director's best!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bleakly Fascinating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No wonder Hitchcock reassures us in a prologue that this is indeed his production. The film's about as far away from his Technicolor romance-suspense films as he could get. The style here is bleak, documentary, and utterly cheerless. No trademark Hitch amusement sneaking in anywhere. Poor Manny (Fonda) appears in the grip of a dark fate from which there's no escape. One minute he's a struggling family man; the next he's in a tiny cell, all because of mistaken "eye witnesses" to a crime. No matter which way he turns, circumstance conspires against him. Manny may not see the dark hand of fate at work here, but wife Rose (Miles) sure as heck does as she wilts under the growing pressure of no hope. As a true story, the movie can throw a special scare into anyone that is really much worse than the usual brand of Hitchcock horror, inasmuch as it's the agents of good that have been turned into the tools of malevolent fate. I think it's especially revealing that Hitch refuses to end the visuals in a reassuring manner? instead, it's a bleak wife Rose hanging onto a limp curtain. But not to worry, the required 50's happy ending is reserved for an epilogue, which, however, doesn't seem reassuring at all. Small wonder this grim exercise is the least known of the master's 1950's output. Nonetheless, the film remains a bleakly fascinating glimpse of happenstance gone wrong.(In passing-- The almost literal assertion of divine intervention comes across more like an unartful, compromising contrivance, than anything worthy of the movie's documentary style or of Hitchcock himself.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excruciatingly realistic tale about an everyman, whose life starts spiraling out of control and ends up being a total wreck, because of a horrible turn of events on one seemingly normal day. Accused of a crime he didn't commit, Henry isn't able to persuade the jury and the townsfolk that he didn't rob a bank. Due to unreliable witnesses, their confessions, and bits of evidence, he is put on trial, which is too biased to end up happily. While he will never be able to recover from this traumatic events, and this occurrences will haunt him forever, the person, who suffers most is his wife. Though emotionally unstable, the impact of this nightmare puts her in a mental institution. With its somber, though tranquil at times, tone The Wrong Man is a haunting story. It gains much strength from the fact that it was exclusively shot on location, where the case took place. Henry Fonda's tour de force, and Vera Miles is so realistic in her portrayal of his wife, that it's really painful to watch at times. Lesser-known Hitchcock, but nevertheless its realism will haunt the viewer forever.</fullReview>

I enjoyed most of the Hitchcock films and he truly is the master of building suspense. No matter how old the movie is, when Hitchcock builds the story you would not realize that it is 50/60 years old. However I felt a little dejected regarding the handling of the madness of the wife. Well overall, the film is a visual treat in every sense and defines what Hitchcock is. "A must watch for all fans of suspense and a recommended watch for all."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Men with Good Intentions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "The Wrong Man" Henry Fonda plays Manny, an Italian-American, and family man to the core. He's gentle to his wife (Vera Miles) whom he loves very much, and he handles their two young boys with tact, diplomacy and affection. He seeks to understand and to provide judicious insight and fairness when there are differences of opinion. He listens carefully to both sides of the story. He doesn't tear down but builds up their self-esteem. He's reliable, punctual, patient and quietly optimistic. Manny seems a bit reserved, emotionally. The family is in debt and never seems to be able to get ahead. If it's not one thing it's another ? now it's necessary dental work that will put them in the hole again. Perhaps his job playing the bass fiddle at the Stork Club eases the tensions of weighty responsibilities. Both his boys are budding musicians, as well, so he's surging with pride. When disaster blindsides him he doesn't see it coming. His qualities as a man, a husband, and a father will be essential in the dark days ahead. More to the point, they are in stark and frightening contrast to what he encounters in the outside world. The way I've written this, the movie sounds like an episode from "The Twilight Zone". It could very well be. But it's an Alfred Hitchcock masterpiece, one that has eluded me until now."The Wrong Man", in Hitchcock's hands, is a breathtaking police procedural that has a few things in common with Terry Gilliam's "Brazil", in which the wrong man is named Tuttle, not Ruttle (or is it the other way around?). "The Wrong Man" examines the minutiae of the process that ensnares an innocent man and his family in a legal and judicial system run by men with good intentions. It picks away at the kind of man that Manny is and his cherished belief in understanding, fairness and open-mindedness, and declares them irrelevant in this alien world of tersely-barked commands and tediously-issued judgements amid the drone of an uncaring bureaucracy.Fonda is amazing. He keeps his body still and gestures minimal, and acts with his eyes (like Ryan Gosling in "Half Nelson"). He reveals just enough of the grinding panic behind Manny's stoic demeanour. His eyes dart everywhere, seeking to decipher events as they crowd into his field of vision and consciousness. What's happening? What does it mean? Why don't they believe me? Evidence is lined up in a configuration that is logical to THEM, those bureaucrats, all men with good intentions. Alone in his jail cell Manny stares out of his barred window at a featureless brick wall.Anything else I might say would result in unwanted spoilers, because there are some startling twists in store, and they are better appreciated fresh. I have to add, though, that Vera Miles' performance is stunning, and it's easy to see why she was Hitchcock's first choice for the female lead in "Vertigo".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Grim Movie about the Whims of Fate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a bleak, sad, at times frightening movie with none of the sardonic humor or bravura techniques of other Hitchcock films. Indeed, it is done in a spare, documentary style, befitting its basis in fact. I'm told that Hitchcock filmed the story in the very apartment, insurance office, precinct house, and jail cell where the real events took place.One watches in fascination as Henry Fonda's character, an ordinary man in spite of working in the fashionable Stork Club, endures one fearful event after another, until his misery spreads to his wife with terrible consequences. They are truly Mr. and Mrs. Job. Mere chance was the cause of it all, just as mere chance put an end to it.Fonda and Vera Miles are totally believable in their roles. The great Bernard Hermann contributes a subdued but ominous score, as well as a terrific Latin number for the opening in the Stork Club. Here is a movie where Hitchcock's technique does not overshadow real content. There's plenty of technique in The Wrong Man, but it is a film full of meaning, from the grimness of the criminal justice system as most people never see it, to the arbitrariness of the fate that really defines our lives.A fine picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That's Him, Number 4</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the most serious film Alfred Hitchcock ever directed. It sets back police detectives to the stone age. Based upon a true story, this film presents the greatest case for the 1960's Miranda Rights ever put on film. The main character (Henry Fonda in an excellent performance) is arrested for robbery &amp; assault based totally upon eyewitness identification without any physical evidence. He is arrested despite total cooperation with authorities in a terribly botched investigation.Vera Miles plays his wife who supports him until a mental collapse caused by all the stress the arrest makes in their lives. Her husband is a musician who works at the famous (then) Stork Club in New York City. There are some images Hitchcock uses in this film which he does reuse in part later in other films.The jail cell sequences are particularly strong as Hitchcock explores his own inner fear of being locked up while innocent from his own childhood. The ferris wheel jail cell sequence is almost hypnotic. This film is the reason Vera Miles was Hitchcocks choice to do Vertigo a year later, only to have her pregnancy change his plans. Miles performance here proves she could have brought it off. A very small role in this by Werner Klemperor (Col Klink on Hogans Heroes ) as a shrink evaluating Miles character breakdown is one of the support actors who show up. Some of the people in the cast were actually witnesses in the real true story put on film here.Though not a large commercial success, this film is not a disappointment to the film student of Hitchcock. It still shows his story telling techniques on film very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cinematic Tithe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I read that Hitchcock did this movie without salary, it only confirmed my suspicions about this film. Like Job, Manny Balestreros provides a subject for Hitchcock to discuss the deepening of faith through misfortune. Certainly, "The Wrong Man" is a more deeply religious film than "I Confess" where religion is used more as a device to create conflict.Unlike many reviews have suggested, this movie on it's deepest level is not grim, but very edifying. It demonstrates how God can use personal tragedy to bring about greater faith, with the real suspense being how it's protagonist will react to tragedy, i.e., with despair or hope.The movie builds up to it's climax by presenting a man who, despite the normal pressures of life, is kind, patient, loving toward his family and basically content. All of that changes through no fault of his own, but simply because of his resemblance to a criminal who has robbed several businesses in his neighborhood. He is identified as the culprit and thus begins his ordeal. He is accused and arrested for crimes he did not commit, while circumstances conspire to undermine any defense he may have had. He loses his greatest love, his wife, to insanity so that she is unable to reciprocate his love or support him during his greatest trial, he is on the brink of financial ruin, and just as his case seems to be heading toward resolution, a mistrial is declared forcing him to go through the stress and anxiety of another trial and the very real prospect of facing prison. It is after all these circumstances have been set before the viewer that the film's message is revealed. Manny enters the his kitchen and his mother is there knitting at the table. Manny expresses his feelings of despair and questions whether it wouldn't have been better to have been found guilty and imprisoned. His mother asks him if he has prayed to which he responds that he has (we've seen the Rosary prominently at his trial - the final shot of one scene focusing on the crucifix, the image of another man falsely accused, tried and punished).His mother then asks what he's been praying for, to which he responds "help". Then in perhaps the most significant line of the film, she tells him that he should be praying for strength. Strength for what? Well, given the prominence of the Christ imagery in the film, one can only assume it's the same prayer that Christ made in the Garden: The strength to accept God's will. Indeed the very next scene reinforces the significance of this connection as Manny walks back into his room to fix his tie, but instead fixes his eyes on the image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus on the wall. He stares at it while the camera moves close to his face as he's clearly mumbling a prayer. As he's mumbling the prayer the image of a man walking along the street toward the camera is superimposed over Manny's face. The image comes closer and closer until the faces overlap - closely resembling each other but not the same. All the while Manny's lips are moving in prayer until finally Manny's face disappears and we follow the other man. It's at this point, the point of Manny's prayer for strength, that the conclusion of Manny's ordeal begins.Manny, like Job, learns that God is not there just to help in difficult times, but realizes that God is a much more integral part of his life. His faith moves to a level that recognizes that everything he has is not really his, nor is he really in control of his life. His faith has been changed from a shallow one that's only active in time of need to one that recognizes our dependence on God in all things and at all times. Manny has finally resigned himself, without despairing, to God's will. As with Job, the mystery of suffering is given meaning by a supernatural outlook. I can't help but believe that Hitchcock had that in mind. In a way, this is Hitch's most overtly religious film, his offering to a world in need of a deeper understanding of suffering - a cinematic tithe, so to speak. Why else would he have directed and produced this movie without salary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No, not Hitchcock's best but maybe his most politically significant film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anybody who thinks the Miranda warning coddles criminals should be sentenced to watch Alfred Hitchcock's The Wrong Man. It may not change anybody's mind, but it sure supplies food for thought. In 1956, with several masterpieces behind him and two or three yet to come, Hitchcock was the most famous film-maker in the world. And he departed from his pure-cinema suspense fictions to take a quasi-documentary (and black-and-white) look at a true story. Based on a journalistic novel by Maxwell Anderson (who co-wrote the script), it's a cautionary tale about how easily justice can miscarry.Christopher Emanuel Balestrero (Henry Fonda) plucks bass in the combo at Sherman Billingsley's Stork Club in Manhattan. When he finishes his gig near dawn, he rides the subway back to Jackson Heights, Queens, to his wife (Vera Miles) and two sons. He makes only $85 a week, and Miles' wisdom teeth need to come out. One day he shows up at his insurance office to borrow against her life insurance. A strange look greets him from the teller, who is soon whispering to her co-workers; they're certain he's the man who robbed them some months earlier. The police are alerted and pick Fonda up for questioning. The lieutenant (Harold Stone) seems amiable enough, so Fonda goes along with their extensive requests, including writing out two copies of a stick-up note. In the second one, he misspells `drawer,' as did the original. That's enough for the police, and Fonda's locked up for the night. When the women from the insurance agency identify him, he's charged with the crime. Finally out on bail raised by friends and family, he engages a willing but inexperienced lawyer (Anthony Quayle). It's an uphill battle, but not a hopeless one. But then his wife begins to disengage from reality....In its pace, The Wrong Man brings to mind another dogged exploration of a miscarriage of justice, Henry Hathaway's Call Northside 777. Hitchcock unfolds the story slowly, deliberately, rarely resorting to his showy set-pieces (when he does, as when the camera spirals around Fonda's face alone in his cell, it's jarring ? out of kilter with the rest of the movie). Other faults, of course, can be cited. Fonda, passive and low-key, is splendid (he always was) but he's miscast. With his distinctive Jack Benny-ish gait and WASPish reserve, he doesn't belong to the ethnic family he's dropped into. From the background we're shown, the real Balestrero would have kicked up a ruckus when the police tried to get him to incriminate himself (though it probably wouldn't have done him much good). Fonda stays civil and self-controlled, as though the best mouthpiece in New York were speeding his way to the precinct. And Miles' sudden slide into catatonia, causing her to be institutionalized, is laid to the trauma of the wrongful charge; whatever may have happened to Mrs. Balestrero, its causes must have been long in the making (though Hitchcock presents the hints of her estrangement adroitly, and Miles obliges).The Wrong Man numbers among Hitchcock's `lesser' films, and it's hard to argue persuasively against that ranking. But it's far from the failure that The Paradine Case was, or as forgettable as pleasant confections like To Catch A Thief or Dial M For Murder. From the routine assumption of Fonda's guilt during his initial interrogation to the tedious charades at his trial, Hitchcock presents a criminal justice system that's as impersonal as it is implacable. And the movie's too-pat, deus-ex-machina resolution drives the point home: If that god hadn't popped out of the machine, Fonda would have been convicted and sentenced. The Wrong Man may be the only politically significant movie Hitchcock ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Manuel Balestrero is a nice man. He and his wife Rose are raising two fine boys and worrying about things like installment plans. Manny has a steady job playing bass fiddle in a Manhattan night club. He is a tee-totaller, and though he picks winners from the pony sheet in the newspaper, he does not gamble.  A man has been robbing stores on the 110th Precinct's patch. Detectives are on the lookout for a suspect. When Manny pops into his neighbourhood insurance office in Jackson Heights, nervous clerks take him to be the robber. Manny's nightmare is beginning ...  Hitchcock's "The Wrong Man" is based on the apparently true story of Manuel Balestrero's arrest and imprisonment for crimes he did not commit. Gripping though the narrative is, Manny's tale (as told onscreen, at least) is hard to believe. An insurance clerk identifies him under deeply unsatisfactory circumstances - she was feeling faint at the time, she glimpsed him fleetingly through a grille, and was under pressure from her colleagues to make a positive ID. A further 'confrontation' ID is set up in a delicatessen, and proves unhelpful to the police. Despite this unpromising state of affairs, detectives persist with the investigation, one officer even putting to Manny the highly misleading proposition that 'several witnesses' have picked him out as the robber. Manny is asked to print out a replica of the hold-up note, and the 'rough similarity' to the original is held by triumphant detectives to be conclusive of guilt. Though Manny has had no opportunity to consult a lawyer, he is placed on an identification parade. The witnesses make their purported identifications in one another's presence, with the very real risk that peer pressure is influencing each selection. Other than having walked into an office, it is far from clear what these witnesses are identifying Manny as having done.  Why is Manny placed in custody? He has strong community ties, and would nowadays receive bail virtually automatically. Admittedly, 1956 can be viewed as a less enlightened age than ours, but is it really the case that defendants were hauled before the courts to be represented by a duty lawyer who had had no opportunity even to meet them, let alone take their instructions? In short, the investigation which ensnared Manny jumped so many legal red lights that one is tempted to say it could never have happened, and yet the author of the book about Balestreros co-wrote the screenplay, so it is unlikely that enormous liberties have been taken with the truth. When all is said and done, "The Wrong Man" is not a training film for law students. It is entertainment for the non-specialist public, and it is, in fact, very good entertainment indeed. When we first see Manny leaving his house in Jackson Heights he is filmed through a gap between two beat cops, the angle of the shot symbolically 'imprisoning' him. Manny's wisdom and goodness in resolving a dispute between his two boys engages our sympathy and ensures that we will view what follows in a light favourable to Manny.  As Manny is driven away in a squad car, we see his home receding in the rear window. His safe, familiar world is fading as he enters a harsh new reality. When the prison van carries him into Manhattan from his cell in Queens (so that he can appear before a grand jury), the lattice of girders on the bridge seems to enclose the van, reminding us of the prison bars, but allowing a fleeting glimpse of the downtown skyline, framed by heavy spars. This symbolises both Manny's brief return to the real world, and the way in which our culture is cramped and limited by our eagerness to incarcerate our fellow citizens.  Once bailed, Manny hires the lawyer O'Connor to represent him. Anthony Quail is great as the attorney, radiating confidence and decency. The District Attorney, in contrast, is a sharp practitioner, unfairly suggesting to the grand jury that gambling debts have driven Manny to robbery.  Sound is used very skilfully to augment the film's meaning. Manny's jazz combo plays its final chord and the musicians immediately pack away, showing that Manny is a professional musician, not a barfly. The hollow echoes of human voices in both the prison and the courtroom emphasise the vastness of the Kafka-like structures into which this unlucky man has fallen. In the bellies of these beasts, he is tiny and vulnerable. When a set of rosary beads is found in Manny's pocket, this reinforces our view of him as a clean-living man, but Hitchcock takes the symbolism further. The camera picks out the dangling crucifix, reminding us that Christ Himself, the ultimate innocent man, was dragged through the courts as part of His final agony.  Vera Miles is memorable as Rose, the simple, good woman whose reason is destroyed by the stress of the criminal proceedings. Her quiet melancholy is extremely impressive. The huge lamp above her head as she is examined represents the beneficent light of science, but the film stops short of offering a happy ending for Rose.  By delivering the prologue, Hitchcock made history of a sort, this being the only one of his films in which he speaks. The blonde one of the two giggling girls who open the apartment door is a very young Tuesday Weld. New York City's Department of Commerce and Public Events assisted with the location work, an early example of the Big Apple's famous co-operation with film makers.  Now for the snags. If Manny is imprisoned in the Long Island City Jail, how come he is released in Queens? Why do Manny and Rose track down witnesses, when this is strictly a lawyers' job? When Rose suffers a mental collapse, Manny asks the unbelievably lame question, "Is it her mind?" The entry of a new character into the narrative in the final reel transforms Manny's situation. A neat 'morph' shows the viewer the importance of the stranger without wasting words. The final confrontation between guilt and innocence offers a striking image which encapsulates the meaning of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who has seen the bibulous work of the late great Alfred Hitchcock will easily recognize this incredible offering. The early Black and White movie is called " The Wrong Man. " It's the true story of Christopher Emanuel 'Manny' Balestrero (Henry Fonda) a simple nightclub Musician who is arrested on his way home for robbery. Never having experienced an arrest before Manny is stunned by the entire ordeal of being photographed, fingerprinted and incarcerated. The effect on his loving wife Rose (Vera Miles) is traumatizing. The director skill-fully allows the dark, shadowy confinement, the black and somber atmosphere to become part of the over all terror of imprisonment. Henry Fonda is superb as Manny and his fellow cast members such as Anthony Quayle, who plays Frank D. O'Connor, his defense attorney, Harold J. Stone, Charles Cooper and Nehemiah Persoff all add to the high drama of the picture. The 1950's movie in retrospect allows modern audience to view how easy it was for an innocent man to be terrorized by the legal system. The word offered by a single witness was enough to punish a man despite his assurances to the contrary. Not much has changed over the decades, the innocent still go to jail and the rich and powerful are still able to purchase exceptional monetary justice. But with Alfred Hitchcock, one get's a victim's close up of the whole experience. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing The Wrong Man is like finding a check for ten million dollars in your back pocket: Where did this come from? The movie is by Alfred Hitchcock and it is one of two or thee of his best. But where did it come from and why is it overshadowed by mediocrities like (yawn) Psycho and The Birds? It is a film as harrowingly powerful as the German expressionist classics, polished by jazzy by a noir score and fueled by anger at a government where a man's life can become a living hell over a crime he didn't commit. The film is based on a true story of a nightclub bass player (touching everyman Henry Fonda) who is arrested for holding up a series of stores. He is put through a nightmarish experience that is filmed with such intensity that I regularly forgot that he was only on trial for robbery and assumed he was on trial for murder (the world of fantastic Hollywood cinema, where anything is possible, sets our standards for excitement so high that something as terrible as bank robbing seems trivial). The ending is uncompromising, which probably explains why critics and audiences haven't given it the word of mouth it deserves. Or perhaps making a film about birds peck peoples' heads off is just more ambitious?</fullReview>

Oddly, Balestrero's attorney had no investigator and Belestrero had to provide much of his own defense. Another unlawyerly thing the counselor did was to make this statement, "Don't worry about my fee, let's just concentrate on proving your innocence."

		<fullReview>Like many of Hitchcock's films, "The Wrong Man" is a story of an average Joe who finds himself caught up in an extraordinary situation. Manny (Henry Fonda) is a docile soul who plays life by the rules. He is as predictable as clockwork in his habits and holds a steady job. He and his wife have two children and struggle to get by when they face medical bills.Peculiar circumstances align, and he is accused of a crime. As a result, his entire world is turned upside down.Hitchcock uses the camera to document Manny's perspective and the strangeness of Manny's new world, including the alien nature of the legal process, from procedures in a police station to legal proceedings in court to the inhumanities of incarceration.The film is based upon an actual criminal case, with liberties taken to heighten the suspense. The core of the story is the series of police procedures for identification that should never be used in today's world. Manny is rightfully scared of the improper and illogical methods used by the police, who apparently don't know any better. Because of Fonda's subdued portrayal of Manny, it is easy for the viewer to see himself in Manny. The film also documents the ancillary costs and the psychological effects of being the focus of a system dedicated to dispensing guilt and punishment.</fullReview>

More a drama than a thriller, for once, as we see the affects on family life and relationships. More character depth, subtlety and human drama than most Hitchcock movies. However, Hitchcock still uses his skills as a master director of thrillers to create a great feeling of claustrophobia and helplessness. Henry Fonda puts in a solid performance in the lead role. However, he is miscast, being far too old for the character. Good support from Vera Miles and Anthony Quayle.Proof that fact is often stranger than fiction...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A jazz musician (Henry Fonda) is wrongly accused of committing armed robbery. Despite being honest and cooperative with the police, the evidence just keeps piling up against him and soon he's suspected of a series of robberies. Very different movie for Alfred Hitchcock. It's based on a true story and is not as flashy or exciting as the other kinds of films he was doing in the '50s. It's also a huge downer. This is the kind of movie they make all the time now. But, at the time, it wasn't commonplace to have a movie that questioned our legal system's infallibility as well as dealt with the effects such things have on the loved ones of the wrongly accused. Henry Fonda and Vera Miles are both excellent. Hitchcock's style here is different than what fans are used to so it might turn off some but, if you give it a shot, I think you'll find it a hidden gem in the great director's oeuvre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's most relentless effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a real case of an innocent man being the prime suspect in an armed robbery, this doesn't have Hitchcock's leavening sense of humour, and after a while, it becomes more of a downer than most of his other work. Still good, still worthwhile, but awfully dark and depressing; but that was doubtlessly the point: to wear us, the audience, down as Fonda's character gets worn down himself. To make us feel as tired and weary as he felt in that predicament. Which also gives this film a more chilling, relentless feel to it, beating us down just as he is feeling beaten down.It is admirable, that Hitchcock sacrificed his own style to tell this particular story: a mystery, Hitchcock's only "Whodunit", without any of his usual trademark suspense, humour, grand spectacle, or chase finales.Perhaps in attempt to be more 'film noir', film was shot in high contrast black-and-white, an interesting experiment, but that, in and of itself, wore me down after a while, too. Claustrophobic. Expressionistic, slightly.It is a good movie, but not one of my favourite Hitchcock's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock directed this realistic(based on fact) story that stars Henry Fonda as Manny Balestrero, who works in a jazz band in the Stork Club. One day, while visiting his Insurance office trying to get a loan on a policy, he is wrongfully identified as a man who had previously robbed them twice before. Manny is arrested for the crime, putting further stress on his already depressed wife Rose(played by Vera Miles) which will ultimately overwhelm her. Manny desperately tries to convince the police that this is just a case of mistaken identity, before it is too late... Starkly directed and acted film is quite effective, most unusual for Hitchcock, but also most welcome. Lesser known and underrated, though worth seeking out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>English screenwriter, producer and director Alfred Hitchcock's 46th feature film which he produced, was written by English screenwriter Angus MacPhail (1903-1962) and American playwright, poet and journalist Maxwell Anderson (1888-1959) and is based on a Life Magazine article from 1953 called "A Case of Identity" by American journalist and writer Herbert Brean (1907-1973) and the novel "The True Story of Christopher Emmanuel Balestrero" by Maxwell Anderson. It was the final film Alfred Hitchcock (1899-1980) made for Warner Bros. Pictures and is an American production. It tells the story about Manny Balestrero, a middle-aged jazz musician who lives with his wife Rose and their two young sons in New York City where he works at a nightclub. Manny and Rose are not wealthy people so when Rose tells her husband that she needs to see a dentist, he goes to the insurance office and asks if he can borrow from her insurance policy. At the insurance office the employees mistake Manny for an armed robber who has robbed them on earlier occasions and calls the police. After the police has arrived, Manny is identified as the perpetrator by several witnesses. The detectives asks him to give a handwriting sample of a robbery note, but nervous as Manny is he misspells a word and is shown that the same word was misspelled on the robbery note. Manny is charged with the crime and taken to the police station. Here he meets his defence attorney Frank O'Connor and provides him with information concerning his whereabouts during the time the crimes took place, but when Frank tries to locate the people who can vouch for his client it turns out that they are either dead or unreachable.Distinctly and precisely directed by legendary filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock, this profoundly moving film noir draws a compassionate, foreboding and unsettling portrayal of a decent man's struggle to prove his innocence after being mistaken for someone else and to prevent his wife, who becomes so distressed by the case that she has to be committed to a mental institution, from losing her sanity. While notable for it's commendable art direction by American production designer, art director and director Paul Sylbert, black-and-white cinematography by American special effects technician and cinematographer Robert Burks (1909-1968) and the fine editing by American film editor George Tomasini (1909-1964), this low-budget film which is based on a true story depicts a condensed study of character about a man who stands more or less defenceless and helpless against police detectives who has prejudged him.This character-driven and plot-driven mystery which was shot on various locations in New York, USA contains a distinct score by Alfred Hitchcock's long-time collaborator, American composer Bernard Herrmann (1911-1975) which emphasizes it's poignant atmosphere and is impelled and reinforced by it's stringent narrative structure and the prominent acting performances by American stage and film actor Henry Fonda (1905-1982), American actress Vera Miles, English actor and director Anthony Quayle (1913-1989) and American television and film actor Harold J. Stone (1913-2005). A detailed, humane and expressionistic psychological drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock at the top of his Form with Effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Henry Fonda is the method actor behind Christopher Emmanuel (a.k.a Manny), a man who is fraudulently thought to be the robber of quite a bit of money and that he also stole over ?70 on a wager that he claimed to have borried ?50 and in due course would pay it back. Of course, in the beginning we see that a man is already being indicted and then we make a transition to Fonda, so there goes it is already a mishmash of certainty and uncertainty. In prison, the camera deliberately shakes around a frame with Manny in a close-up; it's like we're agitated in the same sequence that he is in.The drawn out sequences in the interrogation actually keep you inquisitive as to how everybody else is getting on and of course that is the same stick with them - only this time it almost feels implausible not to think it was him, but you're forced to assume he's not, as he is so charitable and shows no signs of wrongdoing; this is where it grips you, even though you have such an inclination as to be forced to think it's not him even though it's largely subject to testifying in the movie, you keep wondering who it is. From that one part where Rose was rigid and was closed up on the camera I thought she exhibited the nerves of a guilty person - and there you go that's just one of Hitch's many tricks!There is a religious theme with a pendent that may be the macguffin to the story and how everything prevailed to justice - I don't know and considering this is the basis for a true story I may be mistaken, but I do know that this was his only way of thwarting his spectators during their accusations of him. Fonda does a terrific job and puts on a powerhouse performance which is largely down to the way he has a glimmer in his eye and a real suspicious side, always beating round the bush, under the spellbound nightmares of his trials. Hitchcock is very attentive to the inkling of his audience and still goes way out to surprise and then it comes to a point where you just traverse through it as it becomes futile even pinpointing - and it's quite clearly illustrated in the movie. The monochromatic color gives it a noir mystic and the music drives the story in with its buzzy and ghoulish theme.The children in this movie, like all Hitchcock movies, are perfunctory in their delivery but then again are scarcely in the movie; however, out of the foreground, they still come off to me as extras or supporting actors and they are all right. Even the one who was a disciple of Mozart and admired him!And even in Manny's attempt for truth, the tentative accounts all unfolds and it is all too tragic. They are conspicuously and indistinguishably alike funny enough; but it's not so akin that you wouldn't believe. Really the disguise is what keeps it very much on a wheel of suspense. About Rose being implicated into the case; I have to say I hoped and begged it wasn't her. And then it all came full circle and when you find out who it is, it's really endearing the way the two faces are edited in the frame from different places; the visages are coincided and morphed into the coalescing of one; it's all from the work of a master.So if you are a fan of Hitchcock this may quench your thirst... if you love true stories, this may peek an eye or if you just like Noir then pick this up. It's well paced and is compulsory to follow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Solemn Dossier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock was supposedly very eager to dispel the notion that suspense and surprise are similar. Allegedly in his view, with surprise, the audience discovers something it doesn't know and with suspense, the audience knows something the character doesn't know and watches to see what will happen as the character learns it. Unusually for Hitchcock, there is much more surprise than there is suspense in this film. When trouble begins in The Wrong Man, it begins suspensefully, according to this definition, but it's not long before it's subtly exchanged for pure tension, anticipation and surprise.While the Master is describing in nearly every neutral fine point a disquieting near-miscarriage of justice, Alfred Hitchcock has shaped a solemn dossier. His ethics are heartfelt but they seldom rouse passion or make a viewer's grip tighten. Chillingly accurate, the story creates merely a small amount of drama. Less fuel for high concept, The Wrong Man becomes a rather even-tempered study of oppression.Nightclub bassist and family man Manny Balestrero strolls into a creditors' bureau to become prejudicially scapegoated for robbery. The circumstantial evidence sets in motion a thorough investigation after he's seized by plainclothes cops seeming much more like thugs collecting a delivery for their boss in a gangster film than law enforcement obeying protocol as they're subsequently portrayed to be. They file him through the assorted transgressed establishments, scenes in which self-reflexively cinematic "looking" now becomes narratively organic use of the protagonist. The merciless technical procedure which entraps Manny seems to squeeze and choke him. Cramped spaces emphasize Hitchcock's inversion of his accustomed Wrong Man adventures.Manny scours for alibis, however most anyone who could back him up happens to be?unavailable. His monetary constraints mound. As the case drags on, his wife Rose, played by the typically compelling Vera Miles, disintegrates, consequently turning into an idea-propagating audience for Manny. Via a discreet, even downplayed performance, Fonda unearths the mortal benevolence in the torment Manny. Except the family's response to his capture, Hitchcock contains the film to Manny's perspective, highlighting character over the prearranged story.In reconstructing the character of the actual Balestrero, Fonda produces an disconcertingly level portrayal. No more than intermittently does he vary a faintly hunched, trancelike bearing as he's arrested, interrogated, finger-printed, booked, jailed, etc. The drama resonates at home with the characters, due to the contrast of the performances. Miles suggests a mournfully piteous impression of the outrageous circumstances into which they've been cast. Anthony Quayle gives a sufficiently keen performance as Balestrero's attorney, and Harold J. Stone and Charles Cooper, who make detached but thoughtful detectives; and Doreen Lang and Laurinda Barrett, as frightened witnesses."The length of a film should be directly related to the endurance of the human bladder," Hitchcock famously said. Which could perhaps serve as rationale for why the film's ending feels so rushed. It's a happy ending that feels slapped on, as a lot of true stories that end with codas do. But what relieves us from writing it off is the film's exceptional handling of point-of-view shots and a low-key, unobtrusive and moving Bernard Herrmann score which fuse the undertaking. This is not a typical Herrmann score, but brilliant and sensitive to the subjective and capricious journey of Balestrero. It's literally like the rhythmic, thumping lurch of a man in an overcoat and fedora.Hitchcock is not setting a standard with The Wrong Man. Facts have provided fiction for many films. Hitchcock has done a fine and lucid job with the facts in this interesting trial noir---which nevertheless has had a considerable impact on numerous directors like Godard and Scorsese---but they have been made more important than the hearts and dramas of the people they affect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock, with no doubt in my mind, was the the greatest filmmaker of all time. He knew how to get the perfect shot, the perfect actors, the perfect characters and most importantly, he knew how to tell a very great story. He will truly be remembered for years and years to come as a wonderful director.Now, with all that said, The Wrong Man is a different kind of movie for Hitch. It's a great Noir that focuses more on the punishment of a crime than the crime itself. It gives you a feeling of dread the whole way through because you know that this could actually happen and it turns out that it did happen. It's a very well done film.Henry Fonda rules, that's not an opinion, that is fact. He does a great job as the man who was wrongly accused. Vera Miles is also brilliant in her role as well as Anthony Quayle who was an awesome lawyer. The story is great and also true. This movie moves very well and is extremely relevant to this day and age.If you like Hitchcock, and who doesn't, you should see this one. It's not very typical for his style but it is a great work.

He vehemently protests his innocence but acts thoroughly guilty , leading a host of witnesses and to finger him as a killer . The trial goes badly for Manny, but life is worse for his wife , Rose (Vera Miles) , who cracks under strain and she can't handle the changes wrought in their lives by this gross injustice . The more that Balestrero cooperates, the more guilty he appears to Police Inspector Det. Lt. Bowers (Harold J. Stone) . In order to get his freedom Manny hires a good advocate at law called Frank O'Connor (Anthony Quayle) .Enjoyable and offbeat suspense movie involves a bewildered musician mistaken for a killer being detained and imprisoned . Entertaining mystery based on frightening facts ; it packs drama , intrigue and ordinary Hitch touches . Indispensable seeing this quintessential Hitch movie , demanding various viewings . Alfred Hitchcock's films have become famous for a number of elements and iconography : innocent men wrongfully accused , long non-dialogue sequences , a matter of mistaken identity etc . This film has these particularities ; furthermore contains an exciting intrigue , intense drama , suspenseful situations and keeps the pace at feverish pitch . This theme about innocent person wrongly chased results to be an ordinary issue in Hitch films such as ¨Frenzi¨ , ¨I confess¨ , ¨Saboteur¨ , ¨Young and Innocent¨ , ¨39 stairs¨ , among others . In classic Hitchcock form , he was famous for making his actors follow the script to the word, and in this movie the characters use their dialogue taken from an interesting as well as thought-provoking screenplay by Angus MacPhail from a story by Maxwell Anderson . However , Alfred Hitchcock asked John Michael Hayes to work on the treatment and screenplay of this film for no salary but for a percentage of the profits ; Hayes declined, and their four-picture relationship ended . Although based on a true story , Alfred Hitchcock deliberately left out some of the information that pointed to Manny's innocence to heighten the tension . Magnificent performance from the great Henry Fonda ; the scene where Henry "Manny" Fonda is taken to prison was filmed in a real prison ; as he is led to his cell , you can hear one of the inmates yell out "What'd they get ya for, Henry??", and a bunch of other prisoners laughing . Top-notch acting by Vera Miles as his wife who falls apart under the strain of his ordeal . Very good support cast such as Anthony Quayle as Frank D. O'Connor , Harold J. Stone as Det. Lt. Bowers , Charles Aidman as Jail Medical Attendant and Nehemiah Persoff as Gene Conforti , among others . Alfred Hitchcock filmed one of his usual cameos, as narrating the film's prologue , being the only time he actually spoke in any of his films. Adequate as well as atmospheric musical score by Bernard Herrmann , including jazzy themes . Evocative cinematography by Robert Burks , Hitch's usual , mostly filmed in New York , though when the crew went to film the scenes at the country hotel, Alfred Hitchcock stayed in his limo due to the cold outside and decided to move the production to Hollywood to complete the film . the flick was compellingly directed by Hitchcock and in documentary style . Rating : Above average . The motion picture will appeal to Henry Fonda fans . Essential and indispensable watching for Alfren Hitchcock aficionados .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The true story of Manny Balestrero (Henry Fonda), a musician unjustly accused of armed robbery. Balestrero vehemently protests his innocence but acts thoroughly guilty, leading a host of policemen and witnesses to finger him as the thief. The trial goes badly for Manny, but life is worse for his wife, Rose (Vera Miles), who falls apart under the strain of his ordeal.I love Henry Fonda, I love Alfred Hitchcock and Vera Miles is alright (though I find her character here rather disappointing). The film gets credit for sticking very tightly to the true story, and for using the actual locations when possible. I will say that is admirable, and groundbreaking (this film has been said to influence many others).I guess the only reason I give it a 7 rather than anything more is because the story is ultimately dated. I will not reveal how it turns out, but today's audience may be numb to the idea of an innocent man being falsely accused. And today it would be for a more serious crime than a hold-up.Sadly, this also happens to be Bernard Hermann's most annoying score. I appreciate the simple, subtle approach, but it is grating on the ears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shut up Darwin, hello Jesus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"An innocent man has nothing to fear, remember that." ? Lt BowersPatrick McGilligan, author of "Alfred Hitchcock: a Life in Darkness and Light", states that Hitchcock's oeuvre is "suffused with Catholicism", and points out that Hitchcock was brought up as a Catholic and had a strict Jesuit education. That first part is debatable (McGilligan cites some pretty feeble examples), but McGilligan is nevertheless correct when he goes on to state that of all Hitchcock's films, "I Confess" and "The Wrong Man" are the only two with overtly religious themes. Indeed, a young Jean Luc Godard was so moved by the latter film that he once touted Hitchcock as being one of only two directors to have ever filmed a genuine "religious miracle" (the other being Dreyer)."The Wrong Man" stars Henry Fonda as Christopher Balastrero (his name an overt reference to Christ), a New York-bred Italian Catholic who is wrongly accused of committing a series of robberies. As the film progresses, Fonda becomes a humble Christ figure who is arrested, tormented, interrogated and quickly finds himself sucked into America's labyrinthine legal system.Whilst everyone frets and despairs, concerned that Fonda may be convicted, Fonda himself remains quietly confident. He, somewhat naively, has utmost faith in the American legal system. He believes that the truth will set him free. And of course, just when all hope seems to be lost, the real culprit is convicted - immediately after Fonda says a prayer, no less - and Fonda is released. So in a very broad sense, Fonda is your archetypal Christ figure who suffers, bares our sins, remains steadfast in his faith and is eventually redeemed.The film has been called a "film noir" and likened to Kafka, Fritz Lang and Orson Welles' "The Trial" (also based on Kafka), but these comparisons aren't quite valid. Kafka's novels depict the phantasmatic unconscious world in which man initially, wrongly, experiences bureaucracy as all powerful, all knowing systems. Systems to which he is mercilessly subjected without reason, rhyme, or any prospect of escape save death, but which nevertheless operate with a higher, unseen Reason. The lesson of both "The Trial" and Kafka is, however, that the subject is not guilty, that one may never discover why one is accused, and that The Big Other (bureaucracy, patriarchy, religion, the symbolic order, etc) is itself lacking. It is without answer and often without rhyme or reason. With Kafka and Welles, this realisation leads to the radical collapse of (and belief in) The Other which is itself accompanied by a collapse in personal identity. This collapse results in a profound sense of relief (the subject no longer defines or views himself in the gaze of The Big Other, no longer defers to authority) and a profound sense of anxiety (he achieves subjective destitution), which is very much akin to an existential crisis.With Hitchcock's "The Wrong Man", however, things are COMPLETELY the opposite. Whilst most noirs revolve around a cosmic conspiracy, their narratives embodying a conspiratorial universe which works actively against our hero, "The Wrong Man" begins with a conversation about Darwinian evolution (and its effects on the human jaw) and ends with pictures of Jesus and a miraculous salvation. In a sense, we move from the indeterministic universe of noir, to a universe in which all social order is restored, the power of The Law (be it religious, government or the judicial system) reinstated. In this way it's quite a regressive little film - be good (at the time, Henry Fonda was the poster boy for angelic American values) to God and State and everything will be all right ? possessing none of the challenging or traumatic depths that typified Kafka, or indeed the best noirs and the best Hitchcock.That said, Hitchcock's technique is so beautiful, so flawless, that it's easy to overlook how hokey the film is. Watch how Hitchcock's camera glides through slits in doors. Watch how he morphs faces onto others. Watch how he uses a series of precise cutaways to flesh out Fonda's jail cell. Watch how coolly he details Fonda's absorption into the Justice System. Every shot, every edit, every cast shadow, every camera movement, every bit of choreography in this film is just so damn perfect that we can forgive the film's cop out plot and its soapy subplot in which Fonda's wife suddenly goes crazy and is then magically cured ("Psycho's" silly psychologist speech pops up here as well). And though everyone forgets it, Hitch was an Expressionist (he adored early Lang), and we see him flexing those particular muscles throughout "The Wrong Man". Ironically, or perhaps unsurprisingly, the film is also beautifully detached throughout most of its running time. Like Hitch's "Dial M For Murder", released two years earlier, "The Wrong Man" is methodical, almost like a documentary or aloof machine.Incidentally, when the Cahiers du Cinéma boys began proclaiming Hitchcock as an "auteur", Godard and Truffaut both praised "The Wrong Man" highly. Godard primarily liked the film because it was the first time Hitchcock merged "popcorn cinema" with some larger spiritual or social message. In contrast, Truffaut praised the film mostly for its style. For its pop-expressionism. As Godard and Truffaut became film-makers themselves, their attitude to "The Wrong Man" changed. Truffaut became a maker of bubble gum and began championing lightweight stuff like "North by Northwest" and "To Catch a Thief", whilst Godard became super-serious and outgrew Hitchcock entirely. This led to "The Wrong Man" slipping through the cracks somewhat. It's Hitch's ugly duckling, seemingly abandoned by all.8/10 ? Gorgeous style, and with the kind of procedural-like restraint that appears only in a handful of Hitch flicks (Vertigo, Dial M, Strangers on a Train, Frenzy etc). Thematically the film is regressive, those interested in these themes better out seeking flicks like "The Trial", "Brazil" and "Murder on a Sunday Morning". Worth multiple viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unexpected,offbeat Hitchcock subject</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE WRONG MAN covers a subject matter that Alfred Hitchcock frequently used in a large percentage of his output:an innocent man trying to clear his name over a crime he did not commit.But the details are wholly different from the suave,witty byplay with Cary Grant in TO CATCH A THIEF and NORTH BY NORTHWEST,in rich technicolor, glamorous sets and locations,for example.On this occasion,Hitchcock places his story in Wintry New York,filmed in stark monochrome,with a low-key,almost documentary-style feel to the proceedings,which prevent any elaborate Hitchcockian set-pieces.The main protagonist,Manny (Henry Fonda),a perfectly ordinary,decent and straightforward working man (a musician at a swanky nightclub) is accused of a series of hold-ups,and is seemingly powerless to fully prove his innocence of the crimes in a court of law.In the end,the real villain is eventually captured,but not after his wife Rose (Vera Miles) cracks under the strain and suffers a mental breakdown.THE WRONG MAN is certainly not one of Hitchcock's more typical works,despite the familiar plot line;the pace is deliberately slow and stately,it's hero is of the most modest (if not dull) of proportions,and there are no opportunities for any humorous relief.On the other hand,this does not entirely work against the film.The details of Manny's ordeal after his wrongful arrest and period in the police station are very convincing and even a little harrowing,and Fonda and Miles are impressive as the man and wife haplessly caught in the terrible events that have taken over their lives.Ms Miles herself,an underrated actress, is particularly persuasive as Rose,her gradual mental deterioration very effectively and believably performed,with some very touching and moving dramatic moments.She certainly deserved an Oscar nomination at least for her excellent portrayal of this role,in possibly the best performance of her film career.In the midst of such classics as VERTIGO,NORTH BY NORTHWEST and PSYCHO,THE WRONG MAN has been somewhat unfairly overlooked in this creatively fertile period for Alfred Hitchcock.And while it is true that it lacks the humour,memorable individual sequences and imagery that the above films have in abundance,this is still a diverting and worthwhile attempt by Hitch to approach one of his most favourite subject matters from a more modest,but unusual standpoint.And he still manages to produce some striking moments of cinematic invention,most notably when Fonda's face is gradually superimposed on that of the real hold-up man,just before he commits the crime that will give his game away and clear Manny.The film's only real negative point is the casting of distinguished British actor Anthony Quayle as Fonda's lawyer;Quayle is by no means an embarrassment in the role,but his struggle with an American accent is obvious and one wonders why Hitchcock didn't cast any available US actor in the part.That quibble aside,THE WRONG MAN is still a very well-crafted effort by one of the cinema's masters,and although not one of his very best (it is certainly among his saddest and gloomiest),it is definitely worth further appraisal after being somewhat ignored and undervalued for many years.RATING:7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Story comes first, Hitchcock second</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wrong Man is not the typical Hitchcock movie, although there are the familiar trademarks (beautiful, symbolically charged closeups supporting the action, e.g. a silver hairbrush raised high up, like the knife in Psycho, to strike the main character on the head, the reflection of the main character in the broken mirror seconds after the blow).I do not know why Hitchcock for once decided to make a film that supposedly sticks close to real facts and leaves little room for elegant stylistic means. I suspect that it had something to do with Hitchcocks feelings about religion. Apparently he had a very strict catholic upbringing, and religious motives often appear in his movies. In this case religion is presented in a straightforward way as a means to keep faith. The action leads to a situation in which the wrongly accused main character, Manny Balesteros, can do nothing but pray. There is no rational explanation for the reason why several witnesses are convinced he is a holdup man. The judicial machinery functions faultlessly and relentlessly against Manny. In the face of the coinciding testimonies they have to act the way they do. Manny's wife is physically destroyed by this all and is not able any more to give him support ? no wonder Manny desperately fingers his rosary during the trial.Manny is saved by a police officer attached to his case who crosses the real man that committed the crimes Manny is accused of in the corridor of the police station. After the chance encounter the officer leaves the station, walks away from it, then pauses and turns back. This is presented in a way you think an angel had whispered something in his ear.My guess is that Hitchcock wanted to show the viewers with this "true" story that man is at the mercy of godly powers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Wrong Man, a movie about a man wrongly accused for a crime he didn't commit. But he gets arrested anyway. How do you prove your innocence when the law is working against you? How do you prove your innocence when your wife can't handle the pressure?Henry Fonda does a wonderful job here. In the first half of the film his character is degraded from a normal guy, with a job, house, wife, kids, debts to a low life criminal. Fonda plays this well, the unbelieve radiates from his face. He can't belief what's happening to him, he doesn't understand it. Frustration, anger is what I would expected, but the fact that it didn't does great justice to the character. It's his wife (Vera Miles)who can't handle the pressure. The scene in the bedroom where his wife hits him on the head, the broken mirror, the great acting of Vera Miles is the best scene in the film. It's a turning point in the story. Suddenly you it becomes evident how the events have effected the characters.In the last 30 minutes the story becomes kind of dull. The courtroom-scenes and the discovery of the real suspect are not as strong as the rest of the movie.What I liked most about this movie is the effect the story has on the characters. During the movie I was constantly thinking how the events effected the characters. And for me that's what makes a great movie: if it makes you think it is a good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wrongfully accused</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Bible, the scriptures tell us that it is better for a guilty man to go free than for an innocent man to be condemned. Master director Alfred Hitchcock proves this biblical maxim in his sparse black and white documentary-style thriller based on the real life account of C.E. Balestrero (played by Henry Fonda in an appropriately understated performance). Almost from the opening frames, we see how this simple but financially struggling family man, has his dignity and pride stripped away as complete strangers look at him with all the suspicion, contempt, and fear of a dangerous criminal, all because of an unfortunate resemblance. Seeing this wrongfully accused man be clinically processed by the police, court, and prison systems makes the audience realize just how flawed the justice system can be. However, before one condemns the system, it should be remembered that at least in the Anglo-American legal system, that scholars like Alan Dershowitz rightly praise, there is an attempt to remedy miscarriages of justice. By comparison, in the Third World they simply throw away the key!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Kafkaesque narrative, based on a story that actually happened, starring the highly expressive and excellent Henry Fonda along with a very good, and particularly beautiful Vera Miles alongside him. The classic theme: a man wrongfully accused, his trial and tribulations, and the lingering question, seemingly forever - is he even really innocent at all ? What a man can lose when he is being convicted, often far more than just material loss. His perseverance in this personal battle against what seems to be the entire world. The glimmers of hope, the devastating news, and Fonda's character's world that seems to come apart bit by bit, something almost of a Job's parallel from the Bible.Very well made, constantly compelling and suspenseful in its own way.

		<shortDescription>What happens when the police arrest the wrong man?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Manny Balestrero makes a living as a bassist at a New York club; the money isn't great but he, his wife Rose and their two children get by. Then Rose needs some dental work so Manny goes to cash in an insurance policy? and that is where is troubles begin; the woman who serves him thinks he looks like the man who robbed the place recently; she tells her co-workers and they agree with her. He is arrested just before he gets home and taken to the police station. At first he is more concerned about letting his wife know what has happened than anything else? after all it is a case of misidentification and will soon be sorted out. Unfortunately things aren't sorted, far from it. He is taken to the sites of two other robberies where the victims also identify him. He is quickly charged, processed and remanded to jail. Luckily he is soon bailed and employs lawyer Frank O'Connor. As the trial approaches Manny and Rose try to find witnesses that can confirm that Manny couldn't have done it; the first two they discover has since died and Rose has a breakdown; blaming herself for their predicament. She is taken to a sanatorium while Manny faces trial alone.Alfred Hitchcock made plenty of films about people caught up in crime, but as his introduction states, this is unusual because it is based on real events? knowing this, but not knowing details of the case, made this tenser than it would have been otherwise. Aspects of the story would appear unlikely in a work of fiction; most notably the way some witnesses are allowed to confer and others are primed to expect the robber. Henry Fonda is on great form as Manny and Anthony Quayle impresses as Frank O'Connor but is Vera Miles who stands out as Rose as she suffers a breakdown. As one might expect Hitchcock does a great job keeping the story gripping and using many of the actual locations rather than film sets. As the story progresses it is hard not to feel a sense of injustice and wonder how many other people like Manny there must be. Overall I'd certainly recommend this less well known Hitchcock film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low-Key Analysis of A Man Wrongly Accused of Robbery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Compared with Alfred Hitchcock's more well-known movies, THE WRONG MAN is comparatively low-key in tone, with few of the visual flourishes characteristic of his directorial style. The only really noteworthy moments are the prologue, where the director appears on a darkened and deserted sound stage, his shadow projecting eerily towards the camera as he introduces the action. Later on Hitchcock includes a memorable shot as the camera encircles Manny Balestrero (Henry Fonda) like a Ferris-wheel to suggest his confused state of mind; on another occasion the camera zooms into a letterbox-sized opening in the jail where Manny has been incarcerated and focuses on a close-up of his wild eyes looking left to right in desperation.THE WRONG MAN opts instead for a cinéma-vérité style of presentation more reminiscent of Elia Kazan than Hitchcock. Exterior locations of mid-Fifties New York play a major part in creating the film's atmosphere, from the bustling urban streets to the Brooklyn Bridge stretching far into the background as Manny and his wife Rose (Vera Miles) desperately search for witnesses to provide them with convincing alibis about Manny's whereabouts during the alleged robberies. Hitchcock was also fortunate in being given access to the famous Stork Club - which eventually closed in 1965 - whose bourgeois clientele and rarified atmosphere vividly contrasts with the mean streets outside. Manny spends his evenings as a bass-player in the club's band, inhabiting a goldfish-bowl like world that offers a refuge rather than an engagement with real life.Thematically speaking, THE WRONG MAN shows just how difficult it can be for humanity to control their lives. Manny lives a respectable life in Jackson Heights with his wife and two children, with nary a thing to bother him. Once he has been accused of the crime and thrown into jail, he has little or no means of redress, save for a sympathetic lawyer (Anthony Quayle) who agrees to defend him. Unable to endure the strain of living with guilt - whether true or false - Rose cracks up, and is forced to enter a sanatorium. Even though Manny is eventually cleared of all wrongdoing, Rose cannot be so easily cured; the sequence where she turns away from her husband despite his protestations of love is especially poignant. Maybe she actually still believes that he has committed a crime.The film ends with a written coda informing us that the Balestrero family eventually lived happily ever after in Florida. But this welcome news does not really alter our perception of the film. It is not really a mystery thriller or a film noir, but rather focuses on how ordinary people often cannot cope with extraordinary circumstances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surely the identity-parade scenes were flawed by virtue of the fact that the witnesses would look at the men independently, not together. Otherwise one could influence the other on their choice of person.I think that the real robber did have a remarkable similarity to Fonda and it was brilliant the way Hitchcock superimposed the two faces.Vera Miles' gradual descent towards mental breakdown is brilliantly acted as is Fonda's continual look of astonishment at his wrongful arrest and process by the police. Beautifully filmed in black and white, it is a classic piece of film noir and much under-rated. No histrionics, no violence, just a rattling good story of what could happen to an innocent man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A journey into nightmare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having amassed a fairly comprehensive collection of Hitchcock over the years, including all the feature films from the first "The Man Who Knew Too Much" onwards, I recently embarked on a chronological retrospective. It was at the conclusion of the second TMWKTM (infinitely better than the first) that I suddenly stopped. Readers may be puzzled why, with some of the main glories still to come. The truth is that I have always found the maestro's 1956 work, "The Wrong Man", one of my most gruelling cinema experiences, almost too painful to watch. I suppose most seriously minded cineasts have certain films that they consider fine, but which they have to steel themselves to re-see. For me it tends to be isolated moments such as the truly ghastly happenings at the end of Zanussi's "The Constant Factor" and Angelopoulos's "Ulysses Gaze" or the embarrassment of witnessing the father's rejection of the son's gift in "East of Eden" and James Dean's heartrending response. "The Wrong Man" somehow tops everything in this respect for being one long, unrelieved journey into a nightmare. Although even the ending is still downbeat there is a suggestion of hope in the final caption which just about makes the overall experience bearable, but we have been without any form of consolation for well over an hour and a half. "The Wrong Man" is unique in the Hitchcock canon for being based on a true story. We are given the director's assurance of this in his spoken introduction, his only appearance in any of his features as himself rather than as an incidental cameo. What follows is played out absolutely seriously in an almost documentary manner with no allowances for Hitchcock's customary black humour. During the course of one long evening, night and morning, Manny, a professional double bass player (Henry Fonda in one of his finest performances) endures the humiliation of being wrongfully accused through circumstantial identification of a number of holdups. Police interrogation, overnight imprisonment and criminal charges follow. Throughout much of this ordeal, which we follow in minute detail, his wife and family wait at home not knowing what has become of him. It is only after many hours of anxiety that the police contact them. Manny, released on bail pending trial, begins with his wife (Vera Miles, on wonderful form) and a sympathetic but inexperienced lawyer (Anthony Quayle) the frustrating task of trying to establish an alibi. As their search for witnesses continues with the outcome looking ever more hopeless, the wife succumbs to a severe mental breakdown. Apart from William Wyler's magnificent "Carrie" was ever a commercial venture by a popular director more bleak! And yet such is the mastery and intensity of its telling that it remains for me one of the most memorable cinematic experiences of the 1950's, arguably Hitchcock's second greatest achievement after "The Birds". When I finally did steel myself to re-seeing it I discovered something I could not remember from previous viewings. The scene where Manny, on returning home after bail release, speaks to his elder son made me shed a tear, something that just does not happen in any other Hichcock film. So now... on to "Vertigo"...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Right Direction makes The Wrong Man a solid drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this last night, on a double-bill of sorts w/ Welles 'Touch of Evil' and have to report that viewing both classics together makes for an oppty to compare/contrast two 50's era H'wood director's visual styles and thematic takes on the drama of police investigations. Where Hitchcock does a respectable documentary-like job that documents how established protocol can lead to the disastrous consequence of being wrongly accused of crimes one has not committed; Welles does a nightmarish take on official corruption (as a means for serving justice) by wrongly accusing someone(s) of crimes they have not committed (same theme). In the Welles film, the villains are clearly drawn, but in Hitchcock's film the lines are softer ... you never believe for a minute the police really wants to clear Fonda's character, they don't plant evidence like in 'Touch of Evil', but they silently condone arresting 'The Wrong Man.' It's clear by a mile, in the scene where the detectives have the Fonda character write samples of a robbery note, that things will sadly lead to Fonda's arrest.Hitchcock succeeds further by peeling back the layers of the Miles character ever-so-slowly, so that when she does 'cracks-up' under the pressure the audience resents her (I did) for not being stronger and holding it together. The Miles character's arc is impressive: strong wife/mother becomes institutionalized basket-case. The production values in this film, and the script, are superb. It's easy to believe the Fonda character's meekness as played by an actor known for his gentle screen presence (Ox-Bow Incident, On Golden Pond), and the supporting players are well-cast (especially Fonda's character's mother and sons).</fullReview>

I remember enjoying Anthony Quayle's performance(did he sound an awful lot like Cary Grant or is that just me?) and thinking that Hitchcock had done some serious re-thinking of his usual formula and put together something that really mattered to him.And it sure does come as a relief at the end of this when they do get the real guy, you see Fonda's face interposed with his...they Do look alike.

Certainly the final moments here are well-directed, giving the audience the release it deserves, but this poor guy--who is chewed up by the legal system--is really put through the proverbial wringer.

		<shortDescription>Guilty until proved innocent ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the middle of the 50's, the French New Wave provided new standards to filmmaking inspired by the Italian post-war neo-realist movement, the nihilistic existentialist mood of the era, and naturally, the film-noir genre. From "Rififi" to "Bob Le Flambeur" and ultimately "The 400 Blows" and "Breathless", a new generation of French movies set Cinema's gripping and realistic tone. Viewers, tired of heroes standing above them on a pedestal built by pedant directors, went to see their alter egos, not heroes, not quite antiheroes, but unfortunate protagonists of circumstances encouraging them to elevate themselves from their inner condition. Elia Kazan and later, John Casavetes would become the figureheads of this movement in America. Therefore, the least likely director to intervene in that arena was Alfred Hitchcock who, in 1956, was one of the most established and successful figures in Hollywood. And it is a credit to the director's immense stature to feel a need for change, to abandon for one movie, all his beloved trademarks, and embrace the modernity of his time without compromising his style. As a result, "The Wrong Man" is a real oddity in the director's body of work, whose posterity has been shadowed by "Rear Window" or "Vertigo". Yet I believe it's quite a fitting place for one of the best surprises for a Hitchcock fan is to discover the Master's versatility.Hitchcock, so eager to provide the film a unique touch, doesn't hesitate to kill the most popular of his darlings: the obligatory cameo. Hitch doesn't appear in the film, not within the story anyway, but right in the beginning, the shadowy silhouette covers the whole frame while Hitch' distinctive voice warns us: this film is based on a true story. No director would ever dare to tell his audience in which mindset his film should be viewed, but Hitchcock is no man of conventions and understand the need to guide our emotional focus. The warning works even more because the essence of the story relies on an extraordinary (yet real) streak of bad luck that would hardly be believable if it was fiction, even by Hitchcock's standards. The directing is fluid, there are a few creatively subjective shots but we're definitely focused on the nightmare endured by Henry Fonda and his wife, played by Vera Miles.And Henry Fonda is the perfect actor to play the ill-fated Manny, a bass player wrongly accused for hold-up because of his resemblance with the real criminal. It isn't spoiling the story to say he's innocent, since the title is a clear give away and the misfortune would only be justice if he were guilty. Fonda's talent shows in the subtle way he dilutes himself into his character, keeping this level of gentleness and humility powerfully rendered by his ordinary looks. Fonda doesn't have the sex appeal of Grant or Stewart's discreet charm, but his appeal is almost superior in the way it inevitably inspires our empathy, with the dimension of pathos the story requires. And Vera Miles is also perfect as the devoted wife who follows the slow descent into hell and ends up being a poignant collateral damage of the wrong suspicion.But besides the restrained directing, the authentic performances of unglamorous actors, it's New York City that provides the film the very touch of authenticity that would later be cherished by New Hollywood generation. New York is one of these places of the world, so lively in daylight, yet so hostile at night, with its roaring deserted subways, and shadowy streets. And Hitchcock reinforces the scariness of the town as if it was the refuge of an invisible enemy we discover through Fonda's journey. During the whole police procedural, the witness identification, the handwriting test, we're handcuffed to Fonda's condition and discover this side of New York City, like kids pushed in the dark, with the same 'what have I done' interrogation. The film remains Hitchcockian through its themes such as mistaken identity, a conspiracy inducing an inevitable paranoid feeling, but these times, they get even more frightening because the enemy never shows his face. I guess the opinion that Hitchcock' style doesn't express itself in "The Wrong Man" is not totally accurate. The talent is here and is never more brilliantly demonstrated than when it comes to the epitome of his works, which are human emotions. The film starts with an unusual scoring from Bernard Herrman, a catchy Latin theme that doesn't have this ominous feeling giving away the very emotions we'd feel, yet it succeeds to inspire the expectation of an imminent tragedy. And by making his style more unnoticeable, Hitchcock allows us to penetrate the soul of his characters, facing the tragic events with their succession of misfortunes, hopes, deceptions and anti-climactic resolution. Indeed, those who expect the trial drama, or a grandiloquent statement from Anthony Quayle, might be disappointed, because the point is not in the accusation, but its effects. When Vera Miles' character snaps and turns into a depressive semi-catatonic state, the verdict hardly matters since the harm has always been done. Miles is part of the soul that inhabits the film, while Fonda's character is driven by his Catholic faith (the religious imagery is visually effective), Vera Miles incarnates doubt and skepticism. She doesn't think her husband is guilty, but feels guilty to have such thoughts and end up believing that she's partly responsible. Vera Miles, in an unfairly snubbed performance, occupies the only area for doubt Hitch concedes to us, as a part of human duality, faith and doubt... in God, justice, or a man's innocence.Had the same film been made today, it would have fallen in the twist-ending formula. Hitchcock, respectfully to our intelligence, depicts the devastating effects of a wrong accusation on innocent people, and with the right setting, the right directing and the right casting, "The Wrong Man" turns into one of Hitchcock's most fascinating works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a bit clunky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wrong Man has lots of clunky dialog and violations of police procedure which are unlikely to have occurred even in a serious miscarriage of justice. The true story on which this was based was undoubtedly a miscarriage and its presentation was surely innovative at the time, but modern knowledge of far more serious miscarriages (past and present) makes that aspect far less chilling today.I was also surprised at how clunky some of the dialog was, given that Maxwell Anderson wrote it.In short, like many Hitchcock movies, it was good for its day but hasn't withstood the test of time as well as the best movies from the past.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True story for Hitchcock and Fonda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How do you like your films? Realistic? Or "movie style". If you prefer the former, you're in luck, because this is based on a true story and apparently fairly accurately follows the real-life sequence of events. If you prefer "movie style" films, you'll be disappointed.In the film, Henry Fonda plays a nightclub musician who is accused of being an armed robber. The film goes through the trauma in the family of being wrongly accused and facing prison. Fonda's wife in the film -- Vera Miles -- is excellent as her character descends into deep mental illness. Miles has always been a favorite of mine, and -- in my view -- a highly underrated actress. Eventually the real armed robber is identified.This theme -- a common man brought into a highly unusual and challenging situation -- is one of Hitchcock's favorite story lines. Fonda has always been a sort of "every man", and is perfect for this film.Recommended at least once, but it won't find a spot on my DVD shelf.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ALL THROUGH OUR history of film, we've had the drama featuring those who are wrongly accused and falsely convicted. That the telling the story of criminals who've been incarcerated and found guilty for heinous and felonious acts; and were actually guilty, would make for some pretty poor movie watching'! HENCE, WE HAVE had a great number of whodunits over the years that gave us many an hour matching our wits with guys with names such as Holmes, Chan, Spade, Poirot, Marlowe, Mason, Marple and even Clouseau. The very best of the Detective Story is, by its very nature, strictly formula. Consequently, the Detective Story gets to be a bore.WITH THE FILMIMG of this movie, Sir Alfred moves into new waters for him. Oh, sure, Hitch had done a whole lot of whodunits; but again this is a true story. How would he handle it? Was he over his head? TUNE IN NEXT TIME AND FIND OUT!NEXT TIME! MR. HITCHCOCK WADED into this project with caution, to be sure; but, knowing that, for him, he would have to use all of his directorial talents and skills in making the story.TO BEGIN WITH, everything from the costuming, the sets and even the shooting locales were all rendered to be as bland as possible.The scripted dialog was designed to be as close to realistic as possible.AS TO THE characterizations of the various people, the Director went with the notion of less being more. The underplaying of a scene often is used to accentuate the bold, stark realism. It is almost done in a style which could be classified as Docu-Drama.IN AN ATTEMPT to render the film as having more appeal at the Box Office, Hitchcock could have characterized of the Police being vindictive and being personally involved. To his credit, he chose not to do so. Although this proved to be the more difficult, in the long run it was surely proved to be far more rewarding.AS WE VIEWED it recently, it must rank as a major Hitchcock Film. It also is one of his lesser known efforts.</fullReview>

With so much of the film set in the stairwells, streets and municipal offices of nighttime New York there is ample room for Hitchcock to paint the screen with the harsh black brush strokes of expressionist malice and paranoia.Henry Fonda does a sympathetic job as the everyman caught in a Kafka-lite spiral of faceless process as a single person mistakes his identity. However, the film is really about the collapse of his happy family life under the strain. Hitchcock manages this well through a commensurately good performance from Vera Miles. Although both performances suffer from Hitchcock's inevitable directorial strictures this is a film particularly suited to the angular, helpless stillness etched into the principals' faces. Fascinating but troubling. 6/10</fullReview>

Hitchcock to me is like Woody Allen, if you like them, your not going to dislike anything they do. Ive learned to stop listening to negative reviews about Woodys movies, because they are pretty much all good. Same goes for Hitchcock, they are all quality. The plotline of mistaken identity is of course, a Hitchcockian trademark, but this was a departure for the director, as it is a dramatization of a true story. Its wonderfully done, with terrific shots of life in New York in the 50s, all in good old black and white. The acting is fantastic, (my landlady included) with Henry Fonda, Vera Miles and Anthony Quayle each very believable and very likeable, and at the top of their game. The storyline is quite thought provoking, and gives a harrowing account of what exactly will happen to you if you are ever arrested for a felony. Bernard Hermann's haunting score perfectly compliments the action. But what else is new?</fullReview>

Since the couple is having trouble supporting themselves and two young sons, they decide to take out a loan on her insurance policy. Looking extremely suspicious, Mr. Fonda goes to the bank-like insurance building and arouses fear among the clerks.

The case against him looks open-and-shut, but Fonda is innocent...Director Alfred Hitchcock tones down some of his flash, and keeps this film's tone gritty and low-key. "The Wrong Man" is a fine looking production, and features one of Mr. Hitchcock's favorite story themes - that of a man wrongly accused of some crime and hounded by outside forces, especially the police. Though it is based on an actual story, some parts don't ring true. Many New Yorkers pronounce "drawer" as "draw". Henry Fonda is not 38. And, we need to be reminded this is a true story. In the opening scenes, Fonda practically sends off alarm bells on demeanor alone (even without the other actors' reaction shots). He also keeps walking into establishments with a suspicious gaze.

		<shortDescription>The Wrong Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sir Alfred Hitchcock, Master of Suspense, was popular for taking terrible incidents in real life and turning them into what make his masterpieces (most popular being Psycho), but this film is only focusing on the true story itself. Basically Christopher Emmanuel 'Manny' Balestrero (Henry Fonda) is an ordinary New York musician who is wrongfully identified and arrested for the crime of hold-up robbery, as he was innocently getting money for his wife Rose (Psycho's Vera Miles) to have dental treatment. Manny constantly pleads his innocence, but in doing so looks even more guilty, especially host to the police and witnesses who point to him. Unfortunately, Rose breaks down into a depression and is institutionalised, while his trial isn't going well, even granted mistrial, but thankfully, awaiting re-trial, the real criminal is caught (and there is a likeness by the way), and he is set free, while his wife still remains in her quiet state, don't worry, the ending text said she recovered, and they moved to Florida. Also starring Lawrence of Arabia's Anthony Quayle as Frank D. O'Connor, Harold J. Stone as Det. Lt. Bowers, Esther Minciotti as Mama Balestrero, Charles Cooper as Det. Matthews, Nehemiah Persoff as Eugene 'Gene' Conforti, Laurinda Barrett as Constance Willis, Norma Connolly as Betty Todd, Doreen Lang as Ann James, Frances Reid as Mrs. O'Connor, Lola D'Annunzio as Manny's Sister Olga Conforti, Robert Essen as Gregory Balestrero and Kippy Campbell as Robert Balestrero. I can see why this film is a bit forgotten by Hitch fans, but with fine performances from Fonda and Miles, and a great real story from a fine director, this does deserves more popularity. Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock was the consummate Hollywood director, in that his films had high production values, big name stars, were immaculately composed and scored- usually by Bernard Herrmann, as in this film, yet they also tended to lack heart, or real human emotion. They were all basically plot-driven vehicles that usually had twist endings, that stretched the bounds of the reasonable. In a way he was the M. Night Shyamalan of his day, except that he was a far superior filmmaker in every way. Every so often, however, he would try his hand at a different style of film, like Mr. And Mrs. Smith, Jamaica Inn, and Under Capricorn.Perhaps his most successful such 'oddball' film was 1956's black and white social realism film The Wrong Man, starring Henry Fonda, which was manifestly influenced by the spate of European films that indulged in the Neo-Realistic style of such masters as Vittorio De Sica, Federico Fellini, and Roberto Rossellini, and based upon a real life case of mistaken identity in 1953 which nearly put an innocent man in prison. This film's veracity was so important to Hitchcock that he did not dare make one of his comic cameo appearances within the film, rather we only see him opening the film on a dark soundstage, and in shadow, as he intones the setup. Yet, in a sense, the film is more of a classic film noir, based in reality, than a Neo-Realistic film, based in Hollywood, even as it is shorn of the usual Hitchcockian plot twists and MacGuffins. The film was penned by Angus MacPhail and playwright Maxwell Anderson, and was based upon Anderson's non-fiction novel called The True Story Of Christopher Emmanuel Balestrero, which preceded Truman Capote's non-fiction novel In Cold Blood by a decade. It is a very good film, yet it never quite soars into greatness, for a number of manifest reasons.For a film that has been called Hitchcock's stab at Neo-Realism, a bit less artifice would have been more suited. The Wrong Man, however, is a very good film, even if it is clearly a flawed and second tier film of Hitchcock's, despite its noble attempts at more. It's not a thriller, but a character study- of Manny, Rose, and even the mores of mid-Twentieth Century New York City, with images that do not rhapsodize the city as in Woody Allen's Manhattan does, but show the city as a sort of indifferent beast. Despite its flaws, The Wrong Man has good performances, technical kudos, and great touches that stick in the viewer's mind long after it ends; such as the rote and unwavering way the female witnesses identify the real robber, then are ashamed to look at Manny as they leave, an early shot of Manny leaving The Stork Club, bracketed between two cops as he walks away, or his recalling the cop car in front of his house when he is let out on bail and sees an empty spot in the street. These are the things that show that a great artist, even when not at his best, is still better than most non-great artists at their best. And that's the sort of claim for which no twist ending is needed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Immanent Justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this in the El Camino Theater in San Bruno in the company of a guy who later became Henry Kissinger's brother-in-law. When we left the theater he remarked that the movie wasn't about justice, it was about guilt. He was probably right. Hitchcock was never really very interested in justice because we all get what's coming to us and we're all guilty. Here we are, born guilty, of original sin -- and we haven't even had a chance to do anything that's both terrible and feels good. That premise isn't really too well represented in "The Wrong Man," though. It can be discerned, but as if through a veil of smoke, not with the kind of clarity we find in, say, "Strangers on a Train." What, after all, is Manny Balastrero guilty of? Looking like somebody else? Mismanaging his money? I don't know if the real Balastrero was still around when this film was shot but I have a feeling he was, otherwise the director would have given him a few more human weaknesses, perhaps a closet full of pantyhose. As it is, the guilt is spread pretty thickly. The cops arrest the wrong guy. Balastrero's wife Rose (Vera Miles) is driven mad by a deflected guilt. (Clinically, this is highly improbable, but let it go.) The real culprit of course is the root of all this evil. Even the lawyer O'Connell, who provided the story for this movie, reveals himself as an incompetent bore. Hitchcock was known for building his tales around one or two high points. An airplane attacks a man in a cornfield. Somebody falls from the Statue of Liberty. That sort of thing. And from these set pieces he would build the story outward. In other words, the story would be the answer to the question, "How do we get him to the top of the Statue of Liberty"? There are no such high points in "The Wrong Man," probably because the director was sticking as closely as he could to a documentary model. Everyone who has seen or heard or read an interview with Hitchcock knows the story of how, as a child, he was taken by his father to a police station and threatened with jail, and how the experience traumatized him. I've always suspected it was just another story to tell interviewers trying to probe his psyche, but he does his best with Manny's initial incarceration here. The problem is that there is nothing intrinsically dramatic about seeing a man locked alone into a barren jail cell, so Hitchcock resorts to camera movement to emphasize Balastrero's anxiety. We get to see the interior walls and ceiling of the cell moving, slowly at first, then more and more quickly, with Hermann's score swelling up in the background -- and it doesn't work. All I can think of when I watch this scene is how desperate Hitchcock must have been to convey Balastrero's horror. What I see on the screen is an unsubtle and dizzying camera movement.There are two particularly interesting scenes in the movie, neither of them splashy. The first is Manny's interrogation by the police. Fonda plays him in open-mouthed wonderment at what is going on. (If an infant could think, he'd feel the same way about his baptism.) And the police patiently explain things to him (and to us) so that we can follow easily the traps into which Manny falls. The second, and more interesting sequence, involves the visit to the little hotel in Cornwall and the subsequent search for alibi witnesses. At the suggestion of O'Connell, the couple visit the hotel where they spent a four-day summer vacation at the time the robberies were committed. The scene is beautifully done. The hotel, now out of season, is wintry and deserted except for the manager and his wife, who do everything they can to dig up the identities of the other guests, while Hermann's desolate score hints at the futility of this quest. (Hermann relies on a bass to back most of the incidents; there isn't a happy note anywhere to be found.) Then Manny and Rose are seen visiting the addresses of two of the witnesses. This is the part that is usually skipped over in mysteries and crime dramas. Ordinarily, we see the investigator get the addresses, then there is a dissolve to the investigator knocking on a door that is opened by a colorful character. Not here. Manny and Rose visit the shabby apartment house of the first witness and the door is opened by two breathless giggling kids who have probably been wrestling. The contrast in moods is striking. Two carefree innocent youths facing two middle-aged people in the grip of fear. "Mr. Molinari? Oh, they must be the people who moved out three months ago. Mr. Molinari is dead, and Mrs. Molinari -- well, I don't know where SHE is!" The door closes and the middle-aged hearts sink. The second witness's address is an equally run-down tenement in New York and a concierge who speaks only Spanish shrugs and informs them that he, the second witness, has been dead a long time. Manny seems so heartbreakingly alone. His wife leaves him psychologically. We get to see nothing of any friendships he has, not even with the "fellas in the band" at the Stork Club, although we are led to understand that they'll do what they can to help him. Only his ineffectual family and lawyer are shown giving him any support, and of course his lawyer is a purchased friend. The epilogue tells us that Rose was released from the hospital after two years and that she and Manny live happily with their two children in Florida. But that seems hardly more than a conventionally "happy" ending. The last we saw of Manny and Rose they were in dire straits. Manny was making $85 a week playing bass, they were already in debt for half that amount, Rose needed expensive dental work, she was in an expensive hospital, and they owed O'Connell his fee. How do you get from there to a happy leisurely life in Florida? There's one other problem with the movie. The "double" who actually committed the crimes doesn't look anything like Henry Fonda. Certainly not enough for one of Manny's arresting detectives to pass the evildoer casually in the hall and recognize immediately that this is Manny's double. Put all that aside, though. This isn't the kind of movie that audiences flocked to in order to enjoy a Hitchcock thriller, but it's an improvement over his failures, like "The Paradine Case". It's pace is thoughtful and deliberate throughout. And it's well worth sitting through.</fullReview>

Manny goes to the insurance office to borrow off of Rose's life policy, but the clerks identify him as the robber who held them up months earlier. Manny is cooperative until he finds that he is a suspect in a series of other hold ups in the same Jackson Heights neighborhood in New York City where they live. They hire attorney Frank O'Connor (Anthony Quayle) as they try to prove his innocence.It's an Alfred Hitchcock movie with limited Hitchcockian moves. Henry Fonda delivers his usual everyman performance. There is a great Kafka feel to the first half of the movie. The cops are creepy as heck as they guide Manny around and Manny's naivety is heartbreaking. The intensity dissipates when Manny gets out on bail. The movie peters out. I wish the movie stayed with the Kafka sense and go all the way through with a noir ending. The first half is a solid 9 but the second half is a pedestrian 6. If Manny could stay in jail, that would foster the paranoia so much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitchcock did a fine job breaking out of his usual mold in making The Wrong Man. No wisecracking glamour-boy hero...no sexy wench disrupting the hero's life. This was a very realistic portrayal of a real miscarriage of justice. The cinematography was almost like a newsreel and came off very realistic and convincing. Vera Miles did a fine job showing the onset of mental illness on an otherwise well-adjusted woman. The police characters were also so well done you in fact sympathized with them - - through their best efforts they were sending an innocent man to prison. The best element of the movie was the frightening illustration of actual arrest, arraignment and incarceration procedures: it affects and disturbs you if you put yourself in Manny's shoes more than anything that happens to him; at the outset of the case Manny knows he's a tragic and almost heroic character - taking the wrap for something he didn't do - but senses down deep that this injustice will be recognized and rectified quickly by right-minded cops, citizens, lawyers, judges or journalists; however, when confronted with the mass of men arrested and awaiting trial in that great city, Manny can only conclude that his little case can easily be overlooked and forgotten. Such is the power of the screenplay and the direction. Unfortunately, Henry Fonda's wooden performance tosses a wet washcloth on the gathering fire inside this story and it loses much of its muscularity. Perhaps Fonda was just too old at the time to convince me he has two sons in grammar school. Manny's supposed to be a happily-married man at the beginning of the film, but Henry does a poor job in portraying it. And some of his reactions to being a suspect are so underplayed that you feel he might not even care about it. Still, Fonda's trade-craft does come through and other times and does give us hints of the terror he's experiencing as the false case against him gathers steam - the picture of him grasping the cell's bars as he's first locked in jail is quite powerful. I guess I just expected more of a performance out of such a fine actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Difference between Fact and Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wrong Man is in many ways a typical Hitchcock movie, but the fact that it tells a true story makes all the difference. Characters in Hitchcock thrillers are always put through the mill, but when they're real people, when story becomes history, everything changes. It is exciting to watch Richard Hannay being chased by police across Scotland because 39 Steps is only a film. It is interesting to observe the madness in Vertigo because it's symbolic, and a plot device. But The Wrong Man shows us a real, ordinary and very likable family being victimised by the law to the point of destruction, with the wife and mother sliding into mental illness and institutionalisation as a result. I found it extremely uncomfortable viewing, more like a gritty documentary than an escapist thriller. Apparently Hitchcock genuinely feared the police, and fear is the emotion that drives this film. Fear and worry. In fiction, suspense is exciting. In real life, it equates to worry, and I was drained by the end of this film.Very well made, very well acted, but I won't want to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Far from being Hitchcock's most underrated film, it is only Hitch's involvement with it that marks this film out from the countless other grimly 'realistic' films of the fifties.The lighting is harsh, the photography cheap. The story holds no surprises whatsoever. There is no build-up of tension, no memorable lines, no memorable characters, even - all the acting, with the exception of Fonda, is wooden &amp; about the level of the television dramas of the day. The end result feels, in fact, like a TV show, &amp; one that could have been much better told in a half-hour 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents' episode.There are a few flashes of the Master's hand but they seem ill-fitting &amp; out of place in this otherwise unremarkable 'Based On A True Story' TV movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent, Disappointing for Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wrong Man lacks a lot of great aspects one would expect from a director as legendary as Hitchcock. The main problem is that the title of the film can easily be applied to other Hitchcock films. This movie takes a plot device Hitchcock recycled a few times in his career (the wrong man is accused of a crime) and sets it into a film which lacks the energy and suspense that Hitchcock is known for.In films like North by Northwest and Saboteur, Hitchcock takes this notion of the wrongfully accused man and puts him on a thrilling journey to find the people who had set him up and prove his innocence. In The Wrong Man, we have the innocent Henry Fonda - an actor so often playing the role of the good guy in cinema that it gets monotonous - fill the role of the wrongfully accused and he is put through the process of justice. He is questioned, arrested, bailed out, attends trial - you know, the opposite of what happens in North by Northwest and Saboteur. It proves to be a really boring story to watch as the protagonist is not fighting for his life, but rather simply denying the crimes he is accused of and hoping for the best.To be honest, Henry Fonda feels out of place in a Hitchcock film. He is more of a passive actor, more subtle than famous Hitchcock actors like Cary Grant and James Stewart. Those actors play their roles in Hitchcock films with true passion, clearly portraying fear and desperation. Fonda's performance in The Wrong Man lacks the passion we expect from a protagonist in a Hitchcock film.While Bernard Herrmann usually creates really interesting and powerful scores for films - especially for Hitchcock films like North by Northwest and Vertigo - here his music, like the film as a whole, lacks energy, and it specifically seems to repeat the same two-note theme over and over again. It fits the tone of the movie - this film is more of a drama than a typical Hitchcock thriller - but at the same time it is overly monotonous and hardly adds any feeling to The Wrong Man.Not a waste of time to watch, but The Wrong Man is simply disappointing compared to the rest of Hitchcock's canon, which is filled with masterpiece thrillers that will continue to be discussed for decades to come.2.5/4.0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guilty or not guilty. What does it matter?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although, an extremely skillfully made and with two magnificent performances by Henry Fonda and Vera Miles, this is perhaps the weakest film Hitchcock made.An almost entirely true story can work in a movie. There are extremely long scenes to illustrate this kind of quasi-reality. However, they are too mundane. They are supposed to make you feel sickened that this kind of thing could happen to an innocent man. I just wish that they were a little more exciting. I know, that wasn't what Hitchcock was going for and it is an interesting experiment. I just felt that the scenes were too long.The good parts are Henry Fonda's very subdued performance and Vera Miles' descent into madness is very well played without going over the top. Think of Ida Lupino in They Drive By Night and then look at this. The supporting actors are adequate but in a film like this, there aren't really room for attention grabbing affectations, some of which other Hitchcock characters had in spades in his other work. Here, they are carefully moderated as to not lay blame on anyone.One little false note is the tag at the very end and it sort of takes the power out of what has happened before. Maybe Hitchcock audiences weren't ready for a totally unhappy ending yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>tiny Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is hard to believe that this tiny little film came in between Hitch's expansion of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" and "Vertigo." It almost seems to small to warrant a Bernard Hermann score. Speaking of Hermann, I believe he has a cameo as the piano player at the Stork Club, in a movie that I don't believe Hitch himself appears in. This is an in-between film for many of the people in it, Henry Fonda stopping by on his way to better things and Vera Miles waiting to appear as the sister in "Psycho." Fonda's performance here is much like Gregory Peck's in "The Paradine Case" another episode of "Hitchcock-lite." The camera work is very nice and studied, giving depth, shadow and a lot of space to small interiors like a jail cell. The hook of this movie for me is the aspect of the wife. It might seem out of place to take time off from proving Fonda's character innocent to watch his wife go nuts, but it is actually the crux of the movie. If you look at it as another Hitch "Wrong Man" movie, you will miss the big chases on Lincoln's nose and sweeping drama, etc. If you look at it as the story of a small typically american family constantly hounded by their debts until the pursuit of next month's payment catches up with them and proves too much then it justifies the film's tight focus. The ending is a bit too pat, because where DID they get the money? Surprising that they let them use the real "Stork Club" for a setting when they portray them paying so very little. The religious imagery is confusing, are we putting faith in the rosary beads, pictures of Jesus and prayer; are we supposed to believe, as the nurse tells, that miracles take time? If so, how does that relate to the major plot? Religious imagery is not an area for Hitch to get caught up in.Fairly middling, but worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What does the real Manny Ballestrero think of it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, I withhold final judgement until I can hear how accurate the real Christopher Emmanuel Ballestrero thought it was. One thing I think Manny would notice is that there is no way either Henry Fonda, Vera Miles, or the two kids could pass for an ethnic family. None of them talked like lifetime New Yorkers. Manny's mother and brother-in-law were clearly ethnic and it didn't look like they could be members of the same family. Another thing is the obvious age difference between Manny and his wife. Wouldn't a musician good enough to be part of a band that plays at the Stork Club have a higher standard of living? If not, how was the real Manny able to relocate to Florida after the ordeal was over? Did he sue?The positive is that, despite overwhelming evidence that he is guilty, the police and the lawyer can't help to believe he is somehow innocent. That is what keeps the viewer watching, the expectation that he can somehow be exonerated. He's treated well and is respected by these people who hold his future in the balance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Wrong Man" is an off-beat Hitchcockian film. There is no psychological suspense to enhance the tale and there are no real memorable moments. The film does become a bit bland after a while (I missed the conclusion of the film because it was not riveting and anyone who pays attention knows the eventual outcome of the story).

		<shortDescription>An unusual Hitchcock film that fails to live up to the standard of his others</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Wrong Man" is somewhat different in nature from most of Alfred Hitchcock's other work. Based on true events, it is more like a documentary than a feature film. It tells the story of Christopher Emanuel Balestrero, a happily married father of two young children. Balestrero is a musician. He plays the bass fiddle in a musical group at the upmarket Stork Club, a nightclub in New York. His wife Rose needs expensive dental treatment because she has four impacted wisdom teeth. The couple cannot afford the treatment, which will cost $300. So, Balestrero visits the office of the insurance company at which he is paying for life insurance policies for himself, his wife and the two children to see if he can borrow the money to pay for Rose's dental treatment against her policy. While there, he is identified by several members of staff as being the person who robbed the company previously. Balestrero is arrested and subsequently charged with the crime (which, as the title of the film suggests, he did not, in fact, commit). And that sets in train a chain of events that causes a huge amount of emotional and financial turmoil for the Balestrero family. The acting is first rate. Henry Fonda and Vera Miles are excellent in the starring roles. Miles is particularly good at portraying the emotional scarring her character (Rose) receives as a result of events that she is helpless to influence and which appear to be spiralling out of control. There are, however, a number of problems with the film. It is sombre in tone. That by itself would not ordinarily be an issue worthy of comment. But "The Wrong Man" is also - and this is somewhat surprising, given that it is a Hitchcock film - extremely dull and turgid. There is almost no suspense or tension. And there is none of the macabre humour that is present in most of Hitchcock's other work. Even the trademark brief non-speaking appearance by the director is dispensed with in this film (although that may be because Hitchcock makes a short appearance in shadowy form before the opening credits to explain that "The Wrong Man" is somewhat different from his other films). There are also some continuity problems. No further reference is made in the film (after the initial one) to the dental treatment that Rose supposedly needs. Did she receive it? And, if so, how was it paid for? Much later in the plot, Rose needs (and receives) what must surely have been expensive medical treatment under the American health care system of the time. No explanation is offered as to how it was paid for. This seems odd when the screenplay does address the issue of how $7,500 is found to fund Balestrero's bail and does refer to the problem Balestrero is likely to have in paying his legal fees (his lawyer is sympathetic and agrees not to insist on an immediate payment). Also, as good as Fonda is, I think he looks rather older in the film than the age of the character he is playing (who is 38 years old).So, although not a bad film, "The Wrong Man" is a disappointingly ordinary one that is unlikely to live as long in the memory as most of Hitchcock's others. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some good scenes but far too ordinary and straightforward a story to really grip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Manny Balestrero is a musician at the swan club. He has a wife and two boys and the odd money problem. When he goes into the bank to check his borrowing limit on his wife's policy he is mistaken for a man who has robbed the place twice already. The police pick him up and do several tests to ascertain if he is the robber. They decide he is and set a court date, Manny and his wife search for an alibi for the robbery dates, putting great strain on them both.I will watch any film Hitchcock has made but that does not mean I will enjoy every one of them! This is an example of one where it had it's moments but is nowhere near the quality or consistency of his later work. The plot is a true story which is supposed to make it gripping. However being from Northern Ireland (and living in England) I know that the police wrongly suspecting you is normal, and I'm sure many races and people will feel this as well. So it loses a bit here already. The actual arrest and questioning by the police last for a good chunk of the film as is very good ? it is quite tense as Manny is sucked towards the fate we already know awaits him. However after that the investigation fails to grip, family events are distant and the ending just sort of happens without any prompting.Fonda is a good everyman role, which is what Hitchcock needs and he plays the wide-eyed innocent well. The support cast are good although Miles is a bit too fraught too quickly and her breakdown is not as believable as it needed to be to grip us. The cops are all tough and good but they get off too lightly at the end.Overall this has good touches that hint at Hitchcock's better work but overall it's a little too ordinary and straightforward to grip. The subject matter hasn't aged well as we now have plenty of documentaries that show that the police have arrested and killed innocent men! Only the scenes where Manny is questioned and charged stand out here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . and Christopher Emanuel "Manny" Balestrero (a.k.a., THE WRONG MAN) is certainly an irresponsible slacker, not even springing for crucial dental insurance for his wife and two sons. Adding insult to injury, while his wife is suffering with four impacted wisdom teeth, Manny fritters away his nights doodling around on a string bass for a buck or two an hour. Much of his so-called "earnings" he squanders away playing the ponies. Realizing what a sorry excuse he is for a family man and "breadwinner," Manny slinks around furtively everywhere he goes, frightening others since he looks as guilty as sin. Obviously, this WRONG MAN should NOT be allowed to lurk around as a loose cannon. Being a rosary-carrying miscreant, he's likely to be verging on producing many more kids, when he can't come close to satisfactorily supporting those for which he's already responsible. Taking all of this into consideration, it's amazingly strange that director Alfred Hitchcock deemed fit to tell this story in the first place! That Hitchcock tried to foist off the close of this flick as a "happy ending" smacks of the surreal. Happy for who? Society? Sure as rain, there will be more impoverished little Balestreros coming along down the road, gobbling up welfare benefits and agitating for "More!" Hitchcock knew he had to set this story smack in the belly of a bleeding-heart liberal state, since a guy like Manny would have had less than a snowball's chance in hell of escaping death in prison Down South. Here in Florida, we just KNOW certain people are born guilty, and walk around as constant threats to society, like ticking time bombs. No one here cares how many "innocent" people expired with the guilty sitting in "Old Sparky's" lap. Our jurors exercise "natural selection," and we don't mind judging books by their covers. Janet Leigh in PSYCHO and Kim Novak in VERTIGO both had far more right to live long, happy lives in their ill-fated stories than Manny does here. Neither of the ladies had produced unaffordable offspring. Shame on you, Mr. Hitchcock, for snatching defeat for U.S. taxpayers from the jaws of victory for the de facto keep-people-in-their-proper-place American justice system in your WRONG MAN!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty boring overall....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I am probably the minority here. I am a major fan of Hitchcock. But sometimes, even a master hits the wrong key. Although the story is interesting, and this movie starts out well, it becomes rather morose and boring as it progresses.I appreciate that this was based on a true story. And let's face it, being arrested for a crime you didn't commit is great nightmare material.The problem is, as a film this just doesn't work too well. It was hard to believe the chain of coincidences that get Manny arrested. But I will let those things pass as supposedly those elements are based in truth.As the film follows Manny's arrest and string of hard-to-believe bad luck, we become very interested on how exactly his lawyer plans to defend him. We start getting an idea, and then the courtroom scenes abruptly end. Just as abruptly, the real thief is caught. During all this, Manny's wife suddenly, and I mean suddenly, goes mad.The narrative and tone of the first part of the film completely evaporates. Manny is formally released, and goes to visit his wife in the insane asylum. (One of the positive aspects of the film is to see the change in Vera Miles, her acting is superb.) However, I didn't buy the instant craziness thing. It would have worked better, say, if she had shown other signs of not being completely balanced along the way.When Manny visits her at the end, she is totally mad. He leaves her to go home. Suddenly, there is upbeat music, a shot of palm trees, and screen text that basically says that his wife got out, and they all lived happily ever after in Florida! I don't know when the last time I saw a more abrupt, goofy ending. Maybe "Two Lane Blacktop". Maybe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is not a Hitchcock's invention</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An innocent person, a quite one, good husband and father, always working to earn the money to sustain his family, this was the person played by Henry Fonda (Manny Ballestero) married to Rose (Vera Miles). Ballestero was very unfortunate to be taken as a criminal who has raped some offices and stores. This mistake costs him sometime in jail, but the worst came with his wife's sickness. So a person living with not too much money had to pay for an attorney to defend him of something he never did, but that some witnesses asserted he was the criminal. How the problem was solved I won't tell you. The fact is that one cannot imagine that something like this may happen in a democratic society. It is not possible to put somebody in jail without consistent proves that he was the real criminal. Hitchcock made once again a good film, but since his style is mainly interested in thrills, he only showed the problem but not its solution. Fonda played his role as usual, while nice Vera Miles did it at the same high level as a devoted wife who then became sick as a result of all problems which overwhelmed her family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps if Hitch at LEAST hired two mugs that vaguely looked alike the big suspense finale might make for more shock value. Terribly miscast, no Italian actors available? Henry was told to sleepwalk and in that he excelled.It is terribly sad that so many stories of mistaken identity have occurred over time and even recently. For example, the 3 people nearly shot to death in the LA area, just because police were 'skittish' when Christopher Dorner was on the loose, and the more famous Hurricane case and subsequent film had much more gravitas.I found the directing to be so mediocre I would either groan or burst into laughter. With every molasses scan of shoes, handcuffs, jail bars, mean Detective scowls, and the incessant two note music theme just made the entire film laborious.Curious what the family thought of the film. The mood of lacking any trust is ever more prevalent today. Extremely tragic to see the woman fall into a sheltered coma because her kind, sweet, safe world was shattered. Her exceptional performance in these scenes was noteworthy.Can recommend only for folks who can relate to the book: "When Bad Things Happen to Good People".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though the very premise of the film, the "wrong man" syndrome, seems to fall perfectly into the realm of Hitchcock, this film is one of his weakest of the period. The initial mistake and the process of his imprisonment are intriguing, but unfortunately, the plot does not reach much further than that. The suspense ends soon after the original mistaken identification, and devolves into the bizarre story of a wife gone mad and a rather boring court case. Vera Miles is bland and her part is ambiguous and irritating more than mysterious.

There is a nice shot of the Brooklyn Bridge at night with cars. Technically there is nothing to fault. However, time has not been kind to this film. Maybe this was a thriller for small-town America in the 1950s, even though I doubt it. In 2010 it is just slow, full of obvious plot tricks and stereotypes. The slowness and the fact that nothing really happens in the film can possibly be justified by saying that the film is a character study of an innocent man and his wife. The obvious plot tricks include build-up of the main person as a family man, brutal looking police men taking tough, scattered hopes when the alibi witnesses have died. Stereotypes include people have to rest all the time. And a wife that turns hysterical. Why do women so often become hysterical in old films? So tedious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Love Hitch. Rear Window is astonishing. Vertigo is remarkable. But his best films toy with viewpoint and film technique. With an excellent script he can provide the additional satisfaction of cultural commentary or layered meaning.This offers little in the way of any of those things. The script is the major problem. For 40 minutes all development proceeds along a single anticipated line: each new test will positively i.d. Manny (Fonda) as the culprit in a string of crimes. But when you give your movie the title "the Wrong Man," you've tipped off the audience about both the theme, and the protagonists culpability. You don't need such a sober, laborious setup! It's so plodding that your mind is already trying to read allegorical meaning into it after ten minutes. The score literalizes obvious points and underscores mundane visuals (shoes?) with tension. The music cues might have worked in a half hour television format, which is I suspect where the problem originates.For various reasons Fonda and Vera Miles would never be the leads in another Hitch movie. Miles got pregnant. Fonda is miscast. He may be the least Italian person you could give the part to. He's too articulate and middle-class to play someone mired in red-tape because he can't explain himself better. This is also due to the minority-erasing casting of Fonda. It would be feasible that a non-white person would have a hard time explaining themselves. Fonda, who disliked the Method just recites the script sincerely. His performance has no arc whatsoever. Emotionally, his reaction to being arrested and humiliated is not so different from riding a bus. Nothing registers; it's like looking at a prop for 90 minutes. If he can't get excited about his own fate, how can a viewer? Mad magazine spoofed this back in the sixties as the dullest treatment of an endless series of ordinary moments. It was an unusually perceptive piece.There are several moments in Hitch's career where he tries to escape his genre and meets resistance. There's the mediocre comedy Mr. and Mrs. Smith. There are his historical pictures Jamaica Inn and Under Capricorn. And then there's this; an attempt to play one of his favorite themes straight, without a wink to the audience.It feels like an early test of naturalistic filming that he'd show off again in Psycho. It's a very anti-Hollywood film. It's filmed very crisply. Coming from anyone other than Hitchcock, it might have worked.</fullReview>

His enviable record of undisputed classics such as Rebecca, Rear Window, and Vertigo was marred by uneven, sometimes downright uninteresting fare such as Topaz (whose beginning borders on the unwatchable) and The Wrong Man. Possible spoiler followsNot even Henry Fonda and Vera Miles could retrieve this yawner--nearly two hours of waiting for the inevitable Right Man to turn up. It's as if Hitchcock could not decide whether to make a psychological thriller or a police/law procedural, and produced unsatisfactory aspects of both. Other aspects also are unsatisfactory, including the unexplained cause of Miles' mental problems. We're only told in scrolling text at the end that Rose Balestrero spent 2 years recovering and then lived a normal life. No hint of how her husband supported 2 children and her institution fees working as a night-club musician.There are some good performances in Wrong Man, but not even Fonda's star power is enough to boost the rating over the 50% mark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on a true story the fact that Hitchcock had little or no opportunity for any of his 'touches' makes this one of the better films bearing his name as director. It is, on the other hand, difficult to believe that such a Kafkaesque nightmare could get so far. For example, Fonda - who has been mistaken for a hold-up man who clearly resembles him - is fully co-operative with the police, meek, docile, who is happy to walk into premises he is alleged to have robbed so that the proprietors may get a look at him. The two arresting officers were experienced detectives and would surely have 'sensed' that Fonda was innocent. The whole thing kicks off when Fonda visits an insurance company where both he and his wife have policies. The place had been robbed a few weeks previously yet no one, employees or detectives find it bizarre that a robber would return to the scene of his crime bearing a policy which was made out in the name of his wife. The biggest gaffe occurs at the end when the real robber, who has been arrested by another team whilst attempting to rob a store, is seen by one of the two who arrested Fonda - and not only arrested him, but bullied and harassed him and were not prepared for one minute to believe him innocent. This detective, leaving the precinct, passes the real robber who is just about to be booked. Outside the station he does a 'take', goes back and then realizes his mistake. Now possibly it did happen like that but as it is filmed it seems barely credible. For Hitchcock this isn't too bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit different but interesting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You could say that this movie is being quite different from Hitchcock's usual work. The movie is less suspense and more drama. It tries to tell a real story, in a very serious way. The story and premise is still being typical Hitchcock like but it is its execution that makes this a different movie.I can't really say that everything in this movie worked out too well but what the movie still did well was keeping things interesting, by not being ever formulaic. Of course Hitchcock movies always have been something special and original, no matter what genre they were being part of.It actually has a very simple premise of a man being wrongfully accused of crimes he did not commit. All of the evidence and witnesses however point toward him. It's not a great conspiracy movie or thriller, it's simply being about an average man being put suddenly in some not so average and situations. It's a great simple concept that works out well.Not all of the drama works out to well though. In my opinion they should had really left out the subplot with the wife, that slowly is turning crazy due to the sudden, unpleasant circumstances. It did not really worked out very convincing and distracted from the story. This is also due to the fact Vera Miles wasn't really being good or believable enough in her role. But apparently this is also what happened in real life, so they had to put it in the story. Yes, apparently this all really happened, as does Hitchcock himself also explains at the beginning of the movie, with his narration.It's also an all the more interesting movie to watch in todays light. This movie shows how the justice system worked back in the '50's and how things have changed significantly over the years, all for the best by the way, as becomes apparent in this movie. The movie can also really been seen as a social commentary on how the law enforcement worked and how things got investigated, in what seems by todays standards some very amateur like and simplistic manners. It also shows how easily people's opinions can be influenced by others. The one persons say she recognize the man as the perpetrator and everyone else nod their head and go along with it, pointing him out as the man who committed all the crimes.It's a nice movie role from Henry Fonda, who shows his wide range as an actor in this movie, though it's also hardly his best or most memorable performance. It's more the type of performance in which the subtle little things in this movie make it apparent what a great actor Henry Fonda was and how well he was acting in this movie actually. I also really liked Anthony Quayle in this, who is much better known for his later movie roles, from the '60's, despite that he had already starred in some big productions, prior to this movie.Perhaps not great by Hitchcock's usual high standards. I can definitely see some Hitchcock fans being disappointed with this movie but by any other 'normal' standards this is still a great and also original movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chilling because it's all based on a real case.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As this film begins, the audience is no doubt struck with surprise. Instead of the usual hidden cameo by the director, Hitchcock himself addressed the audience in a prologue. He's dark--illuminated from behind and the effect is very striking.What follows is also very striking because unlike Hitchcock's other films, this one is NOT fiction but based on a real case of mistaken identity. As a result, the show play much differently than other Hitchcock films. It is much more like a well-made American crime drama of the era--stripped of many of the romanticized elements of a Hitchcock film and filled with unexpected touches--such as a jazzy soundtrack and very American character actors you would never see in other Hitchcock films. As a result, the film looks more like real life--real life with much more ordinary looking people. The likes of Harold J. Stone, Nehemiah Persoff and even, oddly, Anthony Quayle appear in this film! It also stars Henry Fonda--a great choice for a famous actor who seems like just a guy. All these actors are quite unlike the Cary Grants and Grace Kellys in many of the director's other 1950s films. So, if you didn't know better, you'd swear this is not a Hitchcock movie and seems very, very removed from his films of the same time period such as "North By Northwest", "The Rear Window" and "Vertigo"--all good films, but also films that are easily seen as escapist fiction.The film is a dramatization of a case where an ordinary guy is identified as an armed robber. Despite being innocent, there is a lot of evidence against him and it looks like he's assumed guilty until proved innocent. It also goes to show you that court cases based on eyewitness identifications and circumstantial evidence are not all that reliable--and is an excellent way to get the public to question evidence of this sort (especially identifications involving a crime that occurred a year earlier). It may look convincing, but in this case it was dead wrong and nearly sent a man to prison. It serves to show the jail and courtroom procedure without the fluff and adornment of normal crime films--and heightens the confusion of the audience and helps you relate to the poor central character.It also serves to show how helpless a person can feel in this situation--and how destructive this can be on the accused and his family. Eventually the pressures of the case take a huge emotional toll on the wife--and she slowly loses her mind. This is pretty chilling. It also provided for an interesting appearance, as you see Werner Klemperer ('Colonel Klink' from "Hogan's Heroes") in a very unexpected sort of role.Of all of Hitchcock's films of the 1950s, this is among his least famous. It's just not as splashy as his other films and it being filmed in black &amp; white make it seem pretty ordinary--even though it's an exceptional film. In other words, it's a rather minimalistic version of a Hitchcock film and some might immediately discount it because of this. Stick with it--it is a very, very good film and seems a bit underrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not on the List of Hitchcok's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wrong Man (1956) is one of a few Alfred Hitchcock films that has either not aged well, or was never very good to begin with. Vera Miles does the best she can with a shallow and poorly developed character. Henry Fonda is quite disappointing and delivers some of the most wooden dialogue that he uttered in his entire career as an actor. The movie starts off strong but gradually loses steam as nothing unpredictable or exciting ever develops or happens, (**possible minor spoiler**) unless you consider the wife's stunned disillusionment with the system to be exciting and surprising.This dud also sports one of the corniest and most ridiculous scenes from any critically acclaimed film from the 1950's. The scene with Henry Fonda's character speaking to his oldest son about what is happening to him is just downright laughable. In fact both me and my Hitchcok loving movie viewing companion both totally cracked up during this overly corny and crazily smarmy scene.Without question, this film ranks in the bottom five (5) of Hitchcock's career, and is possibly his second worst effort. It is worth watching just to see how such a brilliant director in his prime with proved actors and actresses, could deliver such a bomb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who's the wrong man? I think it's the actor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an especially depressing movie, although one of Vera Miles best as she slips deeper and deeper into her depression and finally slips over the edge. She didn't need to express a lot of range in this role, but I found her convincing. Henry Fonda was another story. I always thought he was the wrong choice for the role. It's one thing to be naive about the criminal justice system, but throughout the movie, he seems totally out to lunch. There is something wrong with a character that, at some point, doesn't get outraged at being railroaded. Henry Fonda doesn't have the passion for this kind of role. He seems entirely too reasonable while his life crumbles around him. I guess you can blame some of this on the direction, but an actor with more passion could have given us a peek at his frustration and rage. The 50's night photography and the depressing theme doesn't help either. In short, it was like slogging through mud with no reward at the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never thought I would say this about one of Alfred Hitchcock's films, but this is not one of the director's best films.It stars Henry Fonda as an innocent man who is arrested for robbery and assualt, wrecking his happy home-life and nearly destroying his marriage.I think Hitchcock could have done better than this film, which, I'm sorry to say, was a great dissapointment.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was this Larry Hitchcock? Surely not Alfred. No, no, no.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't bother. Really. Dull and surprisingly amateurish, considering the talents involved. Just because something is based on a true story doesn't make it a good film. Henry Fonda underplays his role and appears catatonic. Vera Miles overacts. Interesting only for its residual camp value and potential to inspire contemporary audience appreciation for the Miranda decision. Watch something else instead, "Notorious", say, even if you've already seen it. You will be better off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No chemistry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would have to say I was disappointed in the Wrong Man. I am a big fan of both Henry Fonda and Alfred Hitchcock and I felt this was a poor effort by both the brilliant actor and the brilliant director. In this movie Henry Fonda's performance was flat. I felt like he was sleepwalking through the movie, never involved in either the fear of being processed by the legal system or in the relief when the real criminal was found. I did not see anything special in Hitchcock's cinematography or in the way he presented the movie. I never felt any suspense or for that fact any interest in the charters he brought to the screen. The ending was very anti-climatic. If you are looking for a good performance by a young Henry Fonda see "Once upon a time in the west"; for Hitchcock see "Notorious".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take a pass on this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has got to be one of the worst Hitchcock films. Just going by the title, you can predict the ending. It is something that has probably been done a thousand time. I know it's based on a true story, but that still doesn't mean it couldn't been better. The acting was stilted and robotic. You'll hardly be moved emotionally. There is no suspense and it was very boring. The movie started out alright but headed straight downhill after the midpoint.Another thing - considering the setting is in Queens, why do so few in the casts have a NY dialect? They all sound like they're from England or some other part of the US.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreary, Slow, and Pointless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amazing that there are people who call this Hitchcock's best movie. This film is so slow and pointless that it is hard to believe it is even a Hitchcock film. There is no suspense, no tension, and no drama.The basic story: Manny Balestrero is a jazz bass player in a night club. He has a wife and two sons, and they are barely making ends meet. He goes to the bank to see about borrowing money on his wife's insurance policy (to pay for a dental operation for his wife) and is mistakenly identified as a man who robbed the bank days earlier. The rest of the movie is spent, slowly, showing Manny trying to prove his innocence.But the thing is, it's not suspenseful at all. We know Manny is innocent. We also know it is unlikely he will be jailed for a crime he did not commit. How odd that Hitchcock, the man who practically invented the suspenseful movie, can do nothing with this material. Even when Manny learns that everyone who can confirm his innocence has died, nothing is done with the fact. No intrigue, no development. Manny just looks sad some more.Most of the scenes drag on intolerably. Perhaps they were shocking to white America at the time - I doubt most white-collar people had seen the inside of a holding cell, or knew what happened when you were brought in for questioning. And it is somewhat funny to see how horribly police could treat suspects back then. Manny is arrested without being told what he did, is not allowed to call his wife, and is put through the most laughably inept investigation process ever organized. The police actually have him write out two copies of the stick-up note for a "handwriting comparison", then use the notes he wrote to indict him. And the lineup is particularly hilarious. The people doing the identification are in plain sight, with the light over their head dimmed. But after identifying the criminal, they walk out where the suspects can see them!The movie plods along, and there is no resolution. By the end Manny's wife has gone crazy (no real reason why, women went crazy at the drop of a hat in 50's movies) and is institutionalized. Manny's innocence is proven because he prays - an unbelievably insulting notion. There is a bunch of religious nonsense thrown in at the last minute, in an attempt to lend the movie credence. After his devout mother reminds him to pray for strength, the real criminal commits another stickup and is caught. His innocence does not help his wife's condition, but as the movie ends we are treated to a Dragnet-style text summation informing us that his wife regained her sanity two years later. Ridiculous.There is nothing to recommend this movie. I saw it for free on a movie channel and it wasn't worth the time I invested. I would recommend any other Hitchcock movie before this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hitchcock's Most Underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wrong Man, The (1956) *** 1/2 (out of 4)Forgotten Hitchcock classic is based on real events. Musician Manny Balestrero (Henry Fonda) gets picked up on armed robbery charges but he's innocent of the crime. Some strange evidence, including a couple eye witnesses, ends him up on trial without much hope for any type of acquittal while his wife (Vera Miles) slowly cracks under the pressure. When people talk about the classic Alfred Hitchcock movies they mention stuff like VERTIGO, REAR WINDOW, PSYCHO and of course NORTH BY NORTHWEST. It seems that the director simply has so many classics that many of his other films simply get lost in the crowd and that's certainly the case with THE WRONG MAN. This is such a good film with some really great performances and a rather scary situation that it's hard to believe that it's been overlooked since it was first released. I think what works so well is the way Hitchcock films it as if it was a documentary. The director makes his "cameo" right at the start of the film when he addresses the viewers and lets them know that this film is based on a real event. Having the director address the viewer this way brings a very serious tone to the film and this corrupt atmosphere hangs over the film from start to finish. Fonda was the perfect choice to play this role because, needless to say, the actor was always terrific at playing your everyday man and someone that the audience could connect with. Fonda really does a remarkable job in the role and just check out the scene where the innocent man sees what it's like behind bars for the first time. Just watch Fonda's eyes as the door opens and it finally hits him that he's in some major trouble. Miles is also quite good in her role but I think the screenplay let her down in a way but more on that later. Anthony Quayle is wonderful as Fonda's attorney and Harold J. Stone is also very good in his role as the lead detective. Bernard Herrmann offers up a terrific score that really puts you in the mind frame of the Fonda character and the director perfectly uses it to build up tension as the film goes along. It was well known that Hitchcock had a fear of the police and you have to think that he wanted to make this film because he could feel the terror of being falsely accused of something and even though you're innocent there's simply no way to prove it other than you're a good person. Hitchcock really nails this from start to finish and one can't help but get caught up in the story. I think the one weak thing is what ends up happening to the wife as she has a nervous breakdown from all the stress. This happened in real life but I think this could have been one of the changes that Hollywood made to the story. The stuff with the wife happens in a short period of time and it's not given enough attention to be believable and what little screen time it does get just takes the focus away from the main story. With that said, it's a shame that THE WRONG MAN has been overlooked for all these years because it shows the director and the star at the top of their games.</fullReview>
