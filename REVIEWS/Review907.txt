		<shortDescription>A Change of Direction For Rocky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Continuing my plan to watch every Sly Stallone movie in order, I come to the second sequel to the Oscar winning ' Rocky', Rocky 3. After the success of Rocky 2, Sly tanked at the box office (unfairly in this reviewers opinion, as both are solid entertainment) with Nighthawks and Escape To Victory. So Sly returned to Rocky once more Plot In A Paragraph: Rocky (Stallone) is champion of the world, has 10 title defences under his belt, has untold fame and fortune and is given his own statue. When suddenly a new challenger arrives, the vicious Clubber Lang (Mr.T) who Mickey (Burgess Meredith) is keen for Rocky to avoid. For a series as long running as the Rocky movies, it's only natural for there to be the occasional need for a breath of fresh air - a fresh perspective on a tried and tested formula. After the last movie relied heavily on the first movie, a fresh rethink was called for by creator/writer, director and star Stallone despite the previous film's box office success. After meddling with scripts and the movies editing on his last two pictures Stallone is back in full creative control. And it's to the movies benefit. Stallone is at his best when playing Rocky--it is his vision and his creation--and despite what Hollywood wants us to think, he is not a bad director either.From the supercharged "Eye of the Tiger" opening this film just does not let up. All of the cast are great, none more so than Stallone himself. The scene of Mickey's death after Rocky's destruction at the hands of Clubber Lang is brilliant-But the Masterstroke here lies in making Apollo a far more central character after Mickey's death. all of this and I still haven't even mentioned CLUBBER! Mr .T is perfect as Clubber Lang a great adversary for Rocky and the power and intensity his character displays in the ring is ferocious. I still say Mike Tyson stole Clubber Lnag's act!!The second fight between Rocky and Clubber is just breathtaking, the pace of the fight is electric, some of the camera work makes you feel like you are literally in the ring with these two warriors.This movie is a must for anyone with the slightest interest in being entertained!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Be nice, it ain't that bad.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clearly the most entertaining of the Rocky films due to its perfect pacing and well-choreographed matches. Stallone is at his best when playing Rocky--it is his vision and his creation--and, despite what Hollywood wants us to think, he is not a bad director either.What he masters are "subtleties" (my term): certain facial expressions or small actions/reactions at perhaps less-than-pivotal moments which reveal his skill. They need to be really looked for to be seen, which is why only those who without the ability to look deeper than the surface find him so mediocre.I don't want to give them all away, but here's one example of a subtlety that shows just how human he can make his characters (especially Rocky): in this film, in the break between the end of Round 2 and the beginning of Round 3, he is sitting in his corner getting a mouthful from Apollo. An assistant starts to spray something in his face (probably something to coagulate the blood, I don't know), but Rocky, who is focused intently on Apollo's furious coaching, opens his mouth as if he is expecting water to be sprayed in. He suddenly flinches in disgust as the spray goes in his mouth and stings his face. It's just a tiny tiny humorous moment that speaks loudly about attention to detail.Or how about in Rocky 2, at the beginning of the match when they meet in the center of the ring and Apollo starts making his bravado-laden threats, we see Rocky just sort of nod and half-smile at him politely, then next you see a side-on shot of him turning to walk back to his corner, and the look on his face says "What a prick." Priceless.I'm not a fan of boxing, or the first Rocky movie (too slow), or the last Rocky movie (huh?), but this one is extremely enjoyable for me to watch as a human being who faces challenges just like anyone else, and who needs that occasional inspiration to give me a dose of determination to overcome them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great flick !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another film worthy of a Frank Stallone sound track, Rocky 3 has been one of the biggest box office turn outs in history. Not only did every Italian American run out to see this film when it was in the theaters but it made the song "Eye of the Tiger" a national hit. Rocky 3 was also a debut film for MR. T. An excellent performance as one of the best villains in movie history. This one is not only written by Sly....it is also directed by him as well. Check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ups And Downs Of Rocky &amp; Mr. T</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For pure entertainment, this might be the best of the five "Rocky" movies. I mean, where else can you see Rocky, his entourage, Mr.T. and Hulk Hogan all creating mayhem in the same movie? Hokey? Oh, man, yes indeed, but it probably has more ups and downs and memorable scenes than any in this series. Some examples:DOWN - "Rocky Balboa" (Sylvester Stallone) fights an exhibition match with a wild overzealous wrestling giant called "Thunderlips" (Hulk Hogan) and almost gets killed. UP - However, he rallies to beat the over-sized animal.DOWN - In defending his boxing title, Rocky gets pummeled by a loudmouth boxer "Clubber Lang" (Mr. T.). DOWN - His longtime manager "Mickey" (Burgess Meredith) collapses at the arena before the fight and then dies. UP - Rocky's former rival "Apollo Creed" agrees to train our hero in a re-match against the obnoxious villain Lang.DOWN - Down and depressed, Rocky is unable to train and be has lost his will to fight again. UP - He finds his "eye of the tiger" spirit and trains with great inspiration, becoming even and quicker and faster afoot than Creed!This goes on and on and on, climaxed by the fight which, of course, has another 30 of these "ups and downs." By the end, you're more worn out than Burgess Meredith. Mr. T, by the way, makes a great villain and the filmmakers added to the suspense using slow-motion action scenes and effective sound with all the punches, grunts and groans all add to the circus-like atmosphere. Nobody grunted like Mr. T!It's corny, it's hokey, etc., but it somehow works and certainly gives the viewer what it delivers in the ring: non-stop entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, Look Who's Still Got It!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>30 minutes shorter than its predecessors-- according to audience reactions I still disagree with, that's the same curse that held "Superman IV" in Hollywood Purgatory (or maybe lower).Thank heavens "Rocky III" is still an enjoyable piece of work!For Stallone's second shot in the director's chair, he pits his famous character against Clubber Lang, a testosterone-oozing Mr. T. The trouble is, has Rocky grown complacent in light of his massive celebrity?While it does stick to something of a formula, R3 still comes out swinging, with more humor and better drama than the first two, but doesn't reach the cheer-inspiring fever pitch of the second.A worthwhile entry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good addition to the "Rocky" series...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"No, I don't hate Balboa. I pity the fool."- Mr. TWho would have ever thought that, after a sequel to a movie that needed none, the "Rocky" chronicles could remain so interesting? Yes, a lot of people make fun of these movies, but I've always thought that the "Rocky" sequels were a lot better than they could have been -- especially considering the fact that the first film is arguably one of the greatest ever made, and definitely not the type of film that should have merited four sequels. How many times can we see Rocky re-train and win a battle? It's always the same. Yet somehow "Rocky III" comes across as a fresh one-two punch. Extremely easy to watch and fun to get into, this is a retread of the first and second film. But, as I said, somehow everything seems fresh.Arguably the final "good" film in the series (although I still consider the last two passable), this chapter sees the death of Mickey (Burgess Meredith), a fierce opponent (Mr. T) ready to take on Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), an angry Paulie (Burt Young), an eager-to-train Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), and an insane 7-foot boxer (Hulk Hogan).After defeating Apollo Creed at the end of Part II, Rocky is challenged and defeated in the ring by Clubber Lang (Mr. T). Things continue to go wrong when his boxing trainer dies, and Rocky drifts into a state of self loathing and hatred. After the city of Philadelphia presents him with a statue of himself, he drives over to it with his motorcycle and throws his helmet at it.Rocky blames himself for Mickey's death, and nearly turns down Apollo's offer to train Rocky so that he can enter the ring one more time and give a real beating to Clubber Lang. But alas, he decides to enter into the ring one last time, and so with the help of Apollo and his wife (Talia Shire), he trains harder and longer than he ever has before.That is all there is, in short. In between we get corny dialogue like, "You've gotta get back the Eye of the Tiger, man!" while the song plays in the background as we see Rocky and Apollo running on the beach in short-shorts and lifting weights together and boxing and doing jump ropes. (These things may be interpreted as homosexual nowadays, by the way.)Having boxed a bit myself, the "Rocky" series always seems pretty close to reality. I've never been in a ring like "real" boxers, but I've done the same training with boxing bags and running and jump ropes and so on. It's hard work, just like it is in the movie. And this is the perfect film to give you the inspiration to work out. Strange, right? Don't ever, ever quote me on that last paragraph. In fact, just forget the entire thing.The film, written and directed by Stallone, is surprisingly sweet and endearing. We still care for Rocky after three films -- and hey, as old as the training scenes may get, I still love them. This movie isn't as good as the first "Rocky," or maybe even the second, but I still say that this series has a long way to go before it reaches the murky depths of "Police Academy."And take some advice from Stallone: "Boy, sometimes charity really hurts!" Oh, wait, never mind. Wrong quote. How about this? "Nothing is real if you don't believe in who you are!" Okay, it's not the next "Citizen Kane." But you'll be hard-pressed to find a more entertaining second sequel than this.3.5/5 stars.- John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fighter. A Lover. A Legend. The Greatest Challenge.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rocky III brings out a lot of raw emotion, in a heartfelt third sequel. This film also proves that some people have times where the motivation to want to do something is impossible to recapture, and that anyone who gets complacent about where he or she is in life will not achieve his or her full potential. However with some encouragement from family and friends, anything and everything is possible. Rocky seems to make me want to bring the best out in myself, when at times I feel like doing the exact opposite.Having defeated heavyweight champion Apollo Creed, Rocky now holds the title and all of the comforts it brings. Gone is the self-doubting, small time boxer ? the new Rocky even takes the time to compete in charity events most notably against the mountain of muscle, Hulk Hogan. His perfect world is rocked by a challenge from the obnoxious and taunting Chubber Lang. Rocky does not take the fight seriously ? despite his boxing prowess, he lacks raw hunger of his opponent and is defeated. The loss is however is incomparable with the tragedy of the death of his longtime trainer, Mickey. Rocky is taken aback when Apollo Creed offers to train him and win back the heavyweight crown in the ?comeback of the century'. All Apollo wants in return is a ?favour', which he will not disclose until after the fight. With Creed's help Rocky again develops ?the eye of the tiger' and the scene is set for another powerful battle in the ring.The cast of Rocky III was great once again. Taking on the roll of Rocky for a third time was Sylvester Stallone. I have watched the whole serious and his acting ability just gets better and better. His scenes along with Carl Weathers in this movie are really special. I am sure these two would be good friends in real life and I can see why they are. It was the final time we get to see the ever-green Burgess Meredith. His role as Rocky's trainer Mickey ended in this part of the Rocky saga, which for me was a little sad. He was the perfect person for the role of Mickey, as he made you feel as if he was a real boxing trainer. There was also another good role from the now ?Mrs. Balboa', of course I am talking about Talia Shire. She was such a good choice as Adrian. I am sure a famous actress would have spoiled that part of Rocky.Yet the one surprising part of this cast is a new edition, that being the brutal Mr. T. He made his presence felt onscreen extremely well. I enjoyed how you felt he was so confident, yet he had the fist to back it up. I never got that heavily into The A-Team, but what I can remembering seeing of it was enjoyable. His role in that show was also very heavy, but he was one person you could look forward too seeing on TV. The story of Rocky III was for an enjoyable one. To have our champ up against it, for me made this an interesting premise. Then to thrown in the death of trainer, a very angry opponent, who is sure that he can take out Balboa in two miserly rounds. Then to top it off we have the great rivals, becoming great friends and teaming up to defeat this very nasty opponent. Stallone is a great writer, with the Rocky franchise a joy to watch in my view.Up in till now, I have not mentioned the powerful soundtracks that accompany these great movies. The main theme especially had a powerful impact on me, to the extent, that I wanted to try and achieve something that normally I would say is just too hard to do. The trumpets at the start are just great. Yet the third movie was based around the ?eye of the tiger'. This was in relation into Rocky get that hunger back to get back into the ring as a real fighter. The eye of the tiger is also a great song that was sung by the group, Survivor. As the movies are made in this series, the music just gets better and better. So Rocky III makes my summation from the first film come true, that Rocky is truly about motivation. Yet it also shows that if you can rekindle the passion, then you can achieve more than you could ever wished for. With its powerful music, great acting and story, I am glad that by 1982 the world had seen 3 movies with the name ?Rocky' attached to them!Rating: 4 Stars or 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without a doubt the best film of the series...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rocky 3 is without a doubt the best film in the series. Rocky I and II are tremendous films that focus more on Rocky and Adrian's love for one another and their journey from unhappiness to complete fulfillment. Rocky IV while visually stunning, is verging on SCI-FI it is so unrealistic( I still can't get over 2000PSI!!) and Rocky V makes the whole journey seem almost worthless. But the third film in my opinion has the perfect blend. From the supercharged "Eye of the Tiger" opening to the classic Rocky v Apollo ending, this film just does not let up. All of the cast act their socks off here, none more so than Stallone himself. The scene of Mickey's death after Rocky's destruction at the hands of Clubber Lang is brilliant- you can feel the genuine emotion Stallone has for Mickey's character and the chemistry between Meredith and Stallone is there up to the very last scene they had together. But the Masterstroke here lies in making Apollo a far more central character after Mickey's death. Carl Weathers pulls of a huge feat in this film in that he fills Meredith's shoes so to speak- not an easy job when you consider just how important Mickey is to the Rocky films. WOW, all of this and I still haven't even mentioned CLUBBER! Clubber Lang is a great adversary for Rocky and the power and intensity his character displays in the ring is ferocious. The second fight between Rocky and Clubber is just breathtaking, the pace of the fight is electric, some of the camera work makes you feel like you are literally in the ring with these two warriors. And more importantly here we see Balboa at his absolute peak- technically and physically, he actually looks and fights like a man who is the BEST fighter in the world. Rocky evolves in this film into a boxer with speed, skill, intelligence and power. A triumph of a movie that I would recommend to anyone with the slightest interest in being entertained!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oddly enough, my favorite Rocky movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Rocky movie is a rather quick flowing film compared to the first movies and features a bit more comedy while still having drama and inspirational scenes that were pivotal in the first two movies. The fights are different here too, as in this film we do not have the 15 round beat downs of the first films, but rather three rounds of pure hard hitting. In this one we start out with a strange charity match as Rocky the heavyweight champion of boxing goes against the heavyweight champion of wrestling, Thunderlipps (Hulk Hogan in his only decent appearance in a movie, then again it is not really a stretch). This match is rather entertaining and funny, but soon Rocky must face a new challenger to his belt, the very tough Clubber Lang played by a very tough Mr. T. Mickey does not want Rocky to fight this guy as Mickey has seen that Rocky has lost the fire in his eyes that got him the title and would most likely lose to this determined if a bit arrogant new fighter. Well they do end up fighting and Rocky loses and gets hit even worse by the passing of his mentor. Apollo having witnessed the fight and not liking Clubber Lang at all offers to help Rocky train and thus a new friendship is born. The training is nice to watch and I like how Rocky does different strategies against Clubber in the final fight. Sure this movie is a bit more over the top than the previous Rocky movies, it to me is still my favorite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my favorite in the rocky movies. Sylvester Stallone is awesome. Mr. t is great. Bringing in hulk hogan to beat the crap out of Rocky had me cheering.So rocky finally beats up Apollo creed, a legendary boxer. so rocky is now famous, doing ads and TV shows like the Muppet show. now, Mr. t, or clubber Lang, is very angry, saying he wants his shot at the title. rocky's fame starts going to his head, so he takes the challenge. he gets easily beaten by clubber, and then loses his motivation. and then Apollo comes to him and tells him he has what it takes to get it back. so will he fight Clubber and win the title?This movie takes the icing with the actors. Sylvester Stallone, Mr. T, and Hulk hogan are enough to bring audiences. This movie is 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching Rocky 3 again ? I was struck by how nice a bookend to the whole piece it would have been. I'm a huge fan of these movies ? I believe they rise above the popcorn bracket they are placed in.As much as i love the idea of 4 and 5 and 6 for that matter it gets a bit ridiculous to watch his IQ rise and fall through the series. Indeed by 2007 when the last is released we should expect to see a bubbling wreck a la the once mighty Ali ? which might have been a nice character piece ? but what we'll get maybe we'll get that one in a few years. But back to Rocky 3. Mr T is menacing ? Coach is frail and plucky and the Adrian/Paulie siblings continue to annoy rather than add to the story. Adrian now seems adept at motivational speaking and Paulie just plain gets on the nerves. The reason I say it would make a perfect end to the series is that a lot of things come full circle. Rocky and his one time enemy become friends ? Mickey dies and Adrian blossoms fully. Rocky proves that he is not just a one time lucky bum made good by beating not just the new threat to the throne but his own fears. Sure it's east to see it doesn't have the gravitas of the original but it has moments. And above all else Stallone created a character that people just love to get behind.A worthy film to any DVD collection. Take it for what it is and not what others try to make of it. It's good solid entertainment and won't disappoint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, a few months ago, I felt that it's kinda silly for me to claim to be a movie fan yet not see the Rocky movies and my friend even told me that it's a must see to be an official movie fanatic. So, I had decided to see all the Rocky flicks, and low and behold there is a 6th one coming out next year, so what better time? I felt that people are a little harsh on "Rocky III". Yeah, it's lost a little more edge and originality, but I felt that they kept it cool and within it's origins. Come on, I mean it's the eye of the tiger! Mr. T, he's so cool. He's so bad and you want to hate him, but you can't because he's just so cool. I loved the twist of having Apollo help Rocky train to defeat Mr. T. What more could a Rocky fan want out of this film? It's going strong and I can't wait to watch the fourth one. I know what happens unfortunately, I watch those "I love the 80's" shows. :P But I'm still excited, I love these Rocky movies. I may just see Rocky X! Come on, fans, this doesn't deserve a 5.6, let's get that rating up! 7/10</fullReview>

Rocky 3 is an exceptional film which inspired an entire nation he has more fights in this film then any other Rocky film to date. This film deserves a way better rating it was one of the biggest hits in the 60's and it's not even a 7. The movie was utterly outstanding and the biggest film buff nick V even enjoyed the film immensely it's the embodiment of entertainment, OK i might have over exaggerated but without a doubt it deserves more then a 7.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** "Rocky III" is another sequel from the first and second "Rocky". It's about Mr. T. wanting to have a match with Rocky(Stallone). It's also about the statue of Rocky standing in Philadelphia. It's sad when Mickey died after the boxing match in the middle of the movie. It was great when Rocky(Stallone) befriended Apollo Creed(Weathers) by working and exercising together for another boxing match with Mr. T. And by the way, "Eye Of The Tiger" was a great song in this cool movie. "Rocky III" has been one of the greatest Stallone movies ever created.

It's about a man that believes in himself, it's about hope and honesty with yourself.There's more into the Rocky series then an underdog story... it's about a man and his life's story. It's about the power of trust... because Rocky believed in himself first of all, he knew that he was a great in what he was doing and he impressed the hole world with that.Apollo's help meant in a symbolic way, that in life, there will always be someone else to believe in you. Even someone you thought to be your challenger. And of course there's his wife that will be with him no matter what.I believe that the Rocky movies are about a man that's showing the world, being poor is not a problem... being gifted it is... :))</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Round 3: Rocky Balboa vs. Mr. T. I Pity the Fool Who'd Miss This Fight!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Our story begins right before our last one left off: Italian Stallion Rocky Balboa versus Apollo Creed in a devastating rematch. With some powerful punches, Rocky lays out Apollo as they both fall to the arena floor. Rocky manages to get up so he wins. He is the new Heavyweight Champion of the World! And since then, Rocky has been traveling the world, fighting in numerous and rigorous boxing matches. He's appeared in commercials, TV shows, even The Muppet Show. Yes, these past 6 years, Rocky Balboa had become a household name. But unbeknownst to Rocky, a tough, gritty, southpaw boxer named Clubber Lang had been watching Rocky for 6 years and demanded to fight him. Clubber has won match after match, pummeling each opponent beyond recognition, and he desperately wanted to challenge Rocky for the title of Heavyweight Champ. Meanwhile, Paulie began losing a lot of respect for his friend Rocky and wanted nothing further to do with him, until he offered him a job. Rocky, Adrian and Rocky Jr. have moved from their townhouse into a giant mansion, and invited Mickey and Paulie to move in with them. Life was great. Then one night, Rocky would be fighting in the ring for charity. His opponent: a wrestler. Yes, 6'6, 390 pounds Thunderlips!Now a match between a boxer and a wrestler is never pretty. Thunderlips climbed into the ring and wanted nothing more than to twist Rocky's head from his shoulders. The fight was on. Thunderlips proceeded to crush Rocky, slam him against his knee, slam him to the floor and jump on him, and finally chucked him right out of the ring. But Rocky bounced right back and finally played out some old school boxing. He successfully laid out Thunderlips and tossed HIM out of the ring. It was a tie and they raised $75,000 for charity; Rocky had a statue of himself dedicated to him, and as he spoke to the crowd, Clubber Lang approached him and demanded a fight, but Rocky had decided to give up the ship and retire from boxing. But when Clubber crossed the line taunting him, the fight was on. But Mickey wanted nothing to do with it and decided to leave. Rocky pleaded with him so he agreed to train him. But instead of doing it at Mickey's gym, they trained in an area filled with Rocky's fans, Rocky merchandise, and a band! Finally, the night of the fight was on. Clubber Lang was driven by anger and sheer hatred. The fight was over in the second round, Clubber had won and Rocky had lost his title of Heavyweight Champ. Worse to come, Mickey's health was failing quickly and he died later that night. After the funeral, Rocky was inconsolable. He didn't know what to do. It was then that his former opponent, Apollo Creed, approached him and offered to train him for a rematch with Clubber.So, Rocky, Apollo, Adrian and Paulie head for Los Angeles to the neighborhood gym where Apollo started out. It was in a trashy neighborhood which didn't appeal to Paulie at all. Rocky's heart just wasn't in to training. He blamed himself for Mickey's death. It wasn't until Adrian confronted him that he suddenly found the courage and the strength. So, Rocky and Apollo engage in rigorous training. They ran on the beach, swam laps in the pool, even pummeled the old punching bag. And before you can say, "It's the eye of the tiger, the thrill of the fight",Rocky Balboa had once again become a lean, mean, boxing machine. And so, the rematch with Clubber Lang was on in Madison Square Gardens. Apollo gave Rocky his old red, white and blue trunks to wear. Clubber was even angrier and filled with even more hate than before. He was going to paint the arena with Rocky's brains. Round 1: Rocky had the advantage, but Clubber quickly countered with jab thrusts. Round 2: Clubber had the advantage and pounded on Rocky with numerous blows to the face. By Round 3: both men stained in sweat and blood, lunged at each other. Clubber laid out Rocky with some death-defying blows. It seemed like it was all over for the Italian Stallion, when suddenly he bounced back and pounded Clubber like there was no tomorrow and laid him out with an vigorous, angry blow. The fight was his! Rocky Balboa was once again the Heavyweight Champion of the World! After the fight, Rocky and Apollo do a little sparring for old time's sake.Well, what can I say about Rocky III? It was good. Just as good as the 1976 original and 1979 sequel. Sylvester Stallone is back as Rock, and is as good as ever. Talia Shire is back as Adrian, Burt Young is Paulie, Carl Weathers is Apollo and Burgess Meredith is Mickey. All turned in great performances. This was sadly the last movie for Mickey, even though he makes a short appearance in Rocky V. Too bad, Mickey was a great character and Burgess Meredith was so good as him. We have Mr. T, famous boxer and future star of "The A-Team" as Clubber Lang, and WWF wrestling champ Hulk Hogan as Thunderlips. This one has a lot more fighting than the last two movies. It focuses more on Rocky boxing than Rocky outside the arena. And "Eye of the Tiger " is an awesome song! So, if you've seen Rocky and Rocky II, by all means, see Rocky III! Sly Stallone wrote and directed. Then see Rocky IV and V. I recommend Rocky III. I pity the fool that don't see this movie!-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an excellent story of a true underdog getting back on top</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rocky is one of my all time favourite series of films and Rocky three, in my opinion is the best one ever. It gives the fans the chance to see that people can fall from grace, but can get themselves back on top and achieve there biggest goals. This is a message for all audiences i think. Its not about how hard you fall; we all saw Rocky hit the mat in round three. Its s about how determined your are to get back up. Rocky sets out to show true reality in many ways. The film shows us raw emotions through its characters and true love which helps Rocky get back on his feet. Its also proves that our enemies can become our true friends.The best part of the film for me is the transition of Rocky. He goes from being on top of the world, with the heavyweight title around his waist, to getting beaten and being looked on as passed it and old, to once again proving he is the best and defeating the mighty Clubber Lang. For me Rocky gives me motivation. It teaches me that anything is possible, you just need to put your mind to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rocky Balboa wants to retire from a successful boxing career but along comes Clubber Lang who challenges him to one more fight. There are people all around him who say that he cannot do and that he is too old but there is an old rival that comes along and helps him out. Rocky learns not to give up and pick himself back up and fight.This is an inspirational movie that I watch whenever someone tells me that I cannot achieve something. Rocky is a great role model for me because he has a drive and passion to come back from the dirt and become something great. He doesn't let anyone say that he cannot do it. He just keeps fighting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do NOT read this review if you have not seen Rocky III. This is more for people who are considering re watching it after many years.I don't think many people will argue that the original Rocky was the best made movie of the series. Keep in mind I have not seen Rocky Balboa yet so I am basing my opinion on Rocky 1 - 5.I don't even care much for Sly but his role in Rocky I was perfect for him as he was completely believable as the semi bum Italian boxer who was tougher tan nails in the ring.Rocky II was the movie everyone wanted because they wanted to see Rocky not just survive but WIN the championship.Rocky III has the most entertainment value to me because we already know the characters, we know the love story, we know Apollo Creed, Pauly, and Mickey.Rocky gets soft fighting has beens for easy money and starts to get a big head.Mr T making his first appearance on the big screen played the role of the young hungry fighter perfectly IMO. He was strong, vicious, fought dirty, and wanted the championship more than anything else on earth. Rocky had sense lost the desire.Micky tell Rocky he wont be a part of this fight because "This guy will knock you into tomorrow" as only the great Burgess Meredith could say it.Rocky prepares lightly for the first fight with the mighty Clubber Lang and Mickey dies during the first fight after a m?lée ensues before the fight between the Rocky and Clubber Lang Camps.Rocky gets destroyed by Clubber.Rocky is depressed, feels like he has lost his meaning in life, and sees no hope. Apollo Creed comes to the rescue with the famous "Eye of the Tiger" speech and the popular pop song is played during the movie in place of the "working hard" to make it more distinctly feel like an 80s movie as compared to its predecessors.As I am sure you know, Rocky wears Clubber Lang down in the rematch and knocks him out in the third round.The reason this is my favorite is the combination of the fact that I already liked the characters, Apollo's character is expanded on, and this movie is almost all action. It starts off with scenes from the Rocky II Apollo Creed rematch and then goes to scenes of him fighting lesser fighters. In between it switches to Clubber Lang knocking out fighters in a much more vicious manner and moving up the ranks. Rocky III even throws ins a charity match between Rocky and Hulk Hogan as an exhibition between a wrestler and a boxer. After Apollo and Adrian (Yo Adrian) gets Rocky of of his funk, it quickly goes through Rocky getting the eye of the tiger back and then quickly moves to the rematch with Clubber Lang. I don't think there was anyone who saw this movie who had any doubt he would lose the rematch.The ensuing Rocky IV and V were very bad especially 5. I recommend Rocky III as great fun one night for another viewing on DVD of course.At this point, the initial reviews for Rocky Balboa (Rocky 6) are looking positive. I laughed when I heard it was made but I am know looking forward to hopefully the final chapter in the Rocky Saga.</fullReview>

Francis Ford Coppola's sister, Talia Shire returns in the role she has in all 5, and Carl Weathers, Apollo, is back.

		<fullReview>Rocky III (1982, Dir. Sylvester Stallone) Rocky Balboa has finally beaten Apollo Creed, and feels that he has nothing left to achieve. He plans to retire. Boxing brawler Clubber Lang becomes the Number 1 Contender, and wants his match with Balboa. Rocky is reluctant at first, but finally agrees to take on Clubber Lang. But things go from bad to worse, where Rocky's manager Micky unfortunately dies. Rocky must now train with his former opponent, Creed. Rocky now not just fighting for the title, but also for the confidence of everyone and especially of all, for Micky.I felt that the third addition into the 'Rocky' series was better than the second film but not as great as the original. All the original actors are back in the parts that we all love. Micky's death is really emotional for those who've watched the series from the beginning. The action is great and the training montage is amazing this time, especially with the wonderful 'Eye of the Tiger' theme blasting out. There are some humour and some sadness, but overall is a great 'Rocky' movie."Why are you doing this?" - Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) "Because you can't win Rock. This guy will kill you to death in three rounds." - Micky (Burgess Meredith)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rocky III isn't better than the previous two. The gritty realism and characterization is no longer with us and what we are given is something that's more comic-strip like and predictable. However, although it isn't brilliant, Rocky III stands out in a unique way. You can't help to be lured into fantasy when 'The Eye Of The Tiger' begins to play over the opening titles as we get a glimpse of Rocky at his best - beating an array of challengers in triumph. Rocky is a true champion. Then, we have Clubber Lang. He falls short to Apollo Creed in terms of humaness and conviction but nevertheless is a suitable draw-up for the film's story. The boxing champion of the world finds his world close to ruins after the all-mean Clubber causes his manager to have a heart attack and then beats him for his precious title. Actually, it's a common case. The bad beat the good to steal something which is good. However, the good don't usually fight back due to fear or the fact that this isn't possible. But you can place a smile on your face because we're in the movies, we're in a Rocky picture. Although the specific plot in Rocky III isn't realistic we can to relate it by this way. Rocky III helps us to enjoy ourselves while gathered around the television and also in confronting our demons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rocky III is a new direction for the series the drama is still on but it becomes even more action packed with a new villain played by Mr. T and Stallone trying to get back in the ring after the death of Mickey. With the original cast return for another sequel, even better music and an unexpected fight with a wrestler (Hulk Hogan) Balboa proves once more he is more than muscles. The 3rd sequel in the series is my 2nd favorite in the franchise i know that many people will argue since the first 2 were more dramatic and less action this one is no where near like other franchises that should have stopped back in 1 or 3. Rocky still provides fun and it's definitely a part 3 that doesn't disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An OK sequel to the first two but lost a lot of its umfph</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the character of Rocky Balboa, success always seemed miles away. Struggling to make it through on a daily basis on the urban streets was never an easy task. His sluggish yet innocent personality made him an obvious target to individuals who wanted to take advantage of him. For all that, everything would change when he went toe-to-toe (twice) with the latest heavyweight boxing champion Apollo Creed. Even after the first fight, Rocky had become nothing short of legend. As for the rematch, it was what solidified his image as the rising star that he was. Rocky (1976) and Rocky II (1979) are the two films that book-ended this story so nicely. Of course there would be a continuation that would be in the form of this feature but did it maintain the same level of quality? It's there, but not as much. It's still a well-made and captivating entry but it lacks the substance that made the first two so gratifying to see.The film begins like it did with its first sequel by recapping the finale of its predecessor and showing how much of a beating Rocky could really take. After winning the title, Rocky then becomes engrossed in his fame by covering promo ads, photo shoots, celebrity show cameos and interviews. Despite this, Rocky ends up confronting a new opponent named Clubber Lang (Mr. T) and discovers he may not be as prepared as he thought, so Apollo Creed returns to get Rocky in shape one last time. As for Stallone's direction on how he wanted Rocky to develop as a character, the idea was absolutely fine. When someone becomes famous and is offered riches beyond their imagination, who wouldn't indulge? The lesson behind it all is that you can't let your guard down, no matter how comfortable you feel. Nonetheless, Stallone's writing misfires a number of times in compensation for his directing.The problems in the screenplay are that unlike its forerunners, there are a couple of scenes that do not add any meaning to the story at hand. Right at the start, Rocky has to confront his Brother-in-law Pauly (Burt Young) about his reckless behavior. Turns out that Pauly is jealous over Rocky's fame, yet the matter is resolved all within the same scene. Another is the charity match between Rocky and Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan). There's nothing wrong with this match up; who wouldn't want to see it? But the fact that it did not move the plot a long in any way other than for the spectacle of Hogan Vs Stallone had no use. These kinds of instances are wasteful. Meanwhile, the audience could have had more sentimental scenes between Rocky and his family. That's not the case though. The audience barely views any family time between Rocky, his wife Adrian and young son.Instead, fans see Pauly constantly complaining and Adrian saying almost nothing important until close to the final act. Along with developing Rocky and his family, his opponent Clubber Lang receives little treatment either. It's hard to say if Clubber Lang's personality is actually Mr. T being himself or not. It's also another thing when a character is determined by something, but Lang doesn't seem to have a reason. Lang has hatred so strong that there's got to be more of a motive than just Rocky ignoring his demands for a match. No one holds that much resentment for a reason like that. Lang really just appears to be fuming out of nowhere for very little reason. Burgess Meredith as Mickey, Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed and Tony Burton as Creed's coach were really the only true redeeming character additions. Meredith is able to provide a touching scene with Rocky and seeing Creed and his former coach team up with Rocky is also a plus. This particular element helps humanize Creed and his followers and makes them even more likable as characters.The other remaining components that do work like before were the music and match fights. The way the fights are choreographed still have life in them and keep the sequences moving at a brisk pace as if to emulate how fast the fists are flying. Credit also goes to Bill Butler, who also was director of photography for Rocky II (1979) and Jaws (1975). Also, because this film represents how far Rocky drifted from his original life (living style), numerous shots contain everything from floor to ceiling of glam and riches galore. It's definitely flashy and displays how much wealth Rocky acquired but it's all style over substance (as explained before). The music composed again by Bill Conti did another efficient job. This time when it came to contemporary music of the time, "Eye of the Tiger" is emphasized more than anything else. "Gonna Fly Now" is still in there but "Eye of the Tiger" was given more priority. The Rocky theme is still played throughout as well along with the softer moments that occur. It's still a decent movie but wasn't executed entirely right.Sylvester Stallone had the right idea on how to continue Rocky's story but his screenplay misses the point by including scenes that go nowhere instead of developing all of its characters like the first two films. Mr. T as Clubber Lang was certainly the right choice for an antagonist but he too barely has much depth. The music and fight sequences all still please to a point with Carl Weathers returning but without all of its developed characters, the heart of the story doesn't feel as strong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rocky Movie With The Most To Offer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rocky series is an ongoing Cinderella story. The first one saw him as a poor nobody who got the chance of a lifetime, the second saw him training harder than ever to get the gold, this sees him as a famous athlete who struggles to regain his pride. This is a more unique Cinderella story, making it a great watch.Rocky III has a different feel and tone than the first two. This takes place a few years after Rocky II with him riding high as the most popular boxer in the world. He has a huge house and a shiny life. The light is a better feel than the dark and dreary sense of the first two. Stallone also incorporates more cinematic elements into this. There's a charity fight between Rocky and pro wrestler, Thunder-Lips (played by a lesser-known Hulk Hogan) and it is hilarious. Hogan goes crazy and anarchy erupts. I die laughing at that. The antagonist is Mr. T in his first and best known film role. As Chicago fighter, Clubber Lang, he destroys every opponent in underneath two rounds. Stallone had a hard time finding the right actor to play Clubber Lang, but when he saw T on the show "Games People Play," he was blown away and contacted him right away. T is so good, kick-ass, and over-the-top that you just can't help laughing. Not sure if Stallone intended it on being like that, but I'm glad it was. After Rocky faces ten handpicked opponents and wins, Lang challenges a soft and vain Rocky, much to mentor Mickey's (Meredith) disapproval. Lang destroys Rocky like his other opponents and he is left with no fans. That is until his old nemesis, Apollo Creed steps up and offers to train Rocky for a rematch since Mickey recently passed away. They go back to basics where Rocky must find himself again and regain the edge he lost. Creed is just as funny as Mickey. As you've guessed, Rocky wins his rematch, but in an unrealistic way. He as little blood and bruises than the first, despite taking more punches. Weird! But beating Mr. T is the the most unrealistic but. That's just not possible. But it goes to show what can happen when you persevere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 3rd installment is better and also a lot more exciting than the previous one, here you at least get some brutality, albeit conventional one, instead of family drama; also, Talia Shire looks way better in this flick.A statue is erected in Philadelphia's favorite son's honor. Balboa drinks the cup of the glory.Balboa, now enjoying the benefits of the celebrity and of his fellow citizens' sincere gratitude, is challenged by Clubber Lang, a loner. Clubber, an iron-fisted giant, crushes Balboa in their first encounter.Apollo Creed, insulted by the insensitive and paranoiac Lang, joins forces with Balboa and becomes his trainer, after Mickey's death.Balboa and Lang offer textbook examples of how to behave and how not to; how to train, and how not to. While the overambitious Clubber Lang is a dedicated loner, and a jerk, Balboa's success comes also from a collective effort; the neighborhood joined him in the 2nd movie, his wife and Creed and others help him now. Balboa's victories aren't those of a grudging loner, but those of an open and friendly person.To me, the 3rd flick is the jewel of the franchise. You get three matches (one with the wrestler, a couple with Clubber Lang). Otherwise, it remains a flick for kids, not something very raw or realist, not HOMEBOY material.It remains of course unexplained how Balboa recovered his impaired sight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the third installment in the Rocky Series. This movie takes place sometime after the second movie. Basically the film starts out by giving a recap of the previous movie, so in this case, it's recapping Rocky winning the world championship from Apollo. Now Rocky is a huge celebrity, and wants to retire from boxing, but an up and coming fighter wants to fight Rocky to prove to the world that Rocky is a push over.There are sad parts in this film, mainly when Mick passes away and when Rocky loses the title. The acting is this movie is top notch as always and the script is well written. The only script part that I have a problem with is Rocky's incoherent rant right after Mick dies.Overall this is a good film to watch and if you like the Rocky movies, then this is a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rocky 1 and Rocky 2 together were a nice coherent story. So when I heard of Rocky 3 I seriously did not know what precisely to expect. What would be the story line? What aspect of Rocky's life was to be explored now? Rocky 3 portrays a possible problem a boxer might face after his career reaches the peak. As Micky puts it, the boxer gets "civlized". Rocky has achieved all fame and name and not to mention a lot of money. He has changed his lifestyle completely much to the disapproval and dismay of his wife and trainer cum friend Micky. His training becomes less intense and over-confidence takes over him after a streak of wins. He does remain the kind hearted and humble man that we have seen him as. This change in Rocky's life and perspective is a possible reference to Apollo's life as well. Apollo too was shown to be over-confident and over-relaxed in the first part of Rocky series.In the meantime, we see emerging, another vicious, brutal boxer Clubber Lang. Clubber Lang clearly has one advantage on his side. His training is mean and vicious. And he is rising up...fast! So when Clubber Lang and Rocky are scheduled to meet in the ring we see the difference in the training styles of both boxers. One can clearly feel the tinge that Rocky is going to lose and he does. With Micky suffering a heart stroke, Rocky under-prepared and over-confident gets a beating from Lang and loses in the second round by KO. With Micky dead and Rocky's confidence and pride totally shattered, Apollo now offers to help Rocky train once again for a rematch. Apollo however teaches Rocky to be faster and more agile. Now make a careful comparison between Stallone's fighting method as Rocky in the first two movies. He did not move fast but gave intense punches and almost had a street brawl. This is of course the reason why the decision goes in favor of Apollo in the first part for Apollo had been able to land way more punches and jabs on Rocky. And now see the way he fights in the third installment against Lang. He moves faster, has a very good footwork, excellent dodging capability and has more stamina. I have to appreciate Stallone for having trained hard to show this new ability of Rocky's. The movie does get a little off the track when we see the fight between Hogan (as Thunderlips) and Rocky. The training scenes are very good but still there is something absent that was present in the first two movies. It is difficult to describe what exactly seems to be missing. The movie tries to tell that one should not let success get into their heads. It also shows an emerging friendship based on mutual admiration and respect between Apollo and Rocky.And I believe that a write-up on Rocky 3 is incomplete without Rocky 3's soundtrack "Eye of the Tiger" by Survivor. Was possibly a song with the best lyrics to suit a boxing movie. The soundtrack covers up a lot for the very slightly reduced luster of the Rocky saga.In the end, I'll say it is a well done movie and not bad at all! It is a highly entertaining, warm and an encouraging movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An important but yet sub standard edition to the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rocky III is probably one of the most well known, liked, rooted for, and important entries in the series. Important because it was Rocky's first move into main stream film leaving behind it's more critically acclaimed roots. In a way Rocky III began to start the film's procession in the same direction as Balboa's career. In Rocky III Rocky has become enamored with the life of fame and fortune. He puts aside his training to show himself off to the people, and "trades his passion for glory" as the famous theme song says. Rocky III featured not one but three fights and also featured big time wrestler Hulk Hogan and eighties icon Mr. T. as Rocky's adversaries. Now none of this is to say that Rocky III isn't good, I only mean to say that Rocky III falls from grace as far as the greatness of the original and it's sequel. However the third installment has some great moments that are integral to the series including the death of Rocky's mentor and trainer Mickey, in a very moving scene, and the friendship that grows between Rocky and former adversary Apollo Creed, who now trains Rocky. As a kid I always remembered Rocky III being my favorite but now seeing it years later it just doesn't have the depth and intelligence and intense story as some of the other ones.Sylvester Stallone once again helms the project as director, writer and star. I just felt that in this film Stallone lost his touch with Balboa and the character doesn't have the same feel but perhaps that is the idea? Either way Stallone is still watchable as the ultimate underdog because for the first time we see him as the champion dealing with his celebrity status and raising his son and being a husband and friend. He still manages to touch the heart strings for his powerful scene following Mickey's death. Burgess Meredith returns as Mickey in a very good performance. Mickey is obviously dying but Rocky is almost too busy with his fame to notice. His death is life shattering for Rocky and Meredith is a sad loss to the series but his scenes are powerful. Talia Shire returns as Rocky's wife Adrian. Her performance is toned down significantly in this film which is part of where the charm goes. Rocky has always been a powerful love story and Adrian's toned down part makes a big difference. Burt Young also returns as the incomparable Paulie who still gets that laughs with his rough around the edges performance is still the same old Paulie. He hardly ever changes and for the character and Young that's a good thing. Carl Weathers returns as Apollo Creed but this time as trainer rather than opponent desperate to help Rocky regain his title after Mr. T. destroys him. Weathers is even better as a friend to Rocky because he loses none of Creed's charm and flamboyance becoming trainer. Mr. T. is well...he's Mr. T....I mean the guy doesn't change much and his performance as Clubber Lang certainly did become a film classic. His steely look and brute force and build makes him a worthy opponent but even still I never thought he had the same talent as Balboa despite beating him once. Hulk Hogan makes a humorous appearance as "Thunderlips" a pro-wrestler who agrees to take on Rocky for charity and gives a funny, and rather overblown performance.No matter what I say about Rocky III you must see it. It's an absolute eighties classic and it's an essential part of the Rocky series which everyone must see hands down. It has it's pluses and a few minuses being a little commercially forced but it also had some very important moments to the entire series. It just didn't quite have the heart as some of the other installments but for one of a series of 6 that is allowed and it still meets my approval. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Civilized Rocky Meets Mr. T</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people didn't care very much for this movie, but personally I rather liked it. It isn't without its weaknesses, but I thought overall that it was better than Rocky II, and certainly worth watching, if one likes the "Rocky" series.Sylvester Stallone plays a much more civilized Rocky Balboa in this picture. Rocky has been champion for three years and has had ten title defences - unfortunately, as we discover from Manager Mickey (again played well by Burgess Meredith), against "hand-picked opponents." "Good fighters," Mickey insists, but fighters he knew Rocky could beat. "My job was to keep you winning, and to keep you healthy," he explained to Rocky by way of justification. But a new, hard, lean and mean fighter ("Clubber Lang," played perfectly by Mr.T) has appeared as the top contender, and Mickey wants nothing to do with him. Rocky has become soft, and not up to the challenge. He lives in a big mansion, fights wrestlers ("Thunderlips," played by Hulk Hogan, in what I thought was a very amusing performance) for charity, and even speaks in a more cultured voice. But Rocky accepts the challenge from Clubber, and the movie goes from there.Clubber Lang is a very different opponent for Rocky than Apollo Creed ever was. I just couldn't dislike Creed. I rooted for Rocky, of course, in those fights, but Creed was not unlikable. He was a showman, and even when a nastier side of him appeared in "Rocky II," it was understandable. I felt sympathy for him. But Clubber is just thoroughly mean and unlikable. An opponent like Clubber was probably necessary to make this movie worthwhile. Carl Weathers was decent as Apollo Creed, who now accepts the responsibility for getting Rocky ready for Clubber. Aside from that, though, the performances were a bit lacking. Not because of bad acting, but because the movie was very short (just over an hour and a half) and a lot of it was taken up with training shots. Talia Shire was for me an exception to this, though. I thought her performance as Adrian was very good, especially a powerful scene on the beach when she convinces Rocky that he has to do this just for himself, and not for anyone else.There were weaknesses here. The dialogue (never particularly a strong suit in the "Rocky" franchise) left much to be desired, and a piece of atrocious over-acting by Sylvester Stallone at Mickey's death scene left me laughing rather than crying, but I liked this movie. And, as always, the fight scenes were magnificent.7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rocky 3 is not a bad movie,as far as the series goes.it has lots of action,some good training sequences and some dramatic moments.however it lacks something that the first 2 have.and that is heart.it just doesn't have the depth of that they have.this is not a tangible thing,but more a feeling.if you watch Rocky 3,you will understand.the antagonist,(villain)Clubber Lang,Rocky's rival,is fairly strong as portrayed by Mr.T.though i get the sense this movie was made just to keep the franchise going.I say this because if you watch the next installment,Rocky 4,you will notice there is more intent to the whole movie.The antagonist is much more developed and there is more at stake.there are actually 2 antagonists and you will understand if you watch the movie.anyway, back to 3.the filmmakers could have done without this installment and went right to 4.as for Rocky 3-- 7 stars/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Rocky film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rocky III is the franchises' best offering. Mr. T steals the show as heavyweight contender Clubber Lang who batters Sly early on in the film to win the world title. Cue a rematch in which Sly is out for revenge, and naturally annihilates his opponent after suffering implausible amounts of pain! The fighting is of course highly unbelievable but that's fine in Rocky III because it adds to its comic value. The movie does have a couple of stale moments, but overall its well worth seeing, if only for the look on Sly's face when his coach dies! Sly isn't very convincing in his portrayal of a man in anguish... Eye of the Tiger is a top theme tune, but the training scenes between Apollo and Sly needn't have been so camp.... On the whole however, Rocky III is not bad at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This third outing in the "Rocky" series is a lot faster than the first two, but the action is always fun to watch and never over done. Sylvester Stallone returns again as writer, director and actor with all our familiar favourites including Talia Shire, Carl Weathers, Burgess Meredith and Burt Young.Rocky fights Clubber Lang (played by "Mr. T" of "The A-Team" fame) and gets brutally beaten, but he fights back hard, in true Rocky style. He's still a lot of fun to root for. Good entertainment from the early eighties that makes good use of a music soundtrack including "Eye of the Tiger" by Survivor. You ain't so bad!Thursday, February 14, 1991 - Video</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot; After the death of his manager and the loss of his title, boxer Rocky Balboa finds an unlikely ally in his quest to regain the belt in&nbsp;former foe Apollo Creed.Over the years, it's been easy to laugh off the ever growing and increasingly implausible&nbsp;Rocky series. But then Stallone makes Rocky Balboa, not exactly a classic, but a return to basics filled with genuine pathos that brings the character and his saga satisfyingly full circle. This is followed a full decade later by Creed, an almost beat for beat remake of the original Rocky that sees Stallone play the mentor and give what may be the finest performance of his career. It's a fascinating franchise that acts both as a mirror of the times in which they were made and of the soul of its star. Stallone is, for all intents and purposes, Rocky Balboa. The original film essentially ports Stallone's own&nbsp;Hollywood struggles into the ring. The sequel shows how Rocky, and by extension Stallone, dealt with the swift and meteoric rise to fame. This third film too mirrors Stallone's life, as Rocky struggles with maintaining his edge after achieving his dreams. It also is a reflection of its era, replacing the gritty look and tone of its 70s-based predecessors with a slicker, faster approach befitting the dawn of the 80s.As a sequel, Rocky III works reasonably well, taking the next logical step in a story that very well might have been better served stopping after one film. If the basic framework is the same (challenge, train, fight, win), the character motivations are different enough for it to be interesting. Stallone realizes the story, while serviceable, is somewhat thin, and therefore trims about a half hour from the runtime compared to its predecessors. If there's no meat on its bones, there's also precious little fat. Stallone's Rocky feels very different than the one we meet in the original. He's smarter, more sophisticated. A product of his success? Maybe, but it's a jarring evolution until you get used to it. Adrian is now more or less Rocky's lucky rabbit's foot, reduced to cheerleader, which is a shame, but also an organic part of the series' evolution. The real stars here are Carl Weathers as Apollo, now stepping in as Rocky's trainer, and Mr. T as the villain, Clubber Lang. Weathers feels very much like the Apollo we know, but we get to scratch a bit beneath the surface. He's a charming, energetic breath of fresh air when he arrives in the film's second half. Unlike Apollo in the first two films, Clubber Lang is a true villain cut from a very one dimensional mold. Despite this, Mr. T manages to make for a compelling and daunting baddie and lifts the entire film.Rocky III isn't a particularly good film, but thanks in no small part to the good will we feel for the titular character because of the previous two films, it does hold together just enough dramatically to allow its slicker, 80s-tinged elements, to deliver a moderate crowd pleaser.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rocky III: An American Tradition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the recap of the fight from the previous movie, Rocky III opens with a montage which begins with fireworks and giant light up sign of Rocky, as if to say "Welcome to the 80's!": a decade when everything was larger than life. The song of choice is Eye of Tiger, the montage is edited like an MTV music video and Rocky even appears on The Muppet Show; and all that merchandise, me want!Rocky III is ridiculously entertaining while still managing to have thematic substance. Rocky is no longer struggling with fame. A man who couldn't film a simple commercial in Rocky II is now making all sorts of endorsements. He could barely drive a car in Rocky II, now he can now drive with ease. Rocky has also become a more intelligent man instead of the dumb dumb he was in first two movies. Not to mention does he looks different, very handsome I might add and in such physical shape. I think Stallone looks like Al Pacino here, especially when wearing a suit. Rocky III brought the series in a different direction, distant from the first two movies. But despite Rocky's wealth and fame, Rocky III is not a movie which cheapens out. The primary theme of the movie is about Rocky's fame making him soft, or as Mickey puts it, "You got civilised". Once Rocky discovers Mickey has been hand picking fighters his seemingly perfect bubble of a life is burst; "You wake up after a few years, thinking you're a winner, but you're not, you're really a loser". This continues the series theme of being semi autobiographical of Stallone's own life as the movie examines what fame and fortune can do to a person. Adrian's role is smaller is time round, although her character still see an evolution as the famous lifestyle has taken away her shyness and made her more outspoken, and pretty hot too I might add. Just listen to the words of motivation she gives Rocky on the beach, a far cry from the Adrian in the first movie.Even when Rocky discovers Mickey has been hand picking fighters, before his fist fight with Clubber Lang, Rocky is training in the most superficial gym. It's full of photographers and visitors, musicians are playing and merchandise is being sold. Unsurprisingly, he gets the worst beating of his life at the hands of Clubber Lang. The solution to Rocky getting his so called "eye of the tiger" back; get away from the superficiality of his wealthy lifestyle and back to the nitty gritty. As Apollo Creed puts it, "Man, when we fought, you had that eye of the tiger man, the edge! And the only way to get it back is to go back to the beginning; you know what I'm saying?". I stick by these words as some of the wisest words I've heard uttered in a motion picture. Whenever you lose your mindset of determination weather physically or mentality, go back to where you first started in order to reclaim it. Rocky III humanises Apollo Creed, with Rocky and Apollo becoming friends being a great spin on the story. I always think of his intense shouting of "There is no tomorrow!" whenever I need some motivation.The hypnotic, uneasy music which plays when Rocky is training poorly under Apollo and stuck with the threat of living with failure reminds me of Bernard Herman's score to Vertigo in possibly the most uneasy scenes in the series. Likewise the scene of Paulie in the arcade has to be the most surreal scene in the entire series in which he throws a bottle pinball machine in slow motion complete with odd sound effects; it's an image which doesn't leave your head.Mr. T as Clubber Lang, oh man! What a beast! A true larger than life villain with outbursts of immensely entertaining lightening fast dialogue; he sure has a way with words with such a violent temper and high levels of anger. You do not want to be stuck in an elevator with this guy. Which raises the question; is Clubber responsible for the death of Mickey by pushing him to the side? Yet even close to Mickey can still inspire in scenery chewing words of motivation, with his death being one of the series most emotional moments. The boxer vs. wrestler charity fight on the other hand between Rocky and Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan) has nothing to do with the rest of the movie, but dam is it entertaining. It's so over the top with such intense pain on display; the referee and police officers are thrown to the side, the audience is assaulted and even Paulie gets in on the action (I do love those bits of humour Paulie provides).The final fight in Rocky III is the only in ring fight in the series which takes place in real time until Creed. Meanwhile the final scene of the movie is such fun, with Rocky and Apollo playing off each other, which along with the training montage gives off some homoerotic vibes along the way with sweaty, shirtless muscular men, tank tops and men hugging and jumping by the sea.Also the film's trailer refers to Rocky III as an "American tradition". What's the tradition? Hollywood sequels?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh man, what a movie I mean what a movie. Rocky III takes everything you saw in the first two movies and takes It to a completely new level. There's new points to the franchise introduced, like the brilliantly original Clubber Lang becoming the newest foe for Balboa to take down, former enemy Apollo Creed becomes Rocky's new trainer/mentor when the poor old Mickey dies due to his old age. The plot is also so much more powerful to watch and experience as it all unfolds in front of the viewer's eyes. The montages are quite cheesy and brilliant, the action is so much more awesome ... however. The one and only gripe that I have with this movie is that, this is the first movie in which we start to see Balboa turn into that Hollywood hog that he is in Rocky V. Sigh, Rocky V. But regardless, Rocky III is awesome and probably my second favorite of the franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rocky III is a sleek shiny plastic cover. but that's a Good thing. it serves to prove a point. And that point is from the time Rocky became the Champion. his life turned from being about the streets. And being about one of the people to being a celebrity . Rocky hasn't sold out. He was swept up by all the fame and all the changes fame makes, More money bigger house more people knowing who you are. It feeds the Ego. And Rocky has quietly slipped into this trap, But Rocky is still fighting. Defending the Championship against ten fighters. Rocky has become a icon. the public loves him. Then a shadow looms over the happiness like a thunder cloud at a family picnic. Clubber Lang. Clubber Lang is a hungry fighter. A top ranked contender he demands a shot at the title. But in the meantime he destroys his way to the top. undefeated. and angry he confronts Rocky at a Civic unveiling of a statue honoring Rocky. angry Rocky accepts and Gives Clubber his shot. but Mickey mysteriously walks away. Leaving Rocky hurt and angry. Once they are home he confronts Mickey who tells him the truth. the beating that Apollo gave him should have killed him. Anymore fights of that type would have. So Mickey working behind the scenes found good strong fighters. fighters that would give Rocky a good fight but not devastate him like clubber. Rocky is crushed. Those ten title defenses he believes are fake set ups just to keep the Title Longer. Rocky begs Mickey to train him .Mickey agrees. Rocky trains poorly. clubber Trains Hard and on the day of the fight two things happen that'll impact Rocky forever. The first is during a brawl between both fighters on route to the ring. Mickey suffers a heart attack and dies. And Apollo Creed while being a guest of honor is treated like trash by Clubber. Clubber destroys Rocky, And the Championship becomes Clubber Lang's. Rocky is not only crushed but depressed and angry. Apollo offers him a solution. Let him train Rocky. Beat Lang regain the Title. To do that Rocky must go back to Apollo's roots and to Apollo's trainer Duke. while Apollo and Duke train the body. Adrian trains the mind and spirit. Rocky scared and angry Soon becomes once again Rocky the Warrior and during the rematch not only beats Clubber but destroys him. Rocky has come back. He has now learned the lessons he needed. Never forget where you come from never forget what drives you and never forget the people that love you and support you.Rocky III some say is easily the best Rocky. And Every Rocky does have a point . the first Rocky had him as a club fighter a man no one paid attention to. and a man destined to be forgotten. until he was given a chance.A shot at the big time Rocky had a dream and it was simply to be standing at the end. dreams are worth fighting for. Rocky II was about not forgetting about what's the most important things in life are. while pursuing your dreams. Rocky III it's point is simple. Never forget who you are and never lose yourself in superficial things be honest to yourself at least.Stallone once said that Rocky III was about how fame changed him. and how people had changed around him it was as Stallone said very surreal. Like Alice falling down the Rabbit hole into Wonderland .And he captures that perfectly here. Creating a classic Rocky film that can easily take its place among the best. Someone Says Rocky and chances are you'll think of either the first Rocky but more likely you'll think of Rocky III and for good reason. It's unforgettable. and its a great time at the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ROCKY 3 is just pure fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After successfully defending his heavyweight championship some ten times against an array of various opponents, Rocky is living the ultimate dream, he's respected by everyone, is stinking rich, has appeared in posters &amp; various commercials advertising products, he has a loving wife &amp; an adorable little boy &amp; now has a statue of him being unveiled right in the heart of his hometown! So why not retire now while he is still on top, at 34 years of age, he might be to young to retire at such a young age, but Rocky is set for life. However on the day he is set to announce his retirement from boxing &amp; hang up the gloves for good, he is confronted by the vicious &amp; very powerful, the snarling Clubber Lang (MR. T.) during the press conference at the unveiling of his statue, who insults Rocky, by not only calling him a coward, but hurling slurs at Rocky's manager Mickey &amp; verbally insults his wife. Angry, Rocky agrees to one last fight by defending his title against Lang, however before either man reaches the ring, Rocky's already ill trainer Micky is assaulted by Lang &amp; later dies in the back of heart attack. In the ring, Rocky squares off against Clubber. The good news? Rocky is a really good fighter. The bad news? Clubber is still way better than Rocky ever dreamt of being! as a result, Rocky is beaten down in an embarrassing showdown, without causing Clubber to break a sweat. Rocky quickly learns that he has grown soft with success. Approached by his former foe Apollo Creed who has agreed to take over as his trainer, Rocky prepares for his rematch with Lang, however despite the training, Rocky realizes he no longer has the heart to face Lang, worse he's afraid of him, can Rocky over come his fear of Lang, regain his heart back for boxing &amp; win back his championship? or is this the end of the Italian Stallion?In truth, while the first two ROCKY movies are considered (certainly where critics are concerned) to be the best films in the series, I must admit that ROCKY III is the one I reach for when I want to be really entertained, while the first two films run two hours each, ROCKY III is able to tell it's story in a faster, crisper 99 minutes, while true this does rob the film from going deeper into the life of Rocky (especially during the training montages which last about fifteen minutes) &amp; lacks the emotional impact the first two stories had, ROCKY III is far more action packed than the first two put together, both of which featured only one boxing match at the climax between Creed &amp; Rocky. The fight scenes are are absolutely tremendous, with real high powered fights to get even the most strongest of wills on the edge of their seats. MR.T's Clubber Lang is without a doubt one of the toughest, most fiercest opponents Rocky has ever faced in the ring &amp; is one of the best villains in film history. The acting is strong, SYLVESTER STALLONE hasn't missed a beat as Rocky, while BURGESS MEREDITH, TALIA SHIRE, BURT YOUNG &amp; CARL WEATHERS all return in their respective roles &amp; do quiet well. I also really liked the friendship developing between Rocky &amp; former opponent Apollo Creed, I found it quiet touching as is Mickey's final goodbye to his pal Rocky before dying. MR. T. is perfection as Clubber, in fact I honestly believe if another actor had been chosen for the role, that as great as ROCKY III is, it would be nowhere near as good (if it would have worked at all) if they had cast someone else in the role. Stallone besides returning in his role as Rocky, also once again steps in behind the directors chair &amp; pens the screenplay &amp; he succeeds in once again making this franchise worthy of it's recognition.An absolute must see for fans of the series, don't miss this one! Followed by ROCKY IV.**** stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It doesn't have the depth and heart that the first one did. But it's still a alright sequel in the franchise, not great but it's a alright watch. So Rocky is back, the boxer with the heart of gold is back again. He may not be the brightest boxer, but he has heart and he has the eye of the tiger. So it's basically a movie with a boxer with a heart of gold, but lacks much emotional depth and heart compared to the first one. But than again it's really difficult to top the first "Rocky" film. The film is about Rocky's passion in the boxing game, his relationship with Rocky's coach Mickey (who is sort of a plot device in this). And his relationship with Apollo Creed, who becomes his new coach. That teaches Rocky to become a more confident, hungry, flexible and rhythmic fighter. To go against one of the most iconic Rocky opponent in the franchise Clubber Lang. Clubber Lang is such a stereotypical opposing boxer who seems to be a utter jerk just for the sake of being a jerk. It also has a returning character that probably no one wanted, Paulie. If Rocky Balboa is a man of heart and integrity, Paulie is the opposite. Overall this is a good fast-paced installment in the "Rocky" franchise that is worth a watch. It does seem sort of commercial at times, with Hulk Hogan making a cameo appearance.7.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Rocky Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After defeating "Apollo Creed" (Carl Weathers) in another epic bout, "Rocky Balboa" (Sylvester Stallone) now turns his attention to defending his world heavyweight title by defeating 10 different challengers over the course of 3 years. However, there is one challenger his manager "Micky Goldmill" (Burgess Meredith) has not scheduled and his name is "Clubber Lang" (Mr. T) who has advanced through the rankings and has now become the #1 challenger. Yet even though Rocky wants to postpone his retirement and fight Clubber Lang, Mickey still wants nothing to do with it because he has seen just how powerful Clubber Lang is and doesn't think fighting him is in Rocky's best interest. But Rocky persists and Mickey reluctantly agrees. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that--even though it may not be the best in the series--it is my favorite of the bunch. Admittedly, it's not as deep as "Rocky" or even possibly "Rocky II". But it has more action and excitement. Likewise, despite the fact that Mr. T was nominated for a "Razzie Award" for his performance, I thought he performed rather well given his particular role. Additionally, I thought Carl Weathers did a fine job as well. In any case, while it may not have been up to the same standard as "Rocky", I thought it was still quite enjoyable and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid film with a new challenge for the character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In many ways, Rocky III gets back to what made the first film so great, whilst also straying further away from the classic formula. I'll just make an aside here to say that I don't understand why we need to replay the last scene of the preceding movie to open this movie. If I'm watching the third film of a franchise, I think its safe to say that I know how the previous ones went.The opening montages for Rocky III show us a lot about what Rocky has become and teaches us so much about the stratospheric rise of James "Clubber" Lang. Rocky poses for commercials while Clubber thrashes himself in his rigorous training schedule. Even the film's first fight is a flashy showcase for charity, featuring great entertainment value in watching Hulk Hogan and Sylvester Stallone face off. Whilst its cheap fun for us, what it says about Rocky makes it worthwhile as well. In the lead up to Clubber's battle with Rocky, Burgess Meredith's revulsion is the focal point for the audience who are also disgusted by how showy Rocky has become. The Rocky franchise has always excelled in contrasting the two boxers and their training, and seeing Clubber's simple but determined workout contrasted with Rocky's light punches in between photo ops speaks volumes about what is to come.Clubber Lang, played adequately by Mr. T, poses the exact challenge that Rocky as a character needed. When Clubber rages against Rocky's refusal to give him the shot that Rocky himself was given, it makes Clubber a deeper character than if he'd just been a brute with a haircut. Clubber wants to be the best, and its that which we remember even amongst his showy, bullying persona. He becomes a far less interesting character once he wins the title from Rocky as we see nothing about who he is or where he comes from like we did with the opponents in Rocky and Creed, but enough has been done that we're pumped for his defeat. The most memorable moment in Rocky 3 is the death of Micky, and this was a bold, confident and absolutely essential moment for the character of Rocky to proceed. Losing his title and his manager in one miserable evening, Rocky is broken down and can begin to rebuild, setting the stage for a movie without it feeling like a lazy rehash. The decision to place Paulie in Rocky's corner while the fight is going in was a brilliant move by Stallone, as Paulie is completely incapable of talking Rocky down and keeping him focused. The death scene, with a grieving Rocky howling over Micky's body is powerful.Apollo stepping in to train Rocky was a plot point I was very pleased to see and it had great potential at the start and paid off nicely, but the piece about Rocky's heart not being in it didn't feel right. It felt like it existed only to give Talia Shire something to do, because Adrian sits firmly in the background this time, a place she'll be for the rest of the franchise. Her concerns about Rocky's health completely evaporated - a fault of Rocky 2's inexplicable ending, rather than this film - her role mostly consists of reaction shots and tragically too- few sweet moments with Stallone. The speech she gives Rocky about getting his head in the game has some power to it, but it feels forced.Rocky 3's iconic Eye of the Tiger is a delight to listen to but I feel that it could have been better used throughout the Clubber fight rather than at the opening. The recurring point about Rocky's hunger was one that was touched on nicely throughout the film, and playing it when he finally gets it back (even at the expense of the gorgeous Bill Conti score) would have felt more appropritae.Overall, Rocky III is a solid film. It's got its flaws, but it's a new challenge for Rocky and a new direction for his character.</fullReview>

After the success of R-2, he redid his body, his look, and his self confidence. He wrote and directed R-3. And he launched a career where in the opinion of your humble reviewer he stands next to Clint Eastwood as the two biggest producers (not stars -- producers!!) to have emerged from that era after Hollywood did everything but dig them both an early grave. As I write this in 2015 Sly is not only still doing Rocky (OMG!) but has the Expendables franchise (gets better and better) and other irons in the fire. In fact I think he even owns the fire.* the film is rock-solid, sorry for the pun. Also launched MR T into orbit for his very convincing portrayal of Clubber Lang * enjoy it or re-enjoy it.

		<fullReview>As artificial as film boxing can be, it peaked here. Yes, the IV fight with Dolph Lundgren (Ivan Drago ) is as incredible as these RIII fights. No, the strength of the Rocky sequels is not the boxing, it's in the struggle with personal life, and the before-and-after fight scenes, that Stallone lifts up his Rocky Balboa with some good acting sometimes. But he obviously thought that the audience wanted an always coming back-machine, who securely would punch out an 8 feet alien monster if he just gets "mad enough", in Paulie's words.No, I think the balance in this movie is brought by Carl Weathers, who's Apollo Creed gets nice to his former antagonist, and wants the newcomer Clubber Lang (well played by Laurence Tureaud/Mr. T) to smell the floor, and therefore puts his skills into slugger Rocky, and gets a rough piece of rock into a sharp diamond, but of course not without some motivation trouble on the way....Well, back in -82 this was surely a smash hit at the cinemas, but the Rocky series was sadly turned into too much way-out fiction. The fights of the two first movies are nice, the one in Rocky II has some very good choreography and directing, and the same last man standing sense that of the first. But after a bad episode V in 1990, Stallone waited 16 years and gave us some little more realism in the Rocky Balboa of 2006. Thank you for that, Sly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rocky III is Good But Its Essence is Missing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though this is a boxing movie, what made its two predecessors stand out were the well constructed characters and a story that harmonized the fights with the dramatic moments. Rocky III leaves much to be desired in this aspect, even if some quite meaningful and emotional events happen. A story has some subplots but they are either wrapped-up quickly or poorly explored. The fights are very exciting, the technical aspects, such as shooting or choreography, are good, but they didn't put me on the edge of my seat. Adrian played by Talia Shire doesn't have such a strong presence as in the previous movies, her few scenes with Rocky, Sylvester Stallone, are enjoyable, specially one that she sees the need to make Rocky understand himself and recognize what he's feeling.Clubber Lang performed by Mr. Tis not a great and mesmerizing antagonist, he transmits so much hatred that in the end it becomes excessive, it seems that he drank a whole bottle of coffee with a red bull pack, because I had the impression that he would explode anytime. Burt Young is Paulie, this character isn't emphatically developed, but his scenes bring a little of comic relief due to his sarcastic humor and complicated personality. Rocky and Mickey, Burgess Meredith, behind all their arguments, there's relation of love and care, like a father and son. An interesting and positive situation was the course taken in the relation between Rocky and Apollo Creed played by Carl Weathers. The soundtrack is almost the same but has some good and remarkable inclusions. It's amazing that even though in the third film, the training scene follows the same molds from the previous but still is incredibly awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rise and fall from grace - undoubtedly tied best classic movie with IV!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take a third sports action drama, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Rocky III (1982) is definitely tied best Rocky film with IV. The first one will always be the best. I think the third entry of the franchise is a big improvement over Rocky II in my opinion. He's on top of the world now, bags a statue, and for some reason, Adrian became attractive in this one. Like, REALLY attractive. He got soft, he got arrogant, and he got lazy. He lost his trainer, his title, and most of all, his self-respect to one of the most that makes me angry villains ever to grace the silver screen: Mr. T's Oscar-robbed performance as Clubber Lang and had to regain the 'eye of the tiger' to get it all back in front of the world. This one also proves further that Apollo Creed is human. Guy went from an arrogant prick and sore loser to Rocky's finest ally. Kudos, Carl. I love Mr. T he become famous after this movie there is also Hulk Hogan in it. Adrian in this movie is very supportive and I love Apollo how he was helping Rocky. Rocky III has a heart beside Rocky I.Why I love this film? This is the only Rocky film in which Adrian is well written - to further support my stance that III fires on all cylinders. Really, what purpose does Adrian serve in II, IV and V? She spends most of those movies telling Rocky not to fight - she is not supportive and just a burden to him. In this one, she actually encourages him and is an asset (speach on the beach.) Heck, there wouldn't be much of Rocky II if not for her objections to. It is the best all around Rocky movie. On a literary level (story), entertainment level, filmmaking level, boxing choreography, characters, etc... The fight at the end actually means something for Rocky. He has something to gain from it (unlike V.) This and Rocky I are the ONLY two Rocky movies where Adrian actually encourages Rocky the whole time (unlike II, IV, and V.) Mr. T is perfectly cast. It was so successful because it was the best. Rocky lost everything his manager, his title, his self respect and mostly he lost his edge! Like Apollo said "Now, when we fought, you had that eye of the tiger, man; the edge! And now you gotta get it back, and the way to get it back is to go back to the beginning." That's what I love. When you lose something don't quit. You need gained back the thing you lost. I love how Apollo motivated Rocky in this film and I think Apollo is well written and portrayed in here. I seriously I think Carl Weathers did a wonderful job portraying arrogant Apollo to an awesome Rocky's friend, to a support and ally. I was surprised Apollo was back in the third entry of the Series franchise. I love the training sequences and the music Score by Bill Conti the same score he used in Rocky I, and II. The same year that Sylvester Stallone made Rocky III the same year he went and started in First Blood, his famous role to this days Rambo! Carl Weathers also said that Rocky III is his favorite film he made. Not only that it is the only Rocky sequel film who won another Oscar award, which is the only one. Beside Carl Weathers I think Mr. T was the best actor portraying a villain in this movie I love how he provoked Rocky I really love that. This is the only film the lasted three rounds. The film has two fight with Clubber Lang (Mr. T) and more fights in which Rocky and Clubber are attending too in the opening scene. Rocky fights a wrestler Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan) in this film. I also love the music score Eye of the Tiger performed by Survivor! I love this film it is my second best favorite rocky film alongside with Rocky I. The rating I am giving is 9.5/10, I would have give it 10, I didn't because Mickey dies in this film and that was the most shocking disturbing scene to me. Three years and 10 successful title defenses after beating Apollo Creed, with whom he has become great friends, a now wealthy Rocky Balboa is considering retirement. Fame and complacency soon cause Balboa to lose his title to Clubber Lang, who inadvertently causes the death of Rocky's trainer Mickey. Rocky sinks into a depression, and Apollo decides to train Rocky for a rematch against Lang so Rocky can try to win the title back. That is the basic main plot. Rocky III is a 1982 American film written, directed by, and starring Sylvester Stallone. It is the third installment in the Rocky film series, and the second in the franchise to be directed by Stallone.9.5/10 Grade: A Studio: United Artists, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) Starring: Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, Burgess Meredith, Mr.T Director: Sylvester Stallone Producers: Robert Chartoff, Irwin Winkler Screenplay: Sylvester Stallone Rated: PG Running Time: 1 Hr. 39 Mins.

		<shortDescription>A good addition to the rocky franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the first two fantastic Rocky films it was decided that there would be a third film and is a good third film. The premise of the film sees rocky in the high life after winning the title until he is faced with a new young hungry challenger. Sylvester Stallone is back as rocky in this film and wrote and directed this film. He is great in this film, it shows a different side of rocky in this film and he does a great job. The supporting cast is also great, adrians character is good because of how her relationship with rocky develops and it works in this film. Carl weathers is back as apollo creed and this is the best portrayal of the character yet as his relationship with rocky being much better in this film and humanizing. Micky is back and even though he isn't in the film a huge deal he does a great job. This film introduced Mr t as clubber lang and he was a really good villain in this film. The story of the film is decent and the redemption story really works in this film. However, this is a shorter film and it doesn't hit the emotional level that you want it too. The script is alright with some good humour but SD I said the drama sometimes doesn't hit as strongly as you want it too. The style is alright with some decent boxing scenes but it doesn't hit the levels of the previous films. Overall this is a good third film that if your a fan of boxing movies you should see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third instalment in the Rocky series, the story of Rocky III is set 4 years after the events of the previous chapter and follows Rocky Balboa who, after many successful title defences &amp; his ever increasing fame, is strongly considering retirement but falls into depression after losing the title to a rookie boxer and turns to a former enemy to get himself back in the ring.Written &amp; directed by Sylvester Stallone, Rocky III is a mediocre sequel that takes the series into a different direction and features a more campy tone that soon becomes very annoying. The screenplay isn't good at all for the plot wastes time on sequences that don't even play any relevant role in the final outcome, not much is added to reprising characters while the new ones are instantly forgettable.There isn't much to talk about its technical aspects for none of the elements have anything new to offer and while its reduced runtime is a welcome change, the final fight this film was building itself to ends up sooner than expected and on that scale, it's disappointing. As far as performances go, everyone fails to make their mark while Mr. T leaves no stone unturned to make his character one of the lamest ever to step into the ring.On an overall scale, Rocky III might be fun for those who had a good time with Rocky II but it marks a departure from what the first film was all about. There are a couple of interesting moments in the picture but most of it is forgettable. Stallone's input both in front &amp; behind the camera continues its downfall, the dialogues are pretty much garbage, the finale fails to live up to its hype, and although Bill Conti's score feels repetitive, it's the only element that fares as per expectations. I pity the fool who green-lighted it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After winning the ultimate title and being the world champion, Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) falls into a hole and finds himself picked up by a former enemy (Carl Weathers).The first film was serious, the second one was more humorous and light-hearted. This one has a few emotional bumps (someone important dies), a bit of a humanization for Apollo Creed (sudden;y a good guy), and some over-the-top absurd humor (Thunder Lips). It is a good mix.Although few would agree, I believe the second film is superior to the first. The third is beneath both of them, but not by much. It is a welcome addition to the series, which they likely never thought would last nearly as long as it does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even more of the same - formulaic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rocky is one of the most overrated movies of all time. Implausible plot, often dull and with some of the worst performances you'll see in a movie: from the over-the-top acting of Burgess Meredith to the monosyllabic, IQ-reducing grunts of Sylvester Stallone. Only Talia Shire was convincing.Only thing that made it watchable was the occasional humour, the introductory scenes and the final fight scene.Rocky II was more of the same. Human drama for 90% of the film, followed by an intense fight scene. This time, however, the human drama side is more realistic and engaging and the movie flows better for it. Still not great, as it all feels kind of predictable, but it is less dull than the first movie.Rocky III pretty much just follows the same formula. Change the guy Rocky has to fight, rinse and repeat. Only difference here is that we have two fights - one in mid-movie, one at the end.I like the idea of a serialized account of Rocky's life, but this doesn't really add anything original to the series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most franchises are showing signs of flagging by the 3rd film but the Rocky series defies this as Rocky 3 is another absorbing film. Rocky has made it to world champion and is enjoying the fruits of success. That is until Clubber Lang comes onto the scene ( an impressively aggressive Mr T ). This entry features more fights and a charity boxing v WWE match between Rocky and Hulk Hogan. It's an explosive mix and this film doesn't slow down for a minute. Not that it's all action as it does feature one of the saddest scenes in all the Rocky films. The final bout is suitably hard hitting and I loved the very final scene. For fans of the originals this is another treat and again this is another entry that holds up well today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's rock! It's time, once again to enter the square circle, and see what happen to Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), the underdog as he faced his greatest foe, yet in Clubber Lang (Mr. T). My predictions. Pain. Directed and written by Sylvester Stallone, the movie starts off from the events of 1979's Rocky II, as Rocky Balboa reigns as a World Heavyweight Champion prizefighter. He's on the verge of retiring undefeated when he's taunted by a contender, Clubber Lang. When, Rocky learn that his longtime trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) has been lining up easy opponents all along, because Mickey believe the wealthy &amp; comfortable lifestyle has made Rocky gone soft. Rocky must once again, find the eye of the tiger to defeat a man like Lang. If the first two movies were based off the Muhammad Ali and Chuck Wepner, then this film fight remind me of what would happen if Rocky Marciano step on the ring with a Mike Tyson type of a fighter. Since, Tyson was still an unknown boxer at the time. I believe Clubber Lang was based on a combo of Sonny Liston, George Foreman, and Larry Holmes. He's a one-dimensional bully with no back story or redeeming features. It made him a great antagonist. Still, I was really hoping for more from the character than being menacing. I glad, this film made Mr. T into a celebrity, but it hard to take him, seriously as a threat to Rocky when rewatching this film, due to the star going on to be a kids' action hero on TV's The A-Team and even his own Saturday-morning TV cartoon, after this. Mr. T became more and more of a joke as the 1980s went on. It's clear that the character of Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) was influenced by outspoken boxer Muhammad Ali. You really do see it in Carl Weathers performance here who takes a more supporting role here by helping Rocky trained against Lang. Creed is humanized so well in this film. Supporting returning characters such as Adrian (Talia Shire) &amp; Paulie (Burt Young) also make the film, worthwhile. Adrian is just as beautiful as she was in the first film. Is Paulie, a bit racist in the film? Yes, but it's pretty tame. I like to think, Paulie somewhere in the film, learn to respect black people, but I doubt it, but he's not the main focus on the film. His presence in the film is pretty minor. Sylvester Stallone is once again, great as the main role, Rocky Balboa. Even as view as the top man in his sport, he still the underdog when it comes to challenges. This movie shows what it is like to have everything rather than to start out with nothing like the previous movies. It show, how fame can lost a person, and for you to gather yourself up, you have to start from scratch. The movie has a lot of heart. Without spoiling it, you feel for Rocky, for the person, he lose in the film. You want to see him, bounce back from that lost. You really want him to go the distance even if Rocky is super rich, now. In my opinion, Rocky Balboa is the greatest character, Sylvester Stallone ever played. It doesn't matter, if he's rich, poor, or old, his 'go for it' motto for life is a great role model and Stallone acting shows that. This movie also have some of the best training montage to pump up. This will inspire anybody for anything. You really get what Rocky is going through. The music is once again, uplifting as hell. Not only do you got, the original Rocky theme song, 'Gonna Fly Now' by Bill Conti with lyrics by Carol Connors and Ayn Robbins. The Rocky series got 'Eye of the Tiger' by the band, Survivor. The film nearly got the song "You're the Best" performed by Joe Esposito. That song was later used for 1984's film, 'the Karate Kid'. It's seem like a nearly perfect film, but this film however, depending on who looks at it, might dislike it for the more cartoony action than realistic drama, approach. Rocky and Clubber Lang take a pounding in their fight scenes, but it look less like boxing and more like pro-wrestling. Rocky getting tossed around by a cameo from a wrestler, Hulk Hogan was interesting. Indeed, this movie helped bring pro wrestling into the mainstream, 3 years later when the film co-stars, Mr. T &amp; Hulk Hogan would team up to fight Roddy Piper &amp; Paul Orndorff at Wrestlemania in 1985. That event was a success, and help bring new light to this film. Because of that wrestling event, Rocky IV was greenlight &amp; release later that year. Would this movie have been a box-office hit if Rocky's opponents were better-drawn character instead of just a trash-talking cartoon like bullies? It's hard to tell. Its cheese factor is one of its biggest draws for me. Is the movie, a bit dated? Yes, the awful 1980s fashion trends are throughout the film, but it's a product of the times. Is the writing is sub per? No, I think Stallone deserve more credit for making Rocky into a likable boxer. He could be a little more, clever in some parts. Does the movie glorifies a brutal violent blood-sport? Yes, but for a movie about boxing, it's pretty tame. Not a lot of blood in this film. The camera work in the film are pretty damn good. The movie was beautiful shot, and the movie ends with one of the most iconic way, a film should end: with a Leroy Neiman painting. Overall: It was indeed a change of direction for the Rocky series, but without a doubt, it's one of the better films of the series. Plus, it gave us the Rocky statue in Philly. So- It has to be must-watch. It's an excellent story of a true underdog getting back on top.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Rocky II' I liked not because Rocky got a chance to win but because it spent most of it's time featuring Rocky trying to go back to his normal life but being goaded back into the ring. Rockys IV and V were execrable which leaves me with Rocky III (do you think I've said Rocky enough?). 'Rocky III' isn't an entirely necessary movie but it is an entertaining one. It's a comic book fable, a hapless movie that gives the viewer what they want.The movie finds Rock at the height of his career with a big house, an infant son and a statue in Philadelphia (it's still there in real life). This is fine but it doesn't make for great drama. Bringing this challenge to Rocky is a muscle-clad loudmouth who accuses him of years of ducking a worthy opponent ? himself of course. Mickey agrees, admitting that most of Rocky's opponents have been handpicked.Not thinking much of it Rock takes the challenge and proceeds on a half-assed attempt at training for the fight (the gym where he use to train is now more an amusement park). Not only does he lose the fight but also his self-respect and Mickey to a heart attack. Stallone's mournful howls in that scene reminded me of a wounded buffalo that I once saw on National Geographic.What follows is a long stretch in which we get Rocky's depression, a visit from Apollo Creed now on Rock's side, a rematch, a trip to L.A., a training montage and two more speeches about bravery and self respect than is necessary. Then the fight in which we don't have to guess who comes out victorious.All of this is in the service of a story that, as I said, doesn't give this series a boost but is entertaining junk food. Stallone tells a good story once again even if Rocky doesn't have all the quirks we remember. As for it's entry in the series, it being the middle film of a decending series it sits somewhere in the middle and so does my rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rocco goes down hard...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suffering from what's come to be known as "boxing dementia," our hero Rocco (like filmmaker Stallone himself) coasts along, milking his name for all it's worth. Everything's fine until a menacing challenger appears on the horizon- "Mr. T," as Clubber Lang (an Ernie Shavers type of puncher; hence, the moniker "Clubber"). Clubber threatens the franchise, ridiculing Rocco's mixed martial arts bout with the infamous Thunderlips ("Hulk" Hogan). When he runs out of places to hide, Rocco gives in and takes his medicine. You can't take that many shots to the head and walk away unaffected; it's fantasy to think so. Just look at what happened to fighters like Jerry Quarry. (Many of the greatest fights ever fought can be found on YouTube, but almost NONE of them can be found on DVD. Maybe Stallone could help some of the real life fighters who fought the fights by starting a line of high-quality dvds showcasing them and donating some of the proceeds to their retirements.) I just recently revisited this one (hence, the updated comments) and I realized that it's not as bad as I'd originally remembered it being- it's WORSE. This is a comic book made for the Big Screen- and not in a good sense: it's chock full of the kind of know-nothing s--- one finds in television shows (ESPECIALLY those that purport to be "boxing" stories). Originally, I thought that Stallone had asked Carl Weathers (as Apollo Creed) to teach him to "fight like a black man" in the movie. I was mistaken. Wherever I heard that statement, it wasn't in ROCKY III- but it STILL stands as one of the dumbest things I've ever heard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is enjoying great success as the defending world champion. His manager Mickey Goldmill (Burgess Meredith) has been picking fighters for him until he is challenged by the arrogant Clubber Lang (Mr. T) at the unveiling of his statue. Lang is exactly the one that Mickey has been avoiding. Rocky not only loses the fight but also Mickey and only Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) can help him recover from the loses.First Rocky fights Hulk Hogan and then he fights Mr. T. It doesn't get more cheesetastic 80s than that. The story has all the iconic Rocky formula. He is put into an underdog position and he has an insurmountable hurdle to overcome. And Rocky has to have an opponent above all. Mr. T serves that purpose. The movie's big move has to be killing off Mickey and bringing back Apollo as now a good guy. It's a brilliant move. This is a mix of good 80s cheese and a broadly written sports movie.</fullReview>

But looming in the distance is Clubber Lang, a young and hungry boxer intent on becoming the new champ.Pretty safe enjoyment for anyone into the fantastical world of Sly Stallone's Rocky Balboa franchise. Into the narrative this time comes a new boxer, portrayed with relish by Mr. T, a revelation that cuts Rocky to the quick, and personal grief when his mentor and friend Mickey (Burgess Meredith) dies (Stallone doing brilliant believable grief). Back comes Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed, only this time he wants to train Rocky to beat the mighty Clubber Lang. Rocky's heart isn't in it though! Can he get that Eye of the Tiger back? Well of course he can and thus we get the obligatory training montages and a ferocious fight to crown the story.It's comfortable film making with comfortable acting performances and it's often very exciting as well. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stallone keeps things chugging along in this sequel, a film building on what was good about its prior entries whilst allowing for fresh avenues.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Something rather amusing happens around about the midway point in 1982's Rocky III, a moment wherein it snaps out of a proverbial daze and realises it is, in fact, betraying its 1976 original's core politic. Ah yes, the original: that film about the underdog being able to pull through and achieve precisely what it is they want even though all seems lost and one is on a road to nowhere. The moment I'm referring to in Rocky III is, of course, when it realises it needs its eponymous and ever-present lead, Rocky Balboa, to go back to not being the the favourite for a huge fight with a hulking African American individual of supreme ability ? thus, it plunges them back down the pecking order and into a situation wherein they must strive and train to get (back) to the top. It is a curious thing to see a sports movie as generic as this one begin with its protagonist at the top of his game and seemingly indomitable, but credit to director Sylvester Stallone and the team for worming their way around some tight rapids and down into a stream of engaging formulae that does not grate.When it begins, it begins with Balboa on the top of the world as the champ. Balboa has trumped all, often flooring them in the process, in a flurry of mean boxing ring set punch-'em-ups inducing a rise in ranking about as meteoric as how opposing boxers have tumbled. Rocky has his name and face up in lights: it is on the television and all over merchandise stretching to that of pinball machines. He is a superstar: he is Rocky Balboa, and yet at once he is Sylvestor Stallone ? both men have been catapulted to stardom after 1976's initial outing and both are living this high life of close knit bonds; idolisation and fame. When we observe what appears to be Balboa guesting on The Muppets Show, and having a gentle box with a punching bag, it is in actual fact footage of Stallone on an actual television broadcast made possible through his acting and writing of the original film, while the use of fleeting moments from the aforementioned film winning plaudits at the Academy Awards is symptomatic of these blurred lines between audience's own awareness of Stallone's own off screen exploits and Balboa's fictitious achievements.Two of these matches have been, no less, that of fellow boxing champion Apollo Creed, whose own story in the second film was as interesting as Rocky's was in the first film and whose ego in the first synced up with how fantastic Rocky thought he was in the second. The portrayals sort of even themselves out, I guess, and in III, they're actually on pretty good terms with room for something more in the form of a mentoring relationship. A man has an eye on Balboa during these moments of fame and he is Clubber Lang (Mr. T), a man who stares on discouragingly from the sides at Rocky being lauded come the end of another victory as all others in the auditorium cheer. Lang makes for a meaner, cruder and more imbalanced substitute for Creed; a tough talking African American who has a habit of winning and sees himself as invincible. For the most part, Lang is the underdog but he is unpleasant and spits these tirades of self congratulatory euphemisms on top of derogatory remarks aimed at our lead ? at least when Rocky came to hear or speak of Creed in 1976's first film, it was a little more along the lines of common courtesy and respect. Indeed, when Lang sees fit to go so far as to systematically insult the man's wife and masculinity, the film has placed us firmly within the camp of this time gunning for the incumbent champ over the sprightly newcomer, something which goes against the franchise-to-this-point's politic and something which is actually muscled into being inverted following an initial bout.As was with Rocky II, one feels you'd have to be in a fairly bad mood to come away not having enjoyed it. No doubt there are arguments that it is overly derivative, while there cannot be much denying that it is a tad simplistic at times. A charity match with a wrestler, two sports-persons top of their respective contact sporting worlds, eats up time and is a bit of a boorish sequence designed to induce cheap conflicting thrills, although it does point out how vulnerable Rocky is when up against a monster of a man whose desire and drive to triumph appears unnatural given the circumstances. And yes, there is that seemingly obligatory framework to do with Balboa and his personal life clashing with his professional one - his actual walking away from the field in the form of retirement an event which is lost and forgotten by the time everything else has been said and done such is the scope for brutish spectacle and emotional wringers, but it all pulls together.There is room for one of the more predominant characters to be killed off, in what is an affecting scene, whereas the subplot of two rivals from instalments gone by working together is a refreshing touch. There is a raw energy to the film, it keeps itself afloat by going over similar paths up upping antes: Lang is the level up as an opponent from Creed; Rocky has more to loose now in the form of a young son able to be conscientious of the risks his father takes; Balboa seeks training from a man who has been to the same heights he has and most come to learn that the only way from the top is back down again, in spite for prior perceptions of one's ability and status. As Stallone very gradually cranks up the affinity we have towards these characters, one cannot help but look forward to the following entries.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rocky 3 is a film stuck in a time capsule. It is very much an 80's film. Look there's Mr. T! Hulk Hogan! Eye of the Tiger! It is a continuation of the story of Rocky's life as he lives the life of a champion with endorsements, riches, glory...but the hunger of his youth all but gone. This is a story about Rocky rediscovering his passion for boxing and it is reasonably entertaining. One thing is clear...this movie is nowhere near the level of the original film, but it holds a certain nostalgia for those of a certain age who grew up with the character. Written and directed by Stallone himself Rocky 3 could have been a decent end to a nice little trilogy. It's entertaining, and the acting is not bad with Burgess Meredith as Mickey coming off the best. Mr. T became a big star after his performance as antagonist Clubber Lang. The best thing you can say about this movie is it wasn't an embarrassment unlike some later entries in the series. I'm looking at you Rocky 4 and 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Pretty Good Sequel!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sylvester Stallone directs &amp; stars in this 1982 drama sequel co-starring Talia Shire, Carl Weathers, Burt Young, Mr. T and Burgess Meredith. In this entry, Rocky Balboa (Stallone) has become heavyweight champ after the last film and gone commercial. After dealing with Paulie (Young) being drunk and jealous, Rocky agrees to fight aggressive boxer, Clubber Lang (Mr. T), though Mickey (Meredith) doesn't want him to. Mickey changes his mind and helps Rocky train, but Rocky doesn't focus. After Rocky loses and Mickey dies, former champ, Apollo Creed (Weathers) agrees to help Rocky get his edge back. Rocky soon overcomes his fear and is ready to rematch Clubber. Shire also returns as Rocky's wife, Adrian and legendary wrestler, Hulk Hogan also appears as fighter, Thunderlips. This is a pretty good sequel, Mr. T is great in it because I hate his character and who can forget Survivor's "Eye of the Tiger" song. I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably one of the best sequels ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the summer of 1982 I recall the attack of the sequels for any or all franchises. This was one of the reasons that may have been tough promoting another "Rocky" movie-but alas another mega hit was made. I always respected the original Oscar winner for being original and a very personal story I felt to it's star. But for the life of me I never felt it's power until it's final shot. There was already a long awaited rematch that everyone was always curious about if you asked the average "Rocky" fan and they delivered in "Rocky II." So to come back and try to convince fans that "The Italian Stallion" had some more magic would be hard trick. The opening scenes start where the 2nd film ended him triumphant in his re-match with Apollo. From there we're given a montage of his success in boxing since he beat Apollo. We're also simultaneously introduced to his new adversary played by that's right Mr.T. Why does all of this work? As much as glossy TV ad take over of Hollywood into movies there's been cool things and they're have been unforgivable things. This movie implements those things into the story using visual and music perfectly. If you don't start singing along to that cheesy classic Survivor theme song then this movie is not for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>probably the second best Rocky after the first one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rocky 3 has a lot going for it in terms of characters - we have Mr T, Hulk Hogan, Rocky and Apollo Creed all in one story and at times it feels like a superhero movie, in a good way The moral of the story is actually a very good one and is relevant to many people's lives at some stage.. we lose our way and need to find it again, perhaps with help and come back stronger than before Rocky has to dig deep and go back to his roots, and back to the sweat and tears to rediscover the 'Eye of the Tiger' in order to match his opponent Clubber Lang in grit and hunger. To do this he returns to the streets and learns some new skills from ex-champ and mentor Apollo Creed Somehow, cut down muscle tops, short shorts, and long socks, sometimes headbands, are acceptable in the ghetto and this culminates in some very shady scenes with Rocky and Apollo jumping and hugging each other on the beach in slow motion Also Stallone takes a hammer and chisel to Burgess Meredith's (Mick's) greatest acting moment on his death bed with some really stupid vocals which only Stallone knows how to makeBut otherwise this is a rock solid movie and very entertaining For those interested it has some unexpectedly good sound design features. Some really varied game-like slo-mo heavy hits from Clubber and Thunderlips. Also the death rattle as Mick expires his last breath is very nicely done Overall, recommended</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most difficult fight is against our inner demons ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Rocky III", we're so far from the atmosphere of the previous films that the result could have been disastrous if it wasn't (again) for the characters and their genuine appeal. They're all here, Rocky, Adrian, Paulie, Mickey and Apollo, the fantastic five embarked for the last time together for one of the most defining film of the flamboyant 80's, the third opus of the "Rocky" series.On the surface, Stallone really took the distance from the first two films, featuring a Rocky Balboa at the pinnacle of his boxing career, the undefeated Heavy Weight Champion of the World. The Italian Stallion's success even mirrors Sly's iconic status in the 80's: the movie begins with a clever montage featuring Sly himself after the first "Rocky" launched his career, it's a whole different mood, forget the austere Philadelphian streets and say hello to the 80's with its lot of action, glitter and cringe-worthy over-the-top moments (gay ballade on the beach, the infamous boxing/wrestling gala fight etc.) and of course, the hit-song that plays as a fitting subtitle: "Eye of the Tiger". Say anything about Stallone and his "Rocky" series, but no one can deny that the guy named Sly knew how to create an impact.The first booming notes of "Eye the Tiger" resonate as a hymn for passion, hunger for fight, and thirst for victory, the 70's are over when the world needed an underdog hero going the distance, no place for the small players, it's all about winning and fighting and defeating, while Stallone created another cinematic icon that defined the 80's through John Rambo. "Rocky III" had to stand out for some values that are less appealing now, and this is why the first opus is still the one that stood the test of time. Still, the catchy Oscar-nominated 'Tiger' song injects some pep in our veins and makes "Rocky III" the solid conclusion of a great trilogy. And that's why we notice the flaws of "Rocky IV" more than in "Rocky III", it didn't have "The Eye of the Tiger", much more than a song, a concept as powerful and defining as Dirty Harry's 'Make my day' quote in the Reagan era.Now, should I really enumerate the flaws of "Rocky III"? As for "Part II", does it really matter? I guess yes since a review asks for a minimum of objectivity, I have to mention that again, the movie sins by a predictable script whose structure parallels the second film's plot, who would have bet on Rocky after watching the first training montage? Anyway, it went like this, first act : Rocky is good, second act : he's down, third act: he's back, with all the cheers and applauds ? and despite all the obviousness, it works. The "Rocky" sequels illustrate the idea that the greatness of a film can rely on its 'wowing' conclusion. On that basis, "Rocky III" is a winner, not a Heavy Weight champion like "Rocky" but still, a film that works, and unlike "Rocky II", it doesn't work less thanks to Rocky Balboa, than to all the other supporting characters around him. For once, Rocky is central to the plot but not to the appreciation of the film. You can tell that Mr. T, Burgess Meredith, Carl Weathers and even Talia Shire steal the show.The most memorable aspect of the film is the antagonism and how a good replacement Clubber Lang is to Apollo Creed. Mr. T is like a mean-spirited but more determined version of Apollo, and despite what he said, I'm sure he just didn't pity but probably hated the fool he thought Balboa was. There's an interesting contrast set between Lang and Rocky. Lang is closer to Rocky's roots while Rocky became too smart, well-dressed and self-confident, it might discomfort some viewers in his first scene with Paulie but I guess it helps to build the new personality of Rocky, something that will be echoed in a poignant discussion with Mickey, who informs Rocky that he got civilized, in other words, he doesn't have the muscle anymore to fight killers like Lang. Psychoanalytically speaking, Clubber is what Rocky lacks. Logically, Rocky loses his match against Clubber and when it couldn't have been any worse, he loses even more.The movie takes an emotional way, which is what the "Rocky" series have done best and after the tear-jerking farewell to Mickey, the grumpiest and most lovable sports coach, Rocky face a serious existential crisis. This is where Apollo makes his entrance, and closes the story's arc of his relationship with Rocky. As I said in my review of the first film, "Rocky" has always been about relationships and interactions, this is what makes the movies work, despite their flaws. And in the third opus, it's an extraordinary idea to allow the defeated Apollo to take a share from Rocky's victory, reminding us that Apollo's last defeat was a very close call and the Rock still have something to learn, to take his pride back. But it ain't easy fighting his own demons and this is when the shy good wife Adrian let Rocky open his heart, admit his own fears and set his mind up to challenge Clubber Lang again. The eye of the tiger is a burning flame that got ignited in the heart.So it's easy to criticize "Rocky III" and mock the evolution of the characters, but the movie is still a good cinematic achievement, more entertaining and heart-warming than your average sports films, it works because the first two films built a gallery of unforgettable characters, we learned to know, to appreciate and to love, as if unconsciously, we never wanted the series to end ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Successful Comeback Of Rocky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third Rocky film now this time goes back to becoming the ultimate sports picture of the movie franchise.After it touched on the theme as the greatest underdog movie in the first and the love story between Rocky and Adrian in the second,Rocky III touches the most about Rocky becoming a sports figure - his rise,fall and successful comeback as boxer.Rocky III is the third installment in the Rocky film series.It is written and directed by Sylvester Stallone.He again stars as title character,Rocky Balboa together with Carl Weathers as former boxing rival Apollo Creed, Burgess Meredith as Rocky's trainer Mickey, and Talia Shire as Rocky's wife, Adrian.It also stars Mr.T, who plays Rocky's opponent is James "Clubber" Lang,a younger and more aggressive boxer.The movie starts with the Italian Stallion so famous that his likeness is everywhere, including pinball machines. Fame and complacency soon cause Balboa to lose his title to young thug Clubber Lang,who inadvertently causes the death of Rocky's beloved trainer,Mickey before their first championship bout. After sinking into a depression,Balboa must regain the love and support of his family, as well as the elusive "eye of the tiger," the hungry need to beat the opponent which former foe Apollo Creed teaches him to regain his hunger and fighting spirit in the ring.In the end, Balboa faces off against Lang for a second time. Just as I have said,Rocky III is the ultimate sports picture of the Rocky movie franchise as it centers on his being an athlete.It definitely inspires viewers especially the young people to rise from defeat and downfalls as evidenced by Balboa in this picture.Aside from refreshing themes untouched in the first two,the movie also introduces a new single "Eye of the Tiger," the theme song Stallone commissioned from the band Survivor.It became a huge hit single and has also been attached to boxing matches for so many years now just like the original Rocky theme,"Gonna Fly Now".Aside from the themes and hit single,the performances of the cast were commendable as well.Overall,the movie provides great entertainment but it falls short from being a masterpiece like the the first movie.Personally,I consider Rocky III the fourth-best in the franchise behind Rocky,Rocky Balboa and Rocky II in that order.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To start of with a very balanced opinion: I'm deeply in love with this entry. Not only do we get TWO boxing matches between Rocky and Mr.T, he even engages in some boxing/wrestling cross-over against Hulk Hogan at some point. Pretty much everything that was cool in the 80s and then just vanished is incorporated here. It's like the storyboard to this movie was entirely made up from kid's drawings, that's how crowd-pleasing it is. The action is a lot better than in the second, but this third one also stands out when it comes to the characters. You care a lot more about them this time, which makes the sentimental scenes so much more touching. Did I mention this is also the debut of the whole "eye of the tiger"-thing? It totally is, and it was still really, really awesome back then. One of the best in the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing compared to the first two, but still entertaining showing Rocky hasn't run out of steam yet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rocky III starts of tremendously with a marvellous montage of where Rocky II left with his rematch fight with Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) as Rocky (Stallone) has become the heavyweight champion of the world. The montage shows Rocky with his career growing over five years as we see him defending his title ten times undefeated. Cut to his new life. He and his wife Adrian and along with there son have moved to an even bigger house with Rocky suddenly maturing (wearing suits). He is enjoying the high-life. He decides to retire but new boxer climbing through the ranks Clubber Lang (Mr.T) challenges Rocky to defend his title, he agrees after Clubber taunts him, but he loses his title as his coach Mickey dies of a heart attack (Buregess Meredith). Rocky feels he has a lost apart of himself but with help from an unexpected friend Creed trains Rocky to reclaim his title from Lang.This is an entertaining third movie in the series and is about twenty minutes shorter. The tone of the third has changed from the first two. Rocky III now just concentrates on more the boxing and as a result Talia Shire as Adrian (whilst her acting is still good and she looks better than ever) her role is severely reduced where she now just appears in most scenes without talking. Though on the beach she gives her husband a passionate speech. Also Rocky Junior dosen't get much screen time, so you don't feel a bond between the family and as a result you lose the most of the touching and heartwarming moments that were apparent in the first two and that is where I felt Rocky III went wrong. Also the story isn't much different and it's started to feel slightly repetitive with the script feeling old-school now.However Stallone delivers a great performance again and so does Burgess Meredith in his unfortunately last appearance as Micky with a heartbreaking moment when he passes away. Mr. T as Clubber Lang makes a fearsome challenge with a delightful evil performance by him. One thing I did like was that Carl Weathers as Creed (who plays his part well) has a bigger role in this one. You see him and Rocky start to bond as they become friends and that was nice to see. The end fight was well done and entertaining but it wasn't as exciting or inspirational as the first two. However Rocky III is an impressive instalment for a third movie and hopefully the fourth in the series can do just as well or better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Underrated Rocky Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rocky saga is undoubtedly my favorite movie franchise. Having watched the complete saga maybe four times now, I certainly know the appeal of each movie individually and their strong points. Now in a series of (mostly) great cinema, it's hard to play favorites. But it is my honest opinion that ROCKY III is the best of the Rocky saga.Compared to the first two films, our favorite southpaw emerges in this movie a new man. In fact, almost everything about this movie seems matured compared to the previous ones. Rocky himself is famous and successful, his features have hardened, and he looks more like a grown man. He and Adrian now reside comfortably in their opulent mansion with their son, and we see that Rocky has really made it this time. It seems no one can take the belt from him. Even the picture and soundtrack has become more fine-tuned than in the previous ones.The most striking of these changes is the underlying depth to ROCKY III. To be vague, a black force cuts into the happiness Rocky obtained and a heavy turn of events turns his world upside down. It is in this installment that we see Rockys inner demons full force as he confronts his feelings of fear and inadequacy, making this the darkest Rocky flick by far. Some characters never change (good ol' Paulie...) but others develop into stronger and more stimulating characters. Adrian, no longer a bystander, is the only one who can understand Rockys' strife and in helping him analyze his feelings, she becomes his partner instead of his sidekick during a very well-written scene that I feel is Adrians best moment (and a great scene altogether). Apollo is back this time as well, but not to antagonize Rock but rather to help him train; a complete 360 for Carl Weathers' part. He's apparently come to peace with some things and isn't the same egocentric prima donna he was before.Like in the first one, Rocky has to prove it to himself again. Only this time, the stakes are much higher; not only is his success or self-worth on the line, but the very composure of our most lovable character is worn down as he tumbles into the abyss of his own mental inhibitions. This time ROCKY encourages us to peer into our heads as well as our hearts. Just as we experience self doubt as we get older, Rocky does himself; WHY am I happy? What do I have that's actually MINE? Am I competent? Am I man enough? Undoubtedly the deepest of the series, ROCKY III exploits all of the strongest traits of the saga and uses them to coin interesting changes. The acting, screenplay, and direction are all top-notch, and besides seeing man-thighs flopping around a couple times I have not one complaint about this movie. Guaranteed the only Rocky movie to make your hair stand on edge, this is the quintessential installment if you ask me.</fullReview>

Guess who he is... It's Apollo Creed. He gets rocky to know the eye of the tiger and he learns a new style of boxing. He doesn't do left hooks anymore... He uses his right hand now.

		<shortDescription>My favorite one in the series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favorite Rocky movie of the whole series mainly because of the fast paced fights, the action and Mr. t. This movie takes place three years after the second movie after Rocky has beaten the world heavyweight champion Apollo creed. life couldn't be better for Rocky balboa(Sylvester stallone). He now has a mansion with his wife Adrian balboa(Talia shire), He's got everything, cars, money, he's doing commercials and he's beaten 10 opponents since he became champion.He still hangs out with his best friend Paulie (Burt young) and Rocky even does charity bouts like fighting against the world wrestling champion Thunderlips (Hulk hogan). But Rocky is unaware that a new fighter by the name of Clubber lang (mr. t), has been watching Rocky in his fights and scouting him and Clubber lang is pulverizing his opponents to get to the top. Only Mickey (Burgess meredith) recognizes Clubber's strength and tries to keep Rocky away from him. Mickey is only giving him fights with people who are steup to lose.At a statue unveiling Rocky decides to retire but Clubber lang comes out of the shadows and challenges him to a fight and Rocky thinks he is just another fighter but Mickey tells him the truth and he thinks Rocky wouldn't stand a chance against him. But rocky convinces mickey to train him but Rocky starts training like a showman,(having the press watch him train, renting out a fancy gym where people sing while he trains).Just before the fight is about to begin Rocky and Clubber almost go at it backstage but then Mickey starts having heart problems. Mickey tells rocky to just go and he does and Clubber lang whips him pretty good and knocks rocky out in the second round. Just after that Mickey dies and Rocky goes into a deep depression and almost hangs up his gloves, that is until an old foe of his Apollo creed(Carl weathers) comes to his aid and decides to train Rocky for a rematch agains the ferocious Clubber lang. But rocky is feeling guilty about micks death and he blames himself and only Adrian can bring rocky to stop blaming himself and and realize that micks death was not his fault and that mickey was only protecting him when he put him against the setup fighters. Now rocky starts training like his old self and Apollo teaches hima new way of fighting where rocky can stick and move and block. Now it's the rematch against clubber lang and Rocky will prove that even if he loses he will have lost with no excuses and no fear as Adrian said to him earlier.I love this movie of the series and I think it had a good message that if you lose something and you learn from it, you never really lost it to begin with. And it takes a hell of a man to recapture something you once loved. All of the actors are tremendous in this movie. Sylvester stallone proved once again that he can act and Talie shire was wonderful as usual. Burt young was great as the loving jealous brother in law. I think it was cool and exciting to see Carl weathers' character Apollo creed to swallow his pride and become rocky's friend and trainer. And of course Mr.t was great as the ferocious, mean and nasty clubber lang and he gave a new meaning to the word tough. I think this role should have won him a supporting actor nominee.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can't fault the Rocky films for being so similar to each other. They had a tried and true successful formula with a likable protagonist in a setting where the underdog had to overcome long odds to come out a winner. It's no different here, and Stallone manages to get it all done in under two hours. The fresh aspect offered in this film involve the Hulk Hogan appearance as a pro wrestling heel, and the presence of Mr.T in the flick that would propel him to 'Pity the Fool' stardom. I would have liked to see Burgess Meredith carry on as Mickey, but death in movies isn't always what it seems. You've got "Rocky V" to attest to that.So this is the Rocky film in which Stallone is really ripped due to a personal training regimen, and perhaps owing somewhat to that 'Eye of the Tiger' theme song that we hear repeatedly. It's overly done in my estimation, but it worked for this entry in the series. I know that by this time a lot of folks were panning the series and Stallone personally, but there must be something to it as the Rocky films are a ubiquitous presence today on a variety of cable channels. My favorite would still be the original "Rocky", but in sequels, the franchise has enough to offer for viewers if taken one at a time, each with it's own message of hope and inspiration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depite a Premise Wearing Thin, "Rocky III" is a Champion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I pity the fool that can't enjoy this movie. I sincerely do.The third sequel in the ever-popular "Rocky" franchise, aptly titled "Rocky III," finds Sylvester Stallone yet again stepping up to the plate as the notorious Italian Stallion as well as behind the scenes as both writer and director. As with "Rocky II," the gang's all here with all the major players from the previous film in tow as well as a couple of memorable newcomers in Mr. T and Hulk Hogan.Opening with a montage set to Survivor's "Eye of the Tiger" (written specifically for use in the film) all of the necessary exposition one would need with this film is provided quickly enough so that the film can get underway with its quickly-paced, action packed and drama fueled plot. Following the events of the previous film, Rocky Balboa is riding high on success, raising his son and living the good life in the lush mansion he shares with his wife, Adrian. On the day he is rewarded with a statue erected in his honor and announces his retirement, he is challenged by a vicious newcomer, Clubber Lang (Mr. T), who quickly gives our hero a run for his money which in turn has him training with an unlikely new ally: Apollo Creed.No doubt, the film is lacking some of the substance of the previous films, but three films into a franchise, it's only natural. Thankfully, "Rocky III" is entertaining enough that it doesn't wear out its welcome. From the colorful characters portrayed by both Mr. T and Hulk Hogan (who would each go on to become icons of the 80's in their own right) to the continuing saga of our main character and his newfound camaraderie with his previous enemy, there's enough juice in the film's tank to keep it running until the end. Fans of the original and even its sequel will notice a significant step-down in quality, yet, it's still a film that's hard not to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rocky + Mr. T = Typical Rocky Sequel, good and bad. Enjoy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rocky III may be the Rocky Sequel that time forgot, but it's not that far off from other Rocky sequels in terms of quality and emotion. Rocky movies usually have a moral overtone, and this one is no different. Rocky get's complacent and loses his championship as a result. He also has to deal with loss in the characteristic Rocky formula when Micky dies. In the end, as usual, he trains hard and comes back to overcome his opponent. Throw in a few appearances by Hulk Hogan and Mr. T and you have yourself an 80s movie. It's hard to know how to feel about this movie. Then again it's hard to know how to feel about Rocky in general. On the one hand, the fight scenes are totally unrealistic. But Stallone pulls you in with his emotional and pityful character. The acting is never bad. But the writing is meant to be more soap opera than serious drama. If you were to see this movie on it's own, it's pretty cheesy. But in the context of Rocky films in general, it's actually not that bad. Mr. T actually gives one of the best performances of this movie. He is very believable as the bitter and cruel Clubber Lang (try to ignore the ridiculous names of characters like these). Tony Burton doesn't get as much face time as "Duke" in this picture, but in my humble opinion he is the best actor out of the entire cast. As for Burgess Meredith, Carl Weathers, Burt Young, and Talia Shire, they all give their consistent decent performances. Stallone really makes you feel for him, truly mastering the "gentle giant" character. It is heart wrenching watching him get his face beat in, even if the fighting is totally unrealistic. Overall, this is a typical Rocky movie. Nothing compares to the raw emotion of the original Rocky, but if you like the series and you have a few hours to kill, this is an entertaining movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost loses "The Eye of the Tiger" half-way through</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rocky Balboa" (Sylvester Stallone, who also wrote and directed the movie), the Professional Boxing World Heavyweight Champion, is living the life he sought. He lives in a huge house with his family, has been on the cover of various magazines and has numerous endorsement deals. However, unknown to him, he has gotten soft inside the ring to the point where his manager, "Mickey" (Burgess Meredith) booked him in bouts with inferior fighters. Even getting in the ring with the cocky professional wrestling star, "Thunderlips" (Hulk Hogan in his acting debut).He lost his edge, and "Mickey" knew it. However, the champ wouldn't believe it. He even went against "Mickey's" orders, and accepted the challenge of "Clubber Lang" (Mr. T in one of his most famous roles), a tough, bad attitude boxer who rapidly reached the Number One Contendership by himself with no trainer helping him out."Mickey" warned "Balboa" not to accept "Lang's challenge, but the mohawked fighter verbally went after the champ's wife (Talia Shire) at a public appearance. He immediately accepted the challenge. However, "Mickey" was proved right, and "Balboa" lost the title to "Lang." And, to make things worse, "Mickey" suffers a heart attack backstage during a confrontation between "Balboa" and "Lang", and dies in the dressing room as "Lang" easily defeats the champion for the title.Now, "Balboa" has to regain what he once had. And he gets help from an old rival (Carl Weathers). A rival who once saw the "Eye of the Tiger" when he fought "The Italian Stallion" himself for the title.This is one slow moving movie, especially about half-way through the film. I saw myself looking at websites around that time more than watching the film on On Demand. It does pick up leading up to the rematch between the two boxing rivals around the time "Apollo Creed" shows up.The acting is near perfect all around. You knew almost immediately when "Balboa" admits that he lost his edge, by Stallone's performance in the scene, that the death of "Mickey" affected him deeply. Certain cast members were performing characters who were more important in the previous two movies. I felt that they were there because they somewhat advanced the storyline, or were just there because they have been part of the series since the first movie in the franchise.I liked the chemistry between Stallone and Weathers in this film. In previous films, they were rivals, and now they are on the same side. They acted like two professionals in one of the toughest sports on the planet, one now acting more like a teacher more than a rival who was still annoyed at once losing the title to his now-student. Weathers really shined in this role, making the audience forget how arrogant he was six years before in the first movie.Another breakout performance was that of Mr. T. Surprisingly, as "Balboa" is getting back his edge, "Lang" is almost forgotten. The film focuses more on "Balboa" training for the rematch more than "Lang" living the life of the defending champion. You almost completely forget he was in the movie until he comes back into the story for the rematch. Personally, I would have liked to have seen some references to "Lang" as "Balboa" is in training. This was the role that gave Mr. T his tough guy image. He was the bad guy you wanted to see destroyed.This film is predictable. You know who will win at the end. Personally, I would have liked to have seen some plot twists that would have made the end a little less predictable.Another problem with this film is the soundtrack. I can only remember two songs in the film -- the "Rocky Theme" piece that is so recognizable now you know immediately where it came from, and "Eye of the Tiger" by the one-hit-wonder (this song) Survivor.Another problem with this film is, at times, it is hard to understand Stallone's speaking. At times, I had to rely on what others in the scene were saying in response to understand what was going on.Unless you already own the other movies, I say get this film on VHS/DVD to complete the series. I also think that this would be a pretty good third choice to rent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shift In The Series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rocky 3 started a shift in the Rocky series. Instead of dealing with Rocky as an underdog trying to work his way up and establish himself, Rocky 3 has Rocky on top of the world.Rocky starts defending his title and knocks off ten different challengers. A new young vicious boxer, Clubber Lang, challenges Rocky. Mickey tells Rocky not to fight him because of the fact that Lang is a "wrecking machine" and that all of the people Rocky had beaten previously were nothing like him. Rocky fights him anyways, however tragedy hits prior to the fight and Rocky loses to Lang badly. Apollo Creed then decides to help Rocky train and regain the look he had when he had fought him.Rocky 3 is different in tone than the previous Rocky Films. Rocky himself acts much differently. As Mickey says Rocky becomes "civilized" and is not acting the role of the underdog who had to work hard to get what he wants. He is a millionaire heavyweight champion of the world, not a guy living in the slums of Philly who gets a chance to go against the heavyweight champion of the world. Rocky seems to be much more civilized and willing to converse in this film than he was in the other two. I can honestly say that I liked the Rocky from Rocky 1 and 2 better but it is interesting to see this change in character.Rocky 3 is an action packed film. Rocky gets in an exciting fight with Hulk Hogan at the beginning of the film for charity. Also Rocky fights against Clubber Lang TWICE in the ring. Rocky 3 has by far the most action of any of the Rocky Films.A few complaints. Number one I do not like the way that they killed off Mickey. I am not disappointed with the fact that Mickey dies, sometimes good characters die. I just do not like the way that he died. He gets pushed down by Lang and suffers heart failure. They could have killed him off in a different way that worked better.Another thing I did not get is how Rocky has the media circus surround him when he is training for his first fight against Lang. It is a complete circus and so unlike Rocky. Maybe this scene just was included to show how Rocky had changed and show how he is losing his edge but I still think it was out of place.Now for things I did like. I like the shift in character for Apollo Creed and how he helped Rocky to train. This is a perfect example of a bad guy becoming a good guy for the better, there are other times where this does not work. When Apollo decided to help Rocky out it completely surprised me and made me like Apollo better.This song has different music as well. Survivor's "Eye of the Tiger" is the main song of the film and really goes well with the theme of the film, Rocky getting back "The Eye of the Tiger". Overall this is one of the best songs in a movie ever, it just goes good with the film. When Rocky trains with Creed at the end they do play "Gonna Fly Now" but once again it is not the same version as used in the first Rocky film.So this is the most action packed of the Rocky Series, has a great shift in character for Apollo, and has a great theme song. It is not without its flaws but it is a lot of fun so it is worth seeing for that reason alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rocky III</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sly is back for a third round as Rocky Balboa "The Italian Stallion", but this time he is taking on his toughest enemy, Clubber Lang (Mr. T).Rocky has been World Heavyweight Champion ever since his successful rematch against Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), but a new fighter Clubber Lang wants a fight with Rocky. After taking out several challengers, Rocky goes one on one with Clubber, after a hard fought battle, Rocky is defeated. Rocky decides to retire, but Adrian (Talia Shire), Paulie (Burt Young), and Apollo are willing to get Rocky back in shape to take on Clubber once more.Featuring a cameo appearance by the Immortal Hulk Hogan, Rocky III holds it own against it's two predecessors and proves to be another good sequel.I give it a 5 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film Rocky 3 was definitely, in my opinion, the best Rocky film of all time. Some people might argue with this by saying that Rocky 1 was the best as it showed the rise of Rocky in boxing and the romantic side from when he fell in love with Adrian, others might prefer Rocky 2 for when Rockys son was born, doing his TV commercial advertisement and when he became the Heavy weight champion of the world, while others might prefer Rocky 4 after the coming of boxer Ivan Drago, the sadness of Apollo Creed dying and when Rocky travelled to Russia. Although most of the Rocky films were spectacular, I have to say that Rocky 3 compared to the other Rocky films had so much more to offer compared to the other Rocky films as it was action packed and ongoing excitement all the way through the film. It had Rockys boss Micky dying, Mr.T and Hulk Hogan(and Wrestle-mania),the building of Rockys statue, it had Rocky losing everything and then getting it all back again and the brilliant one line quotes (ie. When the newscaster said to Clubber lang "Whats your prediction for tomorrow nights fight"... Clubber Lang replies "Prediction"...Newscaster replies "Yes Prediction"... Clubber Lang replies... PAIN!! and from when Clubber Lang says to Rockys wife "If you bring your pretty little self on down to my apartment tonight, I will show you a real man etc...) and not to mention the fact that this film had three fights while every other Rocky film had a maximum of two fights. Also for Rocky Balboa(Sylvester Stallone)to fight in the ring two hard man icons such as Mr. T and Hulk Hogan is quite a spectacular challenge for one Rocky film to offer as no other Rocky film has ever matched up to it.If you haven't seen the Rocky films, then watch Rocky 3, followed by the first two Rocky films for I gaurantee you that if you like boxing films, you will definitely like Rocky 3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably the most popular Rocky movie because it has the versus word.The plot is basically the same as in part II but with new characters and a plot twist on the principal fight.Mr. T. was an interesting choice for Rocky's nemesis on the ring but I feel his presence was cheesy. Mr. T. was a marketing choice that served for it's purpose. Heck, he was very over the top on his scenes.The dialogs are cheesy overall but it's a Rocky movie! You can expect our hero to recover from the worst situations and winning in the end.Recommended only for Rocky fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rocky III</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Rocky beat Apollo in Rocky Part 2, 5 years has past, Rocky is a very popular person. He is still champ and Clubber Lang becomes the number 1 contender. Then Rocky fights Clubber and Rocky gets the crap beat out of him. Rocky is going to get a rematch but oh no, Mickey is dead now, because Clubber pushed Mickey right before the fight. Now who will train him now? Will Rocky win the rematch? watch to find out. Rocky III is not as good as Part 1 and Part 2 but it is still good. So I recommend it. If you liked Rocky Part 1 and 2 you should like this. Is it predictable? yeah, maybe a little. But hey, it is a Rocky movie. Not a Shakespeare play. Not the best of the series but hey, it is not the worst. It has a good rematch. The ending is good. And it is fun. so my overall rating is 7 out of 10 stars. Watch it if you have not seen it. Thank you. Good not great. Enjoy the match. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK OK, i love all the rocky films except 5 but 3 is a very entertaining one, its not as good as 4 but it has a lot more emotion. Rocky loses against clubber lang (played by mr t) then seeks revenge and also to win back his title, (i think just for mickeys sake).But this movie shows a no fear boxer going up against the bright hearted Rocky, so unlike rocky 6 skill vs will rocky 3 is power vs heart. This film shows just how much of a gentleman Apollo really is as well. Overall i give rocky III a 8/10 for its good acting and decent rehased story line. This is the only film to use the EYE OF THE TIGER themetune which i think is pretty unfair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arguably the second best Rocky film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, when I was a kid growing up this was actually my favourite Rocky film. Now as time's gone by and I'm older and wiser, it is of course the original which stands apart from the others. The symbolism and meaning that old all the plaudits are in the first film, but this one is still my next favourite. This film has Rocky as a successful heavyweight champ whose world comes crashing down when he finds out that his subsequent title defences weren't what he thought they were. Faced with a viscous challenger Rocky has to come to terms with facing his own fear of losing everything he's worked hard to build and remember exactly what it was that made him everyone's favourite underdog.True it is not in the league of dramatic brilliance of the first film and it is corny as hell, but that takes nothing away from one simple truth and that is that this film is fun. From the moment of the opening montage or Rocky's successful title defences through to the end painting of Apollo and Rock in the ring it's a rip-roaring enjoyable punch fest and the truth is that there's nothing wrong with that. I, like a lot of people thought little of this film due to Rocky 4 and 5, but what I would say is treat this as it should be treated, as the third part of the first Rocky Trilogy.Fantastic!</fullReview>

He knocks Rocky silly in the opening stages of the fight and Rocky gets depressed. After being trained by old nemesis Apollo Creed, Rocky beats Clubber silly in the first three rounds.It's not as emotional as the first two, but there is more action and of course the song.

		<shortDescription>Bring on the 80's!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this third installment of the franchise started by the winner of the 1976 Academy Award for Best Picture, the Eighties rushes in like a tidal wave. Lucky for us, the Balboa gang is already hip to the decade - just don't take it seriously, that's the key. Honestly, if you want a good reminiscent chuckle of the Rubik's cube era but still want to be entertained, it's hard to beat Rocky III. The film has everything Eighties: the montage, the brightly colored clothes, Hulk Hogan playing a character named Thunderlips... The two main sources of Eighties power? The introduction of Survivor's musical Van Gogh "Eye of the Tiger" and Rocky's opponent Clubber Lang, played by none other than Mr. T. My favorite scene is without a doubt the montage of the two fighters getting fit for the match (Balboa and new manager Apollo Creed running on the beach, Clubber doing chin-ups in a dungeon, etc.). Enough jibba-jabba; see Rocky III.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is much more exotic than the previous two Rocky films. While the first two seemed relaxed and simple, this film gets unusual because certain characters start to develop.Things happen such as Rocky's speech improves, Adrian wears make-up, Paulie starts to gain weight again, Rocky Jr. is now able to walk and talk, and the biggest thing: The stallion is rich.When I first saw this I found it odd to see Rocky rich and was always use to him living the poor but simple life in the streets of Philly.The biggest change is his opponent: Clubber Lang played by the ferocious Mr. T. Lang is this loudmouth boxer who mainly focuses on improving his hooks and making them to the strongest degree. He's a powerful opponent and has a different way of intimidating than Apollo Creed does.Apollo returns again and is his usual self, but this time he is on Rock's side.The final fight between Rocky and Lang is awesome and very well done, even though the sound effects are over exaggerated.Well worth a watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Balboa's beaten Creed but can he beat Clubber Lang?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the events of Rocky I and II, Rocky is now filthy rich by winning his matches. But soon from the ashes comes a big mouth rough boxer named Clubber Land (Mr. T) and after he defeats his fights, he orders Rocky to give him a fight for the belt. Rocky agree's but at the fight, not only does he loose the match and his belt but he witnesses the death of his manager Mickey. Now with the help of Apollo Creed, Rocky challenges Lang for a rematch for the belt, can he win it all again? Sly returns in this second sequel to the smash boxing hit Rocky. This film is not as good as the first two but it proves to be a really entertaining film with the lust of winning and gaining back the eye of the tiger. Mr. T gives a great performance as the killing machine Clubber Lang. Sadly, Burgess Meredith must act as his character Micky passes away in this chapter. But this is a good subplot for when Apollo Creed steps up and helps Rocky train for his fight with Clubber, making the two good friends. This film though, it's worn down from the past two with Rocky now a big star. Though not perfect, this film gives great performances. One may I say is the big brawl between Rocky and Hulk Hogans Thunderlips for charity and it's great! So if you like the first two movies, you'll appreciate Rocky III. Rocky III gets the big 7, it may be worn down it's still pretty entertaining. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Im actually a big Rocky fan, I have a hard time deciding what Rock film was the best. Rocky 3 alone is a great movie. Its no Taxi Driver but its still a great guy movie. The fight scenes are a little more realistic because the fists come a bit closer to the head rather than the typical Rocky 11 foot punch. Mr. T does a great villan role and hes easy to dislike. Throughout the movie you find yourself in Rockys corner. I still find Rocky 5 with Tommy (Gun) Morrison to have the best plot but Rocky 3 &amp; 4 are great too. Of the 5 Rocky movies, Id rank Rocky 3 as being second best. Rocky 5 being the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ROCKY III has the distinction of being the most fastly paced of the series (three bouts in 90+ minutes) and although, the veiwer can sense reality slowly creeping away from the franchise, the movie DOES work, in a 80's over-excess mannor. ROCKY is now a ten times defending champion, who has smartened himself up, gotten educated, but unfortunetly (as manager MICKEY tells him) he's also become TOO civilized, and has lost the killer instinct. This aspect is true, when ROCKY suffers a savage beating at the hands of number one contender (and all round bad ass) CLUBBER LANG (played by the legendary MR T) Matters are also made worse when ROCKY's manager dies, shortly after his brutal defeat. With his title gone, and obscuirity beckoning, ROCKY feels washed up. That is, untill he is approached by one-time nemesis, APOLLLO CREED, and is offered to train for a rematch, and regain the 'eye of the tiger', needed to face a brutal and intimidating opponent as LANG.STALLONE done his homework on this one, he probably kickstarted the whole eighties action movie, as we know it. But ROCKY III, borrows plot elements from genres such as westerns/martial arts movies, with its defeat/training/retribution themes. The fight scenes are trully awesome, with MR T taking equal honours in this department (he looks like one bad mutha, and fights like one!) and the climactic rematch, has some of the greatest editing and lightning pacing in ANY motion picture. The sight of a blood stained STALLONE coming back from a beating that would kill a horse, glaring into the camera screaming "AINT SO BAD...AINT SO BAD!" with every punch thrown at him, is quite disturbing.Note; FRANK STALLONE turns up again, this time singing in a glitzy public training exhibition for ROCKYs 1st fight with LANG. The song he sings,'PUSHING' is a classic of it's kindAdd to the pot an appearence by HULK HOGAN, and you have a classic movie, that if not the best in the series, is certainly one of the best movies of the 80's...i have no other choice but to give this movie a classic ten outa' ten!......and so should everyone else!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third best in the series! Should've deserved a 6 rating instead of a 5. Years after Rocky Balboa fought Apollo Creed, Rocky has had ten title defenses. But what he didn't expect was for one man to come after his title so very quick. That man is Clubber Lang, a hard hitting wrecking machine. Rocky accepts the challenge with Clubber. During the match, Rocky is K.nocked O.ut by Clubber in two rounds. After the fight, Rocky's beloved trainer Mickey dies. Rocky feels like a real loser afterwards, now that he's lost his title and Mickey. He still has one hope though. That is Apollo Creed. Apollo has offered to train with Rocky so they could win the title back together. Now, it's up to Apollo to help Rocky for him to face Lang in a grueling rematch for the World Heavyweight Champion.Starring Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire, Carl Weathers, Burt Young, Burgess Merideth, Tony Burton, Hulk Hogan, and Mr. T. *** out of 4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I originally saw this movie in the theatre when I was 12 and I thought it was the best friggin' movie ever. Now that I'm older, I see all it's flaws but I still like it. Mr T. is of course amazing as Clubber Lang "My Prediction? Pain." and is worthy adversary for Rocky. This movie is also a 90 minute endorsement for Gold's Gym, cause these guys are in the best shape of their lives, holy rippling muscles batman! In fact, Stallone is in such good shape at the beginning it's hard to believe that he's gone "soft", since he's probably 50 pounds leaner than he was in the original Rocky and is cut like a 2x4. I would have preferred a DeNiro type of transformation (a la Taxi Drive) where you actually see him become a human action figure before your eyes.And, of course the fight scenes are rediculous and completely unrealistic (like most boxing films) but they're fun as hell to watch, the editing is superb (amazing pacing). The dialogue is tolerable without causing too much wincing and has some funny moments "Maybe I'll go join the coicus or somethin'", which is all you can hope for in this kind of movie. 3 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

Rocky ignores Micks pleads, and goes down to Lang with Mickey suffering a heart attack in the locker room. With his title in the hands of a young champion and his beloved trainer gone, it looks like Rockys career might be over...but wait....its Apollo Creed...to save the day!!! With Creed by his side Rocky is injected with a great amount of fighting spirit and develops skills that he never thought possible.

		<fullReview>Apparently Rocky got his Master's from Harvard somewhere in between Rocky II and Rocky III. In Rocky II, he lost all of his endorsement deals because he COULD HARDLY READ!! In Rocky III, he is literally brilliant. I'm not certain of this but I think he quotes Shakespeare in this movie. Also, what happened to Apollo Creed. He beats up on Rocky for 14.99 rounds and then decides to retire after losing the belt. Doesn't he deserve a rematch? And what exactly is Paulie doing here? He serves no purpose in these movies, why must they insist on bringing him back for every movie. I wish he had died instead of Mickey. However, this movie is certainly superior to both Rocky IV (which is basically a bunch of homoerotic montages sandwiched between 10 minutes of actual plot development) and Rocky V (a disgrace, pure and simple). Stallone could have stopped after 3, but he wanted $$$. Who can blame him, I guess? It should be noted that Stallone made $25 million for Rocky V. The movie grossed $40 million. Not bad, Sly.</fullReview>

I know the fighting scenes are a joke but Mr.T makes the movie worthwhile with his witty saying's.

		<fullReview>It was unfortunate yet inevitable that one of the freshest franchises in years should eventually fall foul to Hollywood cliches, but this is what has happened in the third installment of the boxing saga. And they have written every single one into this story! What was basically raw cinema for 2 stunning films, is now your bog standard good guy makes good story. Interesting possibilities for sub-plots have been cast aside in favour of making everyone friends. And the villain (played acceptably by Mr T) is dreadfully portrayed as some kind of animal, complete with snarling in the fight sequences. Stallone had something very good for a few years with his ROCKY stories, yet we are presumably going to get the bargain end of the deal from now on - hopefully Stallone will see sense and pull out before this goes too far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Perfect Distillation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Credit Sylvester Stallone with being able to figure out what the people want and how to put it on the screen.The biggest thrills of any "Rocky" movie come from the spectacularly staged fight sequences. So in "Rocky III", Stallone gives us two heavyweight bouts. Mr. T is the evilest villain, playing the role he was meant to play. For good measure, Stallone even throws in an hilarious "exhibition match" between Rocky and "Thunderlips", played by a little known pro wrestler, Hulk Hogan.In these matches, the viewer feels the power of every punch, the awesome impact of every landed blow. It's all helped along by Bill Conti's score and the rest of the totally 80's soundtrack.We're also treated to a music-video style training montage -- another Stallone staple -- that is the envy of every amateur fitness buff. Who doesn't feel like doing push-ups after hearing "The Eye of the Tiger"?"Rocky III" is the ultimate distillation: you've got good guys, bad guys, bad guys-turned-good guys; there's comedy, tragedy, and redemption. Is it great movie-making? Of course not. Does it deliver everything you'd expect (and have come to want)? Absolutely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is Rocky III which makes the Rocky films officially a trilogy. This film lacks the drama aspect that the first two soared with. But it doesn't matter, I mean Rocky Balboa as already proved that "He did it!". What drama could there really be after Rocky II? So instead of closing the book on the film Stallone decided to make this more of an action film. I just loved it. Most critics thumbed down this one and bombed the last two. This movie is great fun and with a heart. Rocky is now enormously rich and famous. He's won more championships and decides to call it quits. But a new opponent(Mr.T) wants Rocky to fight him. Rocky decides to fight one more time. But alas for poor Rocky he has become foggy with all his fame and fortune and has unknowingly lost his "Eye of the Tiger". He kepts hurt by Mr. T and has to make a comeback. He teams up with Appolo Creed and wins back his fighting spirit. The final fight sequence is brief and satisfying. The film grossed nearly 150 million and I loved it. I just wish it is released on DVD on day. The Rocky trilogy is the most engrossing and entertaining sequential movies ever. On one last note for all you Rocky fans, get this: I was reading a recent issue of the Cinescape magazine and I found a mentioning that STALLONE IS CONSIDERING A ROCKY VI!!! It's not official, but is was written in ink. Thank you, and good night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rocky series stumbles a bit in this third movie. Sylvester Stallone once again writes and directs the film, in addition to starring. The plot has Rocky becoming rich, famous, and beloved as he defends the championship successfully in one bout after another. Then a hungry up-and-comer named Clubber Lang (Mr. T) publicly challenges Rocky, who accepts despite the reservations of his trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith).A good popcorn movie but the first of the series to feel like that's all it's striving to be. Mr. T is fun but hard to take seriously. Hulk Hogan has a comedy appearance as "Thunder Lips," a wrestler Rocky has to fight in a charity event. This whole part is silly and kind of out of place with the rest of the movie. Nice to see most of the regulars back, including a smooth way of fitting Carl Weathers' Apollo Creed back into the story. Bill Conti's score is good but what most people remember from this one is Survivor's hit song "Eye of the Tiger." Not a bad movie in any way but a step down from part two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stallone is good when he is bad and good when he is good, so no point in dwelling on him. Rocky has been holding the title as the heavyweight champion until he is defeated by a brutal challenger, and now must regain his fighting spirit through a big rematch, trained by an unlikely ally: his old nemesis Apollo Creed. This is the kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. This is probably the worst of the sequels. By this film the series became even more unwatchable and somehow even more redundant. This is one of those movies that the star isn't only in for the paycheck.

		<fullReview>This is a near perfect story. How many boxing movies portray 3 different matches? (even though the first one was a boxing-wrestling exhibition match for charity)The most inspiring part of this movie is the speech delivered by Adrian in the middle, on the beach, to Rocky Balboa, to motivate him again to fight for what he really wants, for "you, only you, and nobody else". Adrian's speech had me in tears, and Talia Shire has finally, in the serious, ceased being this annoying little mousy wallflower as she had been in the Rocky series prior to this moment.Stallone's and Mr T's physiques were incredible. I have no idea how Sylvester Stallone stars in and directs these amazing, extremely fast boxing action sequences.Mr T's portrayal of the always-hungry metaphorical "tiger" deserves many accolades for acting.</fullReview>

Nobody believes in Rocky anymore, except for former opponent Apollo Creed.As Creed tries to stimulate the fighting spirit and get Rocky back in top-form, it is now up to Rocky to get his edge back.....The third Rocky film took a wonderful turn for the series, made the movies into nothing more than a string of montages and fights.It's more comic book than the previous two instalments, and it works in three parts.Rocky gets defeated.Rocky trains.Rocky fights.And these are the three act rules that the film follows, and what the following films followed as well.The film is written effortlessly, like Stallone was printing out money, and kudos to him for bringing his real life into the story, as he celebrity life reflected the first act.Lang is good, but nothing more than a screaming little boy, but these films know how to pull the heart strings, and also how to get the blood pumping, this is why repeated viewings of part three and four (or III and IV), never get boring, especially if you are of a certain age.Brilliant stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Part III of the Rocky saga has Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) holding the title as the heavyweight champion until he is defeated by challenger Clubby Lang (Mr. T). To regain his fighting spirit for a rematch, Rocky is trained by his old nemesis, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers).This is one of those movies I saw once when I was a little kid. While I don't remember much of it, I do recall rooting for Rocky in the boxing matches and do remember it as being of the more exciting movies to watch back in the 1980s. The boxing matches are well-choreographed and Sylvester Stallone is creative in his Rocky role. Mr. T is perfect as Clubber Lang and a great opponent/villain for Rocky. You put the two in the ring it is like the fight of the century. Overall, it's a nice piece of sport drama movie.Grade B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rocky battles his most powerful adversary yet-the ferocious Clubber Lang-in this hard hitting actioner which comes out swinging with adventure, humour and emotionally charged drama. For what may be the most exciting and most fast-paced film in the series. Sylvester Stallone writes, directs and acts with explosive passion and intensity. As Rocky Balboa fights his way into the hearts of millions, life couldn't be better. He scores ten consecutive wins, lands lucrative endorsement contracts, and becomes famous throughout the world. But when Clubber Lang K.O.s Rocky in an humiliating defeat, it becomes apparent that the "Italian Stallion" has lost his edge. Considering hanging up his gloves, Rocky receives encouragement from an unlikely ally: his old nemesis, Apollo Creed. With Creed's help Rocky strives to retain the "eye of the tiger" before confronting Clubber Land in a rematch and to try and win back the title.This film starred: Sylvester Stallone, Carl Weathers &amp; Mr.T also featuring Talia Shire, Burt Young and Burgess Meredith.In my opinion this is not only the best Rocky film but one of the best films ever made. I just love every thing about this film from the first minute to the last and the fight with Clubber at the end, when Rocky retains the title it's just amazing the whole of the final fight is just amazing with the quote as it is in my summary "come on champ you ain't so bad" just proves how hard Rocky wants the title!*****/***** Outstanding</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good third movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Sylvester Stallone should end the story of Rocky here . It would be a fitting end for the most famous boxer in history of cinema. I like forth one , but as a entertainment movie . "Rocky 5" was a misstep and it's good that "Rocky Balboa" ended the franchise with style. Still , I think that three Rocky movies were more than enough. Oh well , I can't do anything about it."Rocky 3" works really well as a third act of Balboa's story . It's not just another movie in the franchise . For me , it brings the story to full circle. In first movie we are introduced to Rocky, a boxer that has to fight both in the ring and in life for everything . He doesn't even dream of fame , yet he gets a chance from destiny to change his life . In second movie he changes . He wants fame and money . He loses himself . Thankfully he is able to realize that and comes back to his old self. "Rocky 3 " is a story about a man who lost his touch . He's the same likable , honest , good guy we met . Yet he's different. He lost his passion , his hunger , his magic (for lack of better word). He's burnt out . This is something many of us can relate to . We don't know what is the reason that our beloved director has stopped making good movies or why our favorite band can't record album as good as before . Nobody knows . It's hard to achieve success , but it's even harder to life with that success . To not fail . To not become a shadow of himself. "R3" is a story about how hard is to come back to the top . It's kind of a prophecy for Stallone who disappeared somewhere in the mid 90's and came back triumphant in 2006 with Rocky Balboa. It's also a story about defeating your own fear .Mr.T who plays Clubber Lang represents a new generation of boxers ? young , violent , aggressive , with no respect for anybody and anything. In a way he's a darker version of Balboa. T gives a good performance . He's different than Creed and memorable , so Stallone did good job with finding a worthy opponent for Balboa.Sylvester Stallone , Burgess Meredith , Burt Young , Talia Shire and Carl Weathers bring back the good acting they shown us before. Watch out for Chino "Fats" Williams in small episode of drunk homeless man and for Hulk Hogan (sic !) as wrestler Thunderlips . "Rocky 3" works as a solid sport drama . I could live without the boxing match between Stallone and Hogan . It belongs more to "Rocky 4" and doesn't fit in to overall serious tone of the movie . The fights are exciting and quite realistic, especially compared to "Rocky 4" (it's still a movie, so you need some suspension of disbelief) . The direction is solid . The training montage is inspirational and don't forget about great song "Eye of the tiger" by Survivor (it was nominated for Oscar).I give it 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS**** After Rocky Balboa's winning the World Heavyweight Championship in his re-match drag out and knock down battle with "the Master of Disater" Apollo Creed, Carl Weathers, he's given a hand picked string of second tier boxers by his concerned, in not having his fighter and meal ticket Rocky hurt, trainer/manager the Willy Mickey Goldmill, Burgess Meredith, to defend his hard won tidal against. In the background there's the hard hitting training and determined 230 pounds of fighting fury Clubber Lang, Mister T, mowing his way through the heavyweight ranks, like Iron Mike Tyson did before he got his title match, nipping like an out of control pit bull terrier at Rocky's feet.It's at an unavailing ceremony of the Rocky Balboa statue in downtown Philadelphia that Lang finally got his chance to meet face to face with Rocky not only taunting him about how scared he is of him and not willing to give him a shot at the heavyweight title. The mad and intimidating Lange really lets Rocky have it by even going so far as insulting his manhood by claiming that he, unlike Rocky, could satisfied his wife Yo Adrian, Talia Shire, both in and out of bed more then he ever could!With Rocky at first planing to retire from boxing he puts his retirement on hold to give the big bad as well as big mouth Lang a title shot against the better judgment off his manager Mickey. And as history or the film proved it turned out to be a major disaster for Rocky Balboa. He gets clobbered by Lang in two round leaving him both defeated as well as punch drunk. It was also not long after the match with Lang that his friend and manager Mickey who was knocked cold by a crazed and uncontrollable Lang before the fight with Rocky suddenly passed away!Now down in the dumps and the laughing stock of all the entire sports world especially after his wild and bizarre charity match with professional wrestler the 7 foot tall 350 pounds Thunderlips, Hulk Hogan, who's billed as "Every Womens Dream" Rocky goes into a deep depression. In him feeling that his entire boxing career that he was so proud of was nothing but a joke. It's non other then his former bitter opponent Apollo Creed who comes to Rocky's rescue when nobody else even his wife Yo Adrian and struggling to stay sober friend and brother in law Paulie, Burt Young, could. With Apollo taking Rocky under his wings and putting him through a vigorous and ghetto like, in a Watts L.A boxing gym, training regiment he got Rocky in the best shape of his life to take on Lang in a re-match where he wasn't taken seriously at all by Lang or the boxing and sport world.****SPOILERS**** probably the best and shortest,three rounds, fight sequence up to then far better the the previous two Rocky movies with the title fight taken place at New York's Madison Square Garden has Rocky charge out of his corner at the opening bell and box instead of slug it out, like he did in their first match, with Clubber Lang easily taking, on all cards , the first round. In the second round Lang got over his confusion and started to punch his way through Rocky's defenses with Lang's devastating punches getting to Rocky flooring him a number of times. It's then when it looked like curtains for Rocky that he went on the defensive letting Lang do all the swinging until by the middle of the third round his devastating punches, that can poke holes through a brick wall, were nothing more but harmless cream puffs. It was Lang not Rocky who ended up defeating himself by punching himself out so badly that by the time Rocky opened up on him with his left hooks and straight rights that he was left punchy and rubbed armed as well as flat on his back and on the mat for a ten count. With Lang so exhausted and punched out even a light tap from Rocky's old lady Yo Adrian would have done the job as well.P.S Now with his title back Rocky has one favor to do for his friend Apollo who gave him back that hungry mean and lean "Eye of the Tiger" attitude that he needed to defeat Lang. And in an empty gym's boxing ring, probably the famous Gleason's Gym in the Dumbo section of Brooklyn, the two square off in their unannounced rubber match to see who's the best. And as Rocky &amp; Apollo are about to let loose with straight rights and left hooks the screen freezes leaving it up to us in the audience to imagine just what the ultimate and final results of that bout would be!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While any of the Rocky films will never be great thought provokers what they do provide are films that are extremely enjoyable to watch. The build up to the final fight, the music, the training sequences they are all great fun to watch and as a viewer you do get drawn into the movies Rocky 3 does not really provide anything new but it builds well upon the existing formula of Rocky films. One thing that I would like to mention is the one thing about all Rocky films is that Stallone does draw from his own personal experiences when doing this film. If we examine Rocky 3 we can see that it is about a person who's fame has gone to his head, he is no longer in touch with reality and if Stallone was honest this is reflection of himself at the time as well. This is extremely well documented within the film and surely sends out a clear message to the trappings of becoming famous.There are some great moments in the films e.g when Rocky says to Adrian 'Nothing is real if you don't believe in it any more'. How true is this statement and all the people who can convince you to believe in yourself it's your wife, the scene truly can hit home to a lot of people</fullReview>

At that young as an 8 yrs old , i understood the myth and the ideology of this film. That was the 1st time i saw sly Stallone, and in its 1st appearance he made his place in my heart. When he become too much indulged in the business of money making and fame ,he ignored the advice of his mentor mickey and the fact that he is losing his attitude of being a true fighter, than he is met by clubber lang , a new but vicious , arrogant and aggressive contender and he knocks rocky out easily in second round just like without a fight , also then mickey is gone forever. Rocky is so devastated and broken down he even now despises his own self. So much frustrated at this time that he cant put it out of his mind what happened and what is left for him to live than now he is offered a selfless and generous assistance by an unlikely ally. His old nemesis Apollo creed. Now being Apollo on his side all rocky has to do to put himself all together and again live for the glory and prestige he lost in the ring with that championship, Coz that the the only way he can live with his own self, by following the phenomena Apollo creed introduced to him as the eye of the tiger. This was the best movie as far boosting your morale and spirit in the whole rocky series. Mr T as clubber lang was an excellent discovery by Sylvester Stallone, as here he also proved his directional skills , also as he discovered Dolph lundgren for rocky 4. Another good thing was a wrestling match with than champion wrestler Hulk hogan by Rocky balboa. This movie is very very gripping from the start till the end rematch, especially the song eye of the tiger , it is still very much favorite among me and my brothers, cousins and friends. I call it an all time film, forever flick.</fullReview>

He is hilarious.This film now has Rocky being a rich and successful boxer.He one day gets challenged to a match by this amateur boxer named Clubber Lang(Mr.T).They fight and Clubber beats him.So then Rocky's old enemy Apollo Creed befriends him and trains him to beat Clubber Lang.Rocky III is almost the best film of the Rocky series and it just ranks slightly lower than Rocky 1 in my opinion.Still an excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film belongs to Carl Weathers. His character "Apollo Creed" is not only the best character, but the most important. There are two stories here: one about a champion who has been fighting semi-good boxers to remain on top, and then losing to a real fighter ("Clubber Lang"). Then there is the story of the fallen champ who teaches the newly fallen champ how to be a "real fighter". This is the story that shines, and ties everything together, and makes this the second best Rocky film in the series. Burt Young's "Paulie" is hilarious too, especially the way he reacts to the living conditions in downtown L.A. when Apollo brings Rocky to train there. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who wants to be "pumped up" and/or motivated. Okay, it's corny here and there, but it's Rocky, not Shakespeare... Thank God!</fullReview>

Although Rambo III has got some of the strengths of the two earlier movies, and it's a necessary movie in the Rocky-franchise because it shows a Rocky always maturing as he faces personal problems and sorrows. But Rocky III is far from a great movie, the straight-forward production and final finish makes the movie grand for watching boxing-action, but nothing more - Mr. T's ticked off Clubber Lang is nothing more than irritating and the family drama of Rocky reaches a certain point were it's simply not interesting. But one thing Sylvester Stallone really deserves is the fact that he manages making the movie both believable and enjoyable enough that when the movie is finished you feel both entertained and good.

Over the years he's been in car ads, magazine covers, and meeting famous celebrities. Life was good for the Italian Stallone.However a ruthless Black Boxer name Clubber Lang, was jealous and outraged that rocky has all the fame and he doesn't. So he comes around and challenges Rocky to a one on one fight. Eventually Rocky goes up against the loud mouth challenger. But Mick did at all want to be involved with this fight in the first place.Unfortunately the fight didn't last like the way it should. And Rocky feels as if his winning streak has gone down hill. Luckily Apollo has seen the whole thing and offers Rocky some help on regaining the title. And in order to do that, he'll need to challenge Clubber for a rematch, and Apollo will teach Rocky some boxing techniques that he's never mastered before.But will Rocky be able to beat someone who's more ruthless than Creed himself? This is a worthy sequel of the Rocky Series. What i like the most about it is, Apollo and Rocky are now close friends in this one than arch rivals from the previous 2. It has the same theme as the previous 2, and still has the style that Stalone provided in the series. Fans of the first 2 might like this one. But depending on one's own opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I once had an argument with a guy about this film because he said this was the worst film he'd ever seen, which is so far removed from the mark it's bordering on fighting talk. (And may I say that I know for a fact this man liked his girlfriend to tie him up and p**s on his face. Would you take film criticism from such a dirty dirty man? I know I damn well wouldn't).And anyway ? this isn't the worst film ever made because the worst film ever made is some crap like 'Fried Green Tomatoes' or one of those straight to DVD movies you see for sale in a garage. You know the ones - they 'guest star' Billy Zane or Patrick Bergen or some other poor excuse for an actor or actress (such as Julia Roberts).No. This film is great because it's got Mr T in it smacking the living crap out of everyone before getting his comeuppance at the end of Rocky's fists. And it's got 'Eye Of The Tiger' as its theme tune (which is the musical equivalent of fighting in an alleyway). And Apollo is Rocky's mate in this one which is what we all wanted to happen. And Mickey the trainer dies which is more emotional than any other screen death I've ever witnessed (with the possible exception of Connery's Irish/Scottish character in The Untouchables or Goose in Top Gun).Up yours p**s-in-your-face man! I'm right and you're wrong because I'd never let anyone p**s in my face and that's the end of THAT.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. T is Wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rocky III would be a long-forgotten movie if it wasn't for one special character, Clubber Lang, played by Mr. T. Mr. T was the dynamo that charged up this movie and kept it from becoming just another grade B sleeper. Because by Rocky III, Rocky Balboa is already washed up and ready to retire. And who wants to watch a movie about a washed up boxer who is ready to retire? But Mr. T energizes this movie, giving it resuscitation needed so that it can live and say something besides that Rocky's time is over and done with, that Mickey should go home and that Pauly should go back to the meat packing plant. Once Mr.T gets involved, the fireworks go off because it's just a matter of time before he and Stallone have it out, which saves the movie from total oblivion. In this movie Clubber Lang is The Man and he's the character that makes this movie work.</fullReview>

However, that being said, Having just watched the first two Rocky movies, it seems like a different Rocky to me. I think that some of the what made these characters got lost. Rocky just seemed a little smarter, Adrienne seemed like a different person. I just don't think they stayed true to the characters from the first two.

		<fullReview>I don't know why many people bash this movie. It's my favorite in the series. It shows that anyone who gets complacent about where he or she is in life will not achieve his or her full potential. Rocky defeats a number of challengers after defeating Apollo Creed and is challenged by a hungry heavyweight contender named Clubber Lang. Rocky gets lazy with his training and gets clobbered. The twist that I really like is his old nemesis, Apollo Creed, wants to train Rocky for personal reasons. Rocky's lack of spirit shows in the beginning of the training. He then is motivated by a speech from his wife and gets his hunger back. I just like the fact that it shows if you're not hungry, you will not achieve your goals. Take my comments for what they're worth, just my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the coolest Rocky movie in the series,and by the coolest I mean that it may not be the best,but the fighting scenes are awsome.The reason why this separate from the other Rocky movies is because Rocky faces Mr.T as Clubber Lang and he is a beast like nothing you have ever seen before. He are like an animal in the ring and makes the fighting scenes in this movie one of the coolest ever.Another reason why I like this movie is because Mr.T has his birthday on the same date as I,and you gotto love that.I think this is maybe the best Rocky movie,with Rocky 4 on a close second place.So if you like fighting scenes or Sylvester Stallone then this is a must.This is pure entertaining so I guess many people enjoy this movie,because you don't have to think.Just sit back and relax.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fresh life for the Rocky series. Stallone once again proves to be the master of making a sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stallone goes the rounds as both writer and director in this the third installment of the Rocky series, and a winner is produced. Rocky III is often described as Sylvester Stallone vs. Mr. T. Much more can be found and learned from Rocky III the film for one contains emotion, love, sadness, dedication, and friendship but most of all the once again discovery of "The Eye Of The Tiger". You have it Rocky (Stallone) the heavyweight champion of the world makes ten straight title defenses with no problem, but complacency plagues Rocky who shows his odd manner by taking a circus act charity wrestling match against Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan). The lack of training hurts Rocky and he suffers a crushing KO at the hands of punishing challenger Clubber Lang (Mr. T) nearly at the same moment Mickey (Burgess Meredith) suffers a KO to his life in a physical sense only later to die with Rocky crying over him in the dressing room. Death actually occurs in two separate means with the death of Mick it's in a literal sense really happening and with the knockout title loss that Rocky (Stallone) suffered in a sense a figurative death occurred though not in an exact sense, but a title loss felt like death to Rocky (Stallone). I could see the graphic match technique was used to compare the loss and death scene, that's exactly what graphic match does it ties the story together with issues representing both a literal and figurative meaning. After the defeat Stallone once again meets up with former opponent and friend and think god Rocky has a friend Appollo Creed (Carl Weathers) who trains to help him once again discover "The Eye Of The Tiger". Wife Adrian (Talia Shire) supports Rocky to bury the past and to not once again become complacent, and to not bear the burden of Mick's death because guilt will only destroy, by once again believing in yourself and soul searching "The Eye Of The Tiger" can be found. In the rematch with Lang which went three rounds with a KO going to Rocky "The Eye Of The Tiger" was discovered. See a fresh start and be like millions of others and discover "The Eye Of The Tiger".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, but nothing more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The realism in the Rocky movies was never the subject, the idea was to show will, determination, insatiable desire for fame and glory, hope, etc. That's what Rocky was supposed to be. But as the franchise wore on Stallone seems to get tired with the role, he is visibily tired when Rocky IV comes around, and in Rocky V he tries to make amends but fails dismaly.This film is fun, but the viewer should not to expect any more than that. The film is pretty good to watch, the fight sequences are okay but pretty unrealistic compared to Raging Bull (but as I've said above, realisim was never the key).There are good parts to the film, one being the under-written Mr T playing the venomus and tough opponent Clubber Lang. Its obvious Mr T had fun playing the role he always meant to play - every word he says spits the embodiment of hate and frustration - he is exactly like Rocky except his pride and underexpectation of his foes are his faliure.Otherwise this film is relatively good and an enjoyable watch. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. T and the "Eye of the Tiger"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rocky III" is pure corn, but is still probably the best sequel of a tiring series. This time Rocky (Stallone) falls from the top of the boxing world when Clubber Laing (Mr. T) knocks him out. During the fight Mickey (Meredith) dies of heart failure and Rocky falls into an abyss of depression and anger. Now he has to re-train himself with the help of old rival Apollo Creed (Weathers). "Rocky III" benefits from likeable characters (as usual), but the screenplay is near invisible and Stallone continues to prove that he is no director. The film's primary song, "Eye of the Tiger", may be the film's strongest point. "Rocky III" is overall an enjoyable film that plays more like a 99-minute music video than an actual motion picture. 3.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

As Mr. T, of course, who else?? He does a Mike Tyson(years before Iron Mike) type guy to a 'T', very well. They didn't try to do anything much different with Clubber Lang other than making him a bad-ass enemy, and you have to say T delivers.Here the fights are all short, and like the other ones in the first two Rockies-a non-stop parade of haymakers and windmill rights.

		<shortDescription>The Other Guy Now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is taking me longer than I expected to march through the Rocky corpus. That is because ? I think ? it is so unrewarding. What we are supposed to get, as Stallone has said now for decades, is Stallone. He has persevered and won. He has been thrown off by success. He has returned. And then the desires: he desires recognition, height and admiring love. What we want in return is for him to grow, for us to be rewarded for investing in his life. Simply put, we will sit through this autobiographical drek if the man were interesting ? or at least normal but revealed in an interesting way.Well, I am finding him a bore, and these movies lifeless. The story is the same in each; the same buttons, the same faces even. Of the four I have seen, this one has two unique things.There is a fight scene at the beginning with Hunk Hogan. It does not fit into the story template and likely is there as a space and energy filler. It is not referenced in the rest of the story, nor does it illuminate any element of it. Its just stuck in. It is extraordinarily well done though. The climax of these Rocky films is the boxing at the end. The original film had some energy because it was the first time we saw a steadicam. And the boxing was unusual and a but thrilling because it seemed real and brutal. But we tired. By the time of this film, Scorcese had done "Raging Bull" which is a sort of touchstone for cinematic immediacy in the ring. DePalma was still 15 years away from "Snake Eyes," which handles the rest of the world. What to do?Well, Stallone has certain limits physically. Boxing has certain limits as well which unfortunately do not help Stallone. It is as repetitive as golf or tennis, but the overall event sometimes has a carnally carnivorous ebb and flow. But we know how it will end.This inserted fight has the same Rocky, the same ring, the same mumbling. The same crew and their photographic philosophy. But it isn't boxing. It has energy ? amazement, what seems like real pain. The man may be dumb and play dumb. But he has an awareness of the physics of spectators. And that's impressive. I wonder what he did with Rambo?Oh. The other thing is a pretty delicate scripting about race. Boxing often is about hate, racial hate. You see two thugs up there pounding each other; if one is black and the other white, the respective communities emboss tribal associations on their players. The previous Rockys exploited this, apparently without thinking about it. This one does some pretty fancy footwork on the race stuff. A lot of attention went into splitting the black faces into the same symmetries we saw in the ring. Apollo Creed is redeemed. Paulie, the guy who we already know is our measure of "getting things wrong" is shown to be a racist, and we casually brush that off as simply being wrong.Bad movie. Really bad. But a couple indications that the guy knows his cinema.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

In my opinion the movie is even on par with the original.This movie quite possibly is the most entertaining one of the bunch. Even though there is some drama once more, this movie is just mainly entertaining. Main reason for this is because of the 'main villain' Clubber Lang, played by Mr. T. Oh man what a character!The boxing scene's look better than ever and the movie features quite some matches. You will just never grow tired of those spectacular filmed boxing matches!The story itself is actually also quite solid. I just love how they made Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) fit in this movie again. The drama, even though it of course all is very predictable is handled very well also once more mainly thanks to Talia Shire's acting skills. Sylvester Stallone is acting a bit disappointing in this one...but still he simply just IS Rocky.Brilliant entertainment!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

The scenes with Apollo training even reawakening Rocks will to fight , hie 'eye of the tiger' , are superb. Clubbers great so many classic one liners 'No I don't hate Balboa , I Pity da Fool' The way Rocky actually out boxed Clubber in the films climax is a refreshing change from the others where , Drago especially n Rock just beat each other senseless.

I really enjoyed the part where apollo creed (weathers) helps rocky during this dramatic time after losing mickey.he trains rocky with every thing he knows and can teach rocky.he also takes rocky to where he apollo used to train and also he meets up with apollos trainer and manger and he helps him to defeat clubber lang who is actually mr. t in real life. i think the third movie of rocky is one of the best movies of all time and is really inspirational to many young people like showing them how to protect themselves and also the motivation to complete something you don't quite think you can do but deep inside yourself you truly can become what your dreams are made of.</fullReview>

He must then return to the ring one more time (Untill the sequel) and find the "Eye of The Tiger".The film in itself is OK. It does not compare to the brilliance of the first 2 but does work well for the series. It is well acted and well written and directed. Syllone's performance is once again spot on to the character of Rocky.Overall, the film is good for a view but people who have not seen the first 2 should definitely watch them first.

		<shortDescription>Rocky III</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by its star Sylvester Stallone, the first film may be the one that was the most successful, winning Oscars and all, but this one gave us two things, a memorable TV star and a hit song. Basically it continues where the previous film left off, where Rocky Balboa (Stallone) defeated Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) by knockout, falling over and winning getting up, by one second, and he is still enjoying his success. Three years have passed, he has had ten fights holding onto his world champion title, and he is now rich with everything he could ever want. After a charity boxing match against World Wrestling Champion fighter Thunderlips (Hollywood Hulk Hogan) and a commemorative statue in his honour and that of his home town, Rocky announces his retirement. Right at that moment however out of the crowd comes the man who has been watching him with intent to fight him and become the new world champion, up and coming boxing brawler Clubber Lang (Mr. T), and with too much pride he accepts. At first trainer Mickey Goldmill (Burgess Meredith) is strict that he should not fight him, because he is a "killer", and he confesses the ten fights he got him were easy compared to Clubber, but he does agree eventually to give him more fighting tips. It comes to the match, but before it even starts Rocky and Clubber have backstage bust-up, resulting in Mickey having a heart attack, initially Rocky says he will forfeit, but his trainer urges him to go on. In the end, Rocky was too worried about Mickey to fight as well as he normally would, therefore he is defeated in two rounds and Clubber becomes the new World Champion, and Rocky is upset when he returns to Mickey who dies in front of him. He becomes depressed with the grief and thinking that he is finished, and he has no confidence to have a re-match, but then his former opponent Apollo Creed comes along. He encourages Rocky to go for a re-match, which Clubber Lang accepts, and he starts training him, he should try to forget any rivalry he has with the thug and concentrate more on regaining his title, he needs the "eye of the tiger". In the end, Rocky and Clubber return to the ring to have another fight, with wife Adrian (Talia Shire) and Apollo watching in the crowd and by the ring with hope, and against all odds Rocky does win the fight with a fantastic knockout punch, once again becoming Heavyweight Champion of the World. Also starring Burt Young as Paulie, Ian Fried as Rocky Jr. and Al Silvani as Al. Stallone still gives a really likable, Weathers steps up in the ranks becoming his mentor, Shire has her moments, as does Penguin actor Meredith before his character dies, and Mr. T is a great opponent with an attitude, a great attribute that got him the part of B.A. Baracus in The A-Team. I don't think the critics are very fair about this third film in the series, the fight sequences are still gripping, the montage sequence or two with the great music is still enjoyable, and of course the Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated song "Eye of the Tiger" by Survivor, that went to number one, is a great song, a good boxing drama. Rocky Balboa was number 7 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains, "Yo, Adrian." was number 80 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes. Worth watching!</fullReview>

Rocky tries to retire but is tricked into giving Lang a shot and then Rocky learns the truth. For the past 4 years he's been giving Rocky good fighters to defend the Title against but not killers like Lang because Mickey was worried That Rocky could be killed his injuries from the Creed fights was that severe so Mickey helped him get ten easy Title Defenses. The Public doesn't care to them Rocky is a hero. When rocky meets Lang he loses Everything The Heavy Weight Championship and Mickey. His life spirals into a downward spin until a friend from the past offers to help him out once again Enter Apollo Creed. Rocky 3 Was the best in the series and to many it still is the fact that Stallone finds ways to put Rocky into hardships is inventive and let's Face it Rocky 3 is the sleekest and the most attractive looking of the series it mirrors Rocky's life.

He develops a great friendship with Creed and spends more time with his wife.I recommend it this movie is good.not timeless like Rocky I,but really Stallone all the way(not 90s crap action movies)and of course Mr.T too. he is too good actor.training scenes was good in Rocky III like in every rocky.(of course Rocky V was crap and i haven't seen Rocky IV)in this movie Rocky Balboa enjoys the wealth he has as world champion and then came Clubber Lang and won the title and nobody believes in rocky anymore,but in the Rocky shows what he is. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sylvester Stallone returns as Rocky Balboa the beloved boxer who is currently enjoying the fact that he is a champion however this all changes when he is dethroned against hungry contender Clubber Lang (Mr.T the series' best villain) however after aimless thoughts of whether he can win the fight or not he is trained his former champ Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers) who teaches him how to regain his edge and take back the heavyweight title. Rocky III is not as good as # 1 but remains superior to parts # 2, # 4 and # 5 (The jury is still out on Rocky VI) mainly due to Mr. T who is easily the series' most enjoyable villain. Mr. T taunts, intimidates and overall demolishes Rocky for the first half and really it is quite believable on why Rocky might not want to get back in the ring. Still Rocky III suffers from some silliness such as the whole Hulk Hogan cameo as well as some philosophy from Carl Weathers but really Rocky III isn't bad as these things go and I for one quite enjoyed not only the fight but basically everything about it.* * * out of 4-(Good)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is pretty easy to comprehend. Rocky 3 deals with Rocky's fame and status rising after his second battle with Apollo Creed. After winning his 10th title defense, Rocky is challenged to a fight by the number one contender Clubber Lang (Mr. T). Micky reluctantly agrees to help him train for the last time. Mickey undergoes complications before the fight begins, which upsets Rocky. He wants to call off the fight, but Mickey tells him to go out and fight. Rocky's thoughts lie with Mickey as Clubber brutally defeats him in the second round. After the fight, Mickey dies. After the funeral, Rocky enters into a state of depression. Apollo Creed offers to help train Rocky and help him regain his edge. Not my favorite rocky movie, but definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw this as a wide eyed 10 year old child I remember rockin' out of the cinema pumped up and ready take on people out in the street as if I were 29. But watching Rocky 3 again now I'm amazed I missed its subtle subtext of homosexuality amongst American boxers. When Apollo Creed approaches Rocky in the romantically dimmed gym in the middle of the night and calls him "babe", I suddenly saw the film in a new light. Then when Rocky says "you got me curious" and they lovingly stare at each other quietly, I realized the writers were taking the boxing legend into a new ring. The scene of Rocky and Apollo jumping up and down in the ocean in slow motion together in high cut pants was also something I missed as a kid. Then the punchy hook, as Mr T arrives, a surefire symbol of Rocky's denied homosexuality. His playful banter with Rocky's wife, "I'll show you a real man". When Rocky finally summons the courage to face him after spilling his guts to his wife, Mr T says "I'm gonna touch you up" and Rocky says "Go for It!" I had no idea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone knows what happens in this third installment. Rocky starts out never fighting again, but a few scenes later, he manages to do one last fight. This time around Rocky fights Clubber Lang, and we already can assume what the end result will be.We know all of this, yet it's not that big of a deal. Sure we've seen it before, and we liked watching it back then. So this time we know where the good stuff will be. It's a solid movie to watch and not a bad way to kill some time.We all love to watch a good fight and this is no disappointment. The music does its job getting us into the movie as well. Nothing to be blown away by, but this movie is decent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the Heavyweight champion of the World, Rocky seems to have no peers. Until one Clubber Lang (a mean looking Mr. T) challenges Rocky to a fight. Rocky agrees and gets beaten. A rematch is unavoidable and this time Appollo Creed handles Rocky's training.Third time around? Why on earth not. It worked twice before and this time it works as well. Stallone manages to bring some freshness to the Rocky saga and it's all well played out. The leading characters are fleshed out a bit more and Stallone once again shows that he's quite the talented writer. Rocky's adversary, Mr. T, is more like a villain here than Appollo was in the previous two and Mr. T plays the part wonderfully. As before, the finale doesn't disappoint but it's not as spectacular as in the second.The entire cast do a good job as before, the training montage is great and I completely enjoy cheering Rocky on for the third time around.</fullReview>

There are a couple things that happen but i don't want to ruin the movie for you. i think that this one is very good it is in second place for me with parts 1 and 4 in first. If you have so far liked the series you will definitely like this one. Los of action with lots of drama in it. Go ahead and see this one you will enjoy it. All of the character are played with grace and style. If you want to see a very good drama slash action movie this one is great and you will greatly enjoy it. This movie gets nine out of ten possible starts strongly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A change of pace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this Rocky movie,Rocky is now the Heavyweight boxing champion of the world and is very popular all over the globe. Rocky now appears in commercials,magazines,guest on TV shows and interviews. But Rocky doesn't know a hungry contender is willing to show the world that Rocky's not the best fighter. Mickey (Rocky's manager-trainer-mentor) has watched this rising contender knocked out opponents within a drop of a hat. Mickey sees that this man means business,and at a ceremony he challenged Rocky. Rocky didn't have the hunger he use to have in his earlier days (Rocky 1&amp;2) and did not took his opponent seriously. This is similar to when Apollo was champion and fought Rocky for the first time. In this movie Mickey dies due to heart complications during the mayhem between Rocky and the new challenger Clubber Lang (as known to the world as Mr.T). Clubber was a street-wise brawler from Chicago and pounds on his opponents unmercifully. Now Rocky being unfocused and haven't trained properly eventually lost to Clubber Lang. But Rocky join forces with his old nemesis Apollo Creed to put Clubber away. The training scenes are the most rememberable part of the movie and how they bond so well together. Though I realize in this movie the only reason Apollo wanted to help Rocky was because Clubber disrespected Apollo before Rocky's first fight with Clubber. Being that he saw Rocky wanted to get back at Clubber Apollo wanted to involve himself with Rocky's training. Apollo was a hustler he talk to Rocky about not having the hungry while fighting Clubber Lang that he had when he fought him. He also made Rocky wear his boxing shorts he wore in the first movie,I guess it was to make him feel as if he was in the ring to fight Clubber. In the second round Clubber got the best of Rocky and Apollo yelled at Rocky as if he was losing the fight himself. That why Apollo said to him "you owe me a big favor",and that favor was to see if he and Rocky still had the "eye of the tiger".</fullReview>

Stallone is good here, the training sequences steal the show (as always), and Mr. T's role as Clubber is not bad, but the story becomes predictable by halfway.

		<fullReview>The third in the Rocky series was said to be good in this way and that, but I didn't see a lot of good things except for the fighting. This is the one that really told us that the Rocky series was going downhill if the continuous sequals didn't stop. Rocky happily holds his world heavyweight title, after defeating Apollo Creed it seems that Rocky is becoming a bit too civilised to be taking his fights carefully. He is intiminated by a loud mouthed heavy hitter named Clubber Lang (played very well by Mr. T) and fights him for the title. Mickey has a heart attack (one of the worst decisions in the whole series) and Rocky thrown off enough in the fight to lose his title. After, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) tries to coach Rocky and encourage him to get 'the eye of the tiger' back in his punches so he can get his Heavy weight championship back on his waist. Although the summary sounds interesting, the movie does not carry the right ingrediants well enough and what could have been great turns into something made to grab our money. Hulk Hogan makes an unnecessary cameo as Thunder Lips, a challenger for Rocky in an exhibition for charity. Not great, but if you want to see the series, or if you're in the mood for pretty good fighting, see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rocky 3 lacked the heart that made the first 2 Rocky movies so great, While in no way was Rocky 3 bad, it was entertaining but it just didn't have the heart the first 2 had.Sylvester Stallone once again is Writer/Director. After Rocky(Sylvester Stallone) won the heavyweight title, all is going good in his life.Paulie(Burt Young) is jealous of the success Rocky is having, after Paulie has a few words with Rocky, they make peace and Rocky gives Paulie a job to work in his corner.Rocky has won ten consecutive fights and lands lucrative endorsement deals.Rocky has also become a mega-star everybody knows who he is, he is famous world wide.But all the high points are taken away from his dedication to the ring.Meanwhile Clubber Lang(Mr.T) is an up and coming fighter who is winning fight after fight.While at a ceremony for Rocky, Clubber Lang shows up taunting the champ.Mickey(Burgess Meredith) does not want Rocky to fight Lang, but Rocky accepts the challenge from Clubber.Mickey though not happy with Rocky's decision to fight Lang trains him anyway.But this time Rocky doesn't train so hard, he has a public workout, and is more concerned about posing for pictures then actually training.Clubber Lang on the other hand is working hard to get in to top shape.Come fight night, on the way to the ring Rocky and Clubber have words and have to be pulled apart Mick who is not in the best health already is shoved by Clubber.Mickey has trouble breathing and cannot go to the ring to be in Rocky's corner.Rocky not in the best shape and worrying about Mick suffers a humiliating defeat at the hands of Clubber Lang.Once the fight is over Rocky goes back to his dressing room to see Mick.Mick nearing the end asks Rocky what happened in the fight, Rocky lies and says he won to make Mick feel better before he passes awayNow Rocky is down on his luck Mick's death plus the defeat to Lang sends Rocky in the crossroads.While at the Mick's Gym from the first 2 movies none other then Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers) shows up to talk with Rocky.Apollo wants to help Rocky win the title back, he explains to Rocky he knows how he feels, Creed tells Rocky he felt the same after he lost the belt to him.Apollo sees this has a great way to get back in the spotlight.But it becomes more then that for Apollo, Rocky was once an enemy but over the movie the two men forge a friendship.The training sessions go horrible at first, it's clear Rocky has lost his edge.After Rocky admits all his fears to Adrian(Talia Shire) she gives Rocky the encouragement he needs.Now Rocky is ready and has that edge back helping Apollo train Rocky is Duke(Tony Burton) who was Apollo's trainer in the first two movies.Come fight night Rocky is ready for Clubber Lang. In the dressing room Apollo gives Rocky his red white and blue trunks that he wore in the first fight with Rocky.I think we all know the outcome for the Rocky/Clubber fight.This time around Paulie is a lot more like-able then in the past films, he is sort of like Archie Bunker.Sylvester Stallone wrote a good script but not on par with the first two movies.Sly's Directing at times was a bit sloppy but still did a pretty good job.The scene with Adrian and Rocky on the beach where he confess his fears was a great scene Sly shows his talents once again as a Writer/Director and Actor.But just this time around Sly wasn't able to keep that up the whole film.Despite everything Rocky 3 was still a fun movie to watch just not on par with the first two moviesI give Rocky 3 6/10Wrestling legend Hollywood Hulk Hogan makes an appearance in the movie playing Thunderlips in a very cheesy scene</fullReview>

Now in this third installment at the beginning of the film he can be seen doing one successful TV commercial after another. Well how did he suddenly become so smart or at least smart enough to be able to film the TV advertisements that he couldn't do only a short while earlier? I guess all the extra punches in the head during his second Apollo Creed fight and his subsequent title defenses must have helped. Two more films followed this one but none even came close to the first, which won the Oscar for best picture in 1976.

		<fullReview>The Rocky films are excellent. And as much as I like the drama of the first two I have to admit that I love the sheer exhiliration of part 3 and 4. I love this film.Mr. T. is a bad-ass villain. When you move on from the original story and take away all that Apollo Creed was to Rocky, you have to present the audience with more danger than the other films had. And early on you learn to hate Clubber Lang simply for the fact that he wants to take away what Rocky has. If you can create hatred for a character even though he is not a bad man, that is good writing. Clubber Lang is the embodiment of hate even though what he represents is will, determination, an insatiable desire for fame and greatness and to win the heavyweight boxing title. How do you hate a character like that? Well for one, you make him grunt and spit his words out like venom. You make him snarl and use words like "sucka" and phrases like " pity the foo". And you have to give Mr. T. credit for portraying the role as well as he did.Rocky III is as high on the entertainment scale as you can go and the only film that supercedes it in terms of wanting the underdog to win at all costs, is Rocky IV. This is a great film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictions? Pain?Rocky III</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After all these years, I finally had the opportunity to watch my least favorite of the Rocky series, Rocky III, again. With the new installment, Rocky Balboa, having just reinvigorated my enjoyment in the saga, I couldn't wait to see a true tragedy with this one. I'll say that it did not end up that way entirely. I actually had a real good time watching it. Upon completion, I turned to my friends and said, "that wasn't as bad as I remembered." They replied by saying, "yeah, but I'm sure we didn't laugh that much the first time we saw it either." So, I am not going to declaring this a masterpiece by any means. Truthfully, the score I gave it from the memory of years back will stay the same. Maybe I would have increased it if the film's goal was to be a comedy, but since it tried to be a drama, it did ultimately fail.I give full credit to Sylvester Stallone. He wrote the original and ended up starring in it on more accident than anything else. He took that classic and turned it into a franchise beloved by many. This entry just has too much of its era on display?the 80's are in full force. I understand what he tried, showing how success and the Me-lifestyle of the decade turned a champ into a chump. Some really great stuff happens too: Mickey saying that he had been protecting him and keeping him out of contenders' grasps, Apollo Creed coming to his defense as a promoter, and Adrian stepping up and telling her husband how it is, despite her wanting him to retire. The bad just outweighs the good way too much. Between the circus in the hotel training facility, Hulk Hogan's embarrassing cameo, Mr, T's street version of Muhammad Ali trash-talk, Burt Young's ridiculous remarks at every turn, and Sly's new wardrobe, I shook my head in shame the whole time. The real travesty, though, is that Mickey had to go out in such an inferior product.Along with all the unintentional laughter, the re-training of Balboa at the hands of Creed and Duke?Carl Weathers and Tony Burton carry the film?is fantastic stuff. The montages are cheesy and each scene drips melodrama, but the thought is what counts. Making a slugger become faster and graceful is an interesting spin and makes perfect sense. Maybe Sly just needed a script doctor to hone his good ideas into a more enjoyable whole. As is, though, while the underlying themes and progression of the series is worthwhile, the fluff just drags it all down into the gutter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacks The Rocky Feel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original ROCKY and, to a lesser extent, ROCKY II, had a certain feel. You knew you were watching something special as the underdog of underdogs endeavored to bleed, sweat and punch his way to the impossible. You could relate to Rocky and da tings he was go-in chrew. He made you feel part of his experience.That sort of magic is absent in ROCKY III. It's not so much that Rocky has changed, though he has. When we first met him he was a nobody with nothing. In ROCKY II he was struggling to deal with being a somebody with lots of things. Though he tries to again make us believe he's a longshot, Stallone just can't pull it off this time because we know better. And it's not so much that the formula has changed, though it has. The first two films were not really boxing films at all, but human dramas we could all relate to whether we'd ever seen a punching bag or not. ROCKY III makes the mistake of being a boxing movie, largely pushing aside the human elements that made this character an icon.Well, actually, those factors probably do have something to do with it. As do the disappointing opening and closing matches. In the first, Rocky squares off against loud-mouthed wrestler Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan) in a charity bout. It ranks as the most embarrassing and bizarre occurrence of any ROCKY film as the Hulkster tosses Rock around and goes berserk. In the second, Rocky tries a new strategy of getting his opponent all worked up before delivering the finishing blows. The wonderful suspense of his first big fights are absent. Instead of standing up and cheering, we merely nod at the emergence of the obvious.Not that ROCKY III is an awful film. When critiqued on its own, forgetting thrills of the past, it certainly has worthwhile qualities. Stallone is good and honest as the hero, and Mr. T (in his film debut) is a treat as the over-the-top yet serious Clubber Lang. Rocky's use of his former rival, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), as his post-Mickey trainer is interesting, though of course the chemistry just isn't the same. And once again, the training sequences are inspiring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rocky III is great entertainment. Its less serious than the previous two, as Sylvester Stallone packs as much action as he can into its running time. This time Rocky is defeated in the ring by Clubber Lang played by Mr T who went onto greater fame in TV's The A team and Rocky has to get "The Eye of the Tiger" back to take him on again in a rematch. Without his beloved trainer Mickey who dies of a heart attack in a touching scene in his dressing room after his defeat. Appollo Creed now trains Rocky in an interesting twist as they were opponents in the first two films. This leads to the usual training sequence and massive fight at the end of the film. All in all a great film and a massive hit when it was released in 1982. It also contains the No 1 hit "Eye of the Tiger" by Survivor. A great Rocky film, and in my opinion it was even bettered by the next Rocky film, Rocky IV of course!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever switch on the first two films but still is a boxing soap opera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Years after defeating Apollo Creed, Rocky has successfully defended his title 10 times and is living well off commercials, endorsements and his charitable public image. However just off Rocky's radar, a hungry young fighter, Clubber Lang, is winning fight after fight by knock out. Sickened after a charity fight where Rocky takes on a wrestler in a comedy display, Lang challenges Rocky to a fight. Rocky loses his title during the bout and suffers a personal loss. With the help of Apollo Creed, Rocky seeks to get his hungry desire back and retake his title from Lang.Stallone shows that he can write soap opera easily and quite intelligently. Here the Rocky story is put on it's head and we see him growing old and successful. He is not as urgent and hungry for victory as he once was. This twist makes this more enjoyable than the second film as we get to see what happens to successes when they forget where they came from. In many ways this reflects what must have been going on in Stallone's head as his movie career progressed. It may not be a perfect comparison but it is more interesting than another copy.The soapy mush of the first two is toned down a bit here and replaced by the struggle to re-find the fire that made Rocky so strong. This way we get to know Rocky better and this journey is more interesting when he has to go back to go forward. At times the story is silly and the fight scenes aren't as good as the previous tow films, although the final fight still carries an emotional, if unrealistic, punch.Stallone is good, as he seems to bring a lot of himself to the role this time ? his experiences have changed as have Rocky's, he uses that. Shire's character has changed well and Young's character is more interesting than before. Mr T is good, at first he is sympathetic because he is the contender, however to make Rocky more popular he has to be really arrogant towards the end. Hulk Hogan makes a silly cameo that goes on to long and Burgess Meredith just seems to be getting more grouchy and wrinkled by the second.Overall this is good ? better than the second. The interest is renewed by the switch in Rocky from underdog to rich success pursued by young contenders. The mushy emotion is toned down and the good elements from the first two films are talked up. Solid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Rocky III" is a wildly - and inexplicably - entertaining film. The term "mindless fun", which is often used in describing movies like "Rambo III" that are actually mindless yawners, is a really accurate description of this particular film. Arguably the best in the series, this film is -and feels- "programmed". Even the human emotions are mostly forced. But Mr.T gives a dynamite, solid performance, and creates a really menacing opponent for Rocky. And Stallone is still excellent in the title role; his performances in the "Rocky" films make you wonder why he underestimates his abilities so much when he appears in pitiful films like "Cobra". The two major fights are very well-done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Manipulation and narcissism...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a director (especially one who directs himself), Sylvester Stallone shows no shame. He puts himself in front of the camera more than anybody else, sure--it's what "Rocky" fans want--but he's there to be pummeled and humiliated in close-up, to get his audience fighting mad. This way his revenge on the enemy will ultimately be that much more sweet. It's an old hat trick, passed down the Hollywood line, and Stallone doesn't even bother reinventing it, he just plows right ahead as if he were doing something new. Maybe he feels he's demonstrating a new form of manipulation, but it's hard to laugh it off when supporting players Talia Shire and Burt Young are used so pettily and cheaply (one big scene each). Stallone's Rocky Balboa matches jabs with Mr. T. as "Clubber Lang", who doesn't so much box as he does pound. This entry in the "Rocky" saga goes so far as to make Lang a killer. How's that for hedging your bets? *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stallone, and Rocky, go soft</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How ironic is this movie? Success goes to Rocky's head, and he loses his edge. The same could be said for Stallone, who was really adrift at this point. Rocky III is a big step down from the previous two movies, and even though I can see Stallone trying to make it great, he's not succeeding.Best part? Apollo Creed, of course. The segments in his dingy gym are really alive, and his motivational speeches are great. By comparison, Rocky's slow-talking, slow-thinking character is becoming tiresome. Worst part? Oh, for Heaven's sake, that Mr. T does not work at all. After topping a class act like Apollo, Rocky is beat by this dumb punk? Both fights are quick and one-sided - note how quickly Rocky thumps Clubber in the final battle, which is rather unsatisfying after his two epic clashes with Apollo.Nevertheless, I own this movie, because hey, it's Rocky and it's got rousing music and stuff. You could do worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why so serious?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Part 2, Rocky 3 starts off where the last movie left off, but things are totally different now. Rocky has the feel of a real person with a real, three dimensional life by now, but he's come a long way from the Rocky we knew in the first two movies. Most notably, he's RICH now. He has a genuine career going in full swing in boxing by now, and the first part of the movie is a montage of event fights, all of which he wins soundly and comfortably. He is a tremendous champion with 10 successful title defense fights and a whole list of corporate sponsors. Not surprisingly, he begins to feel overconfident and a little lazy.There is some ham-handed foreshadowing as we see clips of a concerned Mr. T in the audience at Rocky's fights, and it's not long before Clubber Lang (Mr. T) begins publicly insulting Rocky, challenging him to a fight and taunting him at press conferences. I'm curious about where Lang's anger comes from. He is clearly furious with Rocky, but we know nothing about him. We don't know anything about his past as a fighter other than what is passed on through dialogue, and the unsolved mystery surrounding his uncontrollable rage is probably the movie's only genuine fault.The important thing that we are told is that Lang is not a boxer, like Rocky, but a wrestler, so it's a completely different, ah, ball game this time. There is an interesting fight that Rocky has midway through the movie with a hulking giant (Hulk Hogan) curiously named "Thunderlips," in an illustration of what had become of his career. He had reached such a level of success that his fights became little more than performances put on to generate ticket sales, but Rocky's humanitarianism shows through, as he sometimes donates all proceeds, as in the case of the fight with Thunderlips, to various charities.But as always, Rocky maintains his laid back demeanor, letting the insults and taunts roll off his back, which is one of the qualities that has really allowed him to win so many hearts. But at an outdoor press conference, Lang taunts Rocky's wife, and he gets genuinely angry for the first time in the first three movies, other than the sudden tantrum he had in the first film when Mickey first asked to be his manager. After this, everything starts to fall apart. It turns out that his championship is not what he thought it was, and he is put into a position where he has to defend his wife's honor as well as his own, and to do that he has to fight a fighter that no one, including himself, really believes he can beat. True to his form, Mickey tells him, "This guy'll kill you to death inside of three rounds!"And there is no mistake to be made about that. Lang is absolutely a KILLER. This guy has no interest in getting a knockout, he doesn't even seem that interested in being recognized as the real champion, he just wants to hurt Rocky. Essentially Lang's role in the movie is to knock Rocky out of the rut of complacency that he has gotten into. Thunderlips was billed as nearly 7 feet tall and 390 pounds, which I think it roughly twice Rocky's size, and is clearly a wrestler and not a fighter, and yet Rocky was able to win a fight with him, so it's no surprise that he assumed the fight with Lang would be about the same.When they finally fight, Lang walks all over him, and Rocky realizes that he has gotten soft. Apollo Creed, by the way, is now a sportscaster, and becomes Rocky's trainer when they learn how tough Lang really is. The movie loses track a little when Apollo starts training Rocky like he's never been in a gym before, like he's a complete amateur. Yeah, he hasn't been losing much lately, but does that mean he hasn't set foot inside a gym in all those years? Doubtful, but nevertheless, it's great to see Rocky whipping himself back into shape and once again becoming that hardened hero that we have come to love. Although I have to admit, I loved the swimming scene. Rocky swims like my grandmother!There is one moment of almost unforgivable cheese when Rocky and Mickey have a heart to heart on the beach at sunset in which, for example, Rocky claims that he's really afraid for the first time in his life. Isn't that a direct quote from the first movie? There is notably more anger in part three than either of the previous movies, and while a second sequel runs a high likelihood of being the one that marks the first really noticeable turn downwards in the quality of the series (hear that, Terminator?), this one is no less watchable than the first two and, amazingly, neither is part 4. Well done!By the way, it's interesting that, at one point, a sportscaster notes just before a major fight, "The odds of Rocky making a comeback at 34 are long indeed!" Yeah, how about at 60?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I have seen all five of the first five in the series.We were fooled this time. It sounded like "Gonna Fly Now" would be played at the beginning, but it was just a song that sounded like that one. The new, almost equally worthy theme started up after that, with scenes from the life of Rocky Balboa (even "The Muppet Show"!) as well as highlights of the career of Clubber Lang. Survivor's theme was used for some training scenes later and, with a tiger growling, for the closing credits. Purists who wanted "Gonna Fly Now" get to hear it during some quite exciting training scenes, and played by a marching band early in the movie as Rocky's statue is unveiled.Was it as good as the others? Certainly none of the sequels matched the original, but this film held its own. For the first time, Rocky is faced with the prospect of actually having to retire. Clubber Lang is the fiercest, cruelest opponent yet. And, of course, with Mickey opposed to Rocky fighting this monster (and for another reason I'd rather not mention), Apollo Creed does the training this time, and Carl Weathers gives the movie's standout performance. In fact, this may have been the best of the movies for those who like him.The usual formula applies: need it be mentioned that Rocky can't win the first time? Or can he? Maybe Lang wants revenge. Can Rocky win the second time? Maybe.I'm not sure whether to call Mr. T a good actor. But he is definitely scary and menacing, always taunting, always acting like he can't be defeated. He just doesn't show a lot of range. And Muhammad Ali he's not--Ali had a kind side. One has to wonder if Lang ever had anyone care about him.Stallone gives a good performance here. He has to show doubt about whether he can continue. He certainly shows determination, and in some scenes where he should show fear, he doesn't. That is probably a good thing.Burgess Meredith is almost as good here as in the others, but he isn't in the movie much. Talia Shire has her share of good scenes too.Hulk Hogan is almost as menacing as T in the charity event, and one wonders how Rocky got out of that alive. Hogan's no actor, but his performance should satisfy fans of "rasslin". For those concerned that scene is too violent, Rocky's son does ask if Daddy is having fun. That should resolve any concerns.As for later, I guess it's up to parents if they want to watch two guys beating the you-know-what out of each other. That was never my favorite part of these movies.It's good enough to be part of the series.</fullReview>

Clubber Lang. Clubber is a tough fighter who can match Rocky's determination and strength. Rocky after losing the Eye of the Tiger faces Clubber and is beaten in the 2nd round. To make matters worse is trainer and friend Mickey Goldmill dies after suffering a heart attack during the fight. Then an unlikely allie steps forward to help Rocky train for the rematch with Clubber. Apollo Creed. After training with Apollo for a few weeks they are going no where because Rocky has lost the Eye of the Tiger. After a long talk with wife Adrian Rocky regains his Eye of the Tiger and starts training with renewed energy. Then Rocky meets Clubber in a heart pounding fight.

		<fullReview>**1/2 out of ****The third installment in the Rocky series is an entertaining one, but it's apparent that almost all of the heart of the first two movies is gone. This is a bigger, slicker, and more formulaic Rocky movie. It begins with, to the song "Eye Of The Tiger", a montage showing us Rocky successfully defending his title and at the same time, letting fame go to his head. He is, soon enough, brought down from his cloud by number one contender Clubber Lang, well played by Mr.T in his first movie role. Soon tragedy befalls Rocky, inside the ring and outside, and the only man who can help him is his old nemesis Apollo Creed. Once again, almost everyone from the previous one is back, with a humorous cameo from Hulk Hogan, but this time around they don't seem as into it and sort of run through the motions. And once again, Sylvester Stallone writes and directs, with weaker results in both areas. Also, some of the directing suggests that Sly was watching too many psychological thrillers at the time this movie was made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bold, pumped-up sequel finds Stallone having just shocked the world by becoming the new heavyweight champion. He quickly earns fame and fortune as the champion but also gets a big head, loses the edge that drove him to victory in the first place, and eventually drops the title in a humiliating defeat to the trash-talking and robust challenger Clubber Lang (Mr. T). In order to redeem himself and reclaim the 'eye of the tiger,' Rocky acquires the services of former rival and recently retired ex-champion Apollo Creed to train him for a do-or-die rematch. We've seen it before, but it works thanks to a gritty and energetic story that packs a much harder punch than the previous predecessor. Stallone is in good form and the finale is over-the-top. ***</fullReview>

This time Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) first fights against wrestler, then against boxing number 1 ranked killer and loses. Mickey dies and Rocky gets help for training from his old enemy Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers). They train and Rocky wins. In Rocky III the cape of the opponent has taken creep named Clubber Lang, who has been performed by great Mr. T. This is the same what in the first and the second film. If sadistic fighting scenes interestes you, there is plenty of them. 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Rocky III' is the third part in the Rocky story. This is the part where they should have stopped, after this film. (It does have some good moments, but it is not nearly as good as the previous two.) It goes all downhill from here on out. After the death of a dear friend and personal trainer, Rocky and Apollo team up together to train Rocky to get him back competing. This is a story about loss and about trying to get back onto one's feet again after dealing with loss. It's a touching story, but I don't think it is as strong, and I do not think the fighting scenes and the production was as good as the second one. See it if you are a fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Rocky film was the real start of the decline of the series. Although a watchable film and Mr.T does make it a lot of fun it still lacks the power and performances of the first 2 movies. Mr. T as clubber Lang plays a vicious boxer who is almost a sadist in the boxing ring and he temps Rocky out of retirement to fight him. There are of course the corny Rocky moments we have become use to with the soundtrack rock music playing with Rocky training in the old gym. Anyway, Rocky does come back and fights Clubber Lang and takes a punch that under normal conditions would kill a human being. But hey Rocky is used to getting hit a lot as he always allows himself to. In any case Rocky is approached by Apollo Creed and is told he lacks the eye of the tiger and offers to train him....Yawn. Should I go on. Well, Rocky fights Clubber Lang again and of course wins and has his cheesy speech at the end with wife and kid crying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rocky franchise died with the first. There can be no others, as a matter of continuity. "There ain't gonna be no rematch." Remember that? And, yet, there was. That was the pinnacle of the story, breaking the Creed's will. This was never about winning, so much as not giving up. But, whatever.If there was going to be a second addition, this should have been it. With Clubber holding the title and Rocky determined to take it. That would have been fine, but, no...Sly wanted riches. I can relate.Now, if you can forgive all that, there is fun to be had. It comes by way of Clubber Lang, the most awesome character of all Rocky's opponents. MR T plays this role very well; his best performance of that era. Without Clubber, however, Rocky III does not stand all that well.Although it is the most fun of the franchise, it is a miss in any other capacity.</fullReview>

The fact that Mr. T did not win (and Wasn't EVEN NOMINATED for) an Oscar for this film is a modern day tragedy. Rocky III is by far the best of the Rocky movies. It is definitely an epic film. The only drawback is the horrid Talia Shire rears her ugly head once again as Adrian. However, this can easily be over looked by the greatness that is Mr. T.In fact, someone should have given Clubber Lang his own spin off movie. Now that would have been a movie. But I digress.

		<fullReview>And so to the third Rocky in which a complacent Stallone has grown fat on opulence and celebrity and finds himself unprepared for the hungry and you'd have to say insane challenger, Clubber Lang, none other than Mr.T in the first role of a surprisingly undistinguished movie career. Rocky's beaten naturally because his cheque book isn't quite strong enough to cushion Lang's punches and even worse, Lang has roughed up trainer Mickey and caused him to have a fatal heart attack. Such setbacks would dampen the spirits of lesser men and sure enough Balboa slips into a depression and something of an existential crisis. Thankgoodness then for old adversary, turned friend Apollo Creed who tells Rocky to pick himself up, read up on Tigers and take himself to the beach for a bit of homo-erotic horseplay, then on to the ring to teach the new champ a damn good lesson...Rocky III may be a comment on the promise of the American ideal corrupted by its vast wealth and unrestrained capitalism. Then again that could be nonsense. In Rocky you've got the embodiment of the American dream gone soft and no longer possessing the spirit that was the source of his power and influence. He's reduced to commercial endorsements and expensive suites and even more embarrassingly, Wrestling Exibition fights. He's lost his heart and his self-respect, y'know the kind you only have when you're poor and he needs to get it back because at this point there's still an hour of the film left. The third film is a bit of a weird one because though perfectly watchable its got moments of supreme silliness. All of a sudden Rocky can't get anywhere near a ring without oiling himself up. Creed seems obsessed with the tie-in track and mentions it every five minutes and we learn that the only way to get your respect back is to do imitations of wild animals and jump about in the sand with the spray of the ocean suggestively foaming all over you. We're left with this rather strange situation in which the film is softened by the same commerical pressures that Rocky himself proved susceptible too. It's Rocky now as franchise - product and as a result there's none of the dramatic pretencions of early movies. It's strictly formula which is fine but it might leave you wondering where the series could go after this. Well Russia of course!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The series gets a lot weaker with this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rocky saga continues with Sylvester Stallone in the director's chair again for Rocky III. Keeping with the Rocky formula, Rocky III opens with the end of Rocky II, where Rocky wins the fight against Apollo Creed and claims the heavyweight champion title. We then jump forward three years with the help of your typical Rocky montage where Rocky becomes a huge celebrity and the absolute pride of Philladelphia. However, when a new young challenger comes along, Rocky has no choice but to face him. This challenger? None other than Clubber Lange, played by the infamous Mr. T in his film debut. In the fight Rocky takes a brutal beat down from Clubber, and afterwards looks to former rival, Apollo Creed to train him in order to restore his confidence.I have to admit, for me, watching a Rocky film is a lot of fun. It's empowering, inspiring, and always seems to be a great experience. But, as much as I enjoy a good Rocky flick I can't deny that Rocky III is a pretty half hearted attempt. It feels shoddily thrown together in an attempt to churn out another run of the mill story. The film's flow seems too sped up and doesn't go deep at all. It has some good heartfelt moments, but overall just feels very phoned in. The Rocky films seem to get progressively more predictable and less original. Rocky III offers up nothing new, and it's where the series redundancy really starts to show. I won't say that the previous two films suffer from the third, but Rocky III is definitely very forgettable.Of course, the film isn't without a few good things. You can expect to see some of your favorite things about Rocky films in Rocky III. You'll be treated to some great montages, even though this film has a total of three I believe, and for a 100 minute runtime this is sort of overdoing it. We also get to see the characters of Rocky, Adrian, and Apollo grow and mature to continue to be ever fascinating characters. Kudos go to Sylvester Stallone to keeping his characters fresh, it's just a shame he couldn't do the same with the storyline. Also, as with the previous two Rocky films, you can expect a rousing climax in Rocky III. It's inspiring and empowering to watch Rocky fight at the end of the film, and it almost makes you forget how mediocre the rest of the film is.All in all, don't expect much from Rocky III. It's the weakest of the first three films by a long shot, but if you enjoyed the first two then I would say give this one a shot if you haven't satisfied your Rocky fever quite yet. It's not a disaster, but Rocky III is pretty underwhelming.</fullReview>
