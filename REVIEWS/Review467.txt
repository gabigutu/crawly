		<shortDescription>A very worthy attempt at bringing the Amy Winehouse story to the screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when Amy Winehouse died back in 2011 it had a certain inevitability about it yet was still shocking and very sad. The media had made a meal out of her problems documenting them at every given opportunity and her increasingly emancipated appearance was publicised for all to see, courtesy of the lowlifes of the paparazzi. Hers was life in a goldfish bowl by the end and for a person who never wanted fame in the first place; this made her life all the more difficult. What complicated matters so fatally was that in amongst all of this, she had a predisposition for drink and drugs. The combination sent her spiralling on a downward trajectory.This documentary about her has been made by Asif Kapadia who directed the film Senna (2010) which remains one of the most highly respected documentaries of recent years. When you consider that that film was also about someone at the top of their field who died young in a dramatic and sudden manner, you could say that there are some similarities between both stories. But in reality the Amy Winehouse story is a much darker one, with its central character going on an extended path of self-destruction. And one in which we in the audience know only too well how it ends. The film is made up of home video and TV clips of Winehouse and fills in details with recollections of people who were close to her in the form of voice-overs, as opposed to a more traditional talking heads format. After the release of her definitive album Back to Black in 2006, Winehouse basically retreated and conducted next to no interviews which of course posed the film-makers some problems and the effect is that as the film goes on she becomes increasingly remote and we feel like we know her less.The contrast between the Amy of the early years to the one latterly seen is pretty pronounced. Her appearance became more intense and she quickly covered herself with an assortment of harsh tattoos. This phase coincided with her downward spiral with drink and drugs. It seems pretty clear that her attachment to her husband Blake Fielder was inextricably linked to this. He came across as a hanger-on who led her onto hard drugs and who then had little self-interest in getting her off them. The problem was that she loved him and it was this that made the situation so destructive. Throughout the film, as her songs play, her lyrics are displayed on screen and it is obvious that much of her music was based on highly personal emotional songs that constantly were sourced from her experiences in relationships. So much of her success was derived from this well of emotion but it was one that could equally destabilise her. This was only exacerbated by her bouts of depression and her problematic relationship with her dad.There is no getting away with the fact that this is a sad story; one that is all the more shaming when you consider that it played out so visibly in the public eye. But the public eye is very uncaring unfortunately and all too often empathises when it is far too late. But this film also captures the voice and the humour, so integral to Amy Winehouse. And so while it is impossible to ignore the tragedy, the beauty is here too. This was, after all, a very singular artist whose roots were in jazz, which is hardly a music for lightweights. Amy Winehouse was a proper talent who made music entirely on her own terms. If I was to criticise mildly it would be to say that the film itself might be marginally too long and perhaps goes over some ground more than it has to. But mainly this is ultimately a very worthy attempt to tell what is a complex and contrasting story to the screen with all its darkness and light.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extraordinary film, one of the most powerful I've seen in years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>haunting, heartbreaking and stunningly brilliant film from Senna director Asif Kapadia, which takes us into the confidence of Amy Winehouse, as the bolshy, big-voiced, jazzy Jewish girl from North London becomes a megastar, while her personal demons, her relationship with a drug addict, and a ravenous, amoral press proceed to rip her to shreds.Thanks to an abundance of revelatory home video footage, soundtracked by incisive interviews, we see her not only as the beehived, cat-eyed chanteuse or the alarmingly ribbed tabloid quarry, tumbling out of a club at 3am, but as a shy, spotty teen with a seductive offhand confidence in her vocal gift.I'm not an enormous fan of Winehouse's music, I think because her deeply personal writing and distinctive, expressive voice tended to be masked by such contrived, Americanised pastiche ? trading first on '30s jazz and then '60s girl groups ? but the portrait that emerges here is uncompromising, thrilling and frequently devastating: of an unhappy girl equipped with a massive talent, but none of the stability or serenity to deal with the perpetual media storm that her success brought upon her.We see stand-ups and TV presenters laughing at her bulimia and drug abuse, her management pushing her out of rehab and onto foreign stages, and ? in the second half ? a rapacious, vulturous paparazzi incessantly stalking her, an essential decency chillingly absent. If that was my job, I think I would struggle to watch this film and think: "Yes, what I am doing with my life is essentially fine."By contrast, Kapadia's film is quite beautifully lacking in sensationalism. Though it essentially doubles an indictment of a society almost entirely lacking in basic compassion and empathy, it's a work that possesses both virtues in apparently limitless amounts, surely compressing and simplifying an impossibly complex narrative, but attaining something that seems awfully like the truth ? and apparently is, according to her closest friends.Amy is a tough watch, but it feels essential, not just for its vivid picture of a fascinating, deeply troubled young woman, but also for its wider significance: as a plea for people to stop being so horribly selfish, to stop seeing excess and illness as 'rock and roll' and drug abuse as a joke, and for the media to realise that if it wants to paint itself as a crusading Fifth Estate, then some basic humanity wouldn't go amiss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who killed Amy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cover story of this week's edition of music magazine NME is: 'Who killed Amy?' It would have been a perfect title for this superb documentary. I went to see it, hoping it would answer two questions. One: could Amy Winehouse's death have been prevented in any way? Two: if so, by whom? The film provides crystal clear answers to both questions. One: no, it probably couldn't have been prevented - at best it could have been postponed. Two: several members of her entourage have probably contributed to her downward spiral. Her father, who wasn't there when he should be and was there when he shouldn't. Her husband, who encouraged her drugs abuse and seems to be an utterly despicable person. And the press, who relentlessly haunted her and enjoyed every misstep in her life. But the documentary also makes one thing very clear: in the end there's only one person responsible for Amy Winehouse's death: Amy Winehouse.Apart from providing a stunning insight in Winehouse's short life and career, 'Amy' is also a great movie from a cinematographic perspective. The unique feature is that it consists almost entirely of existing footage. It's absolutely incredible what the film makers (with the help of the Winehouse family) have unearthed. Lots of home videos, from her youth as well as from her later life, interviews, recording sessions, telephone conversations, even voice mail messages. Sometimes it almost feels uncomfortable to view images, clearly made for personal use, on a giant screen. But they are extremely revealing. There were numerous moments when I felt like saying: wow! The very first moments of the film are almost worth the ticket price. We see an amateur home video of a birthday party: 14 year old girls giggling and fooling around, until suddenly one of them starts singing 'Happy Birthday' with a voice and technique that seem to belong to Sarah Vaughan or Ella Fitzgerald. We also see Winehouse commenting after her first single has sold 800 copies, we see a hilarious scene during a holiday in Spain, but we also see her waving a bag of marijuana in front of the camera, we see her arguing with her father, visiting her incarcerated husband, and in one haunting scene, lying on the floor in what seems a drunken stupor.'Amy' tells an extremely sad story. It's told in all honesty: it shows how incredibly talented Winehouse was, and how dedicated to her music, but also how insecure and self-destructive. When one of her childhood friends tells how she felt when, in the end, Winehouse wasn't her old self anymore, she almost starts sobbing in the microphone. I have no doubt each and every one in the cinema theatre felt the same way after seeing this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartbreaking and captivating depiction of the life of an incredible talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fascinating and heartbreakingly sad and dark depiction of the life of a brilliant singer. It's a touching testament to Winehouse's career, relationships and ups and downs, and it takes a very dramatic but powerful approach to telling the story in Asif Kapadia's inventive documentary style.Kapadia directed my favourite film of all time, Senna, which I have, after countless viewings, found to be incredibly powerfully emotional, consistently exciting and, most of all, stunningly original.Originality is a hard thing to come by in the documentary genre, but Kapadia, in both Senna and Amy, uses this fascinating style of presenting a documentary in the form of a narrative drama to make it a more engrossing and captivating experience, something that works so well, and makes for an absolutely brilliant watch.The story of Amy Winehouse is a bittersweet one, and this film does that reality justice. On the one hand, it does a fantastic job of showing her fun-loving and upbeat personality in the years before the health problems started, and it really gives you a lasting image of a completely different Amy Winehouse to the one that almost lived in infamy towards the end of the 2000s.However, on the other hand, this film is quite brutal and dark to watch due to its very realistic depiction of the impact of drugs, drinking and bad relationships on her life. In the second act of the film, Kapadia does a stunning job of showing how Winehouse's life completely disintegrated due to all of these problems, and it is a truly striking thing to watch.Despite the darkness of that part of the story, one thing that remains positive throughout is how the film celebrates Winehouse's incredible talent for jazz singing. It interlinks the events of her life with her earliest and most famous singles and turns them into strongly symbolic demonstrations of her deepest emotions and thoughts.Overall, this is a brilliantly intriguing documentary that will move you to the core. It uses a fantastically inventive narrative style to create a powerful story that shows so clearly the bittersweet nature of the life of an amazing singer.www.themadmovieman.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's not to love about Amy? Her death!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You should be tougher mum, you're not strong enough to say stop." Amy Winehouse Don't we all wish this gifted British jazz singer had heeded her advice to her beloved mother? But she didn't and lost her young life to drugs, alcohol, relentless fame, and a father, husband, manager and a whole menagerie of hangers on, whose motives were suspicious at the least. Or, maybe I should say her father, Nick, is only the most obvious sinner as he gains a reality TV show and allows his daughter to perform even in the face of her decline.Although Amy the documentary doesn't give anyone a pass, it does show Amy's slow descent into dependencies that can only in the end be characterized as her own. The strength of the doc, however, is not to blame everyone except by implication and their very words, some of which are voiced over rather than through boring talking heads.The first half of the film is a glorious catalogue of her young days at home and then early on singing jazz. Her tight dresses and fab legs don't even distract when we watch the essence of soul emerge out of her voice and face. Even I, barely knowledgeable in the genre, could spy greatness in her every breath.As if to remind us of her genius, she comes back from rehab to briefly exonerate herself by singing a duet with Tony Bennett. Her diffidence with that icon next to her is as endearing as it is appropriate, given his stature in the business and her relative inexperience. Yet, Bennett himself acknowledges her gifts and compares her to the greats like Ella Fitzgerald.Amy is director Asif Kapadia's unforgettable achievement, one of the finest music documentaries ever. However, it is not an easy ride, especially when we can feel ever so slightly complicit as we contribute to the crushing adulation of celebrity and unvarnished love of capitalism. Some like Amy Winehouse need to back away from both before it kills them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic, Honest and Raw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best documentaries that I have seen because its not meant to be flashy and "entertaining". It is a very honest and emotional movie with personal clips that show her rise to fame and her feelings about it. One of the biggest reasons why I loved it was because all the different sides of her life were presented in the movie. I loved how all the opposing sides agreed to come together and make this amazing movie. Her parents, managers, ex husband were all included, even though they probably hate one another in real life. I also liked how they included full songs in the documentary. I was a big fan of Amy Winehouse before but this movie made me appreciate her personality and clever poetry. Highly recommended. trust.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A whole new Amy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary is presented in an unusual way: using only footage of Amy's home videos, photos, interviews, live performances and voice-overs only for interviews from Amy and the people who knew her best. It certainly makes a nice change from the numerous camera interviews, mixed with footage of the documentary's subject. It's intimate, raw, sympathetic and heartbreaking. With so much footage of her, in the end, you feel like you really knew her. And it's absolutely gut-wrenching when she dies. Amy's father Mitch was very critical of the movie, saying it put him in a bad light. But in truth, he already did that himself. Although the film shows him as a loving father that wants what's best for Amy, it does show him as someone who could have done more for her. Other times, he takes a misstep in trying to get his daughter off drugs, such as insisting she doesn't go to rehab the first time, then the second time allowing both her and her drug addicted husband Blake (I curse the day she ever met him) to go clean in the same clinic, which results in them going on a horrific binge later. And another, such as bringing in a horde of cameras on holiday, when the entire purpose was for Amy to get away from all of the cameras and publicity. Like Kurt Cobain, she was a fragile human being who couldn't handle the fame. If one doesn't have it in their blood to withstand the pressure, they won't survive. Tragically, neither Kurt nor Amy could handle it.This brilliant bio-doc paints an entirely different picture of Amy Winehouse, other than the nasty tabloids story that hampered her over the years. The tense moments when the paparazzi assaults Amy whenever she goes out got me really annoyed. This picture is one of a loving, talented, rebellious, music loving young Jewish girl - caught up in the dangerous parts of the music industry and ultimately crippled by addiction. 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Amy': A Brief, Sad Journey Worth Taking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Amy" is a sledgehammer 2015 documentary portrait of Grammy-winning British pop singer and songwriter Amy Winehouse that gives new, poignant and heartbreaking meaning to the phrase, "Hello, I must be going."Even though we begin watching this film knowing that Winehouse died in 2011 at the age of 27 from alcohol poisoning, by the time we reach its conclusion we find ourselves praying that the ending will be different, that she will still be around when we leave the theater.We've taken a revealing, involving, moving journey that we don't want to end.Director Asif Kapadia opens the film with Winehouse, about 14 at the time and living in suburban northwest London, mugging on video with some friends, including her lifelong buds Juliette Ashby and Lauren Gilbert, apparently at the birthday party of one of those girls. When Amy opens her mouth to sing, effortlessly, "Happy Birthday," and the rich, low tones of a Judy Garland mixed with the soulful, meaning-packed wail of a Billie Holiday come out, we get the director's point instantly: This was an entertainer for the ages.Using more than 100 interviews artfully mixed with archival footage that ranges from childhood home movies of Winehouse to performances both personal and public, "Amy" will satisfy her fans while informing those not familiar with her work how very much they missed.Among those interviewed are Winehouse's manager, Nick Shymansky _ who took on the singer when she was 16 and he was only 19 _ Yasiin Bey (also known as Mos Def), iconic singer Tony Bennett (shown in a tender, heartrending recording session with Winehouse), her father Mitchell Winehouse (in a slashing mini-portrait of a parent gone awry), pals Ashby and Gilbert, and music executives, her ex-husband, a boyfriend, a publicist and a one-time bodyguard.You'll also see here the likes of Jay Leno, who welcomed her with open arms on his "Tonight Show" when she was at the top of her game, but had no qualms about shafting her later in his monologue when she was having problems with drugs. Heartless and shameful don't begin to cover it.Leno's use _ and discarding of _ Winehouse also is a stark metaphor for how her peers and the public alike seem to use then trash celebrities at times when they most need us as fellow human beings.Hearing Winehouse bounce through her song "Rehab," which opens with the lyric "They tried to make me rehab but I said 'No, no, no,'" is an ugly reminder of how troubled she was and how neglectful and complicit we all were in not insisting more be done for her."Amy" is important both in setting the record straight about Winehouse and also in warning us not to commit the same grievous mistake with yet another celebrity.("Amy," which has a running time of 2 hours and eight minutes, is rated R _ under 17, requires accompanying parent or adult guardian _ and contains drug and alcohol use.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this at the NXNE festival in Toronto last night. The movie was quite long, I must admit I was exhausted when I left. Not in a negative way, but overwhelmed at everything I had seen. The director had a lot of material to give us and he didn't hold back. The scene that I found the most powerful was the one in the recording studio with Tony Bennett, it was pure magic. I can't say that I followed Amy Winehouse, or was very familiar with her work, other than the song 'Rehab'. I did love her hairdo, it reminded me of the Ronettes. I am always fascinated by artists and how they develop.We get a close up of Amy's artistic process. Her power was in her ability to constantly come up with song material that resonated with her at the deepest level and put those words to music. Combine this with a unaffected personality and an amazing ability to connect with an audience and you have a true force of nature. On the negative side, she had to deal with her personal daemons from her childhood. The tragedy was her use of drugs and alcohol. One gets the feeling from the movie of an almost inevitability of her path, but I guess that is always debatable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Amy" The Amy Winehouse Documentary is brilliant. It's sad, depressing, interesting and very insightful. You feel like a fly on the wall as you watch raw video footage throughout that shows you that there were various factors that lead to her Drug addiction and untimely death. It shows you that she wasn't just a dumb junkie but from a young age she was a very mentally troubled person. She had a lack of discipline at a young age. Her Father neglected her as a child. But he had no problem using her as a meal ticket once she became famous. She had various mental issues such as depression and bulimia. Whilst I don't condone Drugs the doc does show you how and why people try and get hooked on them. The Doc is very fair in showing the good side and bad side of Amy. Ultimately it leaves it up to you to make your own judgement about her. My only gripe is that Amy's final Boyfriend Reg Traviss isn't in it at all. This is a huge omission considering he was with her until she died. Overall it is an amazing documentary that is thought provoking and will create a debate between people. RIP Amy 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Amy' Is a fantastic documentary about one of the Great Jazz Vocalists!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amy Winehouse might have been one of the best all time jazz singers in the world. In fact, I believe she still can hold that title, even almost five years after her death. Her voice was something unlike anyone ever heard and could be in the same league as Etta James, Billie Holiday, and Edith Piaf. In addition to her voice, she was charming, witty, and a ton of fun to be around. You just couldn't get enough of her likable personality. Unfortunately in 2011, Amy died of alcohol poisoning at the age of 27, making her one of the latest members of the '27 club', which Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Kurt Cobain, Jim Morrison, and Brian Jones all belong to.It's a very sad story, which director Asif Kapadia ('Senna') tells perfectly through only home video footage and present day voice interviews with those closest to the talented singer. Amy's parents, friends, and management company allowed for all of the intimate concert footage, behind the scenes footage, and the rare home movies to be showed here, however, Amy's parents are not too happy now, once they've seen the final product. This makes me laugh, because her parents aren't exactly good people, and were mostly responsible for her downfall.Simply titled 'Amy', we get a glimpse of Amy's life before she made it famous. She sure was a lot of fun, as we see her hanging out with friends and being a little ham at birthday parties or even pretending to give a house tour as a Spanish maid. It was quite funny. Even though it was later in her young life where the paparazzi were all over her 24/7, her friends and family had a camera in front of her, before she got famous, and even then, we could have seen how talented and fun she was.With interviews with her own parents, closest friends, and even Mark Ronson, Salaam Remi, Yassin Bey, Tony Bennett, and Questlove, we see through the eyes of those near her, what life was like. Even her awful human being of a lover she kept, Blake Fielder is interviewed here, and he is as atrocious as he was ten years ago, without a remorse for anything related to Amy or in life really. Once she started seeing the druggie Fielder, is where things started slowly going downhill, which is where this documentary turns to a more somber note.Don't get me wrong, Amy could have changed her ways, or even gotten better help, but she didn't know how to. And nobody close to her really was telling her "no", especially her parents. We all know how everything turned out, as it was widely reported in media. It's heartbreaking. But nobody can deny that she was one of the best jazz vocalists to have ever lived. Her almost instant rise to super stardom caused a lot of problems, because all she wanted to be was a normal person without all of the cameras in her face. 'Amy' is a solid tribute film to Amy Winehouse, one that she would be proud of, warts and all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moving but Harrowing Documentary on a gifted but fragile talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Amy', a documentary on the late British jazz/soul singer Amy Winehouse,is totally compelling and absorbing from first to last shot,though anyone with a human heart beating as I try would acknowledge it is very difficult and harrowing to watch.Around a decade ago,I worked as a mobile DJ for three years,and in the midst of having to play prosaic,corporate and assembly-line produced music,Amy Winehouse was the one artist I had time for;her compositions and lyrics had a quirky,original style about them helped along by her husky,soulful voice.I don't think that 'Amy' is exploitative at all;it is actually very respectful if not reverent of her considerable talent,rare then and now in an era when individuals with the slightest smidgen of talent compared to her are absurdly hyped by PR agencies,trashy celeb mags and tabloids beyond their real worth.It would have been disingenuous if it had not looked into the full story of her deep problems with depression,bulimia and substance abuse.The break-up of her parents' marriage and their faults in nurturing had an undoubted effect;to be put on anti-depressants as she was in mid-adolescence was the first of many misguided decisions taken by those surrounding her or by the singer herself.She wasn't interested in being famous as she thought she would not be able to handle such attention;singing jazz standards in small clubs would have been the ideal living for her.keeping a low profile from the limelight,but such was her talent that various managers,record execs and promoters promised her wealth and greater opportunities which she succumbed to.It was made obvious in the film that all those closest to her (with a few honourable exceptions) either didn't realise or care that Amy was a very vulnerable,troubled young woman,frail emotionally and physically,and by the time the damage had been done it was too late to save her.Her father comes across as more misguided and foolish than nasty;her husband and various other seedy hangers-on like managers,promoters,paparazzi and the like are genuine villains however,using her status,talent and wealth for their own ruthless self-interest,indifferent to the negative effect it was having on Amy,who was too incredulous and naive to perceive how she was being exploited.The saddest scene of all was towards the end at a concert in Belgrade;clearly in no fit state to perform,all she could do was either put her arms round various colleagues and associates on stage or alternatively sit down and do nothing;with her being subject to boos and catcalls while at the eye of the storm was heartbreaking to watch,as indeed most of the film was;the brief moments of glory were saved at award ceremonies and while she performed her best known works in the recording studio,notably with her idol Tony Bennett,a genial,affable presence who in the end seemed to be more in awe of her than vice versa.Perhaps it was unwise to show pictures of her in the worst stages of her drink and drug abuse;make-up horribly splattered across her face,later looking a skeletal,haunted wraith which were profoundly shocking.All in all,the film does not moralise or judge but leaves the viewer to make up their own conclusion;my own is that Amy would have been happy earning a modest living as a jazz/soul singer in equally modest clubs or venues,and that her considerable emotional problems from her teenage years were either ignored or disregarded by too many people around her,which in the end proved too much with her ravaged,frail body unable to cope.The story is nothing short of tragic,and Asif Kapadia has crafted a shattering but deeply moving documentary that dramatises the deep despair but also celebrates the talent of Amy Winehouse as fully and sincerely as possible.RATING:8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't know much about Amy Winehouse. I feel so sad for her. The two men she looked up to the most in her life totally failed her; her husband and her father. I got choked up at the end when Tony Bennet said (and I paraphrase) " ... life will teach you how to live ... if you live long enough to learn." She was an old person in a young body so super talented. It upsets me when people were making fun of her problems. She was sick and needed help. I think she was close to making it out of her funk. But her addictions killed her in the end. Why didn't someone save her from herself? So many people in her close circle loved her so much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not an easy watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Amy' (the film) highlights the obvious perils of pop music fame, sex, drugs, alcohol and every rock n roll cliché, with one main underlying current. No matter how great the person, how strong the voice, how catchy the songs, if the people closest to you aren't playing with a straight bat, you're in trouble. Alcohol and drugs played a massive part in Amy's demise, the film will also let you draw your own conclusions on who else was responsible and why she was allowed to get to such levels of addiction and despair before any real help was forthcoming. Watching 'Amy' is a macabre experience as you allow yourself to smile during her pre-headline innocent years. I find myself waiting for the dark days, not wanting to get attached to the upbeat teenage jazz singer smiling at me from the HD cinema screen. Early live footage reveals just what a talent in waiting AW was, young, confident, funny and a voice that could floor an elephant. But behind the scenes we learn of her bulimia, father Mitchell's infidelity, her mothers lack of control and how the pair's lack of any parental discipline molded her own life. Enter Blake Fielder-Civil, the love of her life, her dark inspiration. The relationship with Blake is laid out in all it's distressing glory. Blake confesses to introducing Amy to Crack, Coke and Heroin, a regular user himself before they paired up. Then he left her for his previous girlfriend, leaving Amy an emotional and physical wreck. Friends and managers begged her to go to Rehab, she left the final decision to her father, who said she didn't need it. A hit song was born and her life as we see, is ended. The missed window of opportunity of getting Amy into rehab early in her addictions proved a massive turning point in her life, personally and professionally. Chart success on both sides of the pond, reconciliation and marriage to Blake, Grammy's, artistic recognition and a house in Camden, for a time she thought she had everything she had ever wanted. Then the footage becomes harder to watch as Amy deteriorates. She becomes a Red top superstar, each disaster spread out for the nations titillation. If handled correctly Blake going to jail could have been the saving of her, for a time she was clean then plummeted. Footage of a one off concert in Serbia, (possibly the most ill advised trip since Hitler's winter invasion of Russia). Amy makes it on stage but refuses to sing, a drunk, stumbling, shambolic mess, it's not easy to watch. In fact it's utterly depressing. The films final shots of a body bag leaving her Camden home put a rotten cherry on this whiskey and coke soaked cake. Ultimately 'Amy' is a painfully insightful film, Blake and Mitchell may want to avoid it, they are (rightly or wrongly) cast as the villains, a pair of emotional and financial vampires. Their misplaced arrogance in interviews does nothing to help their cause. Amy Winehouse was one of the most original female artists this country has ever produced, period. She deserved, in life and love, better.Guy Shankland 16/07/15</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blew me away. essential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>AMY was quite something, really affected me. 10 out of 10.Tony Bennett quoted in this outstanding documentary. ''Slow down, you are too important. Life teaches you really how to live it if you can live long enough''.That quote is something I intend to follow. The scene where Amy sings with Tony is remarkable, her singing with her idol. really touching.I always felt Amy's voice and now I can see her shining talent as a lyricist too. Such a strong mature voice yet such a fragile person. Love, drink, drugs just shook her to the core. You see how nasty and deranged she turned when high. Not pleasant to see, but you also see her shining witty side.Her dad came across as someone who jumped in to Manage her life far too late - only when fame and money came along. He did come across as a nasty piece of work.AMY holds SO much footage of her from an early age you find yourself growing with her. Her bouts of madness were just tangible... Maddening to see the glare of fame tear her apart. Paparazzi/media scum being an evil she could not tolerate. As Tony Bennett nails it - she was a natural, true Jazz singer.Why would anyone want to become famous, to be in that limelight, being stalked by press and fans alike. madness!Oh to sum up this is ESSENTIAL. Amy Winehouse fan or not her story WILL affect you. Personally I felt privileged to follow her life and immensely saddened to see such a talented soul leave us so young.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Familiar Story with an Incredibly Poignant Twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Asif Kapadia's documentary tells a familiar tale of the life and death of Amy Winehouse - a precocious talent from North London with a unique vocal and songwriting talent destroyed by a combination of willful manipulation, drugs and drink. The same could also be said for other great jazz singers of the past, notably Billie Holiday (whose voice often seems eerily similar to Winehouse's).With the help of childhood friends and archive interviews, Kapadia paints a picture of a Jewish girl growing up in an unstable household. Her father Mitch had an affair when Amy was still a baby, and finally left home when she was eight or nine. Her mother Janis admitted that she was really too weak to keep Amy under control: Amy grew up doing virtually what she wanted with little or no authority to restrain her.By her teenage years it was clear that Amy had a unique talent for singing and writing songs reflecting her various angst. Signed to a contract by Island Records, she gradually rose to stardom, while keeping her feet on the ground; she was always someone most at home with writing and recording music. Video footage from the period shows her enjoying herself with her companions as they traveled to various gigs. At heart she was a girl wanting to enjoy the experience of growing up and adjusting to the world.Things only really started going wrong once she crossed the Rubicon from well-known jazz artist into international star. Feted on television in both Britain and the United States, it seemed as if the world was her oyster. Yet it was also evident that she was too much influenced by hangers-on wanting a piece of her. Her husband Blake Fielder, a feckless junkie, introduced her to hard drugs; a succession of ineffectual managers including Monte Lipman failed to shield her from the media; and her father came back into her life as someone more interested in making money than protecting his daughter. Kapadia's film suggests that perhaps her father was most at fault for his daughter's decline; in one sequence he brings a camera-crew to St. Lucia, thereby ruining Amy's attempts to enjoy some kind of peace away from the media.Amy's troubled life is juxtaposed with performances of her greatest songs, whose lyrics are put on screen as she sings them. It's clear that she wrote from bitter experience; the only way she could make sense of it was to write about it. We get the sense that Amy performed first and foremost for herself.Her untimely death at the age of twenty-seven remains something of a mystery. From the evidence presented in this film, we are left uncertain as to whether she took her own life or whether she died accidentally. Given the prison-like existence she led for the last five years of her life, culminating in the now-notorious occasion when she failed to perform at a Belgrade concert, it's tempting to think that she had had enough.Few of her close associates come out with any credit as a result of this film. It's almost as if they wanted to exploit her, and when she died, they ascribed the tragedy to fate rather than admitting responsibility for it. This is especially true of Mitch.The ending is almost unbearably poignant. It seems such a sad waste of a unique talent. Nonetheless at least we have her musical legacy in the form of her recordings, both live and in the studio.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Dedication to Destruction: Amy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the public we only see the picture that is given us, but Asif Kapadia's new movie, Amy, shows us the behind-the-scenes of extremely talented star Amy Winehouse. We catch glimpses of young teen Amy, smiling to the camera. We watch Amy enjoy making her music. We replay her breakthrough. And we see the horrific reality of the consequences of her fame, and the influence of the press. This masterpiece is an eye-opener and shows the truth behind the glamour of the red carpet.Even though most people know the story of Amy, it has never been retold in this setting. Archive footage which makes the movie real, raw and honest. Commentary of people who have participated in Amy's life, and they tell the story as how they knew her, and not how the press thought they knew her. We get to know the fragile girl who "just wanted to be loved" and see her path towards her inevitable end, with participation of her destructive relationships as her absent father, her bad-influence husband and her addiction.While we see the changes in Amy we see the changes in her music. Her music started off as a product of her personality, her smoky jazz, "I only write a song if it really means something to me" - Amy. But in the end her level of personality in songs has sunken just as much as her participation in shows. She couldn't handle the load up of all her personal problems and became only a mere shadow of the emotionally powerful chanteuse she once was. Her journey is an emotional roller-coaster of the bright Amy as we see her in the beginning of the movie and the addicted woman who just couldn't let go of heroin, ecstasy, cocaine and alcohol. They tried to make her go to rehab, but all she said was "No, no, no".Although the emotional load up of this documentary is great, I do feel that it does show a selective side of the story. After I had seen the movie, I had the idea that everything that had come over Amy Winehouse was the result of her husband, parents, and the press. It is being presented as if Amy is a doomed angel because she is surrounded by the devil. This might be a peaceful thought for her close friends but I don't think it fully represents the truth.But I am still amazed and overwhelmed by Amy's story and shocked how she went from the passionate and bright teenager she was, into a story about brilliance, depression, exploitation and addiction.This movie is just as much as a worthy remembrance to Amy Winehouse as a representation of many celebrities who suffered from the pressure, the press and the fame-industry.Mare P.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What you could expect, decent summary of Winehouse's career and life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have seen Asif Kapadia's Formula-1-themed "Senna", you basically know what to expect here. This one is a pretty decent film from start to finish, very much by the books, but also with a couple surprisingly great moments. This film here does consist almost exclusively of archive footage and that's fairly impressive as it runs for over 2 hours. We see concert recordings and many recordings as well from Winehouse's husband that he made of the two. He really does look like one of the main forces of Winehouse's downfall and her falling deeper and deeper in this spiral of drugs and alcohol. But there are more reasons, like her tough relationship with her dad or the fact that she could not deal with stardom. This is an argument you hear frequently, but it may be true in her case. There is a scene when we hear that she is sick of singing her old really successful hits, but her struggles kept her from achieving new hits, so she is forced to sing the old ones and it seems as if this really shook her to the core.The best thing about this film is, without a doubt, the music. No matter what opinion you have about Winehouse in terms of if she brought this on herself or is just a victim of the whole situation, there is no denying she was an absolutely outstanding artist and there are some mesmerizing recordings in here. This film is advertised with the notion that there is unseen material here, but I think this is generally a really pointless references as maybe nobody in the theater has seen all the old material, so it's fine there is unseen material in here, but nobody will perceive it as unseen. Anyway, if this documentary is eligible for Oscar consideration, I am sure it may make a deep run. It's very relevant, very contemporary and very well-made, even if moments of absolute greatness are very rare. One would be the ending when we see how she is dead and quickly afterward we see recordings of her when she was much younger and just a normal girl before her rise to stardom. Good job from Kapadia all in all and I recommend this film. A good tribute to a truly talented and very authentic artist. Thanks Amy for the music. Rest in peace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Amy" is a revealing and personal portrait of Amy Winehouse, but should have dug deeper.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's difficult to sum up a celebrity's entire life in a two-hour film, even if that person died at a young age. Placing that person's public moments in the proper context, showing some of the private moments to provide insight, revealing influences, hopes, fears and struggles to provide understanding and digging deep enough to suggest lessons the audience can learn from that celebrity's life ? it's a lot to cover. Filmmakers have to decide what their focus should be, what to include, what to delve into, what to summarize and what to leave out. In addition, if the film is a documentary, they need adequate video and audio to tell the aspects of the story that they've chosen to tell. If they don't have video, they have a radio program and if they don't have audio, they have a book. It's all those challenges the makers of "Amy" (R, 2:08) had to confront. They did it fairly well on the surface, but could have dug deeper.British singer-songwriter Amy Winehouse died of alcohol poisoning in her London home on July 23, 2011, at the age of 27, a sad ending that gives this documentary on her life much of its power. The filmmakers know that and focus on Winehouse's rise to fame and her struggles with being famous, all of which can be said to have led to her death at the same age that also we lost musicians Brian Jones, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison and Kurt Cobain (the so-called "27 Club"). Those who are drawn to Winehouse's story because of the tragedy of her premature demise will indeed get some answers as the film discusses the struggles she had dealing with the price of fame and her resulting problems with drugs, alcohol and bulimia nervosa. Those who are fans of her music will get a generous helping of stories about her rise to fame and samplings of her music.Director Asif Kapadia was fortunate enough to have an abundance of material to use in telling Winehouse's story. No narrator is needed, as interviews with the singer's family, friends and music industry professionals provide the necessary exposition. But these are not talking heads. Almost all the soundbites are short and are edited in as voice-overs, with on-screen fonts identifying the speakers. The film's visuals include home video of Winehouse, from her teens onward, news clips, television appearances and concert footage. In the scenes of her musical performances, the words to her songs are subtly and artfully presented on the screen as she sings. Throughout the film, dates and locations also appear on the screen to provide the necessary sense of time and place, while the transitions to different events and periods in the subject's life are otherwise seamless."Amy" provides a very good summary of Winehouse's career, personality and life as she transitioned from "just a girl who can sing" to a worldwide celebrity, but it should have gone farther. Some of the time spent delving into her personal relationships could have been surrendered in favor of revealing aspects of her life which were almost completely ignored, such as the evolution of her sense of style, her significant charity work and her efforts on behalf of other musicians. We also could've done with fewer details and soundbites concerning her drug and alcohol abuse, if it meant more analysis of who or what was to blame for her problems. In spite of missed opportunities to make itself more meaningful, this film is a revealing personal portrait of a unique talent and a lost soul who died much too young. "B"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sympathetic but ultimately superficial portrait</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hoped this would offer a more revealing insight into Amy's mental illness, but the problem with some types of mental illness is that people are so very good at hiding it. I guess what you do see here, in a way that for most people is hidden, is how much of your life for anyone with mental health issues is really just an act. For sure, thanks to her amazing talent, Amy's life was played out to a much wider audience and hence captured - often in excruciating detail by the camera, but by the end of the film, although I had a better idea of the chronology of events, I think it really exposed surprisingly little of Amy Winehouse and just what made her tick. Yes many people along the way did recognise her instability, but I think it was quite notable how the media seized on drug abuse, when this, bulimia and even the alcoholism that killed her were merely symptoms of much deeper problems. Inevitably, the roller-coaster of drug-abuse and recovery dominates the narrative of this film, but generally overlooks how much time and effort Amy must have spent on becoming the best Jazz singer on the planet and the amount of intellectual effort she required to achieve that feat and also to produce lyrics that were both sincere and interesting. I think she achieved that aim, but a 5 minute chat with her friend during the 2008 Grammy awards revealed just how superficial she found the achievement. Sadly despite her intelligence, she had a fairly closed mind to any form of psychological therapy, and despite a succession of boyfriends, doesn't appear from anything we see here to have found anyone who she trusted enough who was in any position to help her change direction. To my mind, she created a kind of comic book character for herself, only to find that despite massive international acclaim, it didn't mean the same thing to her. She gave a massive amount to charity, and clearly had a sincere perspective on a huge range of issues, sadly nobody in this film really talks to her about anything but "Amy Winehouse".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>AmyJazz musicians do drugs so it appears there are more people in the audience than there are.Mind you, the chanteuse in this documentary could sell-out any basement nightclub.Encouraged by her friends (Juliette Ashby, Lauren Gilbert, Nick Shymanksy) to record what would eventually become her debut album, Amy Winehouse finally harnessed her self-destructive nature for something good.It wasn't until her sophomore album became a juggernaut that her dependency on drugs and alcohol, and her life-long battle with bulimia, came to a head.Thanks to home-recordings, TV appearances and interviews with her ex-husband (Blake Fielder) and contemporaries (Tony Bennett, Mos Def, Pete Doherty), Amy is a comprehensive catalogue of the crooner's meteoric rise and fall.Putting a human face on the much-maligned songstress, Amy helps fans fully understand their idol's intimate lyrics and erratic actions.Also, this is why safe heroin use should be taught to high-school jazz bands.

		<shortDescription>Good Technical Quality, Skewed Priorities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For fans of Amy Winehouse, "Amy" is must-see. The story is already known, although the film provides many interesting details perhaps not widely seen in public media. To avoid spoilers, I will stick to vague strengths and weaknesses. Strengths: &gt; Good video and sound for the music parts - this is not somebody's iPhone video of a public performance &gt; Chronology of story development - the film follows Amy's short life without jumping around in time &gt; The obvious bias is that of a fan. Janis Joplin's biographers have not been nearly as kind. The performance sections in "Amy" are carefully chosen &gt; No secret here: the pop music business and the pop media business have no humanity. They showed no mercy toward a fragile young woman who struck gold. This point was made clearly. The only improvement I can think of would be to get Keith Richards to comment on how the world loves to see its pop idols hounded - by police, by media, by fans, and by promotersWeaknesses &gt; Not enough music parts - the profound talent is displayed, but should have been put forth more often and for longer periods &gt; The sensational drug and alcohol abuse drama overwhelms the film as it did the artist herself. That may have been the point, but if so, it was made heavy-handedly &gt; Given the first two weaknesses, this film is just too long. I kept wishing they would get back to the concert and recording-session footageThe film is still a must-see for Amy Winehouse fans. Full disclosure: I am a huge fan of Amy Winehouse's jazz record with Tony Bennett.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching AMY, I left the theatre thinking more about the consequences of fame rather than just the "life of Amy Winehouse". A classic case of fame eating up a beautifully brilliantly gifted young woman who finally lost control of her life. I felt so terribly sad as her life unraveled yet listening to her sing was mesmerising and exhilarating. Such a waste and such a shame she couldn't be helped or saved. There is no doubt she was one of the most talented musicians of our century. The early footage of a 14 year old Amy singing with her girlfriends is priceless and there is no questioning that she was born with a gift... she couldn't be saved and fame came at the worst price. Go and see Amy just to understand how fame can go so horribly wrong...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very personal look at a lost treasure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into this documentary, I know very little about Amy Winehouse, past people making fun of her for her abuse problems. I feel robbed that this is what I knew first cause I just assumed she was some pop sensation and did not know anything about the musicBut thanks to this doc, I got to hear what this girl could do. That's one of the best things about the doc is that it plays entire versus of her songs, while she was recording or performing and it would display the words on the screen like a sing-a-long. We live in an age where everyone can document themselves and Amy is no different. The whole movie is just home footage of her mixed in with professional footage and layered with audio interviews from those who were truly close to her. As someone who knew so little of Winehouse prior to this movie, I like to say with an even tone that the best part of the movie was the first half, as it goes through her personality, the beginning of her career and her climb to success. Once she got to the top, the movie gets boring. It's not like they ran out of footage of her, but they slowed down the pace of the film in an attempt to show you how tragic her death is, as if though we did not already know that. But overall this movie made me want to go out and grab a copy of her albums so I can experience more of Amy, cause for the most part, it's completely focus on who she is as a singer, I'm sure she would love that.</fullReview>

Nothing about what made her fall for drugs and questionable boyfriends, nothing about what kind of relationship respectively non-relationship she had with her mother and her father - that is all brushed over. We also learn nothing about how her career started. Suddenly she had a huge band on the stage with horns and what have you - how did that came about? What part of the music (if at all besides a few song) did she write? Why did she get a contract with this record company at an age where she was at best, well, talented.The only thing we get shown over and over is her being a total train wreck - that's just not enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revealing account of an endearing and flawed person and gifted musician</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike many premature iconic Rock n' Roll star deaths which are greeted with shock, the news of Amy Winehouse's demise in July 2011 came with a grim sense of inevitability. That the daily tabloid fodder of her problems with drink and drugs had long since replaced her extraordinary vocal talent and recording success as the prime generator of all those column inches only added to the sadness felt at that time. 'Amy' is directed by Asif Kapadia previously lauded for Senna the documentary of Ayrton Senna. It provides a fascinating and balanced portrayal of Amy the flawed person and the gifted musician from North London beyond the two dimensional tabloid portrayal which hitherto many casual followers of her life story may only be familiar with. Thankfully it eschews the oft-used "talking heads" approach to documentary making. While numerous insightful interviews were undertaken with childhood friends of Amy, her Manager's, band members, collaborators as well as producers she worked with such as Mark Ronson and Salaam Remi, their contributions appear as voice- overs on the actual footage being shown.The footage itself consists of archive material including interviews and concert material and more home-produced video recorded by friends of Amy, her first Manager- Nick Shymansky and so on than I had expected. The first scene in 'Amy' is one such home recording showing Amy age 14 in normal enough teenage mode hanging out with her friends when she launches into a stunning rendition of Happy Birthday. Early on the impression of an endearing personality is created as much of the footage shows her being effortlessly funny and clever, mouthy but vulnerable too. It's also clear that many of her problems that became so manifest later stem from her childhood. Her father's breakup with her Mother clearly had a big effect on her. She suffered from depression for a time and also became bulimic but this appears to have gone unnoticed at the time. Her talent ensures that success comes quite early but it's clear that Amy was completely ill-suited to fame even prophetically saying in an early interview "I don't think I could handle it, I would probably go mad". One interview also shows a reluctance by her to play the game as she visibly becomes incredulous in the face of an interviewers inane questions.Hand in hand with the growing fame and her uncertainty around how to handle it comes an increasing reliance on drink and then harder drugs to which she is introduced to by Blake Fielder-Civil her on- again off again boyfriend who she eventually marries in 2007. From there its uncomfortable viewing at times but fascinating also as her every move and mis-step becomes fodder for a vile paparazzi and voracious media who come over as somewhat complicit in her downfall.I like the fact that the documentary makes plenty of room to show her performances of many of her popular songs such as 'Love is a Losing game' and 'Back to Black'. While these are shown her lyrics are also displayed on screen. These lyrics go a long way to revealing the sadness in Amy's heart and 'Amy' does go a long way towards giving background context to those heartfelt words.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jazz Singer Sings the Blues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amy Winehouse started as a jazz singer - her idols, we learn in this documentary Amy, were Sarah Vaughn and Tony Bennett - and actually looked down on a lot of pop music from her time period (she was born in 1983, so she would've been prime for 90's music, maybe the 80's carry-overs if she was staying current). She's even described by one or two of the people interviewed that she was deep down an old soul, or at least had the massive appreciation for where soul music and good R&amp;B music came from. Indeed at one point one of her collaborators said she mused on making a "Jazz/Soul supergroup" that would've included a member of the Roots and Mos Def. It's sad so much of what she could've been didn't get realized and she died at 27, in large part due to media WAY-over scrutiny, and both too much and not enough attention from her family and friends.By that one should say this, as her dad does (not that he's a figure to especially look up to from how we see him portrayed in the film visa-vi abandonment and pressing his own media into her private spaces in 2009), that she could've helped herself. But could she? Depression, anorexia, anxiety issues, bulemia, all of those issues that one may find as clichés with certain celebrities. What marks Winehouse as apart from that is she really didn't want to be a celebrity (and there is a difference from those that do and don't, see the Kardashians for more of that). If she just performed in small jazz clubs in front of 20 people she would've been fine; ironically, her song 'Rehab', about the conflict she had with her dad in an incident of going to Rehab, went to number one across the world, won her Grammys, and acted as something of an albatross around her neck.The film Amy has so much in exploration of this person and the world that she was in, how the media affected her (in scathing, unfair attacks, not to mention the Mosquitoes of the Press world the Papparazzi, when she was at her most vulnerable, at least as we can see), and the ups and downs with her family and friends, who wanted the best for her by also couldn't take her drug and alcohol dependency. We see her in many moments and clips, some from press interviews, others her performances where, more often than not (until near the end, at least as the film shows) she killed it in a great way every time, and in her personal spaces.If there is a flaw, and I don't think it's insignificant after thinking about it after I left the theater, it was the style of the clips. Some of this is just not good-quality footage; some of this can be excused away as that this is the best they could use, but other times it's not (a clip of Jay Leno looks like a 3rd-rate rip off of YouTube). The director made the decision to not do any of the 'talking-heads' style of interviews, just using audio - only some fly-over shots of London seem to have been specifically shot for the film for transitions - and that's fine too, except that in the second half I started to get tired of seeing how some of this footage was presented. Stylistically, it really resembles more of an online video than a theatrically-ready feature film.I mention after I left the theater because this was something that only occasionally took me out of the film. The subject matter, the subject herself, is a compelling one enough to carry one through the murkier technical waters. If one already knows a lot about Winehouse it may not give you a whole lot of new news. But just as a story unto itself, given to the casual or not-known-at-all audiences to Winehouse's career highs and lows (the latter was me, I'd heard 'Rehab' vaguely) it's a searing portrait of what power and release can go into dealing with one's demons in the creative process, while the personal problems make thins just always so difficult. Most of all difficult, indeed, is what to predict will happen to that person next; if one saw just the scene with her singing the duet with Tony Bennett near the end - an idol collaboration realized - one might see her talents and insecurities in one little bubble. She sings a take magnificently, but has to back off and go into her own head to go further, to be better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Asif Kapadia's poignant look at Amy Winehouse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Amy" (2015 release; 128 min.) opens with Amy, then all of 14 yrs. old, signing happy birthday for one of her girlfriends. The documentary then swiftly goes on to 2001, when we see and hear Amy in a jazz band, and before we know it, we are already in 2003. Along the way we see Amy getting better at writing and singing, and at boozing too. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, some 3-4 years ago, director Asif Kapadia made a riveting and outstanding documentary about the life and times of F-1 driver Ayrton Senna that was simply called "Senna". It went on to win multiple nominations and awards. So when I heard that a documentary on the life and times of singer Amy Winehouse was being made, and that none other than Asif Kapadia was the driving force behind it, I was reasonably sure that it would be a darn good film. Now that I have finally seen this, I can unequivocally state that this is a tough yet honest and of course an intrinsically very sad look at Amy Winehouse, but that as a documentary, "Amy" is top-notch, pure and simple. Kapadia had the full cooperation of the Winehouse family to all the archival footage (and there seems to be a TON of it, including never before seen home footage), and he had also the final cut. As you may have heard, the Winehouse family, having seen the final cut, then disavowed the movie. Why, you may ask? Let's just say that Amy's dad, Mitchell, seems more interested in Amy's money than in Amy's well-being. And it's not like Kapadia has to make it up or anything: it's all right there on tape and in Mitch's own words! Wow. Second, there is some unbelievably great footage of Amy performing ("Stronger Than Me" in 2003 at Island Records; "What Is It About Men" at the 2004 North Jazz Festival in Rotterdam; and most chilling of all, "Back to Black" filmed in the studio in what turns out to be the perfect take, where we hear Amy mostly a-cappella with her headphones on, and her arm casually on a chair, wow, just wow). There are many other stunning moments in this documentary, I can't even begin to list them all. Most amazing is of course that when Amy was at the peak of her creativity (in 2006-07), she was just 22-23 yrs. old. (I saw Amy perform at Coachella in April, 2007, just as the rocket ship to fame and fortune was taking off. Incredible performance.) Last, when Amy becomes the victim of her own success and is hounded relentlessly by the British paparazzi, it all feels eerily familiar to seeing Princess Diana in her last couple of years. Beware: "Amy" is at times uncomfortable viewing, for many reasons, but "Amy" simply reflects the uncomfortable aspects of Amy's life, and does not sugarcoat things or aims to make this film into a 'love letter' to Amy Winehouse. At times uncomfortable, yes, but riveting from start to finish, watch "Amy" scoop up many nominations when the awards season comes around later this year and in early 2016.I had been looking forward to seeing this for a long time. "Amy" finally opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The early evening screening where I saw this was very nicely attended, to my pleasant surprise. When word-of-mouth gets around, I bet this will play for quite a while in the theaters. If you like top-notch documentaries, regardless of whether you know much of Amy Winehouse going in, you cannot go wrong with this. "Amy" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Some may know Amy Winehouse as the Grammy award winning singer, while others may know of her as the drug-addled target of the paparazzi who died from alcohol poisoning 4 years ago. Still others may be asking "Amy who?" Director Asif Kapadia (Senna, 2010) delivers a film that doesn't shy away from the brutally tough "down" times, but also shines a light on the "up" times for this suburban Northern London Jewish kid who was simply unable to manage her rare musical talent, profound personal weaknesses, and the relentless media pressure.Did you know Amy played guitar? Kapadia includes film of her crafting songs while strumming, and also early performance clips of her on stage with her Stratocaster. It's these rarely seen film clips ? some home movies, some phone videos from fans, and some from other photographers ? that provide the leave-no-doubt proof of Amy's musical genius ? both as a vocal artist and a songwriter. Some of the clips provide a glimpse of her charm and sense of humor and desire for normalcy, while others show the bulimic, strung-out party girl mixed up with the wrong guy. We see her casually hanging out with her childhood friends, and later slurring words and staggering through the strobing flashbulbs. The contrast is heartbreaking.While the typical documentary approach of "talking heads" is almost non-existent, we get plenty of insight from sources such as: her two closest friends, producer Mark Ronson, husband and enabler Blake Fielder-Civil, friend and first manager Nick Shymansky, music executive Lucian Grainge, and fellow artist Mos Def/Yasiin Bey. Amy's longtime keyboardist Sam Beste cuts right to the bone when he says she "needed music". That insight when combined with her childhood issues really bring into focus what allowed Amy to live, and then what snatched joy right away from her.Even from a young age ? we see her at 16 ? Amy was an old soul, seemingly born into the wrong era. The music erupted from a place very few have. The number of performance clips are limited, but there is one when she is 20-21, and when she sings the word "emulate", it takes on meanings not yet defined by Webster's. Contrasting that with the legendary Tony Bennett coaxing her through a recording session is painful to watch, while simultaneously providing a front row seat to musical genius.Director Kapadia shines a certain light on Amy's dad Mitch, her husband Blake, and others that were close to her. It's Sam Beste's frustration at failing on that first attempt at rehab that brings the biggest "what if?" Of course, that failure led to her biggest recording success with "Rehab" (no, no, no), but might it have also cost Amy her happiness and possibly even her life? The final Belgrade concert was one month prior to her joining the 27 Club, and perhaps it's just further proof that Amy simply "can't be that thing" that the fans and media tried to turn her into. Whether you are an Amy fan or not, this is a gut-wrenching look at how a talented artist struggled with life and fame ? until the struggles won out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing expose on the tragic life of Amy Winehouse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Four years after her tragic death at age 27, "Amy" is billed as a tell all story about this remarkable talent. Sadly, this film disappoints. All of the footage is archival, supplemented by voice over interviews with Amy's friends, family, associates &amp; admirers (incl. Tony Bennett). The story is told chronologically, and the interviews with her parents avoid the most delicate issues - her bulimia, her addiction, &amp; the impact of their separation on Amy. Seemingly, the director did no original research, nor interviewed no experts (save &amp; except her doctor). Her unhealthy relationships with the men in her life figure prominently in the film, but what about her father Mich? He shows up mid-way, seemingly to cash in on her popularity. Also, what about her legacy? After her death, Mich &amp; his ex set up a company to manage her estate, and Mich set up the Amy Winehouse Foundation to sell merch: http://www.amywinehouse.com/ I found "Amy" disappointing. The film left me with many unanswered questions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amy: What's Worse, The Truth or The Treatment?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, seems the first thing everyone wants to do is blame this girls Mum, after all she gave in to Amy's own "self admitted" bad attitudes. But even if Mum or anyone else had stood up to Amy's own poor ideals, she would have told them where to go. Amy couldn't get out of home fast enough, why? she said it herself - the freedom to indulge in drug 'n drink etc, etc, till she dropped and, all this she did of her own free will. It's all there for anyone who wants to look deeply enough. Amy's the perfect picture of a non-practicing Jewish girl (by her own calling) doing what she does best. Second thing to do is blame the assortment of dud blokes whom she allowed into her private space - a poor lot? seems obviously so but, no-one forced Amy to follow them into the fire - this she also did herself. Then, like the rest of the hangers on, her Dad (who never seemed to be around in her youth) suddenly pops back into her life when she begins making that instant 'friend getting' stuff called money! All of it appalling.To the above we can now add a doco maker who had a meager gathering of super crap visual material (some of the poorest quality imagery i've ever seen in a 'mainstream' release) - these are people who can smell a fast buck. With little to pay for - they simply use the same weak images ad nausea - even cheaply slowing them down to mere moving frames - stretching it all to breaking point. Do they really care? why would they, it's virtually all pre-sold, the adoring public will eat it up anyway. A 25min doco could have easily said it all but no, we had to suffer over two hours of appalling footage to show an extremely hedonistic, weak willed, young girl reduce herself to pulp. Yes, Amy was blessed with a fine voice and occasionally used it wisely but sadly she was dead before she died, just another member of the numerous walking dead of this sorry world. Talent or no talent, doesn't matter, if the music and magazine industry see a glimmer of sales they go all out to milk it dry. Many say they came away from this movie drained, so did I, just thinking of the two invested hours of my life that I'll never get back. Shameful in the extreme but seems to fit the bill for fans of self destructive muso's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From a non-fan of the singer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the decade of Amy Winehouse's career, I was largely out of touch with mainstream media, so I knew nothing about her and had heard not a note of her singing.For me, then, this documentary told me a familiar story of A Star is Born (and falls, and dies young). It had all the usual suspects: the horrible family member who created the neuroses that drives the art and mental illness in the first place and who waddles back into the picture only to board the gravy train; the significantly less talented lover/husband who doesn't understand what a joke he is and drags the person down and ends up being her worst addiction, the executives who can't hear "no, I can't bear to do that," and ultimately drive the person into the grave. The only element that has been added to the story since 1937 is the simply unbelievable British paparazzi. (Seriously, you people should legalize handguns so the next victim like Winehouse can shoot these guys dead and make it a better world.) So for me, this is a well-done study of addiction and self-destruction and a reminder, not that I needed it, that fame really sucks and is not something any sensible person would wish for. It's such a strong portrait of addition that I'd be surprised if it's not shown to rehab counselors at some point in the future as part of their training.I liked what the director did with archival footage and off-screen commentary, how clearly those voices were identified with text, and how slowly they were introduced so that I was never lost in the cast of characters. Outstanding job with that.I wasn't converted to fandom (such silly adolescent lyrics), but I was moved to pity.It dragged in places; I thought it would have been a better 99-minute documentary. That was its primary weakness for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A documentary that soars...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I approach documentaries with a great deal of apprehension. And when the documentary in question runs for two hours the misgiving and alarm grows. So even while I'd become increasingly aware of the glowing reviews and awards that 'Amy' has been gathering over the past year or so since premiering at Cannes, my innate resistance to watching documentaries kept me away from it. In any event, I had never listened much to Amy Winehouse when she was alive, and was unlikely to start now. Right?Wrong. I finally gave in to the film couple of days ago, and am glad I did. At least, I can now understand why it's being talked about so much. It's a gripping story of extraordinary talent, the inevitable pressures that accompany so much fame so soon, and the potent self-destruction that ensues. Even though you know the ending, the thriller in it remains. No mean feat for a documentary. Take a bow Asif Kapadia. Just to add I've since been obsessively hooked to listening to Amy Winehouse and am going to need Rehab soon?.</fullReview>

I made an exception here as for what i knew of Amy Winehouse other than her very public tragic self destruction, and notoriety was her god given astoundingly deep rich and oh so expressive voice. As a film though for a none fan general viewer the film feels very long and something of a one note samba, the tone is respectful but morose and we know the film can never be a easy watch given the material much of the footage is quite remarkable and often somehow shocking in its candour. But, the story is given no joy no sense of wonder nothing to spark it into life or emotion to pull you in. I did however leave the movie theatre in no doubt that rock n roll had yet another sad victim that was dead to young and with so much potential left unfulfilled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Listen to the music, leave the woman alone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In one of the pre-fame interview clips of Amy Winehouse included here, she tells the interviewer that she doesn't think she will be a celebrity because it will become clear to people that she's not very interesting beyond the music she makes. This overlong documentary more or less demonstrates that, while she was wrong about not becoming a celebrity, she was mostly right about not being very interesting. There is a lot of pre-fame footage of Amy Winehouse, but this film never explores the connection between that and her overwhelming narcissism. The film's refreshing avoidance of armchair psychology doesn't leave it with much else that's substantive to fill the excessive run time. It's a good watch for fans of Winehouse's distinctive vocals and/or her self-obsessed songwriting, though you could get as much or more insight into her preoccupations from a couple of close listens of her album "Back to Black." This is a well-constructed chronicle of a relatively short career that provides some background detail to Winehouse's public meltdown and not much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not as much a review as an overarching question: doesn't this film seem to be an extension of the same sort of thing it criticizes? Amy is just as much a spectacle here as at any other point in her fame, which the documentary indicates was the major factor in her addiction and death. Sure, we feel like we know her after watching, but that's just the thing - we still don't and never will. The poor girl should've been left the flkh alone and taken care of by the people who actually knew and loved here. And here we are continuing to try to access and ingest her celebrity even after she's been destroyed by it. I felt dirty after watching it, like part of a paparazzi mob or a skeezy, maladjusted public who viciously chews up and spits out the celebrities it bizarrely worships. Yes, the documentary itself was reasonably well done - I liked the use of her own lyrics to sort of narrate the film, that was clever - but in truth it was too long and often unnecessarily boring. Staring at her for long periods of time may incite some attachment that wasn't there before, but again, what are you really utilizing here (our desire to get close to celebrity) that isn't also something you're pretty openly denouncing at the same time? Let's be real, you made a film that's grossed many millions by using her tragic story in much the same way everyone else you're criticizing used her in life.</fullReview>

The film runs long at 128 minutes or maybe you just get tired of seeing someone destroy herself. Amy was the product of screwed up parents, a mother who was weak in every since of the word and a father who was absent during her youth but conveniently comes back as the dotting dad as she gains success and notoriety. Amy is no Saint by any means, she has an affair with this low life Blake Fieldler who leaves his girl to be with Amy, then leaves Amy to go back with his original girlfriend then he goes back to Amy as she becomes famous...you get the idea. I knew going in that this would be a disturbing movie so for what it is on my Cannoli scale of greatness between 1-5, this film gets 31/2 Cannoli's!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much troubled, not enough artist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"We're all stars now in the Dope Show" - Marilyn Manson. Side notes: remember when we thought using a serial killer's name as your stage name was subversive? Now we know it just shows you were the product of a late middle age birth without many friends. A movie critic famously said of U2's "Rattle and Hum" movie that it contains too much rattle and not enough hum. The issue exists in this more streaming quality document but the problem is too much troubled and not enough artist. Through pieced together largely work-a-day home movies we are invited to gawk at the toll drugs and alcohol took on the woman who famously penned a song refusing to go to rehab (she actually eventually did). The piece makes the titular jazz singer into a freak like those found in denizens of old- timey carnivals (and perhaps modern day carnivals that sport a freak show) known as a "dope show." The movie obsesses in probing her emaciation, confusion and isolation. The movie makes much of the insatiable appetite of the paparazzi (there are so many scenes of Winehouse in the glare of flashbulbs, it gets to be an in-movie cliché after a while) to microscopically search for pain and degradation. But does the film do any less? As audience members we're just late to the party. All of the paraded outcomes of addiction strikes true chords but how about some research into how a kid from the London suburbs penned future standards such as "Love is Blind", "F Me Pumps" or "You Know I'm No Good." The wit and insight contained in the music makes you wonder - unless you are Asif Kapadia apparently - what source material or experience Winehouse was tapping at such a tender age. Also, what about putting her into a larger cultural context. Like Adele, Joss Stone and Meghan Trainor, modern audiences seems to be continue to be comfortable with a certain sound provided it comes with a certain look. Or as Kid Rock puts it: "I make Black music for the White man." As a side note, the film succeeds at making one wonder how 88 year old Tony Bennett could possible still sound so good. In short, this limited view of the artist has been covered - admittedly without the cell phone movies and as many interviews - already on streaming media. Look for those instead, at least you get a little music with them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>beware films bearing: colons in their title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film is one means of probing a truth content of a subject matter. Although documentary and drama framed movies (and there are hybrid types of doc/dramas) are different approaches are there particular characteristic features that distinguish them from each other? Watching Amy and Janis, two feature docs, made me think about the differences between drama and doc as film expression. Documentaries seem to be a particular type of film expression that lays claim to the actual. But documentary films in relation to: subject matter, contents, structure and even form are often substantially the same as drama. So, what of a film like Kapadia's Amy whose content comprises only of actual documented footage and archive material without any externalities of input such as voice over or extraneous music. You might think that produced in this form using only originary primary material that Amy's expressive content makes it completely distinct from any drama based production. However it might be possible to make a film, that used only actual material originating as documentary or archive recordings, whose purpose was to produce an intentional fabrication. You might call such a film a piece of propaganda (Riefenstahl's work for Hitler) or perhaps a fabricated documentary and the latter type of production would almost certainly borrow heavily from dramatic form to fabricate its story, and to that extent would present many of the markers of a drama in making its claim to present truth content. In relation to Kapadia's 'Amy: the girl behind the name', this is the sort of claim that has been made by some of her family. The overwhelming pressure on film makers from distributors producers commissioners is to have a strong story line. Narrative is king. So both drama and documentary types of film have to conform. To find the line through the material that best delivers a story. To disregard elements that don't fit the story, to draw out their characters in those expressive clips that clearly define their role in the story. This pressure is most strongly exerted on contemporary documentary makers, looking for theatrical release, whose editing of originatory material now has to comply with the rules of dramatic form.Both Amy and Janis conform to the pre-packaged populist narrative of the tragedy of the flawed female performer. The message that female emotional frailty combined with isolation and inability to cope with the ravaging demands made by the image of success, lead on to recourse to drink drugs and death. Both films in their different ways package this story and present it as the primary truth content without too much complication or digression. The music of Janis and Amy is folded into the warp of both films. Music which is intense and personal, expressive of states of mind embedded in the films, but not necessarily definitive of either singers' life. It is perhaps in the expectations of the audience, rather than form, that documentary and dramatic material may be significantly different. Audiences for films presented as docs are more concerned with the truth content of the material. Audiences for drama, more concerned with dramatic effect.Dramatic productions are subject I think to different criteria of appraisal by their audiences. In dramatic performances, actors are appraised for their bodies, their physiques, their voices, the delivery of their lines (sincere, authentic) and their mimicking abilities. In dramatic scripts the audience is happy to accept a large measure of dramatic license in the film scenario. Dramas are understood as fabrications. For the audience the issue is whether at some level the drama can be understood as sincere and authentic. In a film presented as a documentary, the audience attends the material with a different subjectivity. In docs the makers and contributors are judged almost exclusively for their honesty. In the documentary film the audience to some extent play a forensic role, almost a type of jury, examining the film looking for signs confirming the veracity, the relatedness, the frankness, the repleteness and moral stature of interviewees and material as it is presented Amy comprises an overwhelming intimacy. The film consists of home movie footage, archive and selfie material: a door, an opening into Amy's life. It presents as intrusion: like looking through someone's diary or going through their room. The mood created is one of privileged access to the private sphere, a construed invasion of privacy. The film, reinforced with Amy's self referential songs defines the mood of its expressive material shaping it into a tragedy, that entwined emotionally with her music, tells the story of the inevitable rise decline and death of Amy Whitehouse. Berg's 'Janis?' also makes use of archive and personal footage. At the core of the film's narrative drive are the songs, interpreted and re-informed by extensive use made of interviews with those who knew and worked with her. The songs speak for themselves: the emotional authenticity of the story of 'Janis'. But the interviews seem to me less satisfactory. They all conform to the expected image of Janis, and come across as perspectives of the past seen through the filter of the present. A present where the hot issues of the past, its conflicts and antagonisms, have all comfortably melded. The interviews seem to reconstruct an idealised version of Janis that seems at odds with an actual Janis, a demanding out of control hurricane of life.Both Amy and Janis are formulaic but each offers a quite difference experience of subjectivity to the viewer. Amy asks the viewer to conspire with the film makers conceit that their film allows them to understand the music by allowing them into the domain of the private. Janis, keeps the viewer on the outside of the material, asking them to understand the music by believing the word of a number of interviewees talking many years after the events they are remembering.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A documentary on the life of Amy Winehouse, the immensely talented yet doomed songstress. We see her from her teen years, where she already showed her singing abilities, to her finding success and then her downward spiral into alcoholism and drugs.A very gritty documentary - shows her history, warts and all, the good and bad. Well researched - some of the footage is incredibly rare, and even features home movies. Almost everybody who watched this knows that it ends tragically, and the documentary does a good job of showing what leads to her demise - her downward spiral, its symptoms and its causes. There is a large feeling of inevitability to it all.Quite emotional too. Through flashbacks to her teen years we are reminded that she was once a care-free, innocent child, and that the hurly burly of fame was something she was totally unprepared for and ultimately didn't want.Emotional too in that you get an indication of what a great talent she was and get an inkling for how much more she could have achieved.</fullReview>

I always feel it is really their choice. All of these things (despite doctors trying to profit form them by calling them a "disease") it's ultimately the users choice.At least watching this movie I understand better. At least another point of view from all the bad press and jokes. Maybe other factors lead to her self destruction. If nothing else that bum drug addict self-centered looser husband Blake and then her looser father appeared to have a big effect on her destruction. They just aided in it by either joining in the drug use with her and/or wanted to capitalize and spend her money. If they really loved her more than their pathetic selves, things might have been different.At any rate a nice documentary that tells it like it is/was and highlights a lot of her talent. Not overly exploitative like a lot of similar movies in this class.</fullReview>

You'd have to be living in a cave to not know who she was and how her life came to a quick end due to drug and alcohol abuse. Having no idea about the talent of Winehouse this documentary does a very good job at showing both sides of the singer. Of course, the most interesting stuff deals with her rather destructive life that had her dying at such a young age.The documentary used video footage as well as interviews to tell Winehouse's story as we see her at a young age singing a rather remarkable version of Happy Birthday and then we follow her career from small clubs to an album that would end up selling over twenty million copies. The film talks about her various highlights but of course goes through her down times, which includes an abusive relationship with a man who she'd marry as well as issues with her father.There's a lot of great concert footage here but there are also insane moments of the singer coming under attack from hundreds of cameras. The director does a very good job at showing how hectic Winehouse's life was and there's no doubt that the price of fame is on full display here. The father and the boyfriend are made to be the villains here but the documentary fails at blaming Amy herself for some of the various mistakes. If you're a fan of Amy Winehouse then I'm sure you'll love the well-made documentary. If, like me, you didn't know much about her outside the negative then you'll get to know a talent with one too many demons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful and tragic documentary about the life and death of a great talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amy tells the story of Amy Winehouse, a hugely talented British singer who tragically experienced the dark side of fame and eventually died due to alcohol poisoning in 2011. The film is constructed entirely from archive footage. Amy looks set to win the Best Documentary Oscar and while it's a tad overrated, it's a worthy enough documentary. This is an effective telling of Amy Winehouse's life story for various reasons. It's tactic of using archive footage allows the viewer to stay invested in the story, and most of the time it makes the film seem more authentic and real. It's full of great music as well, and it has various powerful messages about the dark side of fame. Crucial to its success is that it allows us to get to know Amy Winehouse as a person and gives an insight into what she was like. The second half of the film is where it really hits its stride as the more tragic elements of the story kick in. Since the outcome is already known, it will leave many viewers emotionally shattered by the end.I wasn't completely won over by Amy. It's a good, efficient documentary but it's nothing ground-breaking and at times feels like it's going the motions. While later on the film really gets going, at first I was very aware of the editing and manipulations in the film, which hammer home the same points again and again. This one was a slight victim of being overly hyped up, but it's well executed enough to draw you in. It's a documentary which genuinely has a lot to say, and by the time it finds its feet it delivers on the emotional moments. As the film goes on, it feels less manipulative and starts just allowing the story to tell itself, rather than hammer in the messages about how fame is bad for you. The audience can work that message of the film out from all the very well edited footage and there's no need to keep stating the obvious. Not a masterpiece, but a good, worthwhile documentary which is in the end a genuine, hard hitting tragedy.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you think anyone says 'I should have known him' after watching 'This Is It'. The answer is definitely yes. In the non-English speaking countries, many people don't know who Michael Jackson is or was. To me, this documentary is a similar case, I had no clue about who Amy Winehouse was or I never listened her musics before. So thanks to the director for this film and I also congratulate him for the Oscars nomination.The movie was not complete. As any documentary this one too based on the recorded audio and video clips, and a series of interviews of whom she had worked with and closed ones. It was like a puzzle, but was arranged neatly in the chronological order. You know, you won't get all the truth from them, many stuffs remain mystery. So this is only a person's quality and character from many (people's) angles, but the accuracy, the honesty is with Amy that's never going to be revealed. Because only she knows about all she went through in her life like we do in our life.Without arguably I agree films and documentary films are too short to squeeze all in about 2 hours to depict a person's entire life and people who watch it to judge that person is not justified. In this, the end was so sudden, like they had no more footages about what really happened. The trivia says Amy's father was not happy about the movie for the portrayal of his daughter, especially the last few years of her life. Only a very few know how much true this film is, but anyway something was very clear that he has not been the father she has wished for.Every child deserves a good parenting. I feel Amy's struggle began from her childhood itself. But after the teenage, while becoming more independent, she lost her path, besides the fame poured in. She definitely had a gifted voice, she did not know how to manage it and someone should have been there to guide her. According to this film, I think the marriage was the beginning of the dark side of the Amy."When you looked at her lyrical and melodic capability, she was a very old soul in a very young body."I have not seen all the Academy Award nominees except this and 'Cartel Land', but I certainly think this film has the edge to win the best Documentary film. Definitely Amy's life story deserves to be made as a feature film and I'm up for it. Because somewhere I read the reply to a question 'why Bill Gates is not celebrated as the Steve Jobs? After all bother of them achieved a lot in the same field and contributed to modernise the computer technology'.The reply was like this: 'Bill Gates was from a financially well settled family who was good at studies and his life was very smooth, support was poured from all the corners. While Steve Jobs was a child of an immigrant parents and had to struggle for his achievements. So he went through many ups and downs in his life and people have soft corner for that'.This film had all qualities to inspire from the Amy's achievement as well as lessons to learn from her personal life. Everybody has their personal issues and so the Amy. Becoming a prey for the drugs and alcohol is very common these days among the celebrities. For example Heath Ledger, Philip Seymour Hoffman and many other stars are the victims for the drug addiction.That does not mean their achievements are nothing. Simply, we see one of the many faces of them. After all, we're humans go after what we desire for, but everything has limits, after that what comes is a self-destruction. It is a very nice movie. If you know her and still want to know better, and if you don't know her and want to know about her, for both it is a must see.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remembering Amy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.5/5 starsA befitting and appropriately sad recount of one of Britain's foremost modern music icons, "Amy" is a candid look at the convoluted relationship between art and artist and subsequently fame and celebrity, while shinning copious light on the lethal spiral of addiction. Winehouse's story is a tragic one, and a familiar one, yet this documentary sets her apart from other, similar entertainers who died young, but not far enough. It succeeds in capturing the fans' adulation with her music and also her downfall; while also managing to relay a profound message about the nature of modern fame.Despite just two albums to her name, Amy Winehouse remains one of the biggest music icons in British history. With a voice often described as an amalgamation of Billy Holiday, Dinah Washington, and Sarah Vaughan, Winehouse was a jazz star with soul; a once-in-a- generation musical talent whose appeal crossed cultural and demographic boundaries. But while her music made her a star, her chaotic personal life stole headlines.Director Asif Kapadia weaves together revelatory footage and interviews, assembling from them a melancholic portrait coupled with an intense character study of a major talent with plenty of demons, which only traumatized her further as her star power and fame grew, leading to her eventual ruination. "Amy" is a celebration of all that Winehouse accomplished as well as a cautionary tale about the grave price to be paid for not getting an addict the help they need. Kapadia's documentary aptly highlights how badly the singer was let down by the male figures closest to her. Yet, beneath all that, the film's most obvious and honest bet lies in showcasing the prodigious talent of Amy Winehouse, paying rich tribute to a great performer with one of the best jazz voices of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why did you leave us so soon, Amy? I'm not a fan of jazz, but when I first heard Amy's music, I knew that she was something special. Her music seemed to have a very unusual syncopation. Amy could have brought jazz to the masses if she had reined in her excesses.Excellent film. Sometimes, the embedded subtitles for song lyrics and dialogue are difficult to read--they really need a rework.The secondary title of the film should be "Surrounded by Knobs"...Mitchell Winehouse (a.k.a Ostrich Daddy, a.k.a. Mooch Groupie)Blake Fielder. If only the wrist slitting at age 9 had succeeded....Raye Cosbert, a glorified pimpOn another note, famous musicians are dropping like flies this year. Lemmy, Bowie, and yesterday, Paul Kantner, who was Jefferson Airplane's co-founder and guitarist. Really strange.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely upsetting documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the news broke on July 23rd 2011 that singer and songwriter Amy Winehouse had been found dead of complications brought on by years of drug and alcohol abuse, there was almost a "told you so" response by the public, or at least the people who I interacted with. People certainly mourned the passing of a truly great artist, but there was an air of inevitability, almost as if this was the natural end to her brief career. Her life played out in front of the tabloids and no doubt played a key part in her sad demise, but Amy, directed by Asif Kapadia of Senna (2010) fame, explores a wealth of home footage previously unseen in an attempt to unravel just what drove the young lady to such self-destruction.The home footage that has been uncovered is often extremely intimate stuff. We at first meet Amy as a teenager. Pretty, loud and full of life, she and her friends are just lounging about being regular teenagers until Amy suddenly bursts into a rendition of Happy Birthday. The soundtrack then kicks in with her youthful version of Moon River, and it's difficult not to be bowled over by such a soulful voice coming out of the then 19 year-old. As her career begins to pick up, she is asked how she believes she would react to fame. She replies that she doesn't believe she could handle it. Following the release of Frank, her first album, the excessive drug and alcohol intake begins, just as two key male figures re-enter her life.Kapadia avoids laying the blame on anyone in particular, as the two people who come across the worst in this documentary - her father Mitch Winehouse and husband Blake Fielder-Civil - are heavy participants in the film. It was Fielder-Civil who first introduced Amy to crack, and when her friends gathered around her to try and put a stop to it, her father told her that she didn't need help. This, of course, was the inspiration for the song Rehab. It is at this point, around the half-way mark, that Amy becomes difficult to watch. We all saw the pictures of her bloody and red-eyed at the end of one particularly heavy binge in the newspapers, but its the revelation that Amy told one of her friends everything is boring without drugs during a clean spell that hits home the most.However, this is not just an extremely sad tale of a talented artists death, Amy also celebrates the music and, in particular, her song-writing ability. During most of the stunning performance footage on show here, her vocals are accompanied by her lyrics written on-screen, which are not only extremely important in helping to understand Amy, but help sculpt the narrative of the film. She is praised as one of the finest jazz singers of all time by Tony Bennett, and it's difficult to disagree. The praise lavished upon her here makes it even more difficult to watch the footage of various comedians mocking the troubled singer. In an age of instant reactions on social media, I guess it has now become socially acceptable to make jokes about a woman in her twenties crippled by mental illness and addition. It's an extremely upsetting story, and when the credits roll it genuinely feels like you have lost a friend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tragedy on camera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amy Winehouse was a jazz singer so talented that she went to the top of the pop charts. She also had severe personal problems and sadly drank herself to death at a very young age. What makes this seem even worse is that she was at best watched while, and at worst driven to, this by the rest of us, as the media found it funny to chart her decline. And before we blame "them", they would not have done this if there wasn't a market for their product. For this reason alone, a film of Winehouse's life might be expected to have plenty of available material: in fact, one thing that's interesting is that she seems to have lived her whole life on camera, and not just in the gutter press: even her earliest career, and, as a member of the digital generation, her private life, was comprehensively photographed and filmed. In fact, this leads to one arguable fault of Asif Kapadia's documentary: it's a little too long. With so much material available, the director's choice has been to leave little out. But it's still mostly compelling and very sad.The other flaw is that the film is a little kind to most of the people who appear in it. The obvious exception is Amy's father Mitch, who does not come well out of the film. But just about everyone else is allowed to present themselves as if they were only trying to protect her, which begs the question, who was actually responsible for dragging her down? Mitch might not have behaved in a positive manner for his daughter's welfare, but it wasn't him who plied her with drugs and drink. Overall, it's still a strong, and tragic movie; and the good thing is that when we see Amy sing, we can at least remember her talent, even though it burnt out far too soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only started to really listening to Amy after her death because her tracks were being played everywhere. I cried like a kid watching this documentary, it was so emotional and it make me feel like I was part of her family, like I was her best friend, and to make a person feel like this is not an easy thing to do. Maybe love was the worst drug she ever took, love for her father who cared about money more than her, and love for Blake who wanted to drown her with him. Those two should have died and not a beautiful soul like Amy, but we have no control over the people who surround us. Tears me apart to know that I'll never see her live.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The director does it again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Asif Kapadia previously directed the excellent SENNA documentary about motor racing, so I was automatically looking forward to this follow up. The subject matter wasn't as interesting to me, but I trust Kapadia enough to deliver an engaging documentary nonetheless.He doesn't disappoint. AMY is a carefully judged exploration of the life - and death - of modern-day jazz singer Amy Winehouse, whose whirlwind rise to fame was accompanied by drug and alcohol addiction, bulimia, and some decidedly dodgy supporting characters. This lengthy documentary is never boring for an instant and manages to straddle the line between being a celebration of Winehouse's achievements and a portrayal of the increasing tragedy that her life became.There are high spots - the Grammys, the duet with Tony Bennett - and low spots (the paparazzi attacks, the increasingly obvious toll that drug dependence was taking on her body), along with some obvious villains (step forward, Mitch and Blake). Where AMY really shines though is in its refusal to go the lazy route by interspersing clips with talking head footage; nearly every second of the film features footage of Amy herself, making this feel like a truly dedicated and immersive viewing experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really only know Amy Winehouse through her hit singles and latter-day appearances in the news media as paparazzi fodder plus of course her sad death at a criminally young age. There's no question watching this bio-documentary that she was a very talented singer and songwriter but unlike bland contemporaries like Adele, Dido and Duffy, she lived a rock and roll indeed one might say punk rock lifestyle. Her death at only 25 it was said was shocking but not surprising especially when it seems clear with some nurturing, education and encouragement she might just have drawn back from the edge of the abyss.Sadly she fell into the orbit of one Blake Civil, a narcissistic, drug-taking parasite but almost as bad, her own father in the time-honoured show-biz fashion, seems to have been complicit in forcing her to tour right at the end of her life when she was in no fit state to perform as evidenced by a gruesome video of Winehouse completely out of her face on- stage at a Scandanavian music festival. With family and friends like this...Better then to concentrate on the happier aspects of her life story. Although always a difficult child, she seems to have developed and retained strong friendships with childhood chums as well as with some of her back room staff. Initially a jazzer and a fan of older singers like Tony Bennett and Sarah Vaughn (one of the highlights and rate high-spots in her later days is the fan-worship she shows Bennett when singing with him for his duets album), she hit big with when with hip producer Mark Ronson, she released the poppier "Back To Black" Grammy-winning album. With the fame however came the infamy of life with Civil and with the fortune the ability to squander her money on an out of control drug and drink habit, which eventually killed her.This documentary tells her story in chronological order with many home videos from her pre-fame youth, where she seems just like any other teenage girl looking for love and laughs. There's no voice-over narration to guide the viewer or to judge her actions but as I indicated above it's pretty clear where, how and with whom she went wrong.A lot of the time it makes for strong and very occasionally turn-away type-viewing. Better then to focus on some of the great music she made and there are several clicks if her in great form, often playing guitar which was a surprise for me to see.Sadly in the end she became another of the live fast - die young brigade who litter the history of music down the years. When Tony Bennett compares her to Billie Holiday, you feel he's not only talking about her singing talent, but also her capacity for self-destruction. Nevertheless in these days where safe and bland are king and queen in modern music, at least to my ears, this film showcases an artist who took chances and broke the mould. Music is the poorer without her.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're an Amy Winehouse fan and you want to learn more, then you're definitely getting what you want. Even if you never really liked Amy Winehouse's music, I still recommend this documentary.This documentary is brilliantly told and well made. They keep in mind that there are Amy Winehouse fans watching, but there's also an audience that doesn't know her at all. They try their best to tell her tale as truthful as it can be told. It's not like every documentary where they tell you how great he/she was and how much of a loss to music he/she was. They don't feed you garbage, they're telling the truth about her life and her experiences. She made mistakes and she did fall, but it also keeps in mind that anyone could have fallen like her. To me, that's an impressive achievement for a documentary.This documentary is amazing thanks to it's cold hard facts. When it suddenly ends, you leave the theater thinking that the music industry lost someone so gifted. It doesn't beat that message into your head like other documentaries. It showcases her talent amazingly and still reminds us that Amy is still a human being through all her obstacles. Well crafted, amazing story, and an overwhelming sense of the truth. Amy is one of the best movies of 2015.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-Amy (promoted as Amy - The Girl Behind The Name) is a 2015 British documentary film that depicts the life and death of singer-songwriter Amy Winehouse and is directed by Asif Kapadia. Produced by Krishwerkz Entertainment, On The Corner Films, Playmaker Films, and Universal Music, the film is distributed by the Altitude Film Distribution and associated with Film 4. The film was released theatrically on 3 July 2015 in the United Kingdom and in the United States, before being released worldwide on 10 July. The film depicts Winehouse's life largely from the standpoint of her struggle with substance abuse problems both before and after her career began to blossom, and which eventually caused her premature death. -David Joseph, CEO of Universal Music UK. further stated: "About two years ago we decided to make a movie about her?her career and her life. It's a very complicated and tender movie. It tackles lots of things about family and media, fame, addiction, but most importantly, it captures the very heart of what she was about, which is an amazing person and a true musical genius." --Critical reception:-The film has received wide positive acclaim from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 96% rating based on 166 reviews, with an average rating of 8.5/10. The site's consensus reads, "As riveting as it is sad, Amy is a powerfully honest look at the twisted relationship between art and celebrity?and the lethal spiral of addiction." Metacritic reports an 85 out of 100 rating based on 41 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".--Family's response:-The film has been negatively criticised by Winehouse's family. They have distanced themselves from the documentary, stating the film is "misleading" and "contains some basic untruths", according to the family spokesman. On 7 May, Winehouse's father Mitch appeared on This Morning and described the film as "preposterous". He further stated:"The film is representing me in a not very good way. There is no balance, there's nothing about the foundation. It's portraying me and Amy in not a very good light." -However, he also said that the film contains "superb" and "beautiful" footage of Winehouse. He added "Half of me wants to say don't go see it. But then the other part of me is saying maybe go see the videos, put your headphones in and listen to Amy's music while they're watching the videos. It's the narrative that's the problem."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really strong and interesting doc--but also way depressing and dark...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong. When I went into this, I knew that this documentary would be dealing with some dark material up to and including the subject's ultimately tragic death at such a young age.But I guess I was expecting there to be another side of the story, where you would see glimpses of joy, moments of triumphs, or at least some exploration of Amy Winehouse's pure love of music. You can find some of that sprinkled around, but mostly this is just a dark story of misery and unhappiness from start to finish, so much so that it really becomes difficult to watch at times. But it's powerful and very moving stuff. You can't help but find yourself desperately wondering what, if anything, could have possibly been done to intervene and help save this amazingly talented young woman from being snatched away from this earth way too early. It also may make you think twice before laughing at and/or belittling the drug problems of famous celebrities. A movie like this reminds you that, despite being rich and famous, they are, at the end of the day, people just like you and me.So I would recommend this movie, but know what you're getting into. This is not some celebration of Amy Winehouse's talent, music, or spirit. It is a deeply dark and depressing look into a lonely, lost, and doomed soul. Absolutely heart-wrenching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, Amy?Why? oh why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Asif Kapadia's documentary, Amy, is often difficult to watch ? especially when you already know how it all ends. We, the audience, become transfixed as we watch Amy descend on a spiral of self- destruction ? much to the anguish of those who love and cherish her and her prodigious talent.More than one of her close friends tell us years before she died that they feared it would all end very badly. Her close friend and manager parted company with her as he could no longer bear to watch this gifted young lady slowly killing herself.It is strong stuff.The documentary is jam-packed with archive footage of Amy, her family, her friends, her husband, managers and so much more ? most of which has never been previously seen. There's some wonderful stuff, including Amy as a young girl giving one of the most soulful renditions of 'Happy Birthday' you will ever hear.She was just a happy, inoffensive 'ordinary' teenager with a massive love for music and a talent for singing.The clips are interspersed with Amy singing live ? in her sitting room, in the recording studios, live on TV ? UK and USA ? in small smoky jazz /blues venues and at massive open-air auditoriums.There is no narration ? it would have been superfluous ? and the film tracks Amy's life from her teenage years ? through her tempestuous life and brief career, to her final moments, lying on the floor of her home when her heart decided that enough was enough.It doesn't surprise me that Amy's father, Mitch, is upset about the way the film depicts him. We all know how easy it is to misrepresent people's motives in film and distort the truth. But the pedigree of Asif Kapadia, the film director, who also made the multi-award winning Senna, is of such a high calibre as to convince us that he would not go for cheap manipulation of a family member, just to get a few more bums on seats.In any case, Mitch's role in Amy's downfall is quite minor. Clearly he was at fault when he ? along with many others who were 'managing' her at the time ? decided not send Amy into rehab when she clearly needed it. How was he to know that this decision might have led to her eventual demise, and who can blame him for putting her commercial interests first. He was looking after her money?. It's easy for us to be wise after the event, and Mitch shouldn't feel so bad about it. No blame was attached to him by anyone in the documentary; we simply watched what happened and could draw our own conclusions.Maybe he "doth protest-eth too much?"Many observers, yours truly included, might well place far more of the blame at the door of her husband who was himself a serious drug addict. Arguably, he was the one who sent her on her early drug- induced binges when he dumped her. Amy's most famous album, 'Back to Black' is all about this break-up.Later, after she became famous, he goes back to her and marries her and together they go on endless booze and drug filled benders. Then he goes to jail for nearly two years for assault and perverting the course of justice. That must have helped Amy's state of mind ? she was unquestionably besotted with him.And of course, there was also the influence of her many 'hangers-on', including the pop singer, Pete Docherty who is also an addict and has been in jail for drug offences.It was a revelation to see that before she was famous Amy was adamant that she never sought fame and told her friends and family ? time and time again ? that she wouldn't know how to cope with fame and attention.Later, when she did become famous, she clearly hated all the public clamour for her. Those close to her should have taken note and made far greater efforts to protect her.Poor Amy ended up in a goldfish bowl which was created by the world's paparazzi. The more she reacted to this unbearable scrutiny by taking drugs, getting drunk and generally misbehaving, the more the paparazzi loved it!Amy was a very special and precocious talent ? a throwback to an earlier age, and she was simply not mentally equipped to be a superstar in this crazy, media-frenzied world of ours.The footage of the nerve-racked recording of her duet with Tony Bennett ? where he had to behave like a father to get her through it ? and her ultimate fall from grace, when she appeared totally intoxicated at an open-air concert in Belgrade and collapsed, unable to sing, was almost too painful to watch.But anyone who loves Amy's music, or even those who don't know much about her and her music, will find something in this film to take away with them.If you love jazz and soulful songs with deeply emotional, poetic lyrics, I guarantee you will become an Amy Winehouse fan. I am quite sure that her voice and her music will transcend her all too brief life for generations to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must watch documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ill start by mentioning that I was never really a fan of the songs Amy Winehouse released. That's not to say I don't realise just how much of an amazing voice she was blessed with, just that I never listened to her CD's, never watched a concert and would be lucky to name at least two tracks she created.However I am a fan of film, and this year seemed to watch more documentaries than I have watched in previous years. Maybe that's because I am trying to construct my own documentary film, or perhaps its because now and again I like to take a break from watching fiction films. Who knows. Who cares really.This evening I watched the latest documentary directed by Asif Kapadia whose previous feature length project 'Senna' really took the world by storm on its release. 'Amy' a two hour plus documentary put together using archival footage of the late singer Amy Winehouse, who tragically died aged 23 after a roller-coaster career in jazz music. To go into the 'plot' of not only Amy's life but also Asif's documentary would do 'Amy' a disservice. This needs to be seen and heard and makes you not only realise how talented the girl was (if you didn't already know), but also how tragic a life in the spotlight can be. Taking you back to the beginning, and taking you through to the tragic end is a wonderful (for the most) journey using audio recordings of her friends, her colleagues, and her family. Building up what perhaps is the best picture possible of someones life. Of course its hard to tell just how accurate 'Amy' is, unless you knew her (I didn't) but it makes her out to be talented, tragic, wonderful and caring.It also makes you realise just how intrusive some aspects of the media can be with scenes of camera flashbulbs going off like fireworks in November at the site of Amy leaving her house, walking down the street or even just getting in and out of a car. There are also some wonderful behind the scenes footage of her with her real life friends, smiling, laughing and joking around. Reminding you that the Amy Winehouse you think you know, isn't the real Amy Winehouse.As the month of November draws to a close and the final month of 2015 nears.'Amy' enters the top 10 films of the year as far as I am concerned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Amy" (2015) is amazingly informative, superbly paced and constructed documentary. Although i wasn't her fan, the voice is truly one of the best there ever was. The unseen videos were very interesting to see and they were greatly crafted into one story. Music is also great."Amy" is very touching at the moments, and this is a superb documentary for even those who didn't listen to her much or knew much about her (like i did). You kinda see a free and very natural young person who got amazing talent and who used it unfortunately not as much as she could. If i would have been her father, I would looked that dude away from her as far as possible - he was the reason for her downfall, these types of "drifters" are always are just a piece of xxx which uses you while there is still what to use it. Overall, "Amy" isn't about losers like that one, it is about one of the most talented young singers that probably ever lived, and how unfortunate her destiny was. It is a very involving documentary which is a must see for fans and for those who appreciate great documentaries.</fullReview>

Director , Asif Kapadia has managed to capture Amy brilliantly without having to shoot anything himself. Just like with Senna he has got friends and family to tell that story along with archive footage and it works really well. I learned many thing while watching this. I learned that she had an amazing talent for righting songs. Lyrically she was brilliant. I learnt that she had an addictive personality and her addiction helped her deal with fame yet ultimately killed her. Another thing is clear is that she had people around her who were using her. Her father being a main culprit and you can see why he didn't want this film to be made. Even if you are a not a fan her music this is well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The documentary about the life, the career and the death of Amy Winehouse is at the same time extremely well done and bone chilling. I see it similar to Facebook posts about tragedies after which you simply cannot click of the "like" sign. It deserves high number of stars for the "product" and zero stars for the misery it portraits. This is why there are no stars above my review.We're lucky that modern technology allows us to follow the events from the movie "firsthand" from home videos and media recordings. There is no need to reconstruct or interpret them. See for yourself and draw your own conclusions.Amy Winehouse was talented and was able to put that talent to good use. She had the voice and writing skills that put her among the best singers in history.The divorce of her parents in her youth led to vulnerability which would play an important role in her demise. The rest came from the people surrounding her. Calling them leeches would be too nice, the proper expression would be ticks. Unlike leeches, ticks have never been use in medicine, they can only cause medical issues.It must be difficult to survive in the limelight when a lot of people close to you simply want to suck on your blood. First the indecisive boyfriend with a habit who finally wanted to become a husband when Amy became famous. Roughly at the same time the invisible father appeared in an attempt to capitalize on his parenthood. And finally the management only wanted to keep the cash flowing.I don't want to free Amy of any personal responsibility, but in such an environment it would be hard for any individual to make the right decisions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Review: This is a very well put together documentary about the talented Amy Winehouse who touched many people around the world with her unique voice and powerful words. You get to see her amazing journey from a happy go lucky girl to a famous, self destructive, emotional being and how she used drugs and alcohol to tackle the many issues in her life. When her parents separated at an early age, she had problems with her relationships and when she finally made it big in the music world the pressure from the media became too much. All of her close friends knew that she had serious issues with drugs and alcohol so they tried to help her by sending her to rehab or by holding interventions and near the end of her life, it looked like she had taken a turn for the better but after abusing her body so much with various substances, she finally died on the 23rd of July of alcohol poisoning. Such A Waste! Her amazing song writing skills mixed with a Ella Fitzgerald type voice, made her stand out from the rest and you can tell that every word came from the heart. Her close friends filmed her during her rise to fame, so you get to see the many unpredictable sides to her behaviour. If you wasn't a fan of her music, this documentary is still worth a watch because it really does show that fame and money is not for everyone. Great Watch!Round-Up: Although Amy Winehouse was always in the media about her troubled relationships, excessive drug and alcohol abuse and outrageous behaviour, her music always told a different story. It's not everyday that you hear a jazz singer mixed with modern day music and I doubt that we will hear such a talented singer ever again. After watching this documentary, I can't help but think that it was the people around her, especially her boyfriends, that contributed to her questionable death which is why her story is so sad. With that aside, she was the first British artist to win 5 grammy's in one year and she won the 2008 Ivor Novello award for best song, musically and lyrically, for the song "Love Is A Losing Game " so her troubled life might have contributed to these timeless songs. There is an elite club called the "27 Club" which includes different artists that died at 27. Other artist in the so-called club are Kurt Cobain, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Brian Jones and Jim Morrison. Strange when you think about it! Anyway, this documentary was made by Asif Kapadia who brought you the award winning Senna and a couple of unheard movies called Far North, The Return and the Warrior. He was the perfect choice for this documentary because he had a lot of inside access to her private footage and unheard of music so this is an honest and truthful documentary that is definitely worth watching.Budget: $3.4million Worldwide Gross: $22million&nbsp;I recommend this movie to people who are into their documentary/biography/music movies about Amy Winehouse, in her own words. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intimately revealing doco</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often hard to watch and hard to take, the difficulty in watching Asif Kapadia's intimate and thorough documentary Amy doesn't stem from it being a terrible film but a haunting one, in its examination and insight into the rise and subsequent demise of famed jazz singer Amy Winehouse.Much like 2015's other homemade movie led and almost fly on the wall look at Kurt Cobain, Montage of Heck, Amy is about as close as any of us will ever get to understanding her way of life and what led her on her musical journey that in turn led to her self-destructive ways.As he did with the fantastic Ayrton Senna documentary from 2010 simply titled Senna, Kapadia shuns the usual talking heads and re-enactment way of more by the book documentaries and instead has a plethora of home video footage, concert footage and phone recordings of Amy Winehouse's life that tell the story without need for any expert opinions to be added or self-congratulatory players in her life to take up too much screen time in proceedings.There's nothing else quite like the intimacy found in home video recordings and Amy draws the audience into the downward spiral of life choices that Winehouse made and Kapadia does a fine job of never pointing the finger but allowing the facts to speak for themselves.You'll no doubt as a viewer of proceedings be able to quickly establish and pinpoint moments and players in Winehouse's life that helped led to her sad end and it's shocking, hard to fathom just what some people encouraged her to do or what those people that fed off her success and cared little for her well-being were happy to see have happen.It's unfortunate that we will never get to see just what Amy Winehouse could've become had her life outside of music taken more positive turns and while you don't have to personally love her music much like I personally don't, there's no doubt she had "something" special and there's little questioning that Amy is one of the year's most well put together documentaries and a fascinating look at one of the modern eras highest selling recording artists.4 Terry Richardson photo shoots out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can't review this film without explaining the nature of the documentary.A film-maker doing a drama knows where he wants to go and has at his disposal every possible creative tool to get there.A documentary film-maker knows where he wants to go BUT IS LIMITED BY AVAILABLE FOOTAGE as to whether he can get there or not...? This film tries to tell the AMY story -- your standard "done in by fame and drugs" story -- with the available footage.And sorta succeeds. I say "sorta" because the film is a little on the longish side, and interest tends to wane around the half-way point.It is more than a little spooky that Amy herself predicted her own end, in her own words. I was an Amy fan and yet did not know that.So kudos to this film for educating me.A for effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess I knew the basics, drug problems leading to her death. But I didn't know so much of the details of her trajectory, and seeing it play out on screen was just really heartbreaking. Like, unbelievably so. The film manages to hit you hard without feeling like it's manipulating you. Not only is it sad, but it's disturbing to witness, not just the clips of her in the last stages of her life, but then thinking back to the beginning of the film and how she came across. It also reminded me of something that I've always had an issue with- how much is too much? Comedians can be funny, but at who's expense? When does the judgment and media stop? it's ridiculous. It's all so heartbreaking and it really makes you ponder at the unfairness of it all and how fragile life can be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is first and foremost a portrait of Amy, her music and her relationships but it also shows a disgusting side of the ruthless music and media industry.Bot the good and the bad of Amy is shown, but all in all she comes across as a lovable person. She is funny, talented, energetic and caring of other people.It is sad to watch as the one thing that makes her tacle her demons, her music, becomes a demon itself as she gets pushed into this role she is not made for.The film shows that many persons around Amy cares for her, and try the best they can to help her, her friends, her bodyguard and fellow musicians to name a few. But there are also some persons who clearly fail to put Amys best interest first. And with her self destructiveness, Amy herself is one of them.The film manages to show Amys personality, and the mix between video footage, Amys songs and interviews of the people who knew her is a good way to tell the story.It makes me think if her dying like this was really inevitable, and how important parents are for their children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amy's painful life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know it'll be sad when you enter the cinema, and you leave it with a fulfilled prediction. We see Amy Winehouse's home videos, first appearances as a singer, teasing the camera and her friends. Her voice rises with its amazing quality from an early age, and the voice determines her way in the world.You get the feeling that the director Asif Kapadia has a very strong opinion about the reasons that led to Amy's death. I felt a little uncomfortable about the way he shows her father-greedy and exploitative, this father doesn't stop to notice his daughter's desperation. Blake, the boy friend, and later the husband, the man she's always obsessed about doesn't make the director's life too hard. As a boyfriend he looks smitten by Amy, and his destructive vein is a bad coincidence. But when they get married, and she is already a star, the look in his eyes is different, calculated, and frightening. Amy was bulimic, and she smoked a lot of pot since early on. She always sought excitement, drama, and didn't always treat close people with affection. But she had a spark, wit, joy, and she loved music and had an urge to be original and authentic. It's impossible not to like her. Interestingly, she says on several occasions that she wouldn't be able to handle a big success. Tony Bennett and others say she should have stayed a jazz musician the way she started, and deal with intimate spaces and a different kind of career. Probably true.She is almost always on the screen, even when others speak. Her face is fascinating, her eyes appealing. She changes hair and dressing styles. But the most important thing is that her voice, her music and lyrics accompany us from beginning to end, as the story unfolds and the sense of loss becomes unbearable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sad Account of Amy Winehouse.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amy (2015): Dir: Asif Kapadia / Featuring: Amy Winehouse, Mitchell Winehouse, Janis Winehouse, Raye Cosbert, Blake Fielder: Here is the sad account of talent undone and ultimately crushed by the stress of fame and the question of trust. Amy Winehouse was a media sensation pop star and is the focus of the found footage documentary that ultimately reveals her spiral into drugs and alcohol before being carried away in a body bag. Director Asif Kapadia makes great use of footage of Winehouse. We are shown her childhood relationship with her mother, which is strong. Her father was absent throughout most of her life until she scored success with her pop / jazz sound, which gained her multiple awards. This is a picture of somebody pushed beyond what the victim is expecting. She desires performance and success to a degree. What she was not ready for was the media frenzy that followed. She is ambushed by photographers constantly and her friends worry about those in control of her life. Her father is filmed as somebody who will not likely win "Father of the Year." He constantly pushes his daughter out onto the road on tour to the point where she refuses to perform in Serbia. Her husband Blake Fielder is arrested for drugs. He and Amy are seen under the influence and several trips to rehab is countered by her ties with Fielder. Raye Cosbert is seen as her manager who had high hopes for Amy until it all came down. This is a great depiction of the price of fame and stories viewers have witnessed through numerous other celebrities, some of whom meet the same horrid fate as Amy. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Charting of Amy Winehouse's Success and Her Downward Spiral</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies about musicians usually adhered to a tried and true template - after a stratospheric rise to fame, the musician usually succumbs to a personal crisis, usually drug or alcohol abuse. This is then usually followed by a redemptive final arc. In Amy Winehouse's case this arc never did come and we are robbed of one of the most distinctive singing voices of this present generation. One of the problems that most of these music biopics (or documentaries for that matter) have is they tend to forget the reason why we might be interested in the first place - the music. We do get to see some staple footage of the musician performing some hits but we never get to see the creative process and in the end the movie becomes a greatest hits compilation album. Thankfully this is absolutely not true in Amy. This is the story of Amy Winehouse in her own words, featuring unseen archival footage and unheard tracks.Asif Kapadia (Senna) keeps the music front and centre, because music defines Amy. Her uncompromising and risqué lyrics always juxtaposed with her performances, and just like that I realized the killer lyrics are stories from her life. This is a girl way matured for her age. We also get to witness her early talent through many self-documented videos, on-the- spur-of-the moment vids and voiced interviews without any talking heads. I came away from the film feeling that I got to understand the flawed persona of Amy Winehouse and I also marveled at her growth from a brave teenager into a worldwide superstar. One can appreciate her consummated attitude towards the writing of her music at her own terms. All through the meticulously curated videos, I watched with a bittersweet feeling because I know the destructive storm front coming in. The editing of all these videos and short films is profoundly seamless. The charting of Amy's life is chronologically devastating. Asif Kapadia's eye for telling details is excellent as he must have looked through all the videos carefully which were given to him with the family's blessings. The documentary does not finger anyone overtly but one will surely come away with the notion that her ex-husband, Blake Fielder and her father, Mitch Winehouse, had the most part to play with her spiral into oblivion. The paparazzi is also a killer but one can argue that Amy is the victim of her own success. The scene of her getting booed by thousands at a concert held in Serbia is just devastatingly sad. Who can return from that moment of utter shame? I was also in emotional pain as Amy becomes the brunt of cruel jokes on late night shows. What made it so excruciatingly ironic is that she was actually celebrated at the same late night shows months ago. The pain is so real. If I can feel it, I wonder how Amy must have felt then. Who then are the guilty ones that drove her to self-destruction. Fame, when one is not ready for it, is a very scary thing. Much as it was sad observing her downward spiral, I was emotionally stirred watching her final recording on Sep 2011, a duet with her idol, Tony Bennett. One can clearly observed her vulnerability and her awe for Bennett. It was a superb heartfelt performance and sadly it would be her last recording in a studio. This is an outstanding documentary even though it is not easy to watch. With a slightly punishing runtime of 128min, it was a little too thorough for its own good. I doubt I would want to sit through it again because I don't think I want to feel all the anguish and pain again. It is so clear that she is an accident waiting to happen and yet I am sure her closest friends were powerless to help her. Who can stop a force of nature? This is a cautionary tale and it is an essential must-see.</fullReview>

She gets inspiration from all kinds of stimulus, alcohol, drugs, etc. It seemed like many artists need stimulus outside to give them inspirations.But what impresses me more is how she becomes a prisoner of her own lifestyle and how hypocritical the society and media are, they can give you the uttermost fame, and mock you as the ugliest bitch in the world.Life is short, experience what the world can give you.People are evil, focus on where you are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amy a documentary about Amy Winehouse is absolutely brilliant.Amy has an incredible sound and is an amazing singer, we all know that. However, in this movie we do not just see her as the amazing singer she is. We see her as a person, a person who laughs and is an overall happy girl who relieves herself with her talent but we also see her battles, how she tried to fight them every single time. It's incredibly tragic and I do think that this movie honors her as a person and not just as a young woman on a poster. Asif respects her feelings, her perspective and how she wanted to stay herself. This bio-doc was one of the best I've seen yet. I've watched multiple bio-docs on musicians variating from Tupac to Kurt Cobain but this one was by far the most moving one. Almost after every piece of music we saw in the cinema, it made me want to stand up and applaud. Another important thing: I went her with my grandparents who are over 80years old and tend to fall asleep in the cinema and so have a hard time following the storyline after a while, which is a shame. However, they absolutely enjoyed the movie and had no moment they fell asleep and could follow the whole way through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is long, but gripping as the end comes swiftly to tell us of her death. That was a poignant moment for me - seeing her in the body bag being taken from her home. Her bodyguard saying 'she was laying there...but she was gone.'...I did shed a tear. I saw Amy Winehouse on the Frank tour and then again with the next album. She was a stunning performer, but at the second gig, she was clearly intoxicated and stumbling. I felt sorry for her to a point, but having seen this film and what seems like her exploitation by her father and Blake, I really do feel for her. She was on self- destruct, of course, but I really thought, at the time, that she would bounce back, so her death actually came as a massive shock to me. She was amazingly talented and a truly interesting woman and will be missed. Initially this films almost portrays her as a narcissistic, overbearing rebel, but her character is revealed in nuances and you see the extreme vulnerability in her, despite her always having her guard up and even maintaining that somewhat in this film. You never really quite 'know' Amy and that's what makes her so interesting, but I think she wanted to be understood, though never was, which is incredibly sad. A short life, but what a force.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 2010, British director Asif Kapadia gave us a brilliant documentary about the life and death of Brazilian Formula One racing driver Ayrton Senna. Five years later, he has produced an equally compelling documentary about the life and death of British jazz singer Amy Whitehouse. He uses the same techniques: amateur and professional film footage from a whole variety of sources stitched together to provide a straight-line narrative with voice-overs from all kinds of people who knew her.What makes "Amy" even more poignant than "Senna" is that she died so young (just 27) and her vulnerabilities emerged so soon and were so obvious to those who cared for her and cared to know. Maybe such a self-destructive personality, someone who was depressed and bulimic who drank to massive excess and took lots of hard drugs, was almost bound to hit a brick wall, but one cannot view this documentary without feeling that she was let down terribly by some of the people who apparently loved her the most, including her father Mitch, her mother Janis and her husband Blake Fielder-Civil.Kapadia provides us with plenty of Amy's singing (what a stunning v</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent documentary on an excellent artist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Amy" will open your eyes to two things; the first being Amy's incredible talent, the second being the seldom spoken of, and ugly side of fame and celebrity culture.I should start off by clarifying that the only Amy Winehouse song I had ever heard before seeing this documentary was "Rehab", but after seeing her talent and hearing her music, I will definitely make an effort to hear more than just her biggest hit in the future. The underlying theme in "Amy" is the contrast of Amy's desires to live a private and quiet life making music, with the reality of her ever growing fame. The movie links her problems with addiction, as well as Amy's tumultuous relationships, both romantic and platonic, to the seemingly never ending and inescapable stream of paparazzi and media scrutiny that she endured until her death. "Amy" also features countless live performances of Amy's music from the age of 18 and onward, all intertwined with her lyrics, their meaning, and their origins, which are used to emphasize and highlight her problems with, relationships, addiction, health (both mental and physical), as well as highlight her unique personality. I wouldn't say that "Amy" shows what Amy was really like because I didn't know her and I never will, and it's not very likely that a documentary aiming to capitalize on her life would show you the "real" Amy instead of the one that is most appealing to an audience. But it does show a very clear and interesting version of an Amy different than the one the media portrayed when she was still alive. Ultimately "Amy" brings great insight to someone who was a "once in a generation" musical talent, provides an interesting look into her life and career, and raises important questions about our treatment of stars in today's celebrity culture. I would recommend this to anyone who has any interest in music, culture, psychology or sociology, or wants to learn about another member of the 27 club and the many causes of her untimely death. 8.5/10</fullReview>

After watching the film I was enthused by her music, which I was not much acquainted with, and walked the following day into two music shops...nothing to be found! Amazing that they have not issued a MUSIC SOUNDTRACK to be available to new discoverers like myself. Is it a copyright issue or an agreement between the producer and the music owners ? The movie does not loose rhythm all along and poses the eternal question: how can we stop great artists from effacing themselves once they gain fame, money, surround themselves with slaves that only follow orders (go get me this drug,...).

		<fullReview>Devastating documentary on the life and death of singer Amy Winehouse. It was an odd and painful experience watching her burnout as quick as she did. As an American, I discovered her through her second record, Back to Black, and basically that was the last piece of art she ever created. It was all downhill from there (her first album came out in the US the year after). It basically announced she was doomed from the first track, and we just had to sit back and be entertained by it, which made her fans implicit in her destruction. Her artistry was impossible to deny, whatever the case. The film tells the full story of her career and what led her to her destruction. Really, it wasn't that complicated: she had an enormously addictive personality and those who benefited from it made sure anyone who actually wanted to get her help got pushed out of her life. Her ex-husband, Blake Fielder, comes off particularly bad, as does her father (whom you'll immediately remember is mentioned in "Rehab" as the guy who told her she didn't need to go). The film is deeply moving, and her music is put front and center, with the lyrics often thrown up on screen (and often beautifully illuminating the narrative of the film).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad End for Member of the 27 Club</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came to Winehouse late, after hearing Back To Black. Before and after all I knew about her was the tabloid Amy, the one that was a drunk and drug user.But she was so much more than the character the tabloids portrayed. She really was a powerful and talented singer and songwriter. She was a great jazz singer that could dazzle a small crowd of jazz enthusiasts or a stadium of young rock fans. The documentary takes a usual chronological line from her early notice as a singer to her death in London at the age of 27. And even at over 2 hours the movie does not go into any depth about her demons and death.Most of what I know about her I discovered when I read the book 27 by Brian Sounes. Like Joplin, Jones, Hendrix, Cobain and Morrison, Winehouse lived without the responsibility of following the rules. I remember when Elvis dies and everyone blamed the Memphis Mafia for allowing him to abuse his body to the point he died at the age of 44. But who was going to stop him? He would just fire anyone that got in his way of what he wanted. His entourage really did care about him but they were helpless at stopping him.The movie doesn't show just how bad her addictions really were and that Belgrade was not the only time she got on stage totally messed up. And the last thing she needed was a husband that introduce cocaine to her.But my biggest problem with the movie was her death. Winehouse liked to text and skype her friends and the night she died no one was available to get together (they all had things to do withe their own lives) so she stayed home and drank. A lot. More than someone as petite as Winehouse could safely put away. And since she was alone and not going out, her bodyguard never had a reason to leave another part of the house to check on her. She died as much from loneliness that night as anything and despite how awful her husband and father were to feeding off her earnings it's ultimately not fair to put the blame on them.Despite the superficial nature of the movie I still give it a 9 out of 10 because she was such a special talent and fascinating person. Maybe someday a more in depth doc can be made that really shows her talent and demons.R.I.P. Amy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The girl under the beehive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many others have offered up excellent reviews of "Amy", that it's unnecessary to recount the story. We all know about the girl under the beehive hairdo, but do we really? Director Asif Kapadia has crafted an unflinching look at talent and the price of fame. As the best documentaries can do, the viewer is inexorably drawn into the story. "Amy" is a stunning achievement. Those who didn't know, or care about this woman's musical gifts and only followed her sad misadventures on the covers of supermarket tabloids cannot deny the artist she was.Amy was a unique creature, a true jazz singer in an age of auto- tuned and manufactured pop stars. A gifted writer as well as a gifted singer, the high points of this film are watching the rare footage of Amy doing what she did best, singing. The conceit of showing her words on the screen as she sings was a brilliant move by the director. "Rehab", her best known work is revealed as a rather silly throwaway pop tune, ironically becoming the song that made her world-famous. The power of songs such as "Back in Black" and "Love is a Losing Game" are undeniable.Two unsettling sequences emerge in the film's second half. One, watching Amy's unscrupulous husband Blake Fielder-Civil being interviewed at a restaurant. He's drunk and asks who's paying for the booze he's swilling since he's admitted that he's broke. He smirks and gestures at Amy, sitting a table away. The look he gives says it all. She's got the fame, attention, and money...but it's really all his. Chilling. The second sequence is Amy's last public appearance at a huge concert in Serbia. She's drunk and refuses to sing. The vast crowd goes from loving her to hating her in a heartbeat. It's impossible to look at her in the footage and not realize the end is very near. In a film that has a number of tear- inducing scenes, this is the one that finally got me. Amy is eaten alive and we all got to watch it. The rest is history.At two hours, the film feels a little too long and covers the same ground a number of times. Other than that, this is really worth seeing. You don't have to be a fan of Amy's to understand what killed her. She came undone by both her personal demons and those who used her, when all she really wanted was to play music, her way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Rating: &#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;? out of 4)This film is highly recommended.In brief: An engrossing documentary that shows the downward spiral of a talented performer going to extremes.GRADE: B+The tortured artist. A staple in modern fiction. But when fiction becomes a harsh reality, watching a human train-wreck can be an unsettling experience, especially for anyone who comes near their orbit. Such is the case in a documentary that delve into the life of a gifted talent. Amy directed by Asif Kapidia, depicts the chaotic life of singer-songwriter Amy Winehouse. It follows the highs and lows of her career and the adrenalin rush to fame which makes for compelling drama. The film is all the more disturbing due to the honesty and passion of the filmmakers involved. &#xfffc; Amy expertly incorporates home videos from her teenage years until her death at age 23, with live performances and interviews with those close to her. It is her musical concert segments that shows off the deep-rooted talent and her special style of phrasing that are particularly effective. Her behind-the-scenes archival footage is shockingly candid in its access to this artist. Her songs are so autobiographical that they chronicle her rise and fall. Interviews with friends and family show that the loves in her short life, her father Mitch and her lover, Blake Fielder-Civil, did as much (or more) harm to this vulnerable lost human being than she did to herself. The girl never had a chance to survive from her dysfunctional family, her drug-crazed lover and husband, and the intense media spotlight with its swarm of paparazzi parasites always outside her door. Besides her addiction to alcohol and drugs, Amy also suffered from manic depression and bulimia. The film is a harrowing tale, hard to watch at times. But it never shies away from the many tragedies that befell Ms. Winehouse.&#xfffc;Amy is very well researched and becomes a powerful tribute to a unique talent. Kapidia is a unique talent too. He has a diligent and caring vision to share and places Amy's live performances center stage (along with some previously unreleased tracks) to emphasize the before-and-after effects of a promising career cut short. He does tend to overdo the use of graphics, filling the screen with song lyrics that become unnecessarily redundant and artsy. But the filmmaker captures this artist's body and, more importantly, her soul (especially in a rehearsal with Tony Bennett) that is so moving to witness. Her admiration for this musical legend and elder statesman is almost childlike in her expressions and approach to Mr. Bennett and his compassion to her resonates in this telling scene. Amy is one of the finest documentaries that one will hope to find this year. It is must-see viewing for any serious music aficionado or cinephile.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The importance of discipline, from your friends, family, peers, and yourself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We are constantly told two of the cardinal sins of fame that can lead to one's downfall, or even make it imminent, are greed and power, but what about the lack of self-discipline or discipline in a broad sense? If you grew up fairly undisciplined, allowed to do almost anything you pleased, and, in turn, grew up with the inability to really distinguish right from wrong in a sense of moral guidance, aren't you just as doomed to fail as the person who wants a few more zeroes added on to their net-worth or some more buildings for his or her already large namesake? Asif Kapadia's "Amy" quietly asks that question whilst giving us an intimate look into the life of Amy Winehouse, the famous pop/jazz musician who took off soaring high in the music career before falling prey to drug and alcohol addiction, which killed her at twenty-seven. Kapadia exercises some fairly commendable self-discipline with this documentary right off the bat, avoiding "talking heads" or on-camera interviews unless they were part of older programs, thus making this film largely built off of home videos and archival footage.Over the course of two hours, we watch Amy Winehouse, with her often multi-colored hair perched in a thick bun, winged eyebrows, large hoop earrings, and beautiful, powerful voice grow from a simple songwriter, who kept quietly to herself in her flat, smoking weed and writing music to a globally recognized sensation. Unlike most documentaries, "Amy" starts following Winehouse as she's building her fame in the early 2000's, rather than focusing on her childhood. Kapadia works with the massive amount of material he and producers were fortunate enough to obtain of Winehouse, as he covers her many relationships, particularly with Blake Fielder-Civil, the rise of her music, and her subsequent Grammy win over Jay-Z, Rihanna, and Justin Timberlake.Winehouse's addiction to cocaine, heroin, crack, and alcohol plays a big role in this documentary, so much so that seeing the addiction contrast with concerts and monumental awards shows paints a haunting picture of fame that we rarely see. An unsettling scene comes during one of Winehouse's many stints in rehab, where she is told by the person filming her to sing modified lyrics of her song "Rehab" to fit her experiences. The rawness and inconsiderate request is frightening, and seeing personal photos of Winehouse, taken by her undoubtedly under the influence of God knows what, create this tantalizing and uniquely original look into her life.Returning to the idea of self-discipline, Winehouse's longtime friend and manager Nick Shymansky, who gets the most time in voiceovers, comments about her upbringing that her lack of self-discipline came from not having much reprimanding as a child. Even Winehouse affirms his statements by saying that she remembers her and her siblings running around the house at a young age, zealously getting into trouble, with little to no comment from her mother. In some way, the children were crying for attention, but attention on a disciplinary level was rarely, if ever, given. With that, Winehouse grew up not knowing when enough was enough. From disrupted concerts that had her refusing to sing, to drug and alcohol episodes that left her inside her flat for days on end, to massive doses of various narcotics, and her struggles with self-harm and bulimia, Winehouse knew no limits and had a difficult time keeping herself on the right path during all this fame.Juliette Lewis, one of Winehouse's closest friends, recalls when Winehouse won a Grammy for her album "Back to Black." At this time, Winehouse had been clean of all drugs. We see Winehouse gathered before many of her friends in a London theater, showered with love and unconditional applause upon the announcement that she won the award. Shortly after winning, Winehouse, who looks dazed but still aware throughout the entire thing, apparently took Lewis backstage and said, "this is no fun without drugs." The only questionable part of Kapadia's documentary is its critique on the persistent media frenzy that escalated around Winehouse during the time of her drug use and downward spiral. Several scenes in the documentary show Winehouse, and even us, the audience members, blinded by the flashing lights of dozens of paparazzi resulting in a sensory overload I've never quite experienced from something like this before. This is meant to criticize the way the media handled Winehouse's drug and alcohol problems, but isn't Kapadia doing the same thing, gathering a plethora of different pictures and little-seen footage to publicize Winehouse's story and troubles? I don't lose a great deal of sleep over this predominately because of the fact that where the media's goal was to sensationalize and garner viewers, Kapadia's approach seems much more human. He looks at a soul with a great deal of talent, who, however, lacked discipline and, towards the end of her life, when she needed support from family the most, experienced family company during a reality show instead of the quality, one-on-one time she really needed. "Amy," through everything, plays more like a warning than anything; a warning to artists with unbelievable talent that their personal demons, whether they are muted or present at the time of their fame, can reveal themselves during the most significant times in their life. It's all about how we can control them, and as we've seen through countless documentaries and "Behind the Music" specials, limiting the impact and influence of one's own personal flaws with hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, of eyes constantly watching and judging is a daunting task.</fullReview>

Then the movie came out. I thought, no thanks. Then it won an Oscar. So I thought I should at least give it a try. I am sickened that it won. Every other movie in the category was vastly better. All they did was piece clips together and retell the tabloid story. The oldest story in the world. They should have just called it Daddy Problems. Yes, she did a great job copying an age old art from across the pond. She lucked out because people thought it was super cool she could make that sound and be white. LOL.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Discovering anew</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amy tells a tragic tale, in what amounts to an enthralling documentary that does an exceptional job in humanizing the artist. It's a challenge, because of the disconnect between the public persona and the human being, ever-widening when a musician, actor or any other individual with a modicum of fame goes "global". Personally, I rarely thought of Amy Winehouse, as I had heard little of her music and related more to the tabloid facts that swamped the internet. So the movie's effect on me was powerful in revealing a passionate artist who lost her way between the lights and flashes.Her story is relayed to us through a number of homemade clips and films, shot by friends or acquaintances. It takes the viewer to her earlier days as an artist, where the entourage is not an entourage in its hyped sense, but just a circle of friends. From there, the seemingly small steps towards worldwide fame are contorted and unreadable. Because the film is a composition of private videos, it creates a familiar and intimate experience and tears down the sense of artificiality often inherent to biopics which jump between the now and the then. It becomes impossible not to get involved emotionally and empathize without feeling as if you're being manipulated to do so.The film is powerful because it knows how to construct and frame all the public fragments that made up Amy Winehouse from within, so to say - by transcending from her personal experiences. Sure, there's a touch of the banal in the story, a been there, seen that kind of feeling. But it is this banality that actually makes for a powerful tragedy, the mesh of strange personal networks, personal quirks and public politics that shaped Amy's life and fate. Once you go beyond the narrative, it's unlikely not to be touched by how hard it all hit the bubbly girl from London. My main critique to the film is that, similar to his work on Senna, the director puts Amy on a pedestal: she appears trapped by her social circles, the people trying to control her, her own addiction, but it looks mostly inflicted upon her than anything else. This deterministic approach, while surely pertinent and enhancing the sense of tragic, undermines the idea that Winehouse was a powerful artist, something that comes across through her music. The paradox is part of the core artistic choices made by Kapadia, a token from how much intimacy is imbued in the documentary. As such, it is wise to look at Amy as something else than an exercise in exploring the downwards spiral of addiction. It does her right as a musician and duly criticizes the destructive power of parts of the media that catalyzed all her insecurities, her troubled family life and her relationships. It brings her closer to her fans and the audience, and provides ample food for thought about how sweet and sour and short life can be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tony Bennett: "If she had lived, I would have said:. slow down; you're too important... Life teaches you, really how to live it... if you could live long enough".The best words to sum up "Amy" are heartbreaking, tragic and really depressing. It's a real shame that a talent like Winehouse could have some much wrong with her (mentally) and how her flaws killed her at the end. But she has left us with her talent and her knock out songs, and this Documentary brilliantly shows that. While it's not the best Documentary I've seen, because this one dose follow the same formula like other Documentary's do, but it is still great and absolutely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, since I have read that Adele just cried for hours after seeing the movie, I decided to give it a go although I cannot consider myself a grand fan of hers. However, some of the singles I just adore. I must say that it is no surprise the film won Oscar because it is a high quality pic and there were no paparazzis and yellow stuff. I also must admit that it lacked a bit, some deeper insights in Amy's life, some shocking something...Otherwise I just knew all that. The movie is basically built on her songs, i.s., what she herself wanted to tell about herself. Maybe what I lacked as well was the subtle character of the badness of drugs and alcohol, it must have been stressed more somehow to impress new minds. It is a must for everyone who did not know Amy well. Or a high quality memory film for those for whom she is very dear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Courageous doco</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Congratulations for the creators of this doco for trying to be as truthful as possible, although it's a devastatingly sad journey. The film, to me, conveys that Amy Winehouse was not cut out to be famous. She was way too vulnerable. She would have been better off being a songwriter or club jazz performer or producer. Like so many other performers before her, she didn't have the mental strength to cope with the high pressure life she was thrust into. It was obvious to me that bulimia was probably Winehouse's chief physical problem, with alcohol a secondary, but not insignificant, demon she had to wrestle. The producers have got hold of some extraordinary footage of a young teenage Amy - looking like a perfectly normal girl - with a voice- over saying how she hated how overweight she was. It's obscene that we see her much later on, in her 20s, deathly thin, but still thinking she's fat. She was very, very ill, but there was no one - least of all herself - who was able to throw her a lifeline that was going to save her. And it all played out in front of the cameras. The film asks the question, was Amy the only one who could have saved herself? I am not sure. She did not deserve to die so young, but she was on a downhill trajectory that no one could stop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully edited and tells its sad story very efficiently</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After attending a premiere screening of Amy, I returned home and began aimlessly flicking through the music channels. And in those few minutes, skimming past pretty baby-faced boys and pairs of breasts that sing, relentlessly repetitive thumping beats that steal from - sorry, "sample" - far superior music from eons ago laden with lyrics that sing about nightclubs, sex and alcohol, and music videos that exist as little more than tawdry commercials for corporations to flog their products, one of the many messages of the film hit me over the head like an ashtray in a sock. Amy stands not only as a study of the downfall of an outstanding artist, but also of the music industry as a whole.We all know this already: Amy Winehouse was an exceptionally talented, yet deeply troubled artist. But what many don't realise, and what this film beautifully shows, is what she stood for within the industry, and society as a whole. Amy simply did not fit in the modern music scene, where so much attention is devoted to sales figures, charts, money and looks, and so little to the art itself. What's more, she was taken advantage of by a long parade of people who were supposed to care for her, but instead used her humble and introverted nature for their own gains. The film is beautifully edited and tells its sad story very efficiently, combining previously unseen footage of the singer with interviews from the people who knew her best. It's made with care and sensitivity towards its subject, and it does what it sets out to do. Hopefully, those who see the film will forget the paparazzi photographs of her falling out of nightclubs and will instead think of her beautiful voice and her young, bright eyes full of hope - even if, alas, the outcome is in no doubt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tragedy of Fame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not particularly like or follow Amy Winehouse as an artist when she was alive, and the footage of her performing in the documentary about her life and death, "Amy," doesn't make me a convert. But one doesn't have to be a fan to enjoy "Amy," since the film is less about Winehouse's story and more about the general effect fame can have on people who aren't able to cope with it.Winehouse's story is terribly sad and tragic. But it also enrages. To watch a vicious entertainment industry and public tear her apart as her struggles with drug and alcohol addiction worsen makes one question how much more callous humanity can get. And the leeches in her personal life, including a boyfriend who wants her to stay addicted so that he can have access to drugs himself and a monster of a father, make clear that she didn't have a chance. Damning footage of Jay Leno shows him making jokes about her personal struggles even after he had her on his show on a previous episode."Amy" highlights a tendency in our culture to assume that because celebrities put themselves in the limelight they by default forfeit all claims to common decency or humanity. The film is nominated this year for Best Documentary Feature at the Academy Awards, and while it doesn't deserve to win over the truly great "The Look of Silence," it did work its way into my head and left me thinking about it for a while after I'd seen it.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Banksy claimed that art should comfort the disturbed and disturb the comfortable. "Amy" is one of the few documentaries that manages to do just that, through unraveling the heartbreaking story of a true artist and a wholehearted human. It really shakes your world. Without the need of catchy clips or gossipy statements, it delivers a story of a poet, a singer and a performer. You really get to meet Amy Winehouse, you feel like you've known her, you can sense her pure talent and raw personality. The documentary also manages to provide a clear image of the pop and media culture and how it treats a unique and different public figure, but it does it without implying anything. Lastly, the power of this work is that even though it's centered around Amy's life, it leaves you questioning about important aspects of life and of how everything interconnects. "Amy" is a must-watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The documentary "Amy" on the rise and fall of Amy Winehouse was astounding in its filmmaking and delivery, but it was a bitter pill to swallow on how such a talented jazz artist let bulimia, alcohol, and drugs end her career but most importantly her life. I was shocked how much footage Director Asif Kapadia was able to gather on Amy's music career and her life itself, it was "asif" he was part of Amy's world. Sure, Kapadia does exhibit aspects of Amy's life that we knew already, but reinforces it in his deep documentary; but in the end, it was not too complex its main message that Amy should have gone to rehab, I say yes, yes, yes. Amy Winehouse will always be remembered, its so disheartening that her life was cut short. Another genuine talented artist gone too soon. OK, that's my review, now I'm back to black, I mean fade to black. ***** Excellent</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kapadia delivers another incisive, illuminating documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Documentary film maker Asif Kapadia continues his slightly morbid fixation with documenting the lives of dead celebrities, following 2010's Senna, with this examination of the life of late singer Amy Winehouse, which has that slightly higher touch of cultural relevance, because of the more recent times she occupied.The life of Amy Winehouse can best be described as being like a beautiful, grand plane flying high majestically in the sky, before the engine exploded and it came hurtling down in the air, hopelessly and inevitably, exploding into flames as it went, destructing in the most terrible of ways before the even grimmer finale. It was a tale of a young woman with the greatest, most accomplished of voices, with a talent to take her the world over, who became corrupted by drugs and a hedonistic party lifestyle that came to overshadow her abilities, before meeting her end that grim day in 2011.From the off-set, this is a girl who shows signs that the life her talent will guide her in will cause its own problems. "I couldn't be famous, I'd go crazy" we hear her say at the very start of the film, only for something similar to emanate later after success at an awards ceremony. What's quite surprising, for someone who gained most of their insight into her life just from what was read in the papers, was just how strong her London accent was, leading Johnathan Ross to once comment 'how common' she sounded on his show.This was a girl whose life was never out of the papers, until her life ended, and the garish freak show it had become suddenly stopped generating all the increasingly lurid gossip column inches it did. It's hard not to strike a balance with the life of Princess Diana, shining a light on the issue of tabloid responsibility and accountability. Kapadia has once again done a thorough examination of his subject, and really created an in-depth study of some incredible highs, before the terrible and final lows. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Amy' explores an artist and celebrity with incredibly unique perspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A documentary on the life of Amy Winehouse could easily have been done in a conventional manner a long the lines of A&amp;E's "Biography" series and still been plenty compelling. Winehouse was an enigma whose tempestuous relationships with people and drugs made for ideal tabloid fodder as well as a fascinating character study. But Asif Kapadia ("Senna") strives for something more with "Amy" and it has a more powerful effect.The film is assembled almost entirely from archive footage and images, which provides an unprecedented degree of proximity to the subject, Winehouse. Somehow, friends and colleagues took so much video of her, and Kapadia uses it to give us an authentic window into her personality, particularly the early years. Of course as time marches on and Winehouse is struck with stardom, so much of the film transfers over to paparazzi footage. The contrast is kind of stunning.The film also uses only audio voice-over testimonials (we see none of the people interviewed in the film as they are being interviewed, only through photos and old footage,) so the frame remains tightly fixed on Winehouse and allows us to really focus on and explore her many dimensions.Kapadia is also intrigued by Winehouse's music and makes her lyrics a major lens with which we are to view her as a person. She talks at one point about how she couldn't write lyrics that weren't directly about her experiences, so naturally the songs pair well with certain segments of the film/her life. In this way, "Amy" approaches the subject's craft and creativity in a way no film about an artist has before. "Amy" doesn't overdramatize Winehouse's life, but Kapadia does make choices to focus on the difficult and uncomfortable components. He wants his audience to take note of the many factors that likely contributed to the dark parts of her life and consider what might've been had those negative influencers been handled appropriately. At times, even though the film is so fixed on Winenhouse, it manages to hold a mirror up to the audience. We dismissed her as another irresponsible, drug-addled pop star when clearly she was a down-to-earth jazz singer underneath it all. When we crave and demand certain things from artists and we take pleasure in consuming more than just their craft, we contribute to fame that some people simply aren't meant to endure."Amy" is a relatively long documentary, and it's insistence on raw footage can make for a challenging watch, but investing in Kapadia's method of storytelling results in such a rich experience and way of exploring a person's life. Other documentaries provide much more traditional forms of portrayals and storytelling, but it's the raw, focused, alternative perspective of "Amy" that makes it unique and powerful.~Steven CThanks for reading!

However, her many self-destructive problems would eventually overwhelm her and she would die at the age of 27. This documentary has many of her friends and supporters describing her rise and her deterioration. Her mother is weak and her estranged father is problematic. She suffered from bulimia, drug and alcohol abuse. I wasn't a big fan but like most people, I think her Rehab song is awesome. What I didn't realize is how personal her songwriting is. The best aspect of the movie is how the songs' lyrics are written out describing each one of her life's journey. It makes the Rehab utterly heartbreaking. The words "if my daddy thinks I'm fine" have a whole new meaning. Her dad is a real piece of work. This is a great documentary that is not simply for the fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching Cobain: Montage of Heck, the documentary about Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain, and now this absorbing commentary on the late Amy Winehouse, it's challenging to determine what separated their experiences. Both singers died at the age of twenty-seven from substance abuse. Kurt was addicted to heroin and she was embroiled in drugs and alcohol before perishing from alcohol poisoning. They were young, extremely gifted, surprisingly disinterested in fame and unprepared for the success in their early years. They were also both individuals who were difficult to condition to what record studios might deem a generic image or personality for a music label. Most importantly, both their deaths were arguably preventable by the people around them. The accountability is what makes Amy an angrier, more focused and richer documentary than director Asif Kapadia's previous film Senna. Senna was about the fate of Formula One racing legend Ayrton Senna, whose death held an air of mystery surrounding it. Without Senna Kapadia may not have been able to make this film. The targets and the accusations are bigger and with this it has inevitably upset more people. Any documentary conjuring these reactions from its subjects isn't playing it safe and the provocation, involving the industry and personal relationships, is fascinating to behold.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'AMY': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A British documentary flick, on pop singer-songwriter Amy Winehouse. The movie studies the popular musician's life; until her tragic death, at the age of 27 (in July of 2011). It was directed by Asif Kapadia, who also helmed the critically acclaimed 2010 race driver documentary film 'SENNA'. 'AMY' won the 2016 Academy Award, for Best Documentary feature, and it was almost unanimously praised by critics (it was also a huge hit at the Box Office, as well). I found it to be a very impressive film!The movie uses unseen video footage (of Amy), dating back to 1988, to tell her story. The filmmakers also recorded over 100 interviews; with friends and family members, of the pop star. The story details Amy's troubles with drugs, alcohol, relationships, bulimia, family and fame. It's a very insightful look into her extremely complicated life.I knew very little about Amy Winehouse, before seeing this movie (I don't follow pop music much). I do like her songs though; and think she was a very talented, and extremely beautiful, person. She also had a very fascinating, and passionately troubled, life. I can really relate to her problems; with love and alcohol abuse. It's somewhat comforting, and also disturbing, to see that she had even more severe problems than me (despite her fame and fortune). It's a very fascinating film!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/n2qWxeZ0Tck</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed by Asif Kapadia (The Return, Senna), I first heard about this film when it was getting mixed attention in the press, specifically from those who knew the person who is focused in the film, then of course awards season came and it got nominated, I was always going to watch it. Amy Jade Winehouse was born 14 September 1983, this film depicts the life of the British singer-songwriter, charting her stratospheric rise to fame. The film is made up of archive footage from Amy's television appearances, such as performances in the recording studio and on stage, stills from newspaper and magazine articles, never-before-seen family and friends home video footage recorded by Amy herself and others, previously unheard tracks, including rare live sessions, and voice overs of her family, friends and others, including previously unheard calls and messages. The film starts in 1998, with Amy aged fourteen, as well as bits and pieces from her younger childhood, then moving on to her music career, starting with the success of her debut album Frank (2003). Amy achieved huge worldwide success from her second (and final) album Back to Black (2006), which features great hits "Rehab", "You Know I'm No Good", "Back to Black", "Love Is a Losing Game" and "Tears Dry on Their Own". Back to Black led Amy to winning five Grammys, becoming the first British female to do, for Record of the Year - "Rehab", Song of the Year - "Rehab", Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance - "Rehab", and she was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album, and she won a BRIT Award for British Female Solo Artist (nominated another four times), she was also nominated for Urban Act and Best Album, and she was nominated British Single - "Valerie" (2008). The film also delves into Amy's personal life, which gained media attention and she became tabloid fodder, this includes her troubled relationships, her troubled marriage to ex-husband Blake Fielder-Civil (interviewed), self-harm, bulimia, and her downfall into alcohol and drug addiction. Amy sadly went so downhill that she was dependent on substances, the media and others ridiculed her, live performances were marred, tours were cancelled, and family and friends were unable to help her. The film ends with Amy's tragic death on 23 July 2011, from alcohol poisoning, at the age of twenty-seven at her home in Camden, North London, her life was short but certainly eventful, and she will always be remembered for her great talent, and the fantastic music she made. With contributions and archive footage of Mitchell 'Mitch' Winehouse (father), Janis Winehouse (mother), Raye Cosbert (manager and promoter), Mos Def (friend), Tyler James (friend), Juliette Ashby (friend), Lauren Gilbert (friend), Pete Doherty (friend), Blake Wood (friend), Mark Ronson (producer), Salaam Remi (producer), Andrew Morris (bodyguard), Cristina Romete (doctor) and Chip Somers (drug counsellor). Amy Winehouse is one of my favourite female singers, because she has a distinctive voice and style, Back to Black is one of my favourite albums, it was a shame to see her difficult life unfold in the press, especially her battle drink and drugs, and when I heard of her death it was a tragedy, but she has left behind a great legacy. This moving, sobering and heartbreaking film really provides a non-judgemental look at the life of a young woman who endured more than her fair share of judgement, expect to hear her great music during, including the fantastic live lounge version of "Valerie" in the end credits, a brilliant documentary. It won the Oscar and BAFTA for Best Documentary, it was nominated the BAFTA for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, and it won the Grammy for Best Music Film. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This look into Amy Winehouse's life is honestly heartbreaking. Her lifestyle and her father's presence make you realise how out of control she was over her own life. It's a real eye opener, and smashes the pretences the media shows. In this film, you see Amy as a person rather than just another drugged up performer. She was raw, a real rough diamond. She had such an incredible talent, and it angers me how Blake and Mitch pushed her away from saving herself. If they weren't around, in particular Mitch, she still might have been here today. Devastating. However, hats off to the creators of Amy. This film was created with such sensitivity and respect for the late singer, and really shows how beautiful she was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to feel sick from watching a woman in her twenties drink and smoke for two hours then pass out and deal with hangovers watch this.For having a two hour run time I find it unsettling that the film makers chose so much footage of Amy indulging in excess alcohol and drugs.They would even play normal looking footage in slow motion to give her a drunk look. Horrible character development, scene after scene of her drunk.I assume they feel the average person loves seeing drunk celebrities so that why not fill the entire two hours with clips of her hammered. It actually at times had me feeling sick.Even when friends talk about how she could make you feel good about yourself, the director then shows us a scene of her drunk and flirting with men. OK any drunk girl on a night out is going to be a little flirty, it does not mean that they deep down have a certain power to command affection, it means they are drunk and enjoying the company of others.To sum it up, this movie was obviously made quickly, it expected to get positive reviews from a certain shock of seeing a drunk celebrity (not for me personally) and offers very little in terms of an accurate story of a persons life.The filmmakers really did not have enough content to make any sort of biography and it shows.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of Amy Winehouse. I thought her music was overrated. But I am interested in the subject of addiction and why it is so prevalent in the music and entertainment industry. So I went to see this for some fact-finding and to get an appreciation and understanding of how some talented people seem to have a self-destruct button.The movie follows her life story chronologically which is helpful. From an early age her musical taste was quite different to most girls of her age. She had an excellent ear for true earthy R'n'B artists such as Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughn and Tony Bennett.Amy was deeply affected by the split of her parents at an age where she really need some rock steady good influence and role models and somebody to keep her in line and in check. Sadly her mother wasn't able to stand up to her in a way that she needed. Her father left the family home.There is some wonderful footage of her in performance and off-the-records chats before she hit the big time. From an early age, she understood music and singing far above anybody else. She has a good ear for what sounds good. Her first big influence was Jazz music - very rare in somebody so young.This film has been cut and edited to suit the Director's agenda - make no mistake!!! But I guess that's true of most movies! It's never clear who introduced her to hard core drugs - presumably the no-good boyfriend who you get to learn very little about, but Amy was besotted with him for a few years. She openly admits to smoking weed at a young age and wanted to smoke it constantly. There were a couple of stints in rehab which only had limited success. Amy seemed to go downhill with her useless boyfriend. After he was incarcerated for perverting the course of justice she seemed to improve for a while. Her Back to Black album became something of a millstone for her - she was getting tired of performing the tracks from this album, but this is what the public craved and demanded. This really wasn't her true style of music - this was a homogenized version of what she really wanted to perform. Stardom didn't come easy for Amy, her lifestyle meant that she was hounded by the paparazzi - and for somebody as fragile as Amy, it was just another straw on the camel's back.She did get herself sober from hard core drugs while apart from her useless boyfriend, she substituted that with alcohol. She used to binge drink and wasn't able to perform with any professionalism for most of the time. She just looked like a train-wreck waiting to happen. Her father who was back in her life as some kind of manager or adviser is a total piece of work. You just hope that Karma pays him a visit sooner rather than later.Ultimately, who killed Amy? Herself. I didn't come away feeling more sympathetic - I wish I did. Apart from two female school friends, the rest of the people around her didn't do enough for her - she got away with too much for too long and it caught up with her. It's not as though anybody couldn't see this coming. Shame on those people. There are sadly some people who have a self-destruct button, and Amy was definitely one of those people. Her life somewhat mirrors Janis Joplin! Amy had talent for sure - even though I didn't appreciate it.This movie is for her fans only.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tabloid story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A 2h long movie about a girls who dies. A tabloid story with the mask of hi-end documentary. I walked out after 1h30. The film makes you feel disgusted about how the media, her dad and the people around her push her deeper and deeper, over the edge of the edge and yet here you are... In a room full of people watching that girl die again, in every detail. How many times will she die this opening weekend? How many money will she make the bastards who claims this is entertainment? A documentary? Art? The only thing she wanted was to be heard and loved. Listen to her music, love her but don't watch this filth. - AMY. A sensation piece on the late singer-songwriter Amy Winehouse, who died of alcohol poisoning in 2011.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film of this year...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't wait to see this film about my true hero/idol/legend Amy Winehouse! I believe this is a film that everyone will get involved in and will want to watch it, as people need to know what this woman was about - That there was so much more to her than the drugs and the alcohol. It's already been rated 5 out of 5 by almost everyone who has watched the film so far, especially at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival. I can't wait to witness the extensive unseen footage of Amy and best of all, the film will feature previously unheard tracks, like Asif Kapadia promised - which is a real excitement! She produced the most amazing music that will be played forever and ever, she's massively inspirational to so many people around the world, she looked great, sounded brilliant, she's one of the best artists that there's ever been and this is why people should purchase their tickets at the Amy film website and find out about what this lovely, kind-heated, funny and incredibly smart woman was truly about! She was a lost soul and now shes resting. She will always and forever be an icon. Rest In Peace Forever Amy Winehouse, Love You Forever xx</fullReview>
