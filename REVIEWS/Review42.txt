		<shortDescription>Infinity is a sympathetic but rousing film on one of the greatest minds of all time ? Srinivasa Ramanujan.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Albert Einstein there was Srinivasa Ramanujan - A little known fact outside India and the academic community, and precisely why this story had to be told. The Man Who Knew Infinity serves as a biopic behind the life and times of Ramanujan, a self-taught Indian Mathematician, who some say could decipher the very fabric of existence. It's a poignant film in as much as an emotional roller coaster but an extraordinary story told almost a century after Ramanujan's early and tragic death in 1920.That's because Ramanujan was not only a mathematical prodigy by the age of 11, or that he could mentally compute complex permutations in a fraction of a second, but the fact that at the height of his powers, not many could fathom his genius. Not even the Cambridge scholars who elected him as a Fellow of the Royal Society and also a Fellow of Trinity College ? monumental achievements for an Indian with no formal training in mathematics. Based on this true story and adapted from a 1991 book of the same name, writer/director Matthew Brown begins the film in 1914 Madras (back when Madras was rightly called Madras). Ramanujan (Dev Patel) comes from a poor Brahmin upbringing where even note paper is a luxury. He is seen frantically scribbling theorems on slate before sending samples of his work to intellectuals in Cambridge. Within an instant of receiving the latter's theories, Cambridge academic G. H. Hardy (Jeremy Irons) is not only astounded, but invites Ramanujan to study in England ? both as his protégé and the missing link since Isaac Newton.Forced to leave behind his young wife (Devika Bhise) with his mother, this would be the start of many of his problems but not before going on to make profound discoveries in his field of study. Close on the heels of The Theory of Everything and The Imitation Game, 2014's Academy Award frontrunners, Brown's screenplay fits the bill as a rousing film with a lot of heart but not much insight. Instead, it's more of a sympathetic look at Ramanujan's poor background and the hardships he would encounter in England, including what looks like an over exaggerated and clichéd case of racial prejudice and a depressing long distance love story with his wife. What this means is Infinity is still a well-made film worthy of a thunderous applause, but does little to focus on Ramanujan's innate brilliance. However, from a storytelling perspective that's not really the director's fault. Consider the fact that almost a century after his death, intellectuals using modern day computers are still baffled by Ramanujan's integrals and integers. And only as recent as 2012 have scientists confirmed Ramanujan's incredible intuition that suggests the existence of black holes in deep space ? a concept that was virtually unknown during his time."Intuition" is Ramanujan's answer to how he arrives at his conclusions, and the best moments in the film where Hardy forces Ramanujan to provide "proofs", or sequential steps to his formulae. Without proofs his theories are considered inconceivable and Ramanujan is often dismissed as a charlatan. To its merit, Infinity builds on the relationship between Hardy and Ramanujan, both extreme opposites in their beliefs but recluses who find solace and then inspiration in each other. Irons is perfectly cast as an outspoken atheist opposite Patel who believes his theories come from God. Their symbiotic chemistry builds towards a tearjerker of an ending while adding warmth and closure. Given that Ramanujan was known to be short and stout, Patel might seem like a strange casting choice yet captures his character with integrity and passion and in some ways, a beefier underdog akin to his breakout role in Slumdog Millionaire.That The Man Who Knew Infinity is aimed as a crowd pleaser is obvious and it works well within this scope. And given the subject matter, this film should also do well in foreign markets, especially multiplexes in the Subcontinent and surrounding regions. What's more important, and hopefully so, is that the film brings out Ramanujan's true legacy shoulder to shoulder with the likes of Newton and Einstein. Time, as infinite as itself, will tell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A master piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a wonderful movie which I hope will have a great success when it is released in the USA. I saw it at the Sun Valley Film Festival in March 2016 and it was by far the best movie I have ever seen in this festival. The story of this young Indian with a special gift for mathematics and who becomes a researcher at Cambridge Trinity college is by itself fascinating. The acting is superb with Jeremy Irons as a professor and mentor in one of his best performance ever. The film makes you feel the spirit of the place and the time (first world war England). Dev Patel is no longer the fun host of the Marigold Hotel but a great courageous young mathematician who beats old odds to become one of the major scientist of the 20th century. Please tell your friend to go and see this movie. They will thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You should not miss this for heavens sake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie at the International Film Festival Of India (IFFI), Goa. Most anticipated film which I felt got over in no time. So beautifully directed, enthralling from the very first cut. This is so far the finest performance by Dev Patel. Without Jeremy Irons this film would have been toothless, seeing him for the first time I have never seen a character executed with such panache. Overall a film cannot get better than this, there are some flaws which every film has but are forgivable and probably intended to show the audience that way. Not a film to watch for the entertainment value only but solely for the essence of film watching. A standing ovation to Matthew Brown.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw this film at the SF Film Festival. I thought it was excellent. Why? It combines various levels of entertainment: the intellectual mathematics involved and the realities of academic competition; the historical and cultural conflicts between Indian and English traditions, attitudes, biases, and beliefs; the emotional love/friendship between men, between men and women, and between children and parents; and inhumanity towards other humans: warmongers vs. pacifists, religious vs. non-religious, individuals vs. groups, misunderstandings and lack of emotional intelligence in so many ways. I comprehended very little of the mathematics involved but that did not matter and did not change my overall appreciation for the story and all the levels involved. Kudos to all who created this film. The writing, the acting, the cinematography, the direction, all excellent...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An important film; cleverly mixing a love story with the equally deep themes of moral obligations on privilege to raise those without. At first I was concerned I would not be able to disassociate Dev Patel from the role on Marigold Hotel, but after a few lines which sounded too contemporary, he improved significantly. Jeremy Irons was captivating and the other roles adequately developed. The direction, pace, setting, wardrobe, story, score -all hold the attention.When I watched it, at the end, the audience applauded. In fact at the end of it, one wishes it could last longer - craving more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting but Slow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with this movie is that not a lot happens. And it's very slow. The maths is too abstract for the average viewer to appreciate the ground breaking nature of S. Ramanujan's work. The best thing about the movie is that it brings to the modern audience an awareness of the genius of Ramanujan - who was apparently every bit Einstein's equal or better, but remains basically unknown outside of maths academia. The movie struggles because it can't build to any kind of dramatic "Eureka" moment, when there's a sudden breakthrough that leads to some sort of climax that the general audience knows about. The Imitation Game (2014) at least had a sense of time running out with Alan Turing (and others) trying to find a code to crack the Enigma Machine in WWII. This movie hasn't got that sort of pressure and it doesn't build to any sort of major breakthrough. It's just an interesting story about a maths genius of the 20th Century who most people have never heard of.The director has obviously tried to build up the love story to give the audience something to connect with, but unfortunately it is largely fictional. In real life, 21 year old Ramanujan married his young bride who was 9 or 10 at the time. 5 years later he left her in India with family as he set off for England and Cambridge. The interfering mother- in-law and the star crossed lovers scenario in the movie seems to be pretty fictionalised in an attempt to provide something a little less dry than maths equations.Nevertheless, the movie is beautifully acted. It's just pretty slow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man's recognition of a true genius and his untimely demise is the ultimate human tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ramanujan is a name like Beethoven or Picaso. You don't need to know their history. You don't need to know about their life. Their work speaks for them. While common people try to review and measure what they see, geniuses imagine completely new things that could exist. The Man Who Knew Infinity is just a movie based on a book based on the life of a genius. How can we even expect it to tell us all that is there to know about him? Still, it does its job fairly and with sincerity. The striking difference between this movie and A Beautiful Mind, another biopic about a mathematical genius, is that of the tone. Sure, the portrayal of a genius struggling with schizophrenia makes for a more compelling story but is by no means tragic. How an unlikely partnership slowly turns into a mutual respect and finally into a meaningful yet short-lived friendship is at the core of the Ramanujan-Hardy story. As Hardy addresses his interactions with Ramanujan akin to a romantic affair, he encapsulates their common passion for maths and their devotion to the craft. It was a rare symphony of two souls that happens once in ages. The profundity of that is realised when one feels the pain of Hardy in coming to terms with the fact that he'll never see Ramanujan again. For that matter both Dev Patel's and Jeremy Iron's acting are utterly spellbinding. In that regard, this movie is filled with great performers and they all do their part very satisfyingly. It is like watching good theatre.The seemingly unnecessary struggles of a capable man can be seen as a reality check. It is almost brutal to watch our hero suffer because of some petty issues that simply grow big because of either personal inhibitions or neglect. Case in point, Ramanujan's deteriorating health. There are always worldly limitations that tend to plague the best of us. Moreover, Ramanujan lived in troubled times. He was poor and being an autodidact didn't help his cause either. Ramanujan was an exceptional man surrounded by ordinary people who did deeply care for him but hardly understood him. Hardy was probably the only one who came close to appreciating him but had no experience in dealing with such a cultural disparity. The movie doesn't try to gloss over these circumstances. These are some of the things in this period drama that set it apart. I hope the generation that seeks to alter the truth for excitement rather than get bored by the depth of emotion can fathom that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must See!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw "The Man Who Knew Infinity" at The Sun Valley Film Festival. So happy to see quality films make their US premiere in Sun Valley. Kudos to the non profit group. Must see movie with outstanding story, production and casting led by J. Irons. Independent films like these deserve to be seen &amp; noticed. Opens NY/LA late April. Superb direction from Matt Brown with incredible sets and locations, especially location at Trinity College. Thought about the diversity issue facing the Academy and after seeing this movie, realized it was an issue for a brilliant mind like the lead against the English back in the day. The effort it took to make this film on a tight budget with incredible locations is a credit to the entire crew!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finite and Formulaic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's amazing how much like mathematics this film is. It is strikingly formulaic and everything in it obeys strict laws and forms tight patterns. Ramanujan may have reached for the sky without due process but this film certainly doesn't. Still, his story is a great one and elements of a very human struggle remain. It's the usual stuff in terms of plot, characterization and emotional manipulation but one would be a hard nut indeed if one wasn't touched by it at all. Of the two main parts, though, it is Jeremy Irons' Professor Hardy (who fought against the paradoxically quite brainless prejudices of The University of Cambridge) who comes across most strongly. One warms, too, to Toby Jones' Littlewood</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touches the heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is such a touching tribute to this amazing, brilliant man of humble beginnings. First off, there were a few moments in the film that dragged a little bit. I would have also preferred a little more development of some of the characters, however, it did not take away from my appreciation and enjoyment of this film. There is an underlying message to this story, and whether you're a man of science or metaphysics or spirituality, you will find satisfaction! Patel and Irons did a splendid job in this film. Patel is easily becoming a favorite of mine--he has that subtle intensity that is so mesmerizing and engaging. Irons, well, he is a seasoned actor and one of my all-time favorites. In his role here, he is very believable, showing emotion where it is needed, never overacting, always giving justice to his character. This film will make you laugh, it will break your heart, it will make your spirit soar, and if you have no math inclinations, it will inspire you and make you appreciate its beauty, its usefulness and contribution to the world of mathematics as we know it today!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This outstanding movie is about a little known Indian mathematical genius, Srinivasa Ramanujan who leaves his hometown in Madras to work in Cambridge University. Such a different world for the young Ramanujan who gets excited by a pile of blank papers on his desk, a commodity hard to come by in Madras. Shunned by many of his peers, he sets out to prove his 'theories' with the help of G.H.Hardy.Dev Patel and Jeremy Irons are fantastic in the two lead roles, and Toby Jones does a great job as Littlewood.There are some great shots by Matt Brown, when Ramanujan's wife Janaki walks into the temple through an 'array of sunbeams' stands out in my mind, but the main thing is, the story has now been told and is well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does it's main character a disjustice by doing nothing new.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm rather surprised that this film wasn't produced by Disney. Because it's right up their alley. A young man (Patel) from India travels to England in search of recognition for his work in mathematics. A professor (Irons) takes him under his wing as a mentor in an attempt to show him how to improve his theories. Needless to say, if you're not that into math, this film may not be for you. This ultimately cripples any chance of this film being popular. It shows so much that this man did but it's lost to anyone that doesn't understand what it means. The film just doesn't explain anything. It continues to say that the work is important but never shows why.It tells us to be invested without letting us be. For someone like me that doesn't know how these formulas are vital to math it's hard to be invested. The entire film rests on the work that this man did but is lost among the films own agenda. An agenda that brings religion in at the oddest of times.The two main characters will be chatting about proofing the formulas than randomly god and faith will be thrown in. The film accidentally implies that you can't be great without God. This is the thing that frustrated me about the film most. I get that the main character was very religious but why does the film feel the need to say something like this? One character is religious and the other not. And the film continually makes the case that nothing is possible without God. If you're not religious than this other wise well intentioned film is very pretentious. The strange part is, the only openly atheist character is the most interesting part of the film.Hardy, played by Jeremy Irons, is the best part of the film. Not only is his performance excellent as always but his character is actually interesting. You can tell he has a hard time letting people close to him. He is cold and sometimes overly harsh but you can see that he cares. It's a complex character that I would've loved to see more of. Especially considering how bland the main character is.I mean the entire film revolves around this young man and yet, all we know about him is he has a family, is religious, and likes math. That is all. Not knowing what kind of a person makes his struggles boring. It's impossible to care about him which makes the majority of this film unbearable to sit through. Not to mention the repulsive cinematography and direction.Nearly half the film is out of focus. Even when a shot is in focus there is nothing interesting going on to hold your attention. Most of the shots are within dark rooms that are so poorly lit it's hard to tell where the characters are. All they had to do is put one or two more lights up in the room and the shot would have been a hundred times more compelling. But no, no one seemed to care in the slightest.The film is as harmless as an underdog sports movie and that's the problem. It does it's main character wrong by not being anything different. It continually says that this man changed the world of mathematics but does so in the most by the numbers way. It's predictable, flat, and boring. If it weren't for the great lead performances and Jeremy Irons presence, this film would have been a disaster on every level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had a great potential to be one of the best movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is based on a true story about a brilliant Indian young mathematician. The film had a great potential to be a masterpiece but it failed in many areas. Firstly, the acting of the Indian characters felt exaggerated, or too formal, and a times cold. The relationship between Ramanujan and his wife was shallow and too formal. Actually the relationship between the professor and Ram felt more genuine and truthful despite the professors anti- social personality. The acting of Ram's wife was cold and unbelievable. The acting of his Mother was in some scenes exaggerated. As for Ramanujan, he was either too formal, or shallow and cold in his expressions. It's not that the acting was bad, but it was not on the level that would put this in line with Oscar movies. Jeremy irons character was the best part about this movie. His performance was amazing and deserves recognition.In addition, the story in the beginning felt fast paced and shallow , as if details didn't matter as opposed to overall story. However, it's what the movie was missing. It needed some kind of depth and emotion and synchronization. It was missing the cinematic, artistic touch. Probably if Steven Spielberg took over the direction, he would have turned it into a masterpiece.The movie had the ingredients for huge success but it missed the chance. However don't get me wrong. It's great film and i recommend to watch it, but i wished it was produced differently.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Story of a great mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ramanujan is a legend in India,but most Indians know his name,his field of expertise and the story of the ramanujan number-1729.Few have read up his life story or his works and even fewer can gauge his genius till date.But this is not a review of the mathematician,it's a review of a movie based on his life.That,we can comprehend and judge.Therefore,it is quite fitting that the movie refuses to delve only in the intricacies and complexities of mathematics and venture further into his life as poor Iyengar Vaishnava brahmin before bringing him up as a genius level intellect striving hard to prove his work as a gauche among cambridge's finest.One of the review that says this movie tries to depict that such success can stem only from divine help.Well,this is not the case.The movie rather shows that even someone so deeply rooted in one of the fundamental branches of science can be a devotee of the Lord and carry a scientific approach of the highest level.That Ramanujan says he got all his baffling intuition because of his prayers to Lord Vishnu and Devi Namagiri isn't a religious fervor,but an innate humility on his part to refuse that he was by himself alone,capable of shining light on all the wisdom that had eluded mankind before him.Readers of Bhagavat Gita are well aware of that kind of ideology.Moving past,the background score mainly with flute is a great throwback to the early acts from life of pi and ending score of the highly acclaimed animated short film-Sanjay's super team.The cultural clash and intolerance shown in the movie is also not unnecessary as it truly depicts the sociopolitical picture of the early 20th century.One cannot help wonder what the great mathematician would have been capable of if he wasn't taken so early.Regarding individual performances,Jeremy Irons reigns supreme as Professor Hardy,and Toby Jones is refreshing in his small role as Professor Littlewood.Dev Patel does justice to his role,and holds his ground amidst such stalwarts.I would have rated this film 9,but full respect to the director for braving to take up a relatively unknown figure as a subject for his movie.So,a perfect 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 20 year wait was worth it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somewhere around 20 years ago, I read the book this movie is based upon and thought at the time, "You couldn't invent a story like this if you tried. This has so much human drama and tells a story of great importance." Generally, when the movie industry is forced to distill a great story into a 2+ hour story, much of it suffers. I have been waiting (with trepidation) for this book to be translated into a movie and am quite happy to report that they successfully managed to hit all the high points and tell the story in a beautiful and compelling fashion. The cinematography is well done, the editing is crisp, and the acting is superb. I seldom rank things as a 10 and, with perhaps the exception of A Beautiful Mind, don't recall giving a 10 to any movie. However, I felt this one deserved it. I hope this review encourages more people to see it thus stimulating an even wider distribution so that even more people can have the opportunity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man Who Knew Infinity is a good biopic, not the greatest of ones, but does ample justice to the prodigy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember reading an extraordinary account of Ramanujan from Hardy's pages back in school, where he subtly described the genius he was and the valuable contribution he made to the Mathematical society. I distinctly remember Hardy's thoughts what Ramanujan meant to him, and how impactful was the polymath to his life. Their friendship could be read through those pages I had the good hap of reading.With that memory stick I went ambling to the theatres to see this one. To begin with the direction I must say, Matt Brown has a lot of ground to cover. You could see his inexperience through the way he chops off a frame. It leaves you almost baffled. He doesn't concentrate much on the crucial elements that needs depicting but rather fleets from one cloud to another with a skittish head. There is no subtlety to his frames.The music in the movie doesn't complement his work either. It is not at all powerful, and doesn't ever reach a theatrical level at any juncture. Speaking of theatrics, there is none in the movie. So you can expect a very bland and insipid way of storytelling that will make you averse to the Ramanujan way of living almost instantly.Despite all of the above, what tries to uplift The Man Who Knew Infinity? Who works the best? Jeremy Irons and Dev Patel hands down. Their acting prowess is a joy to watch. Au contraire, some actors we meet in the beginning are really pathetic in the acting department, exacerbated further by Brown's direction. But then gradually the biopic picks up its pace and we see Jeremy Irons on a roll. His speeches are intelligently carved, and his reckless yet powerful voice does justice to all of them. Toby Jones as Littlewood was a pleasant genial companion. Jeremy Northam does a great Bertrand Russell as well.The story doesn't digress from the original which was a good thing. The number 1729 isn't missed either. The setup however gets a little bit morphed there, but we can understand that was done for emphasis. The drama isn't the touching kind.It is unfortunate what happens to great men. S. Ramanujan couldn't escape life's unpredictable warps either, and ended up disappearing in a dire mist.At the end I feel his life needs to be glorified a bit more. There was little we saw of his origins, and his progression towards his virtuoso which is a key factor into moulding a prodigy-biopic. What Matt did was good but what Ramanujan deserves is the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Man Who Knew Infinity" is worth getting to know.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So far, 21st century biopics have been very kind to real-life 20th century scientists and mathematicians. Some of them were fairly well-known before getting the big-screen treatment and some? not so much. 2016 offers up "The Man Who Knew Infinity" (PG-13, 1:48), a biopic about the most famous genius you probably never heard of. Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan may not have the international renown of Stephen Hawking (featured in 2014's "The Theory of Everything") and the cinematic portrayal of Ramanujan's life may not offer the gravitas of helping to win World War II ("The Imitation Game", also from 2014), the mass appeal of a sports backdrop (2011's "Moneyball"), the excitement of a heist film ("21" in 2008), the controversy of early sex research (2004's "Kinsey") or the Oscar cred of a Best Picture winner ("A Beautiful Mind", from 2001), but "The Man Who Knew Infinity" brings us a story of tenacity, triumph and tragedy in the world of mathematics that deserves its own moment of discovery.Popular British actor (of Indian descent) Dev Patel (from "Slumdog Millionaire" and the "Best Exotic Marigold Hotel" movies) plays Ramanujan, a young Indian man who fought prejudice and overcame numerous other obstacles in order to bring his particular genius to light. With little formal education and struggling to survive financially in the eastern Indian city of Madras (now, Chennai), he pursues his fascination with numbers by developing mathematical theorems that should've been well beyond the ability of someone from such humble circumstances. The only way for his highly advanced abilities to really develop further and for his discoveries to have meaning and a lasting impact, is to get help from leading mathematicians outside India. Leaving India, however, would violate his strict Hindu beliefs and cause him to leave his young wife, Janaki (Devika Bhise), and his mother (Arundhati Nag), who has no other surviving children. It's a lot to overcome, but Ramanujan's genius must be shared with the world.A letter from Ramanujan to British mathematician G. H. Hardy (Oscar winner Jeremy Irons) impresses Hardy so much, he invites Ramanujan to join him at Cambridge University's Trinity College. With help from his friend and colleague, John Littlewood (Toby Jones), Hardy works to fill in the gaps in the young Ramanujan's education so the men can maximize what they can accomplish together. Ramanujan chafes under Hardy's rigid approach to developing his abilities, but the two eventually reach a happy medium between Hardy's insistence on "academic rigor" and Ramanujan's need to follow his intuition as far and fast as he can. The protracted fight that was World War I further complicates Hardy and Ramanujan's working relationship, as do religious differences between them, poor treatment of Ramanujan by some at Trinity, his long-term separation from his wife and mother and Ramanujan's own health problems."The Man Who Knew Infinity" makes its difficult subject matter relatable and entertaining, while enlightening and educating its audience. I, for one, had no idea that the modern world of mathematics was so intricate and deep. The script by Matthew Brown (based on Robert Kanigel's book of the same name) gives us just enough of the math (and simply enough) that we understand the uniqueness of Ramanujan's gifts and the importance of his work, but rightly concentrates on the more personal stories of the individuals who were involved in this real-life drama. The challenges of Ramanujan's interpersonal relationships in Cambridge are interspersed with scenes between his wife and mother back in India, reminding us of the sacrifices made by Ramanujan and others so that he could make a difference. Brown also directs and does a good job at making this little-known story accessible and interesting and he is helped by excellent performances from his entire cast, especially Irons and Patel. It may not be "The Imitation Game" or "A Beautiful Mind", but "The Man Who Knew Infinity" is worth getting to know. "B+"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately movies like this usually only make it to only one theater in town, which is literally on the other side of town. So I often wait until the movie is available for purchase on DVD to see it . But I made the effort and drove all the way to see this movie and it was worth it. I did it mainly because I love India and the Indians and had enjoyed Dev Patel in his previous movies. I also love movies about geniuses. Especially if they are scientists or artists. Those of us who are no geniuses should learn from these portrayals that we have to tread very carefully when we are around people, who do not fit the rule. Small minds can destroy big minds. And why, if geniuses are inspired directly by God, does God give them so often troubled and short lives? As an atheist I have a hard time understanding this god and I have a hard time understanding geniuses. Life seems so unfair. I wish film makers would not feel the need to distort truth and the marriage of Ramanujan would have been presented in a more realistic way. He married his ten year old wife when he was in his early twenties and left for England when she was only 14. These child marriages were common in India at that time. Gandhi married his wife when he was 13 and she was 14 , but that did not mean that the marriage was consumed at that point in time. Also the age difference in between Hardy and Ramanujan was only a few years, not decades.Otherwise I loved the movie and wished so much that it would be promoted more widely and young people would see it instead of the crash-and-burn movies which fill the screens everywhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a tale of two cultures that collide in the hallowed halls of Cambridge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without movies so much history would go unnoticed. Bio-pics like The Theory of Everything (2015) and The Imitation Game (2015) celebrate icons of knowledge and elevate brains to equal footing with sporting and other heroes. The Man Who Knew Infinity (2016) is another such story that needs to be told. The field of theoretical mathematics is not one that will excite many audiences and this film does little to convince us of its charms. Making sense of what was achieved in this field is an insurmountable challenge, so instead the film tells a tale of two cultures that collide in the hallowed halls of Cambridge in the early 1900s.Gifted self-taught mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan (Bev Patel) was born into poverty in India and had no formal education. He absorbed mathematics intuitively and believed that "a mathematical equation had no meaning unless it expressed a thought of God". Having learnt all he could in India he connects with Professor GH Hardy (Jeremy Irons) of Cambridge, one of the leading mathematicians of the era and an avowed atheist. The rest of the story is a beautifully told narrative cliché of a dark skinned genius and his obstacle-course odyssey from poverty to a Fellow of Cambridge. Srinivasa's belief in God's will as the source of his gift clashed with musty academic traditions that required detailed proofs behind every mathematical breakthrough which initially led many academics to denounce him as a fraud. He found class, racial, religious and cultural barriers everywhere and Hardy's patronage forced Srinivasa to work against what came naturally. Having left a wife behind in his beloved India, he was emotionally isolated and his health suffered.Nobody does historical period films like the British and this one has impressively high production values for a novice director and modest budget. It portrays the mood and style of the era with authenticity, both in Madras and England. The filming favours Srinivasa's viewpoint to show what it must have been like for a person of his humble origins to walk the grounds of Cambridge and encounter its academic aristocracy. The greatest strength of the story undoubtedly comes from its acting principals Jeremy Irons and Bev Patel. They play opposites in every way except in their love of pure maths, yet Hardy's patronage ensured that Srinivasa's legacy continues into the modern era. This is a great story of a hitherto little-known Olympian of knowledge that will thrust his name into today's mainstream film culture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The true saga of passion and purpose</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.Right to it: along with the science of mathematics in its dearest and most complex ways, "The man who knew infinity" takes a big swing at the social situations of races and discrimination, Indians versus Brits. The world so into success coming from Caucasians that the words like "No man of colour will ever be up there (as for the wall of fame)" comes out and clearly states the separation that existed between people in the age where this motion picture in rolling out the story.A highly entertaining piece of movie, that also combines the natures of proofs in any scientific matter. You can based on intuition think and deeply feel that you are right, as for the proof shows that you are maybe wrong, totally or a little; it's enough and that jeopardise the whole documentation, all the analyzes, all the observations and all the investigations of the matter. As a living proof (pun very much so intended, thank you all!) of being there myself, where over 10 years of work is thrown into the fire within the simple words of; where is the proof? Is this empirical tested? These matters fills this movie and grasp it hard only convey to the viewer the fact of the matter... and this is made in a very good and humble way. Listen to the conversation about 1 hour into "The man who knew infinity"; brilliant frame of the academy side of learning, education and facts. (Also watch 1 hour 9 minutes and 1 hour and 11 minutes.) Can something be based on intuition (from something or somewhere), and years later be based on proofs as "the time is ready" and/or as the necessary tools have been discovered to actually be able to prove it (or something like that)...?Maybe the most appreciated line of the movie (30 minutes and 30 seconds into the motion picture): G.H. Hardy (Jeremy Irons): This will take a life time...! S. Ramanujan (Dev Patel): Maybe two.Similarity. Here I really go far off speaking of genres. Seen the movie "Over the top" with Sylvester Stallone? I any case, the character of Mr. Stallone writes letter after letter to his son, and the grandfather hide them all in a paper box, for the son to found later. What happens here? Well... almost the exact same thing. Ramanujan (Mr. Patel) writes to his wife many letters. Then they find out the mother has been hiding them all... and yes, that is correct... also in a box.Some production, directing and story flaws brings the rate a little down from being a really good movie. One example is where the viewer has to guess what the acting should convey and why the scene is there; these little details makes such a important impact i great movies. (Ramnujan comes off the boat in India in the end; here the scene should convey that he has gotten the illness back and is on the way of dying and his emotional roller coaster. The production team and everyone around missed this target, so I had to guess why this scene suddenly appeared and why Mr. Patel where acting the way he was.)To me, personally, this movie found its place right away, as I have been in a similar place speaking of getting proofs and so on for a solid work. So, my emotions claimed "The man who knew infinity" almost directly and I hold this movie in a warm place. Does that make this review too much of a subjective matter? Maybe... you tell me.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : First thing that comes to mind is the title, "The man who knew infinity". When I first saw the front poster of the movie, I thought that there should have been a more direct and worked on title to sell it even more to the audience. To me it seems like it is a vague title. Besides that, a warm and time precise production, showing both the Indian side and the British side. Proper and well made production, overall. - The actors : Very good ensemble of actors put together. Dev Patel and Jeremy Irons work together smoothly and accents that "humble- academy-of-the-British-style" perfectly. Both Mr. Patel and Mr. Irons should, going forward, be nominated for the Academy award, as they are splendid actors. ' - Entertainment : Could have been more, as for the depth around the entire situation and also the sense for the personalities of the story. Seems like the writer and director Matthew Brown just took a little of the top of the story instead of getting really into it with the whole picture. Really appreciated the photos and the truth behind it all in the end credtis, seeing both Ramanujan and Mr. Hardy in real life. - Age : 117,7 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 8 Excellent movie and a solid production 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is based upon true eventsIn 1910, G.H. Hardy (Jeremy Irons) takes on a brilliant mathematician in S. Ramanujan (Dev Patel) although he has no formal degree that will be accepted by the British. Ramanujan leaves his family in India, doesn't know his family is keeping his wife Janaki (Devika Bhise) away from him, and becomes sickly. The movie shows that the main purpose of Ramanujan was to have his calculations published although he self-taught himself mathematics. We have read stories and seen movies of truly great men and now we are learning about S. Ramanujan (Rama-knew-Gin) who to this day is being studied with seriousness. Hardy is always upset that Ramanujan doesn't provide proofs of his theorems. Ramanujan couldn't be bothered mostly because paper - when he was growing up - was very scarce so he knew his calculations were correct and just went to the end. Now mathematicians are seriously studying Ramanujan and are finding out how correct he was. At the end of the movie we see a statement regarding a lost notebook (now on display at Trinity College in Cambridge) of his in which he shows calculations proving the existence of Black Holes well before the world knew anything about Black Holes. Hardy, a master mathematician himself, was always in awe of where and how Ramanujan got his calculations and later Ramanujan explains that "an equation has no meaning to me unless it expresses a thought of God." Ramanujan was very religious and believed he was guided by his family goddess Mahalakshmi of Namakka. Hardy was an Atheist, but Ramanujan tells him, "No, you do believe in God, but you think he doesn't like you"To be sure we do see a lot of discrimination regarding Ramanujan at Trinity College as most math minds there didn't like to be shown up by someone from India. The movie is quite slow and that is to be expected, but the acting performances throughout are exceptional and we just loved it when Ramanujan proves something that all others thought couldn't be done. It was like watching a magic show and being in total awe. Both Dev Patel and Jeremy Irons are to be congratulated for their performances. Kudos.Notables: Toby Jones as Prof Littlewood and some said he was just a figment of Hardy's imagination; and Jeremy Northam as Bertrand Russell.Go to Wikipedia to learn more about S. Ramanujan. You will be amazed again. This is a great story and we are grateful for those who bring these stories to light. (9/10)Violence: Kind of when Ramanujan gets beaten up. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Young prodigy overcomes all odds to prove he is truly a genius. You can't go wrong with this plot, especially when the story is based on (a book based on) real life and there is enough drama in it to make a Stormtrooper shed tears. Probably that is what the people telling the story thought, and it shows. I don't know if it was the film makers or the book author - which I haven't read - but among the many feelings of outrage at the stupidity of strict religious traditions, the huge damage produces by bigotry and self importance and the sadness to see such potential wasted and then lost there was a strong feeling of "Oh, I know what happens next", which indeed was so.It was the amazing performances from Jeremy Irons and Dev Patel that elevated this film, as well as the attention to detail in regards to the few mathematics revealed in the script. In the end I felt it was too little too fast. I've felt I knew what was going to happen and when the movie ended I felt like I've learned nothing new. Instead I've again been exposed to yet another fine example of how academia breaks the human spirit in favor of the formalism and status quo that hides ineptitude.A sad, true, overly dramatic story that fails to evoke more than the basest of feelings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding Film Biography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Man Who Knew Infinity" tells the story of the remarkable early-twentieth-century mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan. The film is exceptionally well scripted and includes a stellar cast.Ramanujan's genius was recognized when he was growing up in South India. He took the daring step to travel to England, where he worked in close collaboration at Cambridge University with the mathematician G. H. Hardy. While separated from his wife, he encounters racism, the dislocation of life in England during World War I, and, finally, a terminal case of tuberculosis. The film is successful in packing in all of these plot strands while focusing on the breath-taking theoretical ideas of Ramanujan.Dev Patel is outstanding in the leading role, and Jeremy Irons turns in a superb performance as the colleague and mentor to Ramanujan. Much of the film depicts Hardy's frustration with Ramanujan's "intuition" and his deep religious faith that are at the core of his genius. Hardy wants "proofs," and he prods Ramanujan to adopt a different kind of thinking about mathematics. The film carefully handles the ambiguous situation of whether Hardy helped or hindered Ramanujan's growth.Other outstanding performances include Devika Bhise as the long-suffering wife Janaki, Jeremy Northam as Bertrand Russel, and Toby Jones as John Littlewood. The production values were superb with location filming at Cambridge. It was odd that a stronger connection between Ramanujan as Isaac Newton was not developed in the film. Newton also was deeply religious, and the filmmakers missed a golden opportunity to draw that connection. In a curious way, Newton also worked by intuition exactly like Ramanujan. Still, the film succeeded enormously in recounting the life story of a highly influential and dedicated pathfinder in modern mathematical theory.</fullReview>

Its different than the common action movies because the storyline is truly happened, it's educational and full of emotion. There are a lot of details telling the story of Ramanujan, about the culture from England and from India and from pieces of the history. With pieces of humor and great actors the movie was for my amazing.

		<shortDescription>It is a great and very informative movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really love this movie. The idea was astonishing and very new (although it is a biography of Ramanujan). This movie managed to show the audience (directly or indirectly) the life of math prodigy (Ramanujan). Although he has no proper education (even a degree), he is still able to find amazing patterns in nature and communicate with it by using math. As a person who really appreciate math, I find this film has a lot to offer in terms of the way we really think about numbers and formula. I love Ramanujan's character. His role reflects the hardship that he had to take in order to sustain his work, life and his family. Although he came from a very traditional Brahman (if I spelled correctly), he never gives up. I love his spirit a lot. This inspiring attitude drives him to success although he has to sacrifice most of his remaining life being far away from his family. This movie pointed out some great value such as the existence of God, hard work and friendship. Ramanujan's is able to show that religion (some people might define it as nature) and mathematics is always parallel to each other. The friendship between Prof Hardy and Littlewood is quite refreshing and "cute" in some sense. In addition, this movie is able to show the reality of University life where people only judge people through their politics and race instead of one's merit. Above all, merits drove Ramanujan to success and everyone has to give up their dirty politics. In terms of romantic scene, I personally like the love life between Janaki and Ramanujan. No sex scene but still full of romance. Ramanujan's mother is a little bit woody (in terms of acting) and does not portray Ramanujan's mother. Another thing is, this movie shows less work of Ramanujan. The movie only managed to show some formula and I don't feel the excitement when they finally proved all the required theorem and formula. Pursuing that, I really love the quotes inside this movie. This movie helps the audience to understand what really happens in the academic world. Sometimes academic world is not that "academic" and is always vulnerable to bad politics and endless wrong perceptions. Based on my personal rating calculation, I rated this movie as 8/10. Great acting from all casts.</fullReview>

Ramanujan, definitely has that (your teacher might show this movie in class) vibe. A focus on Hardy and Ramanujan's relationship is the biggest driver in this film. His work in mathematics is in the forefront, but not the biggest focus. They Dabble in WWI They touch ever so slightly on race relations in England The Relationship Ramanujan and his wife is told parallel to the main plotBasically Jeremy Irons acts like Jeremy Irons (aristocratically smug) taking Dev Patel for granted, then Patel throws a couple temper tantrums and almost dies, and somewhere in there he solves partitions.That being said, Jeremy Irons(he's my DAWG!) and Dev Patel did an amazing job, all in all that's what I came for. Good acting drove this movie, story is missing a little something in my opinion, maybe more Bertrand Russell! Worth a Watch</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intuition vs proof; atheist vs believer; man vs genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this movie is based on true events, I have noted IMDb user reviews challenging its accuracy. Let me state up front that I'll steer clear of this controversy and rely on the merit of the movie itself.This is the story of an unlikely partnership between S. Ramanujan (Dev Patel) and G.H. Hardy (Jeremy Irons) in cracking the purportedly unsolvable mathematical problem of "partition", thereby making earth-shaking history in the academic world and in the process earning Ramanujan's Trinity Fellowship.Drama, be it real-life or fictional, strives on conflicts. My summary line suggests three for this movie. The first is highly theoretical. Ramanujan is a genius likened to Mozart by Hardy, with a brain that is beyond the comprehension of mere mortals. He works on intuition which sources his "profound, invincible originality" (a phrase Hardy used in his speech arguing for granting Ramanujan's fellowship). But scholars in Cambridge (Hardy included) adhere steadfastly to academic tradition and principle: requirement of proof. This fuels the conflict between the two, until eventually they agree to meet half-way.The next conflict can be viewed as an alternative expression of this first one. Hardy is an atheist. Ramanujan is a believer in divinity. His religious faith in his pursuit of mathematical truth is just as palpable. Again and again he comes up with formula which he just knows is true. So why does he need to supply further proof after the Cambridge fashion? He suggests that Hardy does not understand this because he is an atheist.The third and last one affects the making of this movie to the extent of almost rendering it Schizophrenic. To be able to interact in that lofty level of intellectual plane as between the two protagonists makes them almost godlike, particularly Ramanujan. And yet, there is a parallel story between him and his lovely wife who stays back in India on the strength of his promise that she can join him as soon as feasible. Thrown in for good measure is even the melodrama of the mother-in-law blocking her letters (without her knowing) to ensure that his son will come back.Years, no, decades, ago I had the privilege of reading Hardy's book "A mathematician's apology", introduced to me by a friend who is a mathematician. Understanding next to nothing about the subject matter, I was nevertheless overwhelmingly impressed by Hardy's mesmerizing description of how elegantly beautiful a mathematical proof can be. There is not enough depiction of this aspect in the movie although in all fairness it is not neglected. I want even more mathematical jargon even though that will all be Greek to me. I want to see more of the godlike Ramanujan rather than the ordinary human being missing his wife, staying faithful to his vegetarian diet, victim of bigotry and ultimate consumed by tuberculosis.On casting, Iron is impeccable, while Patel shows what he can do with a serious role. Among the supports, I like to mention two in particular. Toby Jones's Littlewood has been referred to as a figment of Hardy's imagination in jest. While temperamentally he is mild and gentle, Littlewood is academically the other two's equal. Jones, whose excellent portrayal of Truman Capote ("Infamous" in 2006) was overshadowed by the great, late Philip Seymour Hoffman's award winning "Capote" (2005), is a joy to watch as Littlewood. Jeremy Northam's Bertrand Russell is only a minor role here, the character's gigantic status notwithstanding. The actor however is my favorite. Among a variety of roles I have seen him portrayed, the most impressive is poet Randolph Henry Ash in "Possession" (2002).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even if you're familiar with the broad outlines of Srinivasa Ramanujan's amazing history, this movie, written and directed by Matt Brown, is intriguing and moving on many levels. A mathematical genius, mostly self-taught and with no university degree, Ramanujan's insights are still being applied and their significance explored today. "Almost a century on, his work remains a fertile field of study, an object of astonishment, and a source of pride to his native land," says Anthony Lane in The New Yorker. Ramanujan grew up poor in early 20th century Madras (now Chennai), India. When his talents are finally taken seriously, he is encouraged to contact G.H. Hardy, a leading mathematician at Trinity College, Cambridge. Hardy (played superbly by Jeremy Irons) is a bit of a misanthrope. He brings Ramanujan (Dev Patel) to Cambridge and becomes his mentor, not especially to do the young man any good, but for the intellectual challenge. He insists Ramanujan develop the proofs of the theorems he derives, it seems, by intuition. But Ramanujan is "a genius who can only explain that his propensity for solving problems and equations comes from God!" says Mimansa Shekhar in India Times. Ramanujan struggled with the proofs, resenting that they keep him from developing new ideas. The tug-of-intellectual-war between the him and Hardy forms much of the movie's conflict. Both of them confront a calcified British academic hierarchy, reluctant to admit an Indian could match?much less surpass?English intellectual prowess. Hardy is interested in math. Full stop. While he recognizes Ramanujan's mathematical powers, he's little interested in the other aspects of life that animate his protégé?his culture, religion, and love of his wife (Devika Bhise) whom he's left back home under the hostile supervision of his mother (Arundathi Nag). Ramanujan does have advocates at Cambridge?Hardy's mathematics colleague John Edensor Littlewood (Toby Jones) and Bertrand Russell (Jeremy Northam). But it's the start of World War I, and people's attention is mostly elsewhere. Jeremy Irons is perfect, and I liked Dev Patel's performance, too. Jones and Northam are always good. As with any biopic, the plot is constrained by the actual events of Ramanujan's life, and in his case, those events?significant and earthshaking though they were and continue to be?take place mostly inside his head. Even if we moviegoers could see them, we wouldn't understand them! Nevertheless, I found the story moving along rather perkily, aided by excellent scenes of India and his wife's coping with her obsessive mother-in-law. Definitely worth seeing, and a worthy subject for a film. In India, Ramanujan's birthday, December 22, is celebrated as National Mathematics Day.</fullReview>

There are gorgeous scenes of India and Cambridge, a fascinating story line and of course the fabulous Jeremy Irons and Dev Patel. Whether you know Ramanujan or not, it's captivating and a delight to watch.It's not a fast-paced action film, it evolves gradually as the story is revealed. It touches the heart without syrupy sentimentality and made me think - how many times is genius lost to the world for the sake of a mentor, a sympathetic ear or someone prepared to take a risk?

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where does genius come from? Where did a Ramanujan find his inspiration? The movie does a very good job of exploring this open question. Ramanujan believed that God was the source of his gift. Bach also thought that God spoke to him through his music. Other great artists think that creativity comes to them from the spirits, the muse, the daemon, or the unconscious. For math geeks, the movie gives a nod to the primes, combinatorics, and the famous "taxicab" number 1729, which Ramanujan instantly recognized as the sum of two cubes. Wherever it came from, his talent was unworldly. Ramanujan died too soon, like many other prodigies: Keats, Shelley, Schubert, Galois, and so on. Galois was killed in a duel at the age of 20. On the night before he died, he had proved that there is no formula for any polynomial above the fifth degree.The star of the movie is the nearly idyllic environment of Cambridge, which hasn't changed much in a thousand years. The quad is a perfect square, which is why quadratics involve square roots. The "Principia" is enshrined in the library. And even Bertrand Russell makes an appearance, roaming the campus in his academic robes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Hardy than Ramanujan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man Who Knew Infinity is a biopic of the famous mathematician Srinivas Ramanujan, particularly his days in the hallowed portals of Trinity College, Cambridge. Ramanujan comes across as haughty and arrogant, something I had never expected. Hardy, his mentor advises him ? a little humility will go a long way. Ramanujan is in a hurry to get his books published. That is the very reason he has sailed all of 6000 miles from Madras, leaving behind his young and beautiful wife under the care of his ultraconservative but dishonest mother. Hardy patiently reiterates that he wants proofs of the theorems. The clash of occidental logic vs oriental intuition is fascinating. Ramanujan is clueless about proofs and attributes them to Goddess Namagiri.Ramanujan silently suffers the English food and the English climate, but fails to evoke our sympathy. His ego prevents him from seeking help. The film hardly makes an attempt to explore the mind of a genius. It stays superficial. The many confrontations between Hardy and Ramanujan are the best parts of the film. But in each of these, Hardy emerges in a better light. It is just that he has better lines and a better actor.Jeremy Irons is fantastic as Hardy. Wish I could say the same for Dev Patel's Ramanujan. In fact Ramanujan suffers more at the hands of Dev Patel. Wish they had cast a lesser actor as Hardy, just for the sake of Ramanujan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A richly deserved First</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best films I've ever seen: quite informative (for a non-mathematician like me), emotionally powerful yet subtle, and challenging in relation to its period.True, it takes some licence with the facts. In 1914, when it is set (and the war plays a part), Srinivasa Ramanujan Iyengar was 26 and G. H. Hardy 37 ? whereas the actors Dev Patel and Jeremy Irons are now 26 and 67 respectively. Also, Ramanujan's wife Janika was 15 but the actress Devika Bhise is clearly over 20 (Janika died aged 95 in 1994). So the film should be taken on its own terms.In those terms, Hardy, a lifelong bachelor, looks like a father figure for Ramanujan (R). There's no hint of a gay sub-text and Hardy remarks, true to the facts, that he isn't good at intimate relationships.There is, however, a significant political and cultural theme. Though violence occurs only once, R is treated at Cambridge with casual racism, especially by a tutor called Mr Howard (Anthony Calf) who calls him a charlatan and pronounces his name 'Ramajan'. I can't find any evidence of Howard's existence, and perhaps he was manufactured as the 'villain of the piece' in order to accentuate the issue.If that is a fault, Matt Brown's film still raises some crucial questions: the word racism springs to mind at once now ? but what of the historical perspective, 33 years before Indian independence and in a closed English community? For all their brilliance, could those academics have had any conception of racism as we understand it? Even D. H. Lawrence could write in a letter of 1922: 'Those natives are back* of us - in the living sense lower* than we are. ... you don't catch me going back on my whiteness and Englishness and myself.' (He underlined 'back' and 'lower'.) Watching this film, I felt an uncomfortable challenge to resist judging by today's standards.At least as important is the theme of belief. Hardy, who is credited with promoting rigour in maths, insists that R give him proof of his formulae instead of relying on intuition. He is an avowed atheist because there is no proof that God exists. R tells him that his formulae are (in effect) divinely inspired, as though he were a mathematical mystic. Earlier, he has told Janika that for him maths is like painting. Hardy comes to appear increasingly moved by R's faith, and this is extremely poignant.The question of producing proofs represents profound cultural differences. Though accepted at last by the maths establishment, R never really seems westernised; in some dream sequences, maybe a bit fanciful, he imagines himself back in India with Janika.Life at Cambridge took a heavy toll on that extraordinary young man from southern India. Even so, he made lasting contributions to mathematics, including a formula that may now explain the behaviour of black holes. His birth anniversary, 22 December, is National Mathematics Day in India.Judging by the film, R got some very patronising treatment. The film has also had some, from a number of reviewers. In my view, though, it richly deserves a First.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawed beauty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man Who Knew Infinity is a lush, romantic biopic in the tradition of Hollywood's grand biographical melodramas of yesteryear. It is broadly accurate, if rather sentimental, but also somewhat superficial. We're constantly told that Ramanujan's work is important and ground- breaking, yet the screenplay mostly fails to demonstrate why this is so. We're shown how difficult life is for a vegetarian in England during the Great War, yet, oddly, it's never explicitly stated that the resulting vitamin deficiencies contributed directly to Ramanujan's demise. But for me the biggest flaw is the misplaced romance between Ramanujan and his wife, Janaki, when the more compelling romance is the intellectual one that unfolds between Ramanujan and G.H. Hardy. In reality, Janaki was nine or ten when Ramanujan married her in 1909, and only 14 or 15 when he left India for England. She was certainly not the ripe beauty portrayed in the film, and there is no real evidence that their arranged marriage was any kind of grand passion. The film is also strangely coy in avoiding any direct reference to Hardy's homosexuality. Perhaps the writer was being scrupulous about not implying any sexual aspect to the relationship with Ramanujan. Whatever the reason, it's an omission that makes Hardy less dimensional and airbrushes his sexuality from history as completely as a 1950s Hollywood biopic might have done. That aside, Jeremy Irons gives what might well be the best performance of his career as Hardy. It's a compelling and deeply touching portrayal. More surprisingly, Dev Patel - after a series of exuberant but lightweight performances - finally proves to be an actor with some depth and range. The film is also deftly directed, with some gorgeous cinematography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It made me fascinated by the man it was based on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I go into the movie knowing nothing about mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan, but I did come out finding the man quite impressiveYou can't help but to love a story about a poor kid from India who discovers on his own that when it comes to math, no mind is more creative than his. The movie follows his attempts to prove this to the world which of course is met with the stereotypical challenge of convincing a room of old white men who think they are the center of the universe that they were wrong. in Ramanujan's case, one of those white men G.H. Hardy, was in his corner, and a lot of the movie was about their friendship based on mutual respect. I can appreciate the struggle Ramanujan had to got through.I also like Jeremy Irons in the role of G.H. Hardy. Irons has a very appealing charm to him. Not sure how I feel about Dev Patel. I felt that I did not get enough from him in the story, considering he is the center of attention. May not have been all his fault. The narrative was not too exciting, which may have had a lot to do with the amount of material of the short period of time it goes though.But overall it is a pretty uplifting story, which I liked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wasted Opportunity. Simply Trite and Just Not Compelling.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In better hands - scripting, directing and casting of main character - this would have been a winner of a movie based on a real-to-life mathematical genius.As it is, the whole thing is simply trite, contrived and a whole waste of a good opportunity. Right up front, the use of near standard English by the Indian cast who were supposed to be from the "abject poverty" of Madras is downright unbelievable and ridiculous. The script doesn't know what it wants to focus on - is it about an Indian displaced in England? Is it about the genius of the man? Is it about the tribulations of leaving your young wife and family to go abroad? Is it about another important leap of mankind in the area of mathematics? Is it about the relationship between a student and his mentor? It is all over the place and at the same time pointless and trite.Jeremy Irons is superb and is the only key redeeming feature of the whole movie. Cinematography is colour-by-numbers, but good enough. Apart from the mundane meandering scripting, Dev Patel is a total miscast. He is simply a one-dimensional actor who simply does not at all have what it takes to on the range a proper lead sorely requires. He is just playing himself in all the movies he has done - same doe-eyed expression, same hesitating mannerisms, same scuttling around, same intonation, just same himself - he does not at all inhabit this very important lead character, and his amateurism is just a constant sore annoyance throughout the movie.This movie is a dis-service to Srinivasa Ramanujan. It doesn't give any insight into his genius nor a sense of his highly unique and compelling short life.Watch it with little expectations, and it may be mildly entertaining, but never interesting, and certainly never compelling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had a deeply profound spiritual experience while watching this movie. It caught me totally off-guard. I highly recommend The Man Who Knew Infinity to anyone who considers themselves open-minded, polytheistic or spiritual. This is a story of Hinduism (polytheism) versus the stale, sterile secularism and atheism of the West. Most of us in the West coming from the Abrahamic tradition (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) have a profound prejudice towards Hinduism because it is polytheistic. But there are powers outside of ourselves which we simply can't explain. It's so ironic that this incredible mathematical breakthrough came from a spiritual source and nobody would listen because some of the most brilliant men on earth had totally closed minds!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main attraction of this biopic is the superb acting of the main protagonists, played by Jeremy Irons and Dev Patel. Their evolving relationship, excitements, frustrations and anger are fascinating to watch. The supporting actors add an interesting second layer of context and commentary. The film is beautifully designed and shot on location in Cambridge and India. The Indian family background of Ramanujan is largely fictional, but it does help to explain his character, his motivations and struggles after the move to England.It's tempting to compare this to another recent biopic of a Cambridge mathematical genius, Stephen Hawking, in 'The theory of everything'. That may have been slightly better as a drama, but fell down for me on its cowardly lack of any real attempt explain the scientific insights that made the genius. Pure mathematics is an even tougher topic to depict for a broad audience, but the makers of 'Infinity' gave it a jolly good try without taking it too far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not to be missed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These biographical films, although probably romanticized, are useful in the way they inform the public about the contributions of exceptional individuals to the advancement of knowledge for mankind. When the film is well done, as is the case here, it is both informative and entertaining. The excellent "Imitation Game" last year was one of them recalling the exceptional and tormented life of Alan Turing, considered the father of modern computing. These films encourage curious people like me to deepen their knowledge of these persons and their accomplishments. The internet greatly facilitates this research. Now this is the story of the little known Srinivasa Ramanujan, the brilliant mathematician of Indian origin, who died much too young at the age of 32 in 1920. I had vaguely heard of this man, but this film brought him beautifully to life for me. Srinivasa Ramanujan had this unique ability to visualize mathematical equations and theorems, which he could then go on to prove their veracity. As a Mozart who is said to be able to imagine an entire symphony in his head. Unable to neither deny nor curb his "intuitions" that constantly possessed him; his consecration was at the hands of the academicians of London in the early 20th century. But it was opposed by the obscurantist traditions of his home country, cynicism and conservatism of the scientific world at the time and the blatant racism of the Western world. Still, this consecration was acquired at a great cost to his health. This story also reveals that if Srinivasa Ramanujan had been European or American instead of being Indian; he would have probably lived a full life in years and achievements. This story underlines the greatest tragedy that still continues today on Earth, which are the indecent inequalities causing extreme poverty and hunger, that decimate an uncountable number of people and especially children. How many Ramanujan, Turing, Mozart and Einstein die every day without having had the chance to see their unique gifts flourish? The Man Who Knew Infinity: a film not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found "Infinity" to be an absorbing, well-crafted drama of two great minds searching for intellectual "truth", in this case the truth of pure mathematics, in the academic world of Cambridge University during WW I. The film focuses on two great mathematicians of the 20th century, G. H. Hardy of Cambridge and the self-taught, Indian genius S. Ramanujan who is mentored by Hardy. The young, non-degreed Ramanujan is bursting with mathematical ideas in his native India and eager to share them with the world (via publication) and writes to some of the world's famous mathematicians, one of whom (Hardy) invites him to Cambridge where they begin a mentoring relationship and then a collaborative relationship. There is race-based and conservative-based resistance to Ramanujan's ideas on number theory, etc., but eventually his genius wins him respect and in a moving ceremony he's voted a Fellow of Trinity College (Cambridge). You don't have to be a mathematician (I'm not) to enjoy "Infinity"; but you do need to appreciate the "life of the mind" to understand the motivations and behavior of our two protagonists. But there's much human drama as well. Dev Patel's portrayal of Ramanujan is one of enthusiasm and deep Hindu spirituality, while Jeremy Irons deftly portrays the avowed atheist Hardy's rationality and emotional distance, and together we see some discord in their relationship melded with mutual respect and perhaps some semblance of affection on Hardy's part, or as much as the aloof Cambridge don could display. Hardy has called his "discovery" of Ramanujan his greatest contribution to mathematics and has said that their collaboration was "the one romantic incident of my life."The film evoked, at least for me, the nature of higher-level mathematics. Ramanujan is bursting with mathematical algorithms and solutions that seem to come out of thin air, but the rigorous Hardy requires that Ramanujan subject his brilliant mathematical intuition to the discipline of proofs. "We need to have your proofs, before you can publish your mathematical solutions." In contrast, Bertrand Russell advises Hardy to let Ramanujan "run wild" with his ideas and not impede his creativity with the need for proofs. We have the juxtaposition of mathematical intuition and rigorous proofs, analogous perhaps to theory and empirical testing in the natural sciences. Thus, the film touched upon, but did not deal explicitly with, the ancient philosophical issue of whether mathematics is "discovered" or "invented", that is, whether mathematical ideas and structures are "out there" and universal and independent of human existence, or whether they are created by the human mind. To me, at least, the film provided the stimulation to revisit this fascinating and undecided issue.</fullReview>

Do yourself a favor and watch this movie before it goes off of theaters. The life story of a clerk-- Math genius from an impoverished part of colonial India and his struggles to achieve success is the underlying theme. As someone who already knew the life story of Ramanujan, the movie was a bit of let down in some ways. As has been said, Hardy could have done a lot to help this genius succeed better. One of Ramanujan's famous "notebook" was shown at the end, the one that was found in 1976 that is till being worked upon.

		<fullReview>The Man Who Knew Infinity is a biopic about mathematical genius, S. Ramanujan(Dev Patel). Ramanujan grew up in poverty in Madras, India. Ramanujan hopes that his groundbreaking mathematical theories, are recognized by the concerned authorities. Soon, his work catches the attention of G.H. Hardy(Jeremy Irons). Ramanujan travels to Cambridge University in England. This is where Professor Hardy works. When World War I begins, Ramanujan finds it difficult to live a normal life at Cambridge University. Ramanujan has to prove his theories with Hardy's help &amp; publish them in England's mathematical journal. The Man Who Knew Infinity is a brilliant film. Director Matthew Brown has masterfully depicted Srinivasa Ramanujan's life, right from his struggling days in Madras, to his ultimate triumph at Trinity College in Cambridge University. The scenes in the film where the characters are talking about math, are not boring at all. Though most of the mathematical concepts go right above the viewer's head, you don't get bored even for a second. You really want to know, how Ramanujan's tale will end. Cinematographer Larry Smith, has captured the beauty of Trinity College at Cambridge University, flawlessly. Dev Patel is outstanding as S. Ramanujan. Patel's portrayal of the mathematical pioneer, is the best performance of his career, so far. Jeremy Irons is spectacular as G.H. Hardy. Devika Bhise is amazing in her debut, as Janaki. Stephen Fry is good as Sir Francis Spring. Toby Jones is superb as Littlewood. The supporting cast, which includes both British &amp; Indian thespians, are great too. The Man Who Knew Infinity is a must watch, for everyone who wants to know more about this enigmatic man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible! Loved it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This live action feature film is incredible! I fell in love with the main characters and enjoyed the true story. This movie is a biographical account and is very dramatic.This movie is set during WWI and takes place in India and at Trinity College in Cambridge. Srinivasa Ramanujan (Dev Patel) is 25 years old, lives in India and is recently married. He is an exceptional mathematician that receives mathematical formulas by meditating and in his sleep. His mentor encourages him to send his work to the professors at Trinity College. Dr. Hardy (Jeremy Irons) is very impressed with Ramanujan's work and tells him to come to England so Hardy can help create publications of his mathematical formulas. Ramanujan leaves India and travels to Cambridge, England, sadly leaving his mom and loving wife at home. When he arrives at Trinity College, he misses his family and the foods he was accustomed to having at home. Making things more difficult, some of the professors are jealous of how smart Ramanujan is and are prejudiced because he is Indian. He comes up with many formulas, but Dr. Hardy says that no one will publish his work without proof of how he came up with the mathematical formulas since he only says, "It comes to me." Throughout the film, the relationship between Dr. Hardy and Ramanujan develops into a very strong one. Dr. Hardy, in particular, is transformed because of knowing and eventually caring for Ramanujan. Dr. Hardy, a devout atheist, does not believe in God and doesn't believe in anything that cannot be proved scientifically. He does not understand how his student comes up with all of these formulas and struggles with Ramanujan being as brilliant as he appears to be. This movie is amazing in so many ways and also very inspirational and emotional. I couldn't help but fall in love with Dev Patel's version of Ramanujan's character. He is so extraordinary and seems like such a nice person who I would want to know and be friends with. My favorite scene is when Ramanujan is meditating and is given another formula. His excitement in receiving this information is contagious.The settings and scenery are very appropriate for the time this takes place and made me feel as if it could be during WWI. The costumes are well thought out for scenes in both India and Cambridge, and they definitely fit the time period. I give this film five out of five stars because it is entertaining, informational and has a very interesting plot. I recommend this movie for ages 12 to 18. It may be difficult for younger audiences to follow, but I do believe that people should watch this movie to learn about other cultures and times and, of course, they should enjoy this very inspirational true story.

		<fullReview>Srinivasa Ramunajan was an Indian maths genius who came to Cambridge before World War II and who undertook groundbreaking academic achievements despite encountering racial prejudice: this film tells his story.Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire, the Marigold Hotel films) plays Ramunajan and Jeremy Irons plays his tutor and eventual friend and colleague in this gentle biopic. I had two main problems. One was that I never really comprehended what Ramunajan was up to or why it was important. If it was easy we would all be doing it, not just geniuses, of course, but I think a film like this has a responsibility to try to convey a layman's view of a complex idea. My other problem is that I would have liked to see more of Ramunajan's marital situation: this was an emotional heart to the movie, and I felt it got short shrift.Jeremy Irons was excellent as an emotionally isolated academic who found that this odd foreigner had become an important friend without him realising it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, I think the movie is very far from reality. I know it is very hard for the filmmakers as well as for the Britishers to accept how was the colonial rule in India in real so they depicted their own version of colonial rule which is actually really funny and unrealistic. I urge them to do some research and come to your senses to understand the truth of colonialism. Secondly, there is a very narrow minded and myopic understanding of the Indian culture and traditions which is self evident from the cultural things shown in the movie. I think the filmmakers didn't do enough research on India and hence they come out with their own version of India. For example, it is forbidden for a Brahman to leave the land and other such cultural things which are shown in the movie are not real. The thing which they need to understand is India has a history of more than 5000 years. The time when the western countries didn't even exist India had universities and civilization where people come from different parts of the world to study and to live. Therefore, the culture and traditions which India has is because of some reason. The thing which you also need to understand is over the course of thousands of years of Indian civilization these traditions and culture has changed a lot and unfortunately they have lost their meaning therefore to show some cultural things in the movie and saying that this is India is a very unfair and narrow minded approach. Lastly, I want to say Ramanujan was a remarkable mathematician and a true genius. His life was extraordinary and inspiring. But the movie is created like a British drama and more focus is given on drama rather than showing Ramanujan's life through Ramanujan's eyes.</fullReview>

As it was, I couldn't understand why what this man was doing was necessarily any more impressive than what other mathematicians of the day were expressing.In addition, these are not characters that you find terribly engaging. Ramanujan is just an odd little man with a penchant for math. And Hardy, by his own admission, is not one who interacts with others in any way approaching intimacy or friendship. His only "friend" is mathematics. The only character in the entire ensemble that you feel something for is Littlewood who, while plucked from the safety of academia and thrust into the abattoir of the WWI battlefields, whines the least and inhabits a world apart from formulas, proofs, prime numbers and the like.At the end of the day, I just didn't care about any of these people.Some films (you know the ones I mean) beg to be seen repeatedly over time because there is just something so engaging about them.

		<fullReview>Movies about geniuses pose a serious challenge to filmmakers , because the temptation to romanticize is very strong, and yet the director must avoid it to deliver a credible cinematic tale. "The Man..." is a decent movie that captures the life and times of Ramanujan , a mathematical genius . The story of Ramanujan's life is intrinsically so interesting and epic that reproducing it on celluloid becomes a trying exercise in subtlety and indulgence.The story and the plot offer little for one to complain about . The casting is wanting . Dev Patel , delivers a good performance , but the remaining Indian cast , doesn't fit in well. As far the as the English counterparts are concerned , Jeremy Irons seems a little off colour . He gives a few glimpses of his talent sporadically throughout the movie, but seems to be let down by an ordinary screenplay . There is an unkempt skirmish among the rest of the English Characters, in that , the director given the paucity of time, couldn't develop interpersonal backgrounds properly , thereby leaving much to black and white interpretation. The over all tone of the movie is a little off. However,the story keeps the ball rolling and for this reason alone the movie is mildly entertaining . You will not long for a second helping, but would easily sit through the first screening, even enjoying the drama in real life , as it unfolds on screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical biopic about an atypical genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mathematics is generally considered by mainstream audiences as a rather dull topic, but movies about mathematicians often have little trouble finding an audience. There's an odd fascination with the socially awkward minds of geniuses who spend their entire live crunching numbers, or so the success of A Beautiful Mind or more recently The Theory of Everything and The Imitation Game has proved. However, with the success of such films, there's a risk of such biopics finding themselves limited to a specific formula. A misunderstood genius+a harsh, unaccepting society+British acting talent=box office success, such a formula might state. Problem is, these geniuses in question were anything but formulaic people so there ought to be a little more to it than generic writing to make modern audiences fully appreciate their work. Case in point, the legendary Srinivasa Ramanujan and the feeble The Man Who Knew Infinity.The mathematical wonder Ramanujan was born a poor Indian with an uncanny gift for understanding numbers and dreaming up formulas way beyond the comprehension of his social environment in the early 20th Century. It took a while for his talent to be recognized and even longer for it to be put to good academic use, when he finally moved to Cambridge. There he baffled the minds of his fellows in the short years that remained to him. What made this incredible mind tick? The Man Who Knew Infinity unfortunately is more concerned with focusing on the culture of discrimination Ramanujan faced at academia. In the movie, the misunderstood genius spends most of his time being subjected to racist exclusion rather than getting any work done. And so he stays mostly misunderstood to the audience, who can't begin to comprehend just how unusual his formulas were and what grand ramifications they had for the world of mathematics. Ramanujan is just repeatedly stated to be a genius, and that's that.Dev Patel portrays this specific genius and does an adequate job carrying the movie as such, but his talent is basically wasted as the ongoing victim of racial slurs who just keeps looking miserable and unhappy. As the genre's conventions have it, it's up to the assembled British talent to keep the movie alive beyond that. With Jeremy Irons as Ramanujan's close friend Hardy, the film does have one great card to play in keeping us interested both in Ramanujan's plight and mathematics in general. The movie is as its most interesting when Irons graces the screen, guiding us and the protagonist through the academic world and mathematical lore of the early 1900s and sharing many an intriguing anecdote about both. These scenes make for the film's most interesting moments, which are constantly hindered by Ramanujan facing yet another insult regarding his cultural roots or skin colour. We get it, racism is bad. Unfortunately, more emphasis is put on this particular message than we would care to hear. Suffering is after all a trope of the genre and worked for its predecessors: as Turing struggled with his homosexuality in The Imitation Game and Hawking with his debilitating condition in The Theory of Everything, so Ramanujan is subjected to the racism of the day.Which is too bad, since an unusual mind like Ramanujan's didn't deserve to be explored in such a generic period piece as The Man Who Knew Infinity. The movie carefully stays within the boundaries of the genre rather than, like the man it honours, exceeding such boundaries. It drones on endlessly about the poor man's plight rather than making us fully appreciate his work, his field of expertise and his lasting legacy. The Man Who Knew Infinity, sadly, is rather a predictable and dull movie, which hinders general moviegoers to consider mathematics something other than just that exactly. Well, at least Jeremy Irons tried...</fullReview>

The movie lacks a sense of irony or tragedy, even as the character and the world itself suffers horribly from essentially self inflicted wounds, from racism to the trenches of the western front. We are meant to glory in the hero's ultimate acceptance as a 'fellow', when based on their behavior as shown in the film one might wonder why he would want to spend a minute in this group's company. But never mind. Dev and Jeremy are a feast for the eyes and the soul. They act so well, with such conviction and grace. Enough said, well worth watching for the acting and the introduction to the life of a seminal mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>7.7/10 - Go see it , it once in a lifetime movie! (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all , Jeremy Irons gave an excellent , phenomenal performance as G.H Hardy , it a based on true story movie about an Indian Mathematician that goes by the name of : Srinivasa Ramanujan . He was one of the greatest mathematicians alive , probably even the best one! I will not say much about the movie but I will just say what I liked and didn't like , in a really quick way. First of all what I didn't like , I didn't like that the movie wasn't long enough , I felt there was much more to explore about Ramanujan life , I felt like we needed to see him when he was just a baby , to see how he becomes this young man who knows Maths so well that even the Greatest Mathematicians don't know how he knows all of it , I really felt this movie needed to be at least 2 hours and 30 mins long , maybe even 3 hours , a great person like Ramanujan needed an amazing story , this movie did delivery it but not enough for us to really get to know Ramanujan , the movie was mostly focusing on him and G.H Hardy how Hardy tried to understand how Ramanujan mind works , also teach him few things on how to solve his mysterious answers and them working together to solve a lot of Mathematical questions , also there was a strong BROMANCE between Jeremy irons character and obviously Dev Patel Character , probably one of the best bromances put on screen , it made me get even more interested into this story, I just wish we could know more about Ramanujan instead quickly move him to Cambridge . Also , what I didn't like a bit is a storyline itself , the storyline itself was good but not perfect or even amazing , it could have been improved At least I think so .. there were points where I kinda was starting to get tired seeing the same thing in the movie , I guess that what it had to be like I mean it about Hardy's relationship with Ramanujan and all but that was really it , Ramanujan in this movie didn't had a chance to explore the Great Britain a lot also talk to other people to make it a bit more interesting , even through I enjoyed the bromance and all between Jeremy irons character and Dev Patel Character I still felt like they needed to kinda change it up a little , make us Audience miss they Bromance a bit by Ramanujan going do something else and not just Maths all the time even through that what really the movie is , it a Maths movie in a way with few emotional elements , friendship elements , dramatic elements but mostly it about this man's journey becoming a One of the greatest mathematicians we ever had! That's why I said that this movie had to be longer , maybe even 3 hours long .. there is so much to explore and they just didn't make a perfect justice to the Great Ramanujan , but overall the movie was great what made me give this movie a 7.7 rating is that the Acting was brilliant! I can't say anything bad about the acting , Jeremy Irons delivered an Oscar Worthy performance , Dev Patel as Ramanujan was great and I think he should at least get nominated for golden globe , and the rest of the cast did an incredible job as well , so congrats on that , Also liked liked the storyline like I said , it was a good storyline but it wasn't perfect , also seeing Cambridge the way it was build back in a day was quite awesome too see and that's really it.. This movie is definitely an amazing film but no near perfect , and personally I would say this is only once in a lifetime movie , I definitely not planning to see it again , it wouldn't be interesting the second time.7.7/10 - AMAZING FILM!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. When one imagines the most exciting topics for movies, mathematics tends to fall pretty far down the list. Heck, most students only take math classes because they have no choice, so why should anyone be interested in the story of a young Indian man who revolutionized the mathematics world at Trinity College in Cambridge in the early 20th century? The reason is that Srinivasa Ramanujan's personal story is about more than numbers ? it's about faith and passion and overcoming life's obstacles.The story also has an intriguing by-product of demonstrating the difference between intelligence and genius. Trinity College at Cambridge was staffed by some of the smartest, best-educated professors on the planet when this self-taught odd young man appeared with ideas and notebooks filled with equations and concepts that most couldn't even fathom, much less accept.Dev Patel plays Ramanujan, the spirited man from Madras India who accepted his remarkable talent as a gift from God. His initially difficult relationship with Trinity Professor GH Hardy (Jeremy Irons) was a clash of two men whose passion for math far eclipsed their comfort in the real world. Hardy was a bit of an outcast at the university, while Ramanujan struggled to provide for his new wife, and had little patience for those who doubted his work.Writer/director Matt Brown doesn't seem to believe that the relationship between these two gentlemen is strong enough to hold a mainstream audience, so he commits what comes across as an excessive amount of time to the long-distance battles of the wife and mother of this genius. On the math side, Mr. Brown doesn't allow us to get lost in minutiae of math equations, but also misses the mark on just how groundbreaking and extraordinary Ramanujan's work was. There is little doubt that the story of genius, when combined with the abrasive mentorship, racism, elitism and health challenges provides more than enough material to keep us glued to the screen. The rest is merely distracting.Strong support work is provided by Toby Jones (as Littlewood), Stephen Fry, and Jeremy Northram (as Bertrand Russell), but it's Patel and Irons who carry the weight here. It's especially rewarding to see Irons as a co-lead again. There have been other popular math movies like A Beautiful Mind, Good Will Hunting, and Proof, but it's The Theory of Everything that seems to have the most in common with the story of Ramanujan and Hardy. So give it a shot ? and remember to show your work!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Conventional movie about unconventional man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The scientist-as-superhero movie genre is more than well-established by now and having seen A Beautiful Mind, The Imitation Game and The Theory of Everything, I will readily admit it is something of a guilty pleasure of mine. That being said, the narrative of all these movies is basically the same, and The Man Who Knew Infinity doesn't rise above its genre or add anything new at any point. It fails to surprise, to bring wonder to the viewer or to inspire deep thoughts about the scientific subject. In the aforementioned movies, the main characters all struggle with a variety of challenges they have to overcome, and which ultimately grow into more important story lines than their scientific efforts themselves. The reason for that is probably that it's difficult to bring the story of the impact of theoretical science to a visual medium. I thought that A Beautiful Mind was ultimately most successful in visualizing the scientific impact of what the mathematician John Nash came up with. The Man Who Knew Infinity doesn't have a similarly powerful (but admittedly crude) metaphor as a Beautiful Mind does and therefore fails to bridge the gap between Ramanujan's work and the average (lay man) viewer. The result is an average movie about an exceptional man. It's fine if you're looking for a feel-good story in a somewhat-more-intelligent wrapper than your average rom-com or comic-book superhero movie, but don't expect anything particularly impressive.One afterthought: the reference made to Newton inventing gravity is a very basic but unforgivable faux-pas. Newton discovered gravity but he never invented it. After all, one cannot invent something that is already in existence. For a movie with a science theme that is a painful mistake, especially given the fact that several mathematicians were involved as consultants. Knowing the difference between invention and discovery is what they teach you in introduction epistemology. Since having a decent idea of how knowledge is gathered and how the scientific process works is a must for any self-respecting scientist, I cannot help but wonder who the movie's scientist-consultants were.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So-so</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After all the hype, this was pretty disappointing. The first half of the movie is extremely slow and the so-called relationship between Ramanujan and his wife is nothing less than cringe-worthy - I don't know if it was done on purpose, but there is less than zero chemistry between them, it's like two people who meet for the first time, know nothing about each other and have absolutely nothing in common. I understand that as a movie, they wanted to give some background about his early life, but it was way to long and almost irrelevant to the plot and the pacing is extremely slow.The second half of the movie is better, but not great either. It tells a lot about the interaction between Ramanujan and Hardy and not much about the mathematics, but that is expected from a movie intended for the general public. While it's more interesting than the first half, there is nothing too exciting to make it better than your average clichéd melodrama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow paced biography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Man who knew Infinity" is a 2015 charming biography of one of the major figures in pure math around the turn of the 20th Century in Cambridge. The focus of the story is on the relationship between the gifted student (Dev Patel) and the experienced professor (Jeremy Irons), and there are the obligatory references to Patel's life in India and problems with an Indian trying to integrate at one of the premier English universities.The film is slow paced and has none of the interest or drama of similar biographies ("Dangerous Mind", "Brief History?"). The performances are uniformly good even from the small cameos (Stephen Fry, Kevin McNally). On balance, though, there is little to recommend unless you enjoy these kinds of biographies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable despite the predictable by-the-numbers story structure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie not getting much promotion despite the trailer feeling like your typical Oscar movie had me both confused and worried. Confused as to why this is not getting enough publicity, and worried as going to see it might explain why it is not getting mentioned. However, with a lot of positive reviews coming out of the film festivals, that was enough to find out if it deserves a mention.Firstly, I had to search far and wide for a screening of this film. Luckily there were a few times that I was able to travel to. But it was at a cinema I have never been to.My initial reaction to this was my surprise to see that this was a true story. It is a story that I was not aware of and I think many others will feel the same way.As for the film as a whole, I enjoyed it but I was struggling to be overwhelmed by it. I don't know why, but it had the feeling of a TV movie at times. That is not a good remark to make. It is really hard to describe the reasoning for my analogy. The whole structure just felt too basic in my opinion for a story that was really interesting. Everything just felt expected and you just knew where everything was going and how it's going to end. Maybe I was just in the wrong mood to fully appreciate it. But I rarely change my mind on the overall felling of a film on a first viewing. All of that does not mean that I do not like it. I am just struggling to see where this has got many people thinking that this is a masterpiece. For me it is an interesting story told as simply as possible.The performances as a whole were good. Jeremy Irons is by far the biggest stand-out as the main supporting role. His character was really well developed and I felt comfort and almost sanctuary whenever he was on screen. Dev Patel as the lead was pretty solid and kept the film moving along nicely. Also, his screen-partnership with Irons is great to watch and it is well developed especially when both of their characters have polarising beliefs and speak the same language in the form of mathematics. Not many minor roles that are worth mentioning. But it was nice to see Toby Jones and Stephen Fry on screen as they always play their roles well.Despite me not feeling that the good stuff is strong enough, I don't have many massive negatives to mention. There was one moment where I was confused on the time that has passed in the film as there is a scene containing an object that was getting me thinking that we jumped to World War II despite the film beginning in 1920. Thankfully after a little research afterwards, it turns this particular object was used in World War I and therefore made sense as to why it was happening.Even though a lot of my review sounds negative, I did enjoy this film. I just think that it could have been so much better. I liked the story, I knew nothing about it and I am glad that it is being brought onto the big screen. It is definitely a crowd pleasing film that will play to the widest audience possible which you associate with a lot of popular Oscar films. However, I felt that the people making this did not do the story justice as it looked like the script could have been more challenging especially it involves mathematics, equations and all sorts. They explain the high-level maths well in the film. But only in very small doses. It is a shame that this is not getting enough promotion as I think this will please many cinema-goers and get the box office that it deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'The Man who knew infinity' is not at all a reliable source of information about Ramanujan.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is hardly an erudite scholar in India who has not heard of mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan. It is believed that even most young school children in India with some degree of interest in mathematics know all about his life as well as achievements. His stature as a national hero in India is unparalleled. These are some reasons which might induce viewers both young and old alike to watch this film about Ramanujan. However, major disappointment is one sentiment which would greet viewers when they finish watching this ambitious film which failed to deliver on many counts. Firstly, it is episodic in nature and fails to develop as a large cohesive entity. Secondly, watching 'The man who knew infinity', one might have the impression of watching several short films tied together as a finished product. Dev Patel is an absolute miscast as Ramanujan largely due to his inability to delve deeper into the great man's life. It is strange to note that Srinivasa Ramanujan's relationship with his wife when he was in UK has been presented as a love story ! If this was not enough to add insult to injury, an additional blunder was committed by portraying this famous mathematician's mother as a villain who did not care at all for his wife ! The true story of Ramanujan is missing from this film as it not at all about Ramanujan but everything which happened to him. By giving importance to secondary stories around Ramanujan, the real story of Ramanujam remained untold.</fullReview>
