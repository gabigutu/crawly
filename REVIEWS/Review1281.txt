		<shortDescription>Not Sci-Fi?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some have claimed that "Stalker" is not a science fiction film. I'd say it's more of a science fiction film than most of what Hollywood passes off as part of the genre, most of which are simply action films with a sci-fi bent. Stalker is science fiction in the vein of the genres greatest writers like Phillip K. Dick and Stanislaw Lem. It's pure science fiction, based on science, metaphysics and speculation, not some action fantasy or space opera that fits into the genre on the technicality that it takes place "in the future" or "a long, long time ago". The film is slow...very slow but it has to be to put you into the mindset of the film. After the opening 30 minutes the pacing actually draws you into the film in a more personal way more than any Cyborg-post-apocalyptic-hell crap Hollywood could spew out. This film is truly sci-fi, and truly great sci-fi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most Humanist Film in Existence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrei Tarkovsky is a rarity among filmmakers in that he creates films that resemble elaborate (and always smartly written, beautifully shot and superbly acted) puzzles. The pieces are always scattered, and Tarkovsky relies on his viewer to bring the final element of the puzzle along with him. SOLARIS explores the boundaries of consciousness and the sense of grief (and it uses the titular planet as a metaphor for God). ANDREI ROUBLEV is a multi-layered voyage into religious belief. STALKER, however, is far more spiritual and existential than both of them.A teacher and a scientist wish to go to a restricted patch of nature - the mythical conscious "Zone" - to make their wishes come true. To enter the area and survive its numerous danger, they hire a man sensible to the Zone's thoughts and actions, a Stalker. What they find there turns out to be very different from what they expected, as they come to discover who they truly are.There's only so much you can say without getting drowned in details that would appear heavy-handed on paper but flow seamlessly on screen. Quite often, Tarkovsky reduces his characters to silence, letting their movements and eyes convey their thoughts and feelings and letting the viewer bring his own thoughts and beliefs to the film. One of STALKER's many treats is that it invites you to get carried away into your own thoughts, flowing with the images as it provides new questions to ponder... In that sense, the film is very much like a philosophical poem: a very simple surface covering innumerable layers of meaning. Yet the images Tarkovsky provides - whether filming landscapes or wide-shots or simply peering into his actors' extraordinary faces - make this almost hypnotic.STALKER is a treasure: an invitation to go on a mental ride with a poet and philosopher. A film that makes you wonder more about yourself yet without making you anxious. The few existing films like STALKER are the reason why cinema is called "art"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is high art - pause anytime during viewing and enjoy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, it's, quite simply, the best film ever made; Don't you find you can pause any Tarkovsky film at any moment and the art on your screen is good enough to have as a poster on your wall for life ? With Stalker it is doubly true. The first time I experienced the tunnel scene my heart nearly stopped. This was in 1984 I watched the TV listings in England for 20 years waiting for a repeat - finally buying the DVD in 2004, though I couldn't really afford it. Proof that a SCI-FI film does not need tons of effects to work. In a science fiction film book I read years ago they rated Stalker as the only film ever made deserving full marks in all 3 sections. Imagine if Tarkovsky had made a film of one of PKD's novels ?! OK, I'm dreaming ?! We are lucky to have been blessed by his genius. The good die young. All the best, Rich (English, 38 yrs, Paris)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great masterpiece from greatest director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i want to say somethings about the most poetic,philosophical and intuitive director, tarkovsky and his movies ,especially Stalker.first of all, we must all know that, tarkovsky is not for all. his poetic understanding of life and human and putting this understanding to his movies is unique in the world for my opinion. one of the most poetic and philosophical movies of him, Stalker is that kind of movie. it is like a poem written with objects. we must feel before we try to understand.opening sequence of film contains some kind of expressionist objects with related the moral and inner conditions of the people living in the town . the "dirty" black and white take gives the viewers ,the mood of people having nothing to live, nothing to believe and nothing to give others.and the aggressive green take in the "zone" gives another vision of the life. the camera moves very slow to make us to go into to film and feel the film. tarkovsky's usage of objects and colours is very different and that is why i think he was a cinema poet. on the other hand, in addition to this "poem written with objects", the film also has very deep philosophical content. what is life,what is human, what is goodness, what is selfishness, what is devotion, what are the bases of our civilizations etc. and people are made to think all these things, not mostly with dialogs but with objects and colours and complete vision. for example, the three objects shown while the camera goes into the water ,but actually to the heart of human being and we see one cringe, one gun and one religious icon. and these are the metaphors of the human civilizations for my opinion. and all the journey into to the "zone" and finally "room" , actually done into the human being. into our selfishness,into our subconsciousness, our badness,our goodness, our weak and strong parts. actually i can feel that , the things searched in this movie are our lost innocence . the stalker is the only people who believes something and needs to believe .and actually the journey itself is a fake. to go to the truth,faith,justice, goodness are being related with innocence in that movie. the microcosms shown poetically in the water is another metaphor shows human being's selfish behaviour. because human, destroys the things,destroys the innocence, destroys the world living around them.our today's civilization broke our strong cooperation with nature and changed this relationship to a nature disaster. the movie gives the message of the need of mercy to all the living and even non-living things in our nature. because human being's salvation is only related with that.and the need of hope, need of believe is human being's basic needs. and our modern world destroyed all the hopes and believes. the movie contains metaphors making us to feel and think about those needs.and the most critical thing is felt in the film that self-denial is the basic need in our world.and unfortunately this value is lost and needed to be re-gain.i can tell about all the metaphors in the movie but no need. because every person understand those things different like kafka's novels. and we just need to watch the movie with no prejudice but with open heart.i recommend this film to all the cinema-lovers. i recommend also not to try to understand this film. only leave yourself to this great poem and it will give you all you need.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stalker is not boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems to me that I see Tarkovsky' movies differently from many other people. For me this film is not "too long" or boring. For me this is one of the best movies ever made.Western culture has a very long tradition of film-making. Usually typical western movie is focused on "story". (Of course - not always) The sharpness and tension of the movie are achieved by the big number of cuts or by the fast varying of shots or by the sudden varying of plans or by some surprising angle of camera etc. Tarkovsky don't like cuts. The number of cuts is minimal. His camera is moving like in dream (Bergman envied Tarkovsky for that), it has no angles at all. Colours are pale, "dirty", very tender, soft, almost black-and-white.In a typical western movie dialog is followed by the camera. Picture is illustrating text and is subordinated to it. In Stalker text and visual image are coexisting, cooperating with each-other. Both are moving on their own ways but at the same time, somehow - harmonically. Text and picture are not subordinated, they are both independent.Why is Tarkovsky using such a weird language? Surely not only because he wants to opposite the dogmas of western cinema. He has a positive message too. Audience of his films has to understand his films not only at the level of thinking or emotions, but at the level of much deeper consciousness. Therefore watching his movies means rather meditation than watching-TV-and-eating-popcorn. The purpose of Tarkovsky's films is to loose the mind of audiences, to wake it up to much deeper attention. So that audiences can simply watch and see.Stalker is not an entertainment and is not supposed to be. It means there is no sense at all to watch Stalker, when you need some amusing entertainment. Stalker is a serious movie. It is very narrow-minded to evaluate movies on the assumption of entertainment only. Of course, we live in the world of movie-consumers, produced by powerful film-companies, demanding more and more and more exciting entertainment. Consumer doesn't understand this movie. For him it is big bore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting interview on the DVD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Region 2 Artificial Eye DVD includes interesting interviews with the cameraman and production designer. The production designer reveals that the film was completed only to be destroyed because it had been shot on experimental Kodak and couldn't be developed - a whole year's work was ruined. He proposes the possibility that the authorities of the time didn't want it to be developed. The incident nearly destroyed Tarkovsky. He was finally persuaded to go back and film a new Stalker, this time on a shoestring budget.What does the film mean? Ask me again when I've watched it maybe ten times.Certainly the Zone means more to Stalker than the Room. The Room is his living, but the Zone is an escape, a sanctuary from the noisy, industrial rusting slum where he lives (captured brilliantly in metallic sepia). In the Zone everything eventually returns to nature - like a pastoral coral reef growing on a battleship lichen and mosses engulf factory buildings and tanks. His first action on arriving there is to leave the other two occupied while he communes with the natural things growing in the zone, the grasses, the dew, the soil, the tiny worm that dances head-over-tail down his hand.A beautiful, great and puzzling film. But then if it revealed all its secrets straight off then, apart from the beautiful visuals and the soundtrack it would be pointless watching it again. Great art only leaches out its secrets gradually and only to those with the desire to learn them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Journey into Fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The characters at the heart of Tarkovsky's "Stalker" are people who embark on an arduous journey only to discover that they had no idea what they wanted to gain from it. The central character is a "stalker," a man who makes a living by illegally escorting people through a restricted area to The Room, a place where their greatest wish will supposedly come true. Exactly why the area is restricted is never made perfectly clear; in the novel this film is partially based on, "The Roadside Picnic," it was a site where aliens briefly landed, and The Room was an object they left behind almost as if it were refuse. But Tarkovsky would rather not settle for such a flat explanation. To him, The Room is a place that means different things to the people who journey there, and the stark, ravished landscape they must journey through consists of the phobias and anxieties that they can hardly bear to face. The expedition the men experience is a long and often maddening one, and there are many scenes where the camera lingers on a beautifully composed shot so that the viewer can take time to understand how the characters fit into the settings and how those settings form both natural and supernatural obstacles.Andrei Tarkovsky was an artist who did not like giving solid answers to the questions his films posed. He sculpted his stories so that viewers who had the patience and self-discipline to stay attentive all the way through could draw their own conclusions. If there is any specific meaning to "Stalker," it is that we have to fully understand anything for which we are willing to alter our lives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There have been some comments about this film's length. I am initially reminded of the scene in "Amedeus" where Mozart is told that his composition has "Too many notes" to this he replies "There are just enough..." This film offers great insight into the inner workings of not just the creative mind but the social will of mankind. If you are a viewer who enjoys film please disregard the whining of those who don't enjoy investigating thoroughly the possibility of a well thought out and concise perspective and please watch this masterpiece of modern film. The director leads the viewer through some profound aspects of humanity with such brilliance and in my opinion swiftness that to pass it by would be a shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unique visionary film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tarkovsky's direction for this film is nearly flawless.The film mainly focuses on three characters and their basic goodness of each other. The photographic colors are brilliantly choreographed to the mood of character and viewer. The visionary landscapes are mesmerizing beautiful. The survival techniques the characters in the film achieve is unlike anything I've seen in film. Much like Kubrick in terms of directive style and character study, Tarkovsky puts the viewer in a kaleidoscopic landscape of mood and emotion. No clichés here though. I have not read the story which the movie is based upon, but from what I understand the characters in the film all develop a healing understanding of each other. That is when you know [as a viewer] that you will watch something unique andexceptional. If you are into complex, psychological science fiction in the same vain of say {The Andromeda Strain, Solaris, 2001:a space odyssey} than you shall enjoy "Stalker".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mesmerizing, intelligent and haunting ?yet overlong and inconsistent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stalker (1979)***? Stalker is rich, spiritual and contemplative journey through the fantastic inner world of human's hope, desire, disillusions and believes. Main characters, Writer (as incarnation of irrational, imaginative and emotional aspects of our nature or subconsciousness) and Scientist (rational, logic forces or consciousness) are guided by Stalker (symbolizing our desire, will and everlasting search of meaning) to the mysterious Zone (which may represent all our spiritual goals, meanings, struggles to achieve them and barriers in our path). Breathtaking and mesmerizing images and sounds, witty dialog and strong concept are the major virtues of this feature. Writer's monologues are among the most meaningful, thought-provoking and spiritual moments I ever experienced in any art. But the movie is overlong losing its powerful initial momentum and becoming inconsistent in it's final message (by final I don't mean last in chronology but overall). Tarkovsky's earlier SF drama "Solaris" is more structured and fully developed. Nevertheless, Stalker is an outstanding piece of art movie that puts its director among the few true cinema masters. Rating: 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Zone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is loosely based on Arkady and Boris Strugatsky's "Road Side Picnic," and Tarkovsky tried, as he did with his "Solaris" (1972), to downplay the science fiction aspect of "Stalker." Except for a brief explanation at the film's beginning, Tarkovsky chooses to ignore the speculations as to what could have created The Zone, and the changes within it.With "Stalker," Tarkovsky marks the shift toward his later style, with the long takes throughout the film averaging one minute in length, with many four minutes or longer. These long scenes in turn rely heavily on the talent of the actors to sustain the mood, like Writer's long monologue in the sand mogul room. In "Stalker," Tarkovsky is definitively more systematic in his use of black-and-white (sepia) and color stocks than he had been in his previous works. In the swamp scene and Stalker's dream, Tarkovsky reverts to is more usual convention, where dreams are shown in black-and-white, and reality in color. However, the last scene is in color, implying a leakage of the powers of The Zone into the outside reality.As always in Tarkovsky's films, the natural world is present. Water, which used to be the source of life, a redemptive force and a center of regeneration, is now mostly a symbol of decay and pollution. The only exception is in the dream scene in the swamp, where the water is somewhat restored to its positive symbols. In the last scene in The Zone, the men, resigned to their limitations and weakness, sit outside The Room, as the rain falls inside, gently blocking them from entering.The wind is associated with the spiritual, and the earth is a positive force. Upon arriving in The Zone, Stalker's first act is to lie down and embrace it, and in the swamp, all three men lay on it. Like a miracle, there is the luxuriant, if dangerous, Nature ever present in the Zone, in contrast to the polluted outside world, where it is totally absent.And then there is the mysterious dog, which first appears in the swamp scene. Up to this point, the men felt totally alienated from their environment, outside and inside The Zone, and it is at the very moment when they start to meditate and remember, that the dog appears: The Zone is its territory. But at the end of the film, the dog has followed Stalker outside the Zone, showing that even there, the hope that the men were looking for inside The Zone must somehow also exist here, outside, as the dog establishes its own space even though it becomes domesticated in the process.Although Tarkovsky usually favors classics by such composers as Bach, Pergolesi, or Purcell, the musical score in "Stalker" consists almost exclusively of Eduard Artemiev's electronic music mixed with some folk melodies, contributing efficiently to the hypnotic atmosphere of the film.The performances of Nikolia Grinko and Anatoly Solonitsyn, as two lost souls in search of an answer, are convincing. Aleksandr Kajdanovsky is outstanding in his role of a tormented and somewhat pathetic Stalker. Although Alisa Frejndlikh's appearance in the film is restricted to only few scenes, there are most powerful.In "Stalker," Tarkovsky opposes a world in decline, polluted and sterile, to a verdant Zone, which has gotten the better of any human enterprises. He portrays a society which has severed all links with nature, with its own past, and lost its spiritual or moral bearings."Stalker" explores the conflict between science, rationalism, materialism, and cynicism versus spirituality, faith, art, and love. The three men embody different philosophical principles. Professor is a rational being who tries to understand the world according to the law of physics. He justifies his going into The Zone as purely scientific curiosity. Writer belongs to those people who cannot accept the world as it is. He is well aware of humanity's decay and of his own as well, but he abhors science, which he does not understand, and would rather look for answers in the supernatural. Writer believes in the redemptive power of art, but he has lost his own inspiration.Stalker is alone in showing an inclination toward faith. He knows The Zone and has total faith in it, speaking about it as if it were a living being. Stalker respects and fears The Zone at the same time, as he recognizes its potential to provide comfort to the wretched ones who, like himself, have lost all hope, but at the same time it punishes who so ever infringes its rules. This, of course, is how most religious people see their own Gods.The redemptive power of love is personified by Stalker's wife. Her love and devotion is the final miracle which opposes cynicism and the emptiness of the modern world. All these ideas are clearly expressed at the film's end, as she addresses the audience in her heartfelt monologue.As the three characters reach The Room, they can ask for their dearest wishes to be granted, but this would require a painful and searching self-examination, with the realization that what they thought they wanted was not exactly what they now really want. For Professor, his true aim was to destroy The Room, which was beyond his scientific understanding. Writer had said that the purpose of his journey was to regain his genius, his inspiration. However, on the threshold of The Room, he realizes that he may not worthy of accepting The Room's gift. As for Stalker, he asks for nothing of The Room, his only purpose to make the trip being to bring hope and happiness to those most retched than he."Stalker" is certainly Tarkovsky's most complex and most beautiful film, and is worthy of many viewings to appreciate its aesthetic and depth. Unfortunately, the word limitation of this review does not allow one to explore all the intricacies of this extraordinary film and do it justice.</fullReview>

Normally it's you who "summon" the pictures and feelings from the movie when you find cues (feelings/pictures) to it in your environment.But this movie just keeps appearing without no obvious reason at all, filling you with feelings and beautiful images out of the blue.See it and make up your own mind, could be i'm just on the verge of going mad after all ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Silent Monolith Needs to Be Explored</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first Tarkovsky experience, and I'm overwhelmed by its imagery power. The film is pure joy, which, admittedly, requires some time and open mindness.'Stalker' begins when the camera navigates into a room as if we are entering an art gallery. In those images of introduction there is a strange tension between calm, peace, but also a threatening feeling of mysteriousness. It is a feeling which goes throughout the whole film, some sort of a basic flow or vibration which keep fantasy and thoughts of the viewer always busy. The picture of the three persons in the bed, the Stalker and his family, appears as a painting or a collage, showing primary luck and happiness but being now doomed to downfall. This extremely intense atmosphere is capturing and therefore very 'joyful' to watch and go through.I won't get into plot details. Just some things on the characters first: The three persons who enter the Zone are representing different kinds of human ideologies, coming along as a soul trip. We have the Stalker, the one who leads the other two into the forbidden area. He stands for individuality. He is an obsessive, a desperate who escapes his real life and believes he can only exist and unfold himself in the Zone. The writer, cynical and sarcastic, a quitter, embodies the nihilistic ideology of the civilization. The professor represents the scientific conscience.The Zone sometimes appears to be as not real, but maybe also shows the inner cosmos of the three men. Tarkowsky kind of abolishes the difference between inner and outer world by permanently switching from monologues to dialogues, from black/white to color, from close-ups to totals and the other way round.That's not it, not only a soul trip of three failed men (and in that respect of human conscience), but it's also the urge to get to the insight, the truth, the veracity of the damaging progressive human civilization. You see rotting industrial constructions and instruments, you see how the nature takes back what it has lost, captured in beautiful picture compositions (i.e. the fish in the river, surrounded by cans, a Christ figure, coins and oil).What makes the film quite intriguing is that it's not only an apocalyptic description, not only all negative. In the stunning imagery, especially the image of water, you see the miracle of life, something wonderful and esthetically very appealing.At the end, the wife of the Stalker asks him 'What would be life without harm?' A life without harm would be also a life without happiness and hope. She, who didn't want him to go, welcomes him again and brings him to bed.His daughter without legs (and that is the most powerful and enthralling shot I hardly have seen before in a film) sits at a table, we see her profile of the face, and she is silent. She looks at three cups, moves them with the power of telekinesis, one falls on the floor and breaks into pieces. Is that the will of God? The power of free will? The influence of the Zone? Do the three glasses represent the traveling men? Maybe this picture alone is the expression of the mystery of life, the question on how we effectuate, what we cause and what we shall effectuate in this world and in it's nature. Maybe it is the question on the ranking of love and passion when Stalker's wife doubts a life without harm and happiness and hope. Maybe Tarkowsky hits on his own society in the communist totalitarian Soviet Union. Maybe the film goes beyond that and doubts other promises of fortune of other societies. Maybe. Certainly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whats with the reviews for this film????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading the reviews on IMDb has cemented what I have always felt about this film and about art in general. It is not always about a "product" that sums things up in a tidy sentence or a two hour film. It is possible to criticize this film based on the conventions of the medium, but thats besides the point. Sure the stalker is the only fleshed out character, but the writer and the scientist are not even supposed to be characters to begin with. I think its fairly obvious they are archetypes that represent a conflict. Some people have said that the science versus religion thing is tired, this is missing the point completely!!!! Its the absurdity of trying to reduce any conflict to a duality to begin with. The scene where we observe them sitting together makes it all very clear. We are observing them from the very room itself, where our innermost desires are laid bare and revealed. With this insight we can see that there is no duality to begin with, but only different ways to strive towards an understanding, the characters are joined together, their separation dissolves. Someone mentioned that this film is "straining for deepness, and many a viewer will constantly feel this strain." They seemed a little confused because most films strain for this, as do most people!!!!! A successful film will always have this strain because that is part of our existence. Stalker evokes that yearning and allows us to feel it, and that is one of its best qualities I think. To actual visually embody the yearning for meaning, thats what A.T. has done here.Stalker vs. Solaris: Another point of contention on IMDb, Most people seem to like a Solaris more...all I will say is this: Solaris is much more obvious and much more straightforward. I guess people find it easier, but in its supposed "humanism" its actually quite sterile, its clean. It presents human problems but through a haze of "greatness" that you will find with a lot of art. Its filmed from a further distance is what I am trying to say.Stalker is the down and dirty, the swamp, the overgrowth, insects, water, rotting, rust. Its a much more dynamic world, just like our striving is much more dynamic than duality. Its dark, confusing, musty, a little frightening, but extremely beautiful. I would like to mention the use of the word pretentious. If you have you used the word pretentious in your review please read a dictionary and understand a word before you use it. That word is used constantly to instantly demonize something. It is the equivalent of calling someone an anti-semite. It is loaded and works against serious discussion and observation. THIS FILM IS NOT PRETENTIOUS BECAUSE IT DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO IMPRESS OR HOLD ANY GREAT IMPORTANCE!!!!!!! It just exists as it does and its people afterwords that attach importance to it. A.T. refused to ever state clearly what this film is about. So you can discount everything that I just said and anyone else said about it. Like life, like existence itself there is no clear meaning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Zone and the Kingdom of Heaven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There could be many things to say about Tarkovsky and his films. The most important (which could be found in many comments ) is that he does not offer us a very clear interpretation , leaving us to guess, wonder and question ourselves.My interpretation of this film is that the whole trip to the Zone and to its core, the Room its a metaphor for the dangerous trip the human soul takes in searching the redemption and finally the Kingdom of Heaven. Stalker (like Jesus) is the one who shows the way to this kingdom - and there are some arguments to this idea. First, before entering the dangerous Zone, he lies on the grass thinking (or praying?), just like Jesus did in the garden of Ghetsimani before being crucified. Stalker is the one who shows who could reach the final point of this trip: not the good or the bad, but the desperate ones. Stalker is the one who fights with the professor (another metaphor for the rational and logical part of our minds) who wants to destroy the Zone, and also Stalker is the one who in the end laments over the lack of will people have to enter the Zone and to believe in its powers.There are so many powerful shots in this film and I choose only some who really got to me: 1. the destroyed tanks in the first part of the trip are for me the communist weapons who tried to destroy the faith and the church in Russia and in the other communist countries. They failed. 2. the objects shown in the water when the 3 heroes sleep near it, the money, the weapon, the tiles under the water describe the precarity of our material world. 3.the water in the film, from the beginning until the end - it is pure poetry. 4. one dialog between the writer an Stalker, the writer is saying: "who needs your room, i don't need your room" - it reminded me the dialog between Ivan Karamazov and Alexei Karamazov, the first saying to the other: "I don't need your God"But this is only one interpretation, and if it would be the only one, we would not be talking about a great great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's very obvious to everyone that this film is not a movie. Why is it not equally obvious that it is not an entertainment either? It is not even a work of art. It's a work of mind, a powerful mind of a philosopher. Why don't we take works of Kierkegaard and let an average American reader rate it?OK, I don't need to sound so angry. I don't even pretend that I understand it all. The film makes you think about as many different topics as your particular brain can harbor and approach. What a mighty stir! But you can only take it as far as you are capable of. I don't know what I would do if this film were not as slow as it is. I think my head would explode. Or I'd simply stop reacting to what the film is trying to tell me, simply become numb, as we become numb to crime, war, famine and market chronicles in the daily news. But the film's intention is not to stop me from thinking, but to make me think. And in that it succeeds more than any other film I have ever seen.It can not be compared with other films and therefore should not be rated.It is NOT FOR EVERYONE. But EVERYONE, who approaches it as he would approach a serious book, will come out of this experience richer and wiser than before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating, elliptical masterpiece which replays and resonates in the mind long after it has finished.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taking its inspiration from an Eastern bloc sci-fi novel entitled The Roadside Picnic by Arkadi and Boris Strugatsky, "Stalker" is a film that literally typifies Andrei Tarkovsky's approach to film-making. Mysterious, personal, elliptical, beautiful, philosophical, disturbing, inspiring ? all at the same time. But there are two factors above all others that make this film truly a work of genius. Firstly, if Tarkovsky ever intended the audience to glean one specific interpretation of his film he never shows his cards, thereby inviting every individual viewer to undergo an experience vastly different than the person sitting next to them. Secondly, "Stalker" is one of those rare films that replays and resonates in your mind long after it has finished. You may be driving along months after you last saw it, and an image or idea from the film might suddenly pop into your mind. You may be running a bath one morning and for no obvious reason find your musing about one of the many mysteries generated in the film.In a small, unspecified country, there exists a Zone where the laws of science and logic cease to hold true. The Zone was formed following a meteorite strike (or possibly a celestial visitation). Now, the border of the Zone is continually patrolled by armed guards with instructions to prevent anyone from entering. And there are plenty of people who WOULD like to enter, for rumours abound that at the centre of the Zone lies a Room where innermost wishes can be granted. Stalker (Aleksandr Kajdanovsky) makes a living by smuggling people into the Zone and guiding them through its hazardous landscape to the Room. His wife (Alisa Frejndlikh) has grown to detest his frequent absences on such dangerous jobs, more so because while he is away she must tend to their daughter Monkey (Natasha Abramova), physically disabled yet in possession of telekinetic powers due to her father's exposure to the Zone. Stalker finds himself taking two new "customers" into the Zone ? Writer (Anatoli Solonitsyn), who wishes to find fresh inspiration, and Professor (Nikolai Grinko), who claims to be fascinated by the scientific mysteries within the Zone, but is in fact on a secret mission to blow it up in order to prevent the potential for an evil person to have their darkest wishes granted at the Room.Tarkovsky presents the outer world as an impoverished, litter-strewn dump, shot in endlessly dull sepia colours, while the scenes based in the Zone are filmed in striking colour to emphasis the lush greenery. But he also makes the Zone seem permanently dangerous, with Kajdanovsky uttering cryptic warnings about its ever-changing pathways and wearing furtive, fearful expressions upon his face all the time they are there. By having his camera more often than not positioned at some distance from the characters, Tarkovsky makes the audience feel like spies and this in turn creates paranoid suspense, as if the three main characters are continually being watched by some unknown force. In the film's stunning climax, Stalker assumes messianic characteristics - he breaks down in tears and laments the fact that nobody he has taken to the Room has fulfilled their dreams. "Nobody believes. Nobody! Who am I going to take there? Oh, God? And what's most awful is that no-one needs it. No-one needs that room, and all my efforts are just in vain". Like Jesus, Stalker is trying to convince people that they MUST have faith?. Tarkovsky's shattering conclusion is that he cannot win in the face of a cynical society, but the one redeeming fact is that his daughter's amazing powers may give her strength to succeed where her father has not. This is challenging, essential cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tarkovsky's 'Stalker' is the film that made me fall in love with cinema; write tens of pages on movies I have watched; go to America, following a crazy dream of becoming a film director - and thus influencing my later life immensely. I had read the book by Brothers Strugatski before seeing the movie and I think those two narratives are quite different. The book supplies us with the necessary background as Tarkovski never bothers to give any explanations in his film. I will not try to persuade anyone in 'Stalker's virtues - this film is way beyond that. I am sure it will be hated by many, but - with no intention of sounding rude - I couldn't care less. There have only been a handful of movies that, in the process of me watching them, have given me the intense feeling of penetrating to the essence of things - and God at its heart - thus bringing tears to my eyes. 'Stalker' - in its tender and humane ways - is probably the best of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow, Highly Overrated, Interreting, and Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that the bizarre atmosphere created in this picture is one of the most fascinating of anything I've seen in science-fiction. The debates between the characters are intriguing. The journey into "the zone" is one of the finest dream pieces I've ever seen on film. The problem is that these parts cannot save the whole. STALKER contains far too many mood sequences in which the plot takes a break and poetry takes over. The film's symbolism is all glaringly obvious and can't justify the monstrously bad pacing. The ending is also a major let-down. What the hell happened? Tarkovsky started his carreer with brilliant promise. Then it all went to hell with SOLARIS. This is better (in spots) than SOLARIS, but not much better. The story could have been told more effectively in the space of 85, just over half its running time. I usually enjoy long movies but this one was death due to pacing and an overdependence on "meaning." Skip this and see ANDREI ROUBLEV instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We are all Stalkers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stalker is the one of the most bizarre movies I have ever seen. There is a strange zone with high security levels to keep out the ordinary people. It is said once a mysterious crash from outer space happened there. It is also said there is a strange room some where in that zone with power to fulfill every dream. There are only few men how know where that room is and know the zone well enough to avoid all its tricks and dangers. These men, these guides, are called The Stalkers.This movie is a bout two ordinary men who want to go into that zone with the help of a Stalker. One of them is a writer who has lost his inspiration and ability to write. The other is a scientist who seems to be curious about the room and its mysterious power.The journey begins and we see them enter and pass through the zone. The world outside the zone is black and white but after they enter the zone every thing turns to be colored. It clearly shows the differences between the two worlds. One of them is boring and frustrating but the other has some kind of spirit inside. However we never see any other life in there except the three travelers. It is completely a new world by its special rules and order. The silence of the area by itself heightens the tone of mystery. All the time we feel like somebody is watching us, but who? Maybe because we are afraid of something that we don't know what is it.Finally when they reach the room struggles between them arises. The scientist carries out a small nuclear bomb to destroy the zone. He believes any dangerous people and rotten politician could get there and make a bad wish. Who knows the next person who wishes to go there? But the power of the movie I think starts to reveal itself here. The stalker explains this room could be a hope for many people. His life has been spent to guide people there. This room is a symbol of hope more than any other thing. At this point we start to think: does the room really have a super natural power? It seems the two travelers wanted to see that room more because of their curiosity than their believe in it.I think even the two travelers are signs and symbols. The writer is a representative of the artistic feelings of human. The scientist is the representation of logical aspect of human. Both these two parts can't find their way in the modern life. Which one could lead our lives better? Both the writer and the scientist seem confused and helpless in that room. At last they reach an agreement to leave that room alone and don't ask anything form it.They seem more like the Stalker after they have nothing to do with the room. The rain finally starts to fall over them maybe washing their sins and make them ready for a new life. The rain and water are among the key materials in all Tarkovsky's movies. I guess they are the symbols of life and its continuity.The three wretched men are the main subject of the film not the science fiction background and the story of the zone. The director wants to show us their deep emotions and feelings but not to analyze them and clarify who they are. They are like us with their ambitions and hopes. We all might be happy if we could find our own room of dreams. But after all, do we dare enough to go there and make a wish? That room is us in the mirror. It only reflects our deep thoughts, feelings and fears. It shows what we want to be or afraid to become ? It's not a usual movie to watch. All the Tarkovsky's movies are great mysteries. He is a modern poet who does not impose his ideas. It's more like an open text to read freely and with different kinds of interpretation. Tarkovsky's films are new worlds to face and would never repeat again anywhere. I think this film should be regarded as struggle of life to find a meaning for itself. But whether there is a meaning or not, no one knows the answer.At the end of the film we see Stalker's paralyzed little girl moving objects over the tables by mental power. Maybe she was able to do that because his father believed deep in his heart that room had the power to fulfill his wish. That room made him to move on and show the way to others. It is a strange end like all the other Tarkovsky's films.I rated this film 9 out of 10 and I'm sure it is well worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Andrei Tarkovsy's STALKER is one of these films whose reputation is entirely confined to that of Universiy level film studies . It's a film that remains unknown to people who visit multiplexes on a Friday night to watch the latest blockbuster from Hollywood and is rarely shown on network television . I think its only broadcast on British television was on Channel 4 in 1990 or 1991 . Nevertheless it was well regarded enough to make it in to the the lower reaches of the IMDb Top 250 for a couple of years but I'm rather puzzled as to why ? It's not a film produced for the masses which possibly sums the up inherent irony of communism The story starts 20 years after a meteorite has landed on Earth and when people have started disappearing in the crash zone the authorities quarantine the area which is now referred to as " the Zone " . A trio of men sneak through the blockade determined to find out the secret of the Zone This is communist science fiction based upon a story written by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky . Communist science fiction differs quite markedly from its Western counterpart by concentrating on metaphysics , man's relationship to the natural order rather than plot driven concepts . In many ways it's introspective humanism rather than mind expanding and imaginative . This type of story would appeal well to Tarkovsky since his volume of wok centres around elemental imagery such as water and wind . He is a film maker who is the archetypal auteur The problem with all this is that it makes for a rather unengaging piece of cinema . If you're expecting to see aliens you'll be disappointed . There is an argument that science fiction doesn't need aliens in order to work and this is certainly true , think of the number of novels by people such as John Christopher that feature Earth shattering eco disasters for a premise . But if you had three men in Soviet Russia escaping in to a forbidden zone where they walk around discussing the human condition for three hours then you'd have the exact same story devoid of any science fiction heading . In short STALKER isn't really a science fiction film at all At least the film sets out its stall right from the very beginning . We're treated to the type of camera work seen in films by luminaries as Bela Tarr where the camera moves about for several minutes without cutting . We don't actually get any dialogue until ten minutes in to the running time and if you're bored senseless by then then it's perhaps a good idea to watch something else because the pace doesn't really improve much One of the comments on this page states that STALKER is " Like Last Of The Summer Wine set in Russia " and that's a very accurate description of the movie . It's composed of three philosophical men wandering about the countryside making profound statements on the nature of existence . You might rub your chin and nod in agreement but you might also have to rub your eyes in order to stay awake too</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>insufferably boring and egotistical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was in fact the most boring film I have ever seen in my entire life. I am not a hater of slow paced movies-- my favorite film of all time is 2001: a space odyssey-- but some movies, like this one, manage to drag you through what seems like five hours of mud without any payoff that you expect from a movie directed by a snail. This film very easily could have been a short story or a novella as the whole film was just simply walking and walking and then an occasional pause that the characters would take to reflect on universal truths and the meaning of their lives. Two hours could have been edited out. There are shots that last over five minutes where the camera does not move the least bit, and there seems to be no motive whatsoever for this decision. I felt many waves of pretentious as I sat through these laboriously long takes that gave the impression that the director did not in fact no how to build tension or emotion in a scene, except by letting the characters handle it. This works in Woody Allen movies, but in this film since the dialog is so repetitive and there is rarely any dramatic movement from the characters, you are left with the urge to gouge your own eyes out. I would rather eat my own flesh than watch this pointless exercise in pretentiousness and boredom. This film could have been a short play or a magazine article, and saved us the pain of watching three characters do the same thing over and over again in a series of mundane and repetitive shots. The lighting was awesome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tarkovsky remains, without question, one of the ultimate masters of the cinematic medium; a creator of deeply felt poetic ruminations on life, love, art and the metaphysical equations that fall somewhere beyond our grasp. He is/was a cinematic genius to rival both Bergman and Kieslowski, and his best films, like Andrei Rublev, Mirror, Nostalgia and The Sacrifice, are masterworks, fit to be filed away in the vaults marked "absolute classic masterpieces: vol. 1". Although Stalker lacks the more enchanting or ethereal moments of those milestones, it still represents Takovsky's ability to construct a deep and enriching story that plays as much off character detail and cinematic design as it does from notions of philosophy and mystical excess. By this point in his career, Tarkovsky had already dabbled in the broader notions of science fiction cinema with Solyaris, a film that I have always seen as the director's great failure... because it showed Tarkovsky trying too hard to conform to the rigid restrictions of Lem's watershed tome, therefore, obliterating the deep, poetic ambiance that his previous film (Rublev) and later works (Mirror, Nostalgia) would so effortlessly create.To some extent, Stalker is more like his masterpiece Mirror than the cold sci-fi of Solyaris, as it employs a more elliptical narrative that at times fractures beyond the point of clarity. We also see the same focus on a varying ensemble of characters, metaphysical alienation, internal and external use of emotional monologues, and one of the most amazing uses of cinematography ever seen. Here, the camera inhabits a different world to the characters, and, like other Tarkovsky films, somehow becomes an equal explorer; slowly moving away from the action to examine the location, the mood, and the relevance of the moment. With Tarkovsky, the camera is always relevant to the feel of the film... this affects his use of movement, composition, colour and contrast. Here, black and white and defused colour are inter-cut, to differentiate the strange power of the zone (central to the plot) in comparison to the bleak, desolate despair of the "real-world". The opening sequences of the film set up an atmosphere of dense, post-apocalyptic industrial dejection that establishes the universe of the film better than any written exposition ever could... whilst the camera, with it's deep black and white austerity, explores the decaying city and charred human remains in the same way in which von Trier's camera would in the later, Tarkovsky-influenced, The Element of Crime.Like that film, the plot here seems simple... however, if we scratch beneath the surface, we will find a multitude of hidden depths and sub-textual theories that branch off from that central narrative arc. In the film, the world has been ravaged by some terrible (nuclear?) atrocity that has left much of the country segregated. Because of a strong chance of infection, the fall-out area of this accident has been labelled "the zone" and is now heavily guarded by police and government officials. It is said that there is a sanctum hidden deep within the zone that was formed (perhaps) by mystical extraterrestrials (or whatever it was that caused such devastation) that will grant those brave enough to discover it their ultimate wish. This, of course, leads to curiosity, and those who desire entrance into the zone must seek the aid of the stalkers... men on the fringes of society, familiar with the workings of the zone, and courageous (or desperate?) enough to smuggle in "tourists" for a substantial fee. The stalker here is a classic Tarkovsky character - a world away from the typical hero (or anti-hero) that you would find in most sci-fi films - a man of great sadness and bouts of philosophical reflection who, when not risking his life by entering the zone, lives in a dilapidated shack with his dejected wife and psychic daughter.As with much of Tarkovsky's work, the central concept of the film is more of an excuse for philosophical rambling and metaphorical dream-logic as opposed to the usual sci-fi hallmarks like explosions and cheep effects. Instead, he uses space and location in a way that is absolutely amazing, drawing on the idea of an architectural narrative as he would with Nostalgia, so that the approach to the lighting, cinematography and style of the performance is dictated by the design of the location. He also takes on Godard's approach to sci-fi from Alphaville, with the present day filling in for the not to distant future (though here we see a much more expressionistic approach that puts emotional texture above post-modernist style). His uses of location are amazing, and the influence of this technique can be seen on everyone from Spielberg, to Winterbottom, to the above-mentioned von Trier... however, the texture that Tarkovsky creates just simply cannot be copied. In this film, we see the interplay between the poetic and the philosophical, with the conflict between the writer and the scientist germane to the plot, mirrored in the external conflict between the elements of the script (science versus religion, etc). It's intelligent stuff... and beautifully handled by the filmmakers.One could argue that Stalker perhaps lacks the emotional transcendence of his previous Mirror, or the deft narrative layering of the later Nostalgia... though the initial combination of science-fiction theatricality with art-house sensibilities is never less than impressive. It also has one of the dirtiest and most oppressive visual designs that I have ever seen (more so than other dingy delights like Europa, Delicatessen and the films of David Fincher), which, suffice to say, fits the pacing of the film perfectly. It is true, I suppose, that some viewers may feel put off by the snail-like pace or the continual jumps in both narrative and character (something prevalent in all this filmmaker's works), but those who are willing to travel with the Stalker will no doubt discover the film's innumerable, magical and thought-provoking pleasures, hidden deep within the zone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A short comment on the motifs and metaphors in this masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is based on a SF novel by the Strugatki brothers, called "Picknick at the side of the road" (the translation might not be very accurate). In spite of the very simplistic narrative and dramatic structure (the whole action takes place only in one day and only in three locations: the stalker's home, the bar where they meet and the Zone), this is the masterpiece of Tarkovski and probably of the whole cinema ART.You have to understand that this film is not sensational through its action, but through its metaphors and motifs. For example, the house motif, that appears in all his movies (The Sacrifice, Andrey Rubliov, Ivan's Childhood, Nostalghia etc.) also appears in Stalker, as everything that is outside the house. That means all the world that was destroyed and made hard to live in by man. Like the whole world, the stalkers home is ugly and sordid and like Rubliov he doesn't have a place to call home: "For me everywhere is a prison". Thats why he retires and finds his peace in the dangerous but alive and full of miracles space of the Zone. The Zone, sign of extraterrestrial or divine (apparently hostile) passage on earth, remains the only breathable place for man, because man hasn't reached to spoil it yet. The presence of the "wishing well" there says it all. The time in this film is as important, as in all tarkovskian art. The rhythm of the movie is given by the time that flows in it. The long frames express a relation between action and contemplation, between the meaning of that moment compared to the meaning of history. Although there are no retrospectives, the linear flow of the frames doesn't imply neither the subjective nor the objective characteristic of time. If you noticed, in the Zone they only travel in curves: "Here the shortest way is not the straight one" says the stalker to his companions. Anyway, these are few of the reasons why I think this is a masterpiece of the cinema art. For the ones that have rated this film less then "excellent" I would recommend that they see it again... and again... and again. "BUT, EVEN THEN THEY WILL NOT BELIEVE" - says the stalker at the end of his one day adventure. :) I would like to excuse myself for the spelling mistakes! (I'm from Romania :))</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stalker is more than a film; it is an act of Faith.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some say the zone was born from the crash of a meteorite, some say the zone is a gift from an Alien civilization. Whatever they say the zone is a miracle.An unnamed rainy city and in its surrounding is the Zone, in this Zone is a Room, and "here we are at the threshold. This is the most important moment of your lives. You have to know that here your most cherished wish, the most sincere one, the one reached through suffering" is about to come true.If we don't make the effort to change our point of view we may pass on a tremendously poetic experiment. In fact "Stalker" may very well appear as three hours bore fest... But if we take five minutes of our precious time to confront our questioning then we would witness how cinema connects directly with our heart and maybe with our Soul.In "Stalker" we follow three different persons who share a unique goal, reaching the zone but have very different reasons to do so. The stalker is a guide who takes the willing to the 'zone'. One is a professor. It seems his motivation is to see the scientific significance of the area. He believes in science and in science only. He is a realist. The second is a writer who wants to recover his lost inspiration. He only believes in facts and in facts only. He is a cynic. They are both hopeless and looking to reveal the secret of the zone...But does the zone bare any secret? And if so how could someone incapable of Hope, reveal a secret based on a simple wish?The film is a voyage not only from a town to the zone but also from monochrome browns to realistic colors and more importantly from shadow to enlightenmentAs mentioned the stalker is the guide, he is genuinely searching for the right path through the zone and to the room. He is pondering every decision he takes, not rushing through the zone but testing the path and approaching side ways. He proceeds in a caution manner guided it seems only by his intuition. It is so irrational that it irritates the writer who decides to go through the zone in a more straight forward fashion. But as we understand the zone like Life is not straight forward, not always rational as it reflects our fears, our despairs and our disbelieves. In short life is dangerous and so is the zone... The professor says it himself "going forward is scary but going back is shameful" so maybe the stalker's way is the only possible way. Unlike the two intellectuals he has the intuition of what reality is.Eventually it seems our three protagonists are involved in a spiritual struggle. The problem is the scientist and the writer are in denial of this spirituality and the stalker is an intuitive being who can't put a name on his spiritual search. For them Reality "is at best the result of the soul rubbing against the material world" and at worst sequences of facts. So in essence if you go looking for something you don't really believe in or you can't apprehend...would you find it?At the doorstep of the room our three protagonists refuse to go in. The Professor wants to destroy the room; he is scared of what he can't comprehend. The writer endorses the Professor's choice to destroy the room. He is scared of facing his own shadows. They both lack Faith in Humanity. The Stalker doesn't go in either. His place in this world is to guide people his hope lies in others not in himself. He has Faith in Humanity. But the Stalker can't let the so called intellectuals destroy the last place where people can hope and believe again. He reminds them that Hope is "all people have got left on this earth". Hope is what makes us Human?The disappointment of the Stalker is as big as his hope in the professor and the writer was, he had chosen carefully those two in the hope they will be able to put a name on his Faith, unfortunately they can't as if science and intelligence have nothing to do with Faith.A thunderstorm breaks out and rain starts to pore from the roof. Our three searchers sit down behind a water curtain reflecting on their incapability to hope and believe in the better of themselves. Everyday when I wake up I have endless doubts but every night when I go to sleep I have recover my Faith in me, in others?Everyday I search through the Zone of my Life and every night I stand at the doorstep of the Room?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to THE ZONE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably my favorite Tarkovsky film. This is an examination of the conscience. He physically takes us to a place that represents our conscience, appropriately called The Zone. A place where obviously the government fears us entering. The Stalker here is a Christ-like figure amongst the two men, one is an artist, a writer and the other is a scientist, a professor, both characters questioning existence and the meaning of life from their own separate but not entirely different perspectives. The Stalker feels that they both have the ultimate potential to be fine candidates to enter The Zone, a place where for very intensely personal reasons only he can venture or escort anybody who he deems fit. The naive chick with her fur coat and sports car was told that she better go back to where she came from upon introduction. However even the most wretched must know how to behave themselves in The Zone. We are confused because we are not entirely sure what it is that we want due to the conflict between our mind and our heart. Our conscience plays with us, The Zone is tricky. A stray dog without the gift of human spirit is allowed to wonder freely. We have to be like children again in The Zone.....its all poetic and Biblical, an extremely spiritual movie. I like the slow pace in which he takes us deeper and deeper to find some understanding. This is the ideal way to approach and make a science-fiction movie. This is a spiritual experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Master's Failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I want to say that Tarkovsky is one of my favorite directors of all time. His Zerkalo and Andrey Rublyov are among the Best films ever made and I can not even say which one I consider better - they just go together in my mind as two masterpieces - heights of such light, purity and power that they can not be surpassed even by the Master himself. So, you can see, I am not afraid of Tarkovsky's complex poetic symbolism, his seemingly slow camera or the questions that he often leaves unanswered.With this said,I do not like Stalker and even more, I believe it was Tarakovsky's failure even though, the master's failure has got all signs of his greatness - stunning black and white cinematography, debates among the characters about meaning of life and nature of one's deepest desires, the journey into "the zone" to the magic room that is one of the finest dream -like pieces ever seen on the screen. But somewhere among all these fine pieces something very important is missing. Maybe the problem is with the main character of the film, the nameless Stalker who in a film is such a saintly, suffering, and I dare say pompous figure that I just can not care about him very much.***Spoilers for the book "Roadside Picnic"In the original book "Roadside Picnic" by Strugatsky Brothers on which the film is loosely based the stalker had a name, Roderick (Red) Schuhart. He was not a saint; he was a human being with a lot of weaknesses. Like a Stalker in the film, Red had inhuman intuition and luck that had helped him to survive the multiple trips to the Zone. But the Zone caught up with him in the end, and he was playing the ultimate price watching how his only child who was born as a beautiful and joyful girl was turning into the strange and mute animal. That was why Red decided to make the last trip to the Zone and find the legendary Golden Sphere (the Room in the film) that could grant any wish. Red knew he could not go alone because just when you thought that you reached the Sphere there was an ultimate trap that could only be fed by a human being. Such great and desperate was Red's desire to get his daughter back that he took with him an innocent young man, teenager really, perfectly knowing that that man will never return from the Zone. The Stalker of the film KNOWS what other people's deepest and hidden desires could be, in the book, Red found out that after he finally reached the Sphere, he did not know what and how to ask; his only hope was that the magic tool would reach inside his soul and find that his soul was still alive and bleeding from pain and begging for his daughter and for forgiveness. I found the last chapter of the book much more interesting, deeper, and tragic than all the debates among the characters and monologues of the Stalker and his wife in the film.***End for the book's spoilersTarkovsky took only the final chapter of the book and used it for the film. He himself along with the Strugatsky Brothers had rewritten the screenplay many times until he was satisfied with it. Before I started to write this post, I found the screenplay on line and read it just to refresh the film in my memory. I was surprised how short and dynamic the screenplay was. I do not understand how with a screenplay like that and with all its beauty the film turned to be remote, passionless, extremely long and (please forgive me all the fans) boring. I love every minute of 205 Andrey Rublyov's minutes and I would beg for more. I treasure every moment of 108-minutes long Zerkalo, and I have seen it five times. But Stalker, IMO, is the Master's weakest work. I would not mind if it was much shorter than its extremely difficult 169 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>lets get one thing straight, this is an art film for art/academic people. therefore if you're looking forward to watching a sci-fi film then forget it it takes the stalker around 9 minutes to get out of bed. then he meets up with some blokes who want to go to 'the zone'. he then takes them to 'the zone' in some kind of rail cart and we are treated to several minutes worth of railway clamping sounds. these blokes then hang about in a field yes we can discuss all the philosophical meaning behind it but lets face it.. it's like 'last of the summer wine' set in Russia, with no fun or enjoyment of any kindokay i'll admit some of the shots are beautiful but if a film is about audience satisfaction, then this is not a film. it's a collection of long drawn out artistic set pieces. also the whole non diegetic sound thing doesn't work as well here as it did in Solyaris for exampleyes this is experimental cinema, but to be graded alongside conventional film and be given a rating of 8.something is highly unrealistic and misleading to a film layman who might be coming on this website to discover a new sci fi movie to enjoywhat irritates me as well about movies of this kind is that they are often wielded by creatively limited people who want to impress with their wide appreciation and knowledge of cinemabefore watching this film a friend of mine who is an absolute film connoisseur in every regard gave me some advice. he told me that if i want to have a good sleep then i should watch stalker</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Top 3 Films of All Time, If Not the Greatest Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stalker is a work of art, one of the supreme creations in the medium. This does not only refer to the visual mastery present in the film, but also to the profound ideas discussed in the narrative. Visually, the film flows beautifully, with long takes throughout, often portraying the faces of the three main characters, giving us a glimpse into their inner worlds, or of the zone itself, alive and lush in contrast to the drab sepia toned world portrayed at the beginning of the film. The sound design is spacious and echoing, giving the world an alien feel which perfectly fits with the stalker's reverence for the zone. Anatoliy Solonitsyn is perfect as the writer, and the performance of the professor is very good, but the stalker delivers a performance which feels sadly desperate. The narrative itself discusses topics such as the meaning of life, mankind's true desires, the goals of the artist and nature of belief. If you want to find a film to change your view on the potential of the medium to work as art and as profound commentary on philosophic ideas, look no further. Stalker is essential cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest film of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is it, where is it, how will it affect me? A guide leads to men through an area known as the Zone to find a room that grants wishes. To show no respect for this film is to sin. From a cinematographic viewpoint looking in, it's most certainly close to flawless. Tarkovsky presents to us a journey into the heart of darkness, through the eyes of the breathtaking decadent beauty of the Soviet Union's cinema, by way of what could be an exhibition in a gallery for us to breathe and to absorb. Tarkovsky is one of the most impeccable and original directors, if not the most, of all time, hailed by Ingmar Bergmam as simply: 'The Master', and Stalker represents the height of what the human mind is capable of casting on a screen. Many a time has Stalker been criticised for being too slow paced, too drawn out; but my goodness does it work. It will weld us to our seat with some sort of invisible energy the poetic acting, an awe-inspiring location, and engrossingly reflective concepts throw at us. Such wisdom, such aura, such an off- the-wall perspective laced with metaphor. An encapsulating quote from Stalker reads as follows: "While I am digging for the truth, so much happens to it that instead of discovering the truth I dig up a heap of, pardon... I'd better not name it. A man writes because he is tormented, because he doubts. He needs to constantly prove to himself and the others that he's worth something. And if I know for sure that I'm a genius? Why write then? What the hell for? The Zone wants to be respected. Otherwise it will punish." The nature of the zone itself: its mystery, its tantalising fear and its stagnant silence elevate to one of the greatest fictional supernatural worlds of all time: alongside the ranks of Narnia and The Galaxy.Looking back at some of the great moments in cinema history: the horse's head in the bed, the twist to 'You Never Can Tell', few are left out of the dust by Stalker's 'dream sequence', whereby the characters balm us with a beautiful and thoughtful script whilst the camera pans over a river filled with objects in sepia, each representing something so different, and inviting a convention of interpretation: is the Zone's room an allegory for the threshold of heaven, because there is a picture of St Peter in the river? Or is the Zone's invisible and mythical aggression a metaphor for nature's reclaim of the abandoned and the inhospitable, as the dust and sediment covers a sunken syringe just upstream from St Peter. The significance and depth of this film is otherworldly and almighty. Eduard Artemiev's score is in perfect balance with the images shown to us, mixing a sensual blend of eastern and distant melodies with the screen's mists, mosses and relics. Few films which specialise in the power of one specific emotion can conjure as much effect as Stalker does for suspense (specifically the phenomenal scene in the tunnel/meat grinder), philosophy, fear, choice and anguish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't "watch" -- Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Other reviewers have covered important points, but the essential quality of this film has only been danced around by a few.'Stalker' is not to be watched, it is to be experienced. Those who find it too long or boring are standing outside the experience, looking on. Stalker is like an ancient spiritual or healing ritual. It offers you the opportunity to enter into the process and by joining in at each step, allowing the carefully crafted pacing to work on you, come to a point of transformation. Each person has a different understanding of this film because what's in the Room is different for each of us. Every one of us has a deepest wish, usually unconscious, around which our entire life revolves. It drives all our decisions and relationships with people, things, society. And as the film makes clear, our goading wish is quite often not what we think it is - and not what we want it to be.Entered into in the right way, this film can bring you to a new understanding of yourself. You may learn something you wish you hadn't. That's what happened for me... but I'd rather know. Others may choose differently. Others may choose not to even enter the journey into their personal Zone, in which case this film will seem long and boring, like someone else's dream.Experiencing this film was a pivotal point in my life. It profoundly changed me. Like ancient rituals, this is what art - real art - is supposed to do, and Tarkovsky is the greatest master.If anyone would like to discuss this film with me, please email.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Andrei Tarkovsky is a rarity among filmmakers. Russian film school, dominant in the world. A classic movie that has all the elements of art, freely can say that one of the achievements for which the film has the status of art. Great story, masterly direction, perfect photography and great camera. Movie for the true fans of film, certainly one of my favorites. Acting in the film is certainly excellent. It can be said that the choice of actors is also great. Sure, Stalker is a film that I would like to recommend to all fans of a good story and a good movie. Andrei Tarkovsky is with this movie showed why he is one of the cult director. And the story about this film is not finished in the cinema but the per movie was created and a video game that also has cult status.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Random banter on a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a masterpiece. You can tell from the fact that it would be just as good without sound, or sound without image, or even just a set of freeze frames played out.That being said, what you actually get in this film is intense and vast imagery, from the minute to the universal, horrible dankness to expanding nature, inside and outside of rooms; and what is also rare, is that NOTHING is wasted in the script, no fillers, and no retreat from exactly what is going on.The things that turn people off about it are all of its virtues, it's long, it takes its time, its script is poetry, and it doesn't shy away from talking about life.It is also complex, but does not 'try' to be complex. It's actors, all of whom are cast perfectly, especially the almost alien demeanour of Alexander Kaidonovsky (as the paid for hire 'Stalker'), are not really there to entertain you, you are there in Communist Russia walking through cold wet puddles, with little in the way of supplies, going somewhere strange, without knowing what's going to happen.If the world of film was filled with the opposite of this, which it is, one would have to search through the dross to find anything as worth while as this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do you know interesting facts?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's my most dear, secret movie, which I'm ready to watch again and again making journey with characters. As already mentioned in some comments, it's not even film, it's co-existence with travelers, it's a road to your heart or to God, or to elsewhere. I could tell much about this masterpiece, but would like to say about things people, even fond of Tarkovsky art, might unaware of. Below is a quote from Tarkovsky; "For me this work is expression of power of a weak man, man of faith, man of highest spirit. His actions might be impractical and absurd. But impracticality is a sign of high spirit. He has an idea. There is no Zone. He just invented so to take two-three desperate people, bring them there and inspire an idea of some hope for the happiness sake. But finally none of them want to enter this simple room". This is a answer to those (I'm also amongst them), who expressed they guesses that the Zone and the Room are not actually produce miracles or disasters, but just Stalker's words. Though we see corpses, tanks and other things that supposedly confirm the existence of something supernatural, but real miracle (or peril, or change of mind, or growing of souls, if you want) takes places spiritually. This Tarkovsky's explanation (some people, as I am, realized this even before learning Tarkovsky's words) only adds depth to the film. Another interesting point is that the final monologue of Stalker's Wife supposed to be IN BAR (and it's actually shot THERE ? look at the wall behind her, when she is speaking), not in Stalker's home. I learnt about it from interview of the editor of the film. She (it was a women) offered Tarkovsky to move this scene from the bar closer to the end so to have an effect of addressing not only to Writer and Professor, but to the soul of an amateur. The editor said to Tarkovsky that the difference of the surroundings would not be marked by a amateur because his attention on that moment is fixed on the face of Alisa Freindlich (Wife). Tarkovsky finally agreed and put this scene to the final and it became much deeper then it would have been in the bar. Wife now addresses to all of us (as Writer did sitting near a hole in the Zone after going through the "meatgrinder'). I watched film many times and paid attention to the interior of Wife's monologue ? it's in the bar! Thanks to advise of films editor we have such a important change of the final moments of film. To end it I would like to mark a strong scene, almost nowhere mentioned. When crippled daughter of Stalker seems to walk? Film returns in color and Artemiev's music is heard as to underline the miracle. And several seconds later camera moves revealing us the truth ? she is sitting on Stalker's shoulders. What a piercing, shrill moment of a miracle that took place only in our imagination. Wonderful moments!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is happiness? What is the meaning of life? What is the Zone? And what exactly is reality? These questions and many more you will find yourselves asking as you enter the Zone, a place with a Room where all wishes come true. Don't expect too many answers, but try to enjoy the journey, even amidst the decay and ruin of both man and machine.Tarkovsky's Zone is a place of magic, a place where ordinary physical laws don't apply. If one is skeptical that the scenery is what it is, and that there is nothing more to it than what you see with your eyes, the camera in conjunction with the dialogue works hard to convince you otherwise. Distance, scale, and position are all warped, not by any special effect of the camera as in ordinary sci-fi movies, but by the positioning, angle, and movement of the camera within a shot.To take one harrowing example: In the early part of the journey to the Room contained within the central core of the Zone, the small company of travelers, the Stalker, the Professor, and the Writer, pass a blackened trailer containing intact fleshy skeletons. The camera tracks the travelers as they move from a vantage point that deliberately inserts this trailer of death in between. Ever so slowly it creeps up to the scene of death, enlarging and magnifying the details of the decaying corpses, until the camera, having just gotten past the point where it has crept so far up, then overshoots the dead. But it stops; so that while the travelers contemplate the fate of these dead "tourists" to the Zone, we are aware that we are actually sitting on top of them.Metal armor, assorted trinkets, and other material possessions that man has donned or created all fall by the wayside and are discarded and rusted at the bottom of pools of water that saturate the Zone. Man's life and possessions are ephemeral and in a constant state of decay in our industrialized, bleak world. Man is removed from Nature, not just in Soviet life but everywhere we look. It becomes apparent that the only way to survive such ruin of both spirit and home is with faith and hope.But we don't always know our innermost desires so a trip to the Room is fruitless if we have a specific goal in mind. The central dilemma is that the Stalker's faith is predicated upon his belief that the inner desires of most people are good. However, the Writer and Professor, from different but not necessarily opposing perspectives, espouse a view that their deepest desires may not necessarily have the best intentions, despite a basic sense of morality that pervades their respective consciences. This is what I think Tarkovsky was trying to depict, without giving an answer, since there may not be one in this brilliant, philosophical, haunting, and beautifully poetic meditation on what it means to be human in a particular reality that we can see but not really ever grasp.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...to become one with the girls face at the end. Those eyes, that let in what they see... I was not able to forget this great honest minute in cinema, and I am very happy having seen this before my children became eight, nine, ten years old. Yes, I felt something, back in the days I was watching "Stalker", and 'understood' the lines by Khalil Gibran "Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself." But my culture had taught me: I have to preserve my children from something, keep them away from my feelings. Marta's father simply did nothing to her...That most people don't know what hope is, what wishes are, and that there is no need to do anything to "make it come true" - these issues I had understood instantly; I had anticipated most of the upcoming events in the story because there was enough time while watching this film. The lack of surprises was not the 'boring' aspect - that was to stand the lies and how they eat up the power from the men. Through "Stalker" I learned what boredom is to me - simply the lack of truth. Since truth is always within myself boredom is the barred inner paths. Another film I saw that days, "Teorema" by Pasolini, was like a supplement to this inner knowledge. Both cleaned up something for my whole life.I gave the movie a second title: "When three liars go for a walk".But there is a look in the girls eyes at the end that cannot be played, that is always there in the eyes of children who had understood that they will die. (In "Nostalghia" they are missed.) Don't fake yourself with discussions like "Is this science fiction or not". Every movie is fiction and this has not much to do with science although there is a professor on the phone.In "The Sacifice" ("offret") Tarkowski solved his own riddle. Marta knew, and nobody was able to listen so she had nothing to say. May the water pour into our rooms of wishes. May there sometime be someone who covers us. Before the last rest.</fullReview>

It is by our vulnerability that we choose what needs to be done.Certainly, there's a man's power, but it will rest asleep inside him until he finds himself in need.

		<shortDescription>"The Zone wants to be respected. Otherwise it will punish."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like a solemn and reflective piece of poetry, Andrei Tarkovsky's 'Stalker' moves forward slowly. Though loosely based on an undeniable straight science-fiction novel, 'Roadside Picnic' by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky, the film is less concerned with science than it is with pondering the philosophical and metaphysical notions of personal faith and desire. 'Stalker' was released in 1979 after a trouble-plagued production, during which vast portions of the film had to be re-shot due to errors during negative development, and amidst crumbling relations with the original cinematographer, Georgi Rerberg.Most of the film takes place in a wilderness area cordoned off by the government, known as "The Zone." Strictly guarded by armed soldiers who fear to enter it, The Zone is believed to have been the site of a meteor strike, a nuclear accident or even a UFO landing (as in the original novel). One man, known as Stalker (Aleksandr Kajdanovsky), living in a grey and dreary town on the outskirts of The Zone, makes a living out of leading men into the perilous heart of the area, specifically to a room with the alleged ability to grant a man's most innermost desires.On this occasion, against the wishes of his wife (Alisa Frejndlikh), Stalker accompanies two men into The Zone, respectively known as Writer (Anatoli Solonitsyn) ? a skeptical author looking for inspiration ? and Professor (Nikolai Grinko) ? a man of science with ambiguous motives. Once they have bypassed the armed security on the outskirts of the area, Stalker informs his clients that they are to obey his every command if the three of them are to avoid the unspeakable perils of The Zone. These dangers do not appear immediately obvious, with the vast surrounding landscape seemingly peaceful and serene, with the quiet calls of birds and insects occasionally pierced by the distant howl of a wolf or dog. Indeed, it is here that Stalker appears to find complete and utter solace, stretching himself amongst the thickly-scented vegetation to absorb the sights, sounds and smells of the only place that makes him feel human.Writer is initially quite skeptical of the so-called dangers of The Zone, but Stalker's passionate pleas for cooperation eventually convince him to do as he is told. The characters make their journey to The Room slowly, sometimes infuriatingly so, but there is always an underlying sense of peril with every tentative step that they take. Out of a seemingly peaceful and benign environment, Tarkovsky has inspired foreboding. The slow and deliberate pacing of the film most certainly plays a part in this. Tarkovsky's characteristically long takes, coupled with the slow and subtle movement of the camera, successfully create a dream world, a perspective of the story that appears far removed from reality. The trio's journey towards The Room is not so much a journey into the heart of the forest, but a journey into the very depths of the human mind.Softly shot in a sort of dreary metallic sepia, 'Stalker' is a surprisingly beautiful film to look at. Through his extended takes ? some as long as six minutes in length ? Tarkovsky leaves every image on screen long enough, not just for us to notice it, but for its beauty to inspire, to inhabit us. Tarkovsky notably despised the use of quick cuts or montage to achieve artificial dramatic peaks, and, at 163 minutes, 'Stalker' is not the most accessible of films. Admittedly, I did catch myself sneaking a glance at my clock on a couple of occasions, but, once we reached that breathtaking conclusion, I couldn't help but think that the entire journey was very much worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poetic vision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the finest films made, and my favorite Tarkovsky. Eastern European and Russian films in particular are simply differently crafted. Tarkovsky produces images of laden beauty and poetic vision. The film is a quasi- religious sojourn into the "Zone," where dreams may be realized for the patient few. But as with all Tarkovsky films, the theme here is a conceptual and philsophical dialogue among differing positions, in this case a spiritual guide, a writer, and a scientist. Tarkovsky makes you think, though, through his images. Here they achieve exquisite slowness, time squeezed as if from a stone to create an atmosphere of sublime expectation. I can't overstate the artistic achievement this film represents. It's simply a must-see. Do yourself the favor and watch it. I've shown it to many friends and never have they been disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Words are not enough to describe this masterpiece of a film. It requires a tremendous amount of concentration from the viewer, as any other Tarkovsky picture, but ultimately it is worth it. The film features the rather unknown Kajdanovsky and two of Tarkovsky's favorite actors, Anatoli Solonitsyn and Nikolai Grinko, who play very different characters as a cynical writer and a soberfaced scientist respectively. Kajdanovsky is THE STALKER, whose title is hard to understand or explain. But I think that indicates that he has been to the mythical forbidden ZONE and possesses special psychic powers which enable him to find it. He lives with a neurotic wife and a very special child that seems to possess some sort of telekinetic powers.The most stunning part of the film is the scene where the camera moves across the artifacts lying under the water, which go from usual domestic things to an icon of Christ, here given a very unusual portrayal. That scene sums up the movie very well. It is a glimpse of the life that used to be and the symbol of the downfall of the old world. And what about THE ZONE? Well, I see it as a last resort, a sort of forbidden paradise which ultimately turns out not to be what people expect or want. The three characters change as they progress through the dark corridor and to THE ROOM. All these parts of the zone are highlighted brilliantly in a way that only Tarkovsky could. What is THE ROOM? And what purpose does the telephone have? All these questions left me thinking and wondering for hours after.In the end, this film is not for everyone and perhaps 50% of those who decide to watch it don't make it till the end. And that's really a shame for this is Tarkovsky's second best film, after Andrei Rublev, and together with Solaris. The performances are all excellent and the unknown Kajdanovsky impresses the most. The music by Eduard Artemiev is haunting and effective. And the constant shifts from black/white to color enhance the visual majesty of this work. A clear 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A journey through Life and the Body to reveal the Soul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stalker is a visual delight and another Tarkovsky masterpiece. It would be a stretch to call this a "science fiction" film. It seems to me as a story about faith, love and how a person truly sees themselves when there is no way to hide what really lurks in their soul."Stalker" is a man who leads people into a mysterious area called "The Zone." The Zone has been cardoned off and protected by the authorities after many people had entered the area and vanished. We are told that "The Zone" was likely created by a meteor that fell to the earth and could be controlled by aliens or a strange lifeforce.On this occasion, "Stalker" leads two men, "The Writer" and the "The Professor" into "The Zone" in search of "The Room." It is a place in "The Zone" where one's innermost wish is supposed to come true, whether you want it or not. "The Room" is a place that intrigues and terrifies all of the characters. However, they must try and reach it and find out if the strange stories about "The Room" are true.Along the way, we see some incredibly long, but beautiful takes. We also see the shots outside of the zone done in monochrome. It gives the viewer the feeling that the world outside "The Zone" has become a colorless, cold place.When the men arrive in "The Zone," the world suddenly becomes alive with color and it gives the viewer the impression that incredible things could happen in this mysterious place. One's faith about the world and the beauty of life come alive again."Stalker" guides the men through "The Zone" by taking strange routes toward "The Room." He throws bandages weighed down by bolts as a guide and is respectful of not taking the easy, direct path to "The Room," almost as a tribute to its awe and wonder.Both of the men trying to reach "The Room" are doing so for entirely different reasons. "The Professor" questions whether such a place can truly exist and cannot see how all of this can be.. he cannot understand the supernatural.. it is not within his framework of knowledge. And he seems afraid of that which science cannot explain or understand. "The Writer" seems to be looking for inspiration. Along the way he begins to question whether or not he will enter "The Room." Does he want his truest, most sincere wish? Does he have any idea what his mind and soul truly desire? It seems in the end he questions his own faith and whether or not his wish would even be anything he WOULD want or could LIVE with.In my opinion, "The Stalker," takes people on this journey because it is the only place where he truly has power. He describes himself as a "louse," but in "The Zone," he is the guide who knows how to avoid the traps and mysteries of the region and takes people to a place where they can believe and have hope.The journey itself seems to be the story here. It is almost as if the characters must explore their own lives and question their motives along the way to find out if "The Room" is even a place they WANT to enter.The visuals are highly symbolic. They stop to rest. Lying by, or in, still water which shows the stoppage of time for reflection. The icons, needles and weapons submerged beneath the surface of the water show all of the things humans must contemplate throughout their own lives. The characters even have to "wade" through water to get to "The Room." It like they're wading through life itself.. asking questions about faith, science and philosophy along the route. They almost have to wade through chest-deep water (like a baptismal) to get to the treshhold of "The Room." "The Writer" even wears a Christ-like crown of thorns as he reaches the room.. but only temporarliy. Is his faith to weak to become "Christ-like" for even a few moments?In the end, the fascinating thing about this film is whether they will enter "The Room" and if "The Zone's" powers are real? Or all in the mind of their mysterious guide? It is for the viewer to decide.And the closing shot of "The Stalker's" mysterious daughter, "Monkey" is brilliant and puzzling. "Monkey" is an unusual child who cannot walk. The impression is that it may be due to "The Stalker's" repeated exposure to "The Zone," but we do not know for sure. We do see at the end that "Monkey" has special powers.. moving three glasses along a table (symbolic of the trio's journey into "The Zone"). Is it telekenesis? God? The Zone? We do not know. As with most of Tarkovsky's films, we are left to decide for ourselves. And figure out "who" these characters are and what the film stands for.Each of us will come up with many different answers. That's what makes Tarkovsky great.*10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure poetry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Film of incredible beauty and philosophical insight. An allegory about the meaning of life, of beauty, of hope. The rhythm is slow, the film being full of long shots but all done with an incredible sense of composition, colour and light. The beginning, with the locomotive sound and Beethoven 9th really delighted me, as well as the dialogues on Newton's binomial formula... Pure poetry. Civilization, with its pollution and its mal d'etre is depicted in tones of black and white, while the zone, some very old battlefield, a place of destruction turned into a place of hope, thrives with colour. A spiritual, yet innocent and simple, guide, the stalker, takes a scientist and a writer full of culture, cynicism and disbelief to enlightenment or maybe just bare beauty and communion with nature, which they refuse in the end out of bitterness...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Besides all those big reasons which make "stalker" a masterpiece in cinema history and also in future , there is one thing that we all should know and thus respect to Mr. T for his immortal existence . That one thing is this "stalker" we've seen is the re-shot version after the first attempt ended up with a catastrophic result in lab process , where Mr. T lost all of his exposed film material and he had no single frame of what he shot. After this tragedy , he found this mighty power to re - shoot the whole film from the beginning until the end with of course less financial opportunities than the first one ,as the number of tanks, shooting days , etc. I think he really meant something for what he is and what he wanted to say , and proved to all of us , impossible is really nothinG.

		<shortDescription>Better than AVATAR - but that's just my catchphrase.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie made me really, really angry. Not because it's almost unbearably boring and overrated to a ridiculous extend. No, Mostly I hated it because i just finished reading the book it's based on, "Roadside Picknick". I love this Book, because you rarely come across a more chilling or atmospheric story about an alien culture meeting ours. I thought, a movie made from this book must be great, because you could do something outstanding even on a low budget. So I really looked forward to watch this one. What did I get? 3 Guys talking endlessly. It felt like being back to school and forced to watch a philosophical stage play of three hours length. The worst thing is that the strugatzki-brothers themselves screwed this up. It almost seems as if they wrote the screenplay with the intention to eliminate everything which was great about their own novel. I keep it short and give you a list of the outrageous decisions they made:IN THE BOOK the main guy, Roderic, is a hard-arsed scavenger who is sort of addicted to the bizarre Nature of "the Zone". IN THE MOVIE, he is a whimsical, bible-quoting coward in search of some sort of divine illumination. IN THE BOOK, you experience the deadly traps and anomalies of space and time the "Zone" is contaminated with. IN THE MOVIE, you don't see SH*T and nobody even hurts his ankle -- despite HOURS of dialogs emphasizing how dangerous the slightest movement can be. IN THE BOOK, the Zone is a lifeless industrial wasteland where not even birds are to be seen. IN THE MOVIE you have the impression of a nice stroll through a green landscape with some bunker ruins in it. IN THE BOOK, there are lots of alien artifacts that most effectively create an impression of their culture and technology. IN THE MOVIE, you get some strange sounds, also the aliens are completely reduced to a humble meteorite. IN THE BOOK, Roderics Daughter is disfigured by the strange effects of the "Zone" on human beings. IN THE MOVIE she's mentioned to be mutated, too, but looks perfectly normal. IN THE BOOK, you have really creepy stuff like "the meat-mincer" or the walking Dead - IN THE MOVIE you don't.I could go on like this for hours. Let me just put it like this: If they just had made a lousy B-movie I would be perfectly OK. I don't blame anyone for screwing up, it doesn't suit me. But this Disgrace of a movie was done this way ON PURPOSE! It is simply a violation of a great Science-Fiction-Novel and can only be enjoyed by Philosophy-students who mistake everything for high art as long as it's boring enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stalker is among the more artistic films from Russia, which goes to say that it also is pretty good. Aside from being interesting, it's scenery and story are among the best I've seen in a sci-fi film. It feels authentic, the tale is bizarre but intriguing and the camera and actor direction are beyond stellar. Stalker provides us with a fresh taste of reality. The future is so dim and brown that it almost feels as if you could imagine the dystopia being that way. Taking from historic war depictions, Stalker makes you feel unsafe everywhere you go, if that is the aim, they nailed it on the head. Stalker alongside Solaris are two very fine Russian works from the same director that should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie with extremely high expectations, but had the will to let myself be sucked in by it. I was blown away. Stalker is one of those movies, you will never forget, if you watched it in the right mood. Everything is exceptional: the directing, the soundtrack, the cinematography, the places.However my experience shows me that this slow paced movie is not fitted for every viewer. If you are looking for a good entertaining movie to switch your brain and heart off, or something to watch with your buddies this might be the wrong choice. If you feel opened and sensitive enough to stay with this movie the experience gained will be highly rewarding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to the Zone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It looks and feels just like ordinary places. Places you may know even, or have visited before.But you must proceed with great caution. Every step you take re-shapes the very reality around you. Beware of traps, of fruitless trails, of dangers and treasures that swap disguises at every turn. Beware of yourself. You are different here too. The Zone is a place that exists both inside and outside of your mind. How you manage that fact will mean the difference between a beautiful adventure and a funeral dirge of apathy.The way in which Andrei Tarkovsky's 'Stalker' has the potential to re-inform and re-excite your relationship with reality is in my view one of the biggest selling points here.The film follows the journey of the Stalker, a guide for hire who leads his two 'thrill-seeking' clients, a writer and a professor, on a quest for wish-fulfilment through the mysterious 'Zone', a place only he can navigate and that the state seeks to quarantine from civilians. The Stalker's profession seems to draw both respect and derision from society. The writer cheekily refers to him as 'Chingachgook'. Both the writer and the professor express doubts about the Stalker's true qualification for this adventure, and about whether or not there is indeed any actual adventure to be had. Only the Wizard of Oz style transition from monochrome to colour strengthens our presumption that the Zone is a genuinely special place. This magical sense of uncertainty, present throughout the first part of Stalker, is intoxicating. In fact, it's like the best drunken and rainy afternoon in the park with your friends that you ever had.The second part of Tarkovsky's 'anti-quest' tells us more about the agenda and sensibilities of the writer and the professor, but there is the distinct possibility that you will find none of what they have to say very interesting.The philosophy showcased in the dialogue is of an elementary sort, and a seemingly reckless amount of screen-time is given to it. Perhaps Tarkovsky wants us to find their ruminations frustrating. Indeed, as the grand design of the screenplay is revealed to us, the message seems to be that Tarkovsky's Russia is being crippled by intellectualism.By the time the writer and professor arrive at the 'very threshold' of the Zone's supernatural core, they have Hamletized themselves into positions of zero actionability. It's another bitter failure for the Stalker, whose profession is also his spiritual calling. Few people are interested in the real gift of the Zone, Even fewer are worthy of it. And those few who show promise have a depressing habit of talking themselves out of their own worthiness at the last hurdle. Perhaps reason is the true opium of the masses...So for me, the engrossing and lyrical first part of Stalker gives way to a difficult and annoyingly elusive second part. But the film is very much like the Zone itself. Different for everyone. Well. Isn't everything. You take it and shape it and model it in your mind, trying to follow what you think are the rules.But what you get in the cave is a reflection of what you brought with you. Not what you 'thought' you brought with you. What you take home might not be what you wanted or expected, but nevertheless, you will take something from it. Even if it's just the same thing you started out with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strangely compelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HORRIBLE SPOILERS (well just my take on it really) but please DON'T READ ON IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT.Whoa. This is a strange one. I watched it at a small viewing in London. The film is slow but strangely compelling as the imagery is nothing short of sublime. Who cares that nothing is happening when every screen shot is more vivid and haunting than the last? A truly strange picture postcard offering of a film. And it's offering a truly surreal world within a silent landscape - the characters are almost unnecessary. I was happy just watching each eerie frame, each one eerier than the last.The three main characters however all share a rugged appeal and after about an hour (I know that seems a long time) I started to realise that "the zone" that the stalker (for stalker read guide) takes the two fee-paying intellectuals into, is in fact their own minds. And when it comes down to it, their minds are beset with all the ignorance of the true intellectual. This is a mind-bending watch but enjoyable nevertheless. My take on it is that I think the stalker represents a therapist and he is trying to help the two characters but they don't want help, and rail against true healing. After a lot of travelling through a wild, dangerous landscape, when they are actually on the verge of that happiness that they have paid to find, they reject it. As they sit outside the door of enlightenment, they are so shaken that one tries to blow it up (a professor) and the other denies it (a writer), who prefers to hold on to his own misery - not as if his life depended on it - but his life does actually depend on it. This part of the film was frustrating to me as I realised the two men were cowards.This is a truly deep meditation on being human and how some (maybe all of us?) will choose misery over happiness as we are comfortable with it, we know what it is, it is life, is it not. Anything else is just plain scary and too daunting, however much we think we want change. This film is a true masterpiece. This is the first film I have watched from this director. I hope all his films are as deep and as mysterious as this one. 8/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A way of finding hope in this world ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stalker is one of the most bizarre movies I've ever seen. There is a strange zone with high security levels to keep out ordinary people. It is said once a mysterious crash from outer space happened there. It is also said there is a strange room somewhere deep inside the zone with power to fulfill any kind of wish. There are only few men who know where that room is and know the zone well enough to avoid all its tricks and dangers. These men, these guides, called Stalkers.This movie is about two ordinary men who want to go into that zone with the help of a Stalker. One of them is a writer who has lost his inspiration and ability to write. The other is a scientist who seems to be curious about the room itself.The journey begins and we see them enter and pass through the zone. The world outside the zone is black and white but after they enter the zone everything turns to be colored. It shows the differences between the two worlds. One of them is boring and frustrating but the other one has spirit and hidden live in it. It's a world by special rules and orders. The silence of the area by itself heightens the tone of mystery. All the time we feel like somebody is watching, but who? Finally when they reach the room struggle between them arises. The scientist carries out a small nuclear bomb to destroy the zone. He believes any dangerous people and corrupted politician could get there and make a bad wish. Who knows the next person who wishes to go there? The power of the movie I think starts to reveal itself here. The stalker explains this room could be a sign of hope for its seekers. His life has been spent to guide people there. This room is a symbol of hope. At this point we start to think: does the room really have any kind of power? It seems the two traveler's wants to see that room more because of their curiosity than their belief.the two travelers are symbols. The writer is a representative of the artistic feelings of human. The scientist is the representation of logical aspect of us. Both parts can't find the way in the modern life. Which one could lead our lives better? Both the writer and the scientist seem confused and helpless in that room. At last they reach an agreement to leave that room alone and don't ask anything form it.Rain starts to fall down . They washed out of their sins. They are ready for a new start. Rain and water are key materials in Tarkovsky's movies. They are symbols of life and its continuity.The three wretched men are the main subject of the film not the science fiction background and the story of the zone. It ties to depict deep emotions and feelings but , but avoids to analyze . We all have our ambitions and hopes. We all might be happy if we could find our own room of dreams. But after all, do we dare enough to go there and make a wish? That room is us . It only reflects our deep thoughts, feelings and fears. It shows what we want to be or afraid to become ? It's not a usual movie to watch. He is a poet who does not impose his ideas. It's more like an open text to read freely with different interpretations. Tarkovsky's films are new worlds. They won't repeat again anywhere. I think this film should be regarded as struggle of life to find a meaning for itself.At the end of the film we see Stalker's paralyzed little girl moving objects over the tables by mental power. Maybe she was able to do that because his father believed deep in his heart that room had the power to fulfill his wish. That room made him to move on and show the way to others. It is a strange end .I rated this film 9 out of 10 .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a true masterpiece, it's quite demanding to the viewer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a teenager I recall not liking this movie. I found it too slow. E.g. in many points of the movie you'd be looking at a nearly static image. In one case, the main characters ride along the railway and the viewer has to watch the same scene for 2 (or maybe 3?) minutes.One certainly has to grow up and mature enough to be able to understand and then to enjoy the movie. Re-watching it in the age of 26 or so I liked it much more. Maybe I will like it even more again when I'm 50. That's exactly the pattern which works with the greatest, classic works. There are lots of messages in this movie including: 1. weakness is great, not strength 2. when the characters reached the room where wishes come true, they didn't wish for anythingInterestingly enough, this movie manages to create suspense and horror feel with very little means.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a moral film in its profoundest sense.Two men are called to believe in themselves, instead of believing that man is only selfish and worth nothing - a belief which is revealed here as a lack of self-respect of man for himself and as the source of the unhappiness he causes to himself and to others.They are asked (and so are we) to become aware of that thing, which is most important to man and which is unequivocally positive: love.This film thus is not a science fiction movie (there's no fictitious science in it), let alone plain entertainment. It is a work of genius, showing the way to happiness. And as a work of genius, it cannot be measured (e.g. being called 'flawless' or 'perfect' (not to mention other characterizations)). One can only admire it and be grateful for it.It is also not metaphorical or things don't symbolize other things than themselves. Then you are still looking at it from the outside and constructing a parallel story, which probably is much less relevant than the material it is constructed from. For example: how could water, being one of the foundations of our life and of all life on our planet, symbolize anything more relevant than itself? It is simply given its due place here, i.e. being valued for its own sake. And as such, this is simply shown, as opposed to being said or symbolized or meant, and for the viewer to experience, as opposed to construct or infer. As a film, therefore, this is one the best examples of a substantial film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My number 1</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all have a number 1 film, a favourite which we HAVE rather than want to watch over and over again.Stalker is that number 1 for me.The evergreen, like that very tshirt you resent being in the washer.Every time I watch it I get new details, explore new shades and colours, as it happens with any multi layered work of art.That said, I am not going to waste words offering my personal interpretation of this masterpiece, there are a lot around already, some good too.I can understand, let me add, why some people didn't quite get the point of this incredible journey inside and across the humans spirit.I'd say 2 are the main reasons why people might not like this movie: 1) they read the book and could barely find tiny similarities in the story, although the Strugatskiy brothers had a big part in putting together the script (incredibly, they insisted in spite of the countless differences from their book that Tarkovsky's story was ways deeper and important than their own); 2) more likely, people were simply expecting an action packed sci-fi flick and had to go through a slow paced introspective expedition, and most people don't like to do that, especially when it's least expected. They find it inconvenient and disturbing. They rather choose movies offering a vacation from their lives, so they don't have to think of anything while nibbling at popcorn.Sometimes I got sort of punked too in the past, I was all charged and ready for an action flick with my popcorn, drink, laser sabre and ended up getting involved into a slow spiritual-psychological story instead. It may feel kind of like a meeting hook, I know.The difference resides in the fact that I fully enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stalker is a wonderful science fiction movie from the 1970s made by a Russian director who is apparently quite famous there. Tartofsky or Tarkofsky? I should have looked before I started writing this review. Anyway. I obviously am not a huge film expert or critic or anything because I haven't heard of this movie before until a few weeks ago when my friends who were shocked I didn't know it or the director demanded that I stay and watch it with them. This movie obviously is well known to people who like movies that is to say people not like me! I don't think I have anything of value to say other than that it is an excellent movie and I recommend watching it! I wish it was in English because sometimes I felt like when I was reading the subtitles I missed some cool visuals. The movie is about a stalker, a guy who illegally leads people through a strange wilderness where bizarre things happen to get them to a special place where they think wonderful things will happen to them. Excellent, excellent film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>.....whatever you do, watch it on the big screen, preferably a film print. I first saw "Stalker" on VHS in the late 1990s and you could barely tell the movie goes from sepia to monochrome, then muted color, and finally full color. You see it as a projected film and it is like watching a ballet going on in the background. I saw a "new" print in 2006 at the International House of UPENN, up in their rickety folding bleacher auditorium and it was a revelation......like "Lawrence of Arabia", this is not a movie to be seen on the small screen if you really want to appreciate the artistry involved in the color timing of the picture. I know it sounds bizarre writing about the color shift alone, but it's an intrinsic component of the film, and one of the possibly overlooked elements of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tarkovsky masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the simplest Tarkovsky film in terms of plot (but certainly not in terms of dialogue, which is complex and philosophical and symbolism) and, due to it's great simplicity, it is perhaps one of his greatest films, if not his greatest, right there with The Mirror and Andrei Rublev. The story is linear and is easy to follow, very different from his last film, The Mirror, which was anything but easy to follow (indeed, there are multiple interpretations).Tarkovsky was one of the greatest directors in cinema and this film alone proves it. Each frame contains more greatness than many other films and impressively, this highly sophisticated work of art was viewed by 4.3 million people at the Soviet Union.I found it the most impressive of all six Tarkovsky films that I have seem (Andrei Rublev (third), The Mirror (second), Solaris(fourth), this(first), Nostalghia(fifth) and The Sacrifice(sixth)).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't like gushing, sycophantic reviews, so I'll try not to write one. I hadn't heard of this film until recently, but I was aware of the director because I'd heard of Solaris. I watched the George Clooney remake of that and... zzzzzzzzzzzzz.I watch gazillions of films and I'm not precious about what I watch. I'll happily enjoy Shrek or Spiderman.But I also like it when directors step outside the box a bit and make something that doesn't conform precisely to THE FORMULA. So, I'll watch whatever Spike Jonze or Jim Jaramusch make because they've made it and I know I'm going to see something different. And I'll enjoy watching some utter batshit craziness from Alejandro Jodorowsky. Thank God for Alejandro Jodorowsky! Or Kevin Smith, even if sometimes it feels like he's just trying to copy Tarantino with those "You know something bad is going to happen, so I can bullshit for a full 10 mins" scenes. Stop it Kevin. Clerks rocked. Some of these films are good. Occasionally great. Often they are not the-best-thing-I've-ever-seen, but at least they offer a fresh perspective.But Stalker is something else entirely. I haven't the slightest hesitation in calling this a masterpiece. I wonder if it's the best film I've ever seen. I'm not sure.Why is it a masterpiece? That's what I'm trying to figure out.And I think the reason is this...It's still haunting me, days and days after I watched it. It doesn't feel like I've watched a film. It feels like I've had an experience, like I've lived through something which has affected my life. I just can't say that about "Shrek III: Shrek Forever After." I watched Stalker projected on a home cinema, which I recommend. Even better would be to see it on a full cinema screen. It's filmed in a series of long shots. There are no fast cuts. For some reason I found this mesmerising. Your mind ends up wandering and you think about other stuff. I first noticed this when the characters are on a railway cart heading into the Zone. You end up drifting off to the sound of the clattering train. Something in your mind registers that you are actually travelling. This sort of thing happens a lot in the film. But it seems unlikely that it's *just* a result of the long shots.Although the pace is slow, the story is gripping. There are clearly multiple levels to it, which I didn't fully comprehend. I want to watch it again as I feel like there's a lot more to explore in here. It almost feels like it's a place that you visit as much as a film.It's also beautiful to look at. If you don't know anything about how it's filmed. Don't go and look it up beforehand. Don't read anything. Just watch it.So, yeah, this is cinema as art. It doesn't feel pretentious. It isn't someone bucking the rules to be different. This feels like the work of someone with an absolute mastery of his art form.So, yeah, 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ideas about the meaning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS ... What was the hidden concept ?? I think the movie Stalker with its strong symbolism can be interpreted in the context of the Soviet era when religion was brutally suppressed. "The zone"/religion is a place that provides a comfortable sanctuary from the material dull life, and is guarded from entering by the military/ communist authorities. It came to exist from a meteorite/ a heavenly message to earth. For the stalker/ the religious man, it represents home and comfort, although he always enters it with fear to make it/God angry. The zone/ religion has its own natural laws/miracles that defies logic, but you have to get along with. It promises a "room"/paradise were your innermost wishes come true. The road/ life work to reach the room/paradise is tough and requires guidance from a stalker/ religious man. The existence of the room/ paradise has been always challenged by science/the professor and philosophy/the writer, and despite that they try to explore the facts of religion, and have some understanding for it, they could not accept it at the end. Science/the professor was ready to destroy what he could not rationalize, and from the standpoint of the stalker/religious man, science/the professor and philosophy/the writer are completely ignorant despite their knowledge. The stalker personal life/ the religious man life is not materially fulfilling and may be disappointing. The daughter may represent the outcome of following religion blindly, the mind/body may be crippled to move freely but it may have sensitivity and mysticism not owned by others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ko·an: a succinct statement or question used as a meditation exercise. The effort to solve a koan is intended to exhaust the intellect &amp; egotistic will, readying the mind to entertain the response on an intuitive level.Three men embark on an trek through Soviet wastelands, a pilgrimage toward The Zone, a mysterious force that may or may not be extraterrestrial in origin &amp; is said to have the power to grant a man's innermost desire. They are led by Stalker, the humble disciple of this numinous power. Images of industrial blight &amp; ruin surround them on the way to possible salvation.I've read several reviews describing STALKER as 'complex'. I see what they mean but I don't agree. Its so simple it seems complex. Andrei Tarkovsky's holy minimalism pares everything down so radically, right to the bare bones that any addled, schizo-media bombarded senses race round n round clinging to single elements in an impotent effort to safely explain the strange spell such a quiet, small/epic production casts.These kind of things seem to have a reputation for being brainy when its maybe just the type of mind it attracts, obsessed with decoding a formidable puzzle. But aside from some dense philosophizing its the kind of movie a kid could get a feel for. The puzzle is that there is no puzzle, there's nothing to get. Substantial insubstantiality. How can you express the inexpressible? To even try is being deadeningly literal, reducing objective to subjective, trying to contain infinity. Tarkovsky opens up a space so that the appropriate signifiers can emerge and then leaves the rest to us, trusting the audience to make their way. All he can really do is make the appropriate allusions and hope we follow along. Rather than pretentious this actually seems pretty humble. The director knows the finger isn't the moon. Its very emptiness allows the viewer to attach the highest meaning, unlike the kind of film we're used to where meaning is clearly spelled out. Westerners have a very different idea of what constitutes art: stimulation rather meditation, doing rather than being. STALKER is an empty vessel.Yeah, I can definitely see how viewing Tarkovsky's films can be like watching paint dry. Its intimidating when this kind of commitment is demanded from your entertainment but synch up to STALKER's seemingly non-existent rhythm and you'll find a whole world underneath, a whirlwind behind static form. Subtleties on subtleties. Real challenging for the Big Gulp generation but that's the fun of it. Its like one ofthose Buddha statues that seems alive, the Mona Lisa's eyes following you from across the room.I remember watching the NOSFERATU remake and distantly wishing for the Borgo Pass build-up to go on forever, so pregnant with wonder was the wordless, uneventful travelogue. Any plot would've gotten in the way. I got my wish here: loooong silent interludes of industrial decay, pans of underwater treasure, pained &amp;andpensive faces contemplating existence- its so palpable its almost too much to bare. No man made structures like plot could be as evocative as nature.And it's not about Commie Russia per see. The whole world is a concentration camp, it's a state of mind that calls for a new way of being, expressed in a very different language than your standard Hollyweird shorthand (who wouldn't be able to express this because they can't even see it). You don't consume this, its not soma; you join with it, merge. It's your standard sci-fi dystopia from a different angle. I like movies that disguise the Big Questions in genre trappings....the starkness is offset by metaphors like The Zone instead of using the G word and imposing more plot on people when they really should find their own way home. I guess what I'm saying is that I'd take this over ANDREI RUBLEV any day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the science of fiction and the fiction of science make friction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel no sort of commentaries or critics could ever equal what this unique film carries on. It could easily be just about how us, the eye, could make its way through, and the intensity of our participation... we become something like a ghost within the imagery of this film, as well as the Zone can turn inwards ourselves as a cinematographic (and not only) experience, it is not at all about a slow-paced rhythm, but more like of a seek for silence, when motions and sounds and landscapes and tensions unite, as if Mr Tarkovski played with the Light, and that, is what cinematography is all about. But do we believe in it, because you see, Tarkovski really believed, the cinematography itself needs a writer, a scientist, and even more, a stalker. Maby even the Room could be the darkroom where exposed pelicula comes visible, and maybe we, the viewers, are always at a threshold in relation to what the film carries on. The entire film is by itself a 'zone', but we just might not be able to get a clear way through. Whether we like this journey or not, depends on where it leads us, moment by moment, scene after scene, and which is our 'present'/presence in the image. We could call it science fiction just if we could call Tarkovski a 'dinosaur'. Interpretations are our motors of life, he just knew it and let everything open. I think that 'Stalker' did one thing like only few other cinema productions did, it swept away time in a unique way. Created a new kind of time, which for our modern beings is hard to understand or bear. It has to be lived.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutally Misunderstood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think I've had a more infuriating experience than I have reading reviews for "Stalker". Every single negative review I've read so far basically boils down to "it's slow/boring/pointless/pretentious". I feel I need to shed some light onto this whole subject. "Slow" is not by nature a bad thing. "Stalker" is "slow", in the sense that it builds atmosphere and disregards a standard narrative. I feel the world created by "Stalker" is probably the best thing about it. It's incredibly engrossing, it blocks out everything else around me. I'd take this over any action movie that leaves me yearning for the end. The "boring" part is a totally subjective , but what exactly do people seem to find boring about beautiful imagery and poetry put to screen. Every second of the film is crafted so perfectly by Tarkovsky, who just put everything he had into this one. As for "pointless", I find this criticism to be utterly puzzling. "Stalker" has a very clearly defined plot that is developed completely. Did these people not pay attention because there were no fight scenes or large breasted women. More than that, though, it also expresses religious philosophy. It's a film about belief, what exactly is pointless about that? The argument for it being "pretentious" is easily the one that angers me the most. I have to wonder if the people using this word even know what it means. What pretense does "Stalker" hold? It's a pure example of film making, where the director spares no expense to realize his vision. A pretentious film is something like "Fight Club", a film with no genuine content designed to appeal to the masses, while building itself as a pillar of truth that brings light to difficult subject matter, when the party involved isn't even intelligent to understand why a difficult subject matter is difficult.In short, "Stalker" is a beautiful film. It is pure, unpretentious, and subtle, but incredibly gripping. It will not, however, pander to low attention spans</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Russian film by Andrei Tarkovsky loosely based on the novel Roadsine Picnic by Boris &amp; Arkadi Sturgstky, who also adapted the story for the big screen.The film narrates the trip of a writer, a scientist and their guide -the stalker- to the Zone, an unpopulated abandoned forbidden area where there is a place where one can fulfill his/her most cherished wish.The characters are a writer (i.e. an humanist), a mathematician (i.e. a scientist) and the stalker (a believer), all complementary characters. They are archetypes what human thought basically is, and of the main human approaches and explanations of what life is. It is mostly an inner and initiation trip. In fact, if we were not given the initial captions about the Zone and the extraterrestrial landing, the movie could not be considered a science-fiction one but an experimental philosophical and spiritual one.Stalker and Solaris -also directed by Tarkovsky- share that magical approach to reality and to inexplicable events. In both cases what brings drama to the story is not what is factually happening, but how the characters see reality and the world, and how they project in them their inner fears, thoughts and feelings. In that regard, reality is just a personal projection, something that only exists when perceived in a certain way.The dialogs are brilliant, very philosophical and deep, and they reflect on the nature of science, literature, reality, beliefs and the unknown. They can be overwhelming sometimes, but they are worth the effort of paying attention to them. The silences are also mesmerizing and as relevant to the story as the dialogs, as well as the landscape and interiors where the action happens.Visually speaking, the movie is magnificent. It has that Tartovsky's almost metaphysical approach to Nature and to the woods, which are here presented both as beautifully welcoming and threatening evil. A Jeckil &amp; Hyde of a landscape. The abandoned plant where the movie was shot, and the cinematography of it, provide the viewer with unforgettable surreal alien images. Some of the oniric scenes of the film are also extremely poetic and philosophical. The atmosphere, with changes between full color and sepia tones, the latter associated to a gritty reality deprived of hope and joy, are just masterpieces in themselves, with a masterful use of chiaroscuro, camera angling, and a great detail to decor and ambiance.The opening of the movie is unforgettable. Magnetic in away. The framing, the tones, the placement of the elements, the chiaroscuro, everything is artistic and almost pictorial. A little masterpiece in itself.The cinematography, lighting, use of the camera are superb in the whole movie, and the lush greens of the woods and the eeriness of the abandoned plant are turned into a magic powerful and disturbing world.The acting is terrific by all actors, but especially by Alexander Kaidanovsky as the Stalker, and Alisa Freindlich as his wife. However, the performances of Anatoli Solonitsyn (the Writer) and Nikolai Grinko (the Professor) must be praised, too.Stalker is a movie like no other. A slow-paced trip to the inner soul of their characters as much as an exploration of a forbidden and alien Eden without God. It is also a journey for the viewer, so be prepared and in the right mood before you seat in front of your TV. If you expect aliens, spaceships and other clichés of the genre you will be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quintessential Tarkovsky. A must, if you can cope with a slow pace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very special film for me. I first heard of it when about 10 or 11, and already then it had a mysterious aura surrounding it, the words "zone" and "stalker" just stuck with me. Then I watched it in my mid-teens, a time when I idolized Tarkovsky but of course missed much of the philosophical musings. Still, as a youngster already trying to comprehend this life, I found many ideas?and many expressions of the characters?thought-provoking. So, in fact, this film left its mark on forming my personality.That was back in the 80's. Today, I still consider "Stalker" one of the highest achievements of cinema, and to me it belongs, with "Andrei Rublev" and "The Mirror," to the Tarkovsky "top three." A firm 10. Tarkovsky's hypnotic filmmaking literally draws you in, and it has always been a mystery to me how people can find this film boring. For me, it feels like barely an hour or so. I think, the reason is that the characters' spiritual journey finds a perfect expression cinematographically. Tarkovsky's art is pure cinema, he is interested in this kind of artistic expression, by which I mean that everything in this film (dialogues, camera work, music, acting, and so forth) works together to create a piece of art of cinema. It's never just "talking heads" reciting some "profound" truths, or just music trying to evoke some kind of "deep feelings" in the viewer, or anything like that. It's cinema. Of course, to relate to these particular characters you will need to relate to their journey into themselves. Because it is deeply emotional one too, not only spiritual. And yes, for many the pace will be too slow, sadly.Tarkovsky was never interested in an "experimental" cinema. He insisted that the artist must witness to the "truth," as he sees it, artistically or otherwise. It seems to me that in this film this approach in a sense has taken the art to its limits. Because they are only a step away from the revelation, from a possibility of learning something deeply important. However, we can never learn the full truth about ourselves, and the art, in fact, can only ask questions, not give answers. If it starts giving answers, it steps over into the realm of religion, or philosophy. I love the moment toward the end of the film (you can consider the rest of the sentence a slight SPOILER) when one of the characters, losing his balance, almost steps into the desired room?and he almost panics. Even with the "outer layers" of their inner selves, those to show others and themselves, stripped down, there is still so much more to discover.This film also features some outstanding acting. Kaidanovskiy in the title role is one example, and of course, a Tarkovsky regular Solonitsyn, another. What a great actor he was. Although Tarkovsky's films can usually be appreciated quite well without knowing Russian, I doubt it is fully true in the case of Solonitsyn's lines. But I have never watched a Tarkovsky movie subtitled, only in Russian, so it's just my assumption.To sum it up: A quintessential Tarkovsky, a definite must-see for every movie lover. More importantly, a film which can make you learn more about yourself, or at least want to learn. If you are willing to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my favourite film and is based on my favourite science fiction book, Roadside Picnic, which also provided the general storyline for my favourite computer game, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - a testament to the power of central idea in all these works - getting what you truly desire may be the most horrifying thing in the world.As others have noted, just about each frame of this film would make a great poster. It is a truly philosophical movie, but one which relies as much on the meaning of the imagery presented as of the dialogue, a kind of visual poetry. If Tarkovsky has been credited with uncovering a truly, purely cinematic language, this film is perhaps the clearest, most compelling example. The spiritual guide promises to lead the scientist and the cynical writer to a room in the Zone that will grant them what they truly desire, whatever that is, but the journey itself is a sort of test of their character, along with responses to the stalker's stories, particularly the one that describes how another stalker, Porcupine, may have killed himself because he ended up wishing only for money. To watch the film is to journey with the them into the Zone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully bleak very long film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this film about five times but never watched it straight through. I usually break it up in 3 or 4 sittings on my VCR. It has fantastic images and sequences, very long with inexplicable situations escaping rational thought. It is a fascinating piece. I hope I get the chance to see it in the theater or a released on DVD because the video version is of a horrible quality not giving it any justice. I always talk to my friend about Tarkovsky and he appreciates him, respects him, but hates watching his films. They are very long, very slow, and can be very boring. But in this time of compressed stories with meaningless one liners and fast paced action and cutting he stands out as a testament to a higher potential for filmic story telling. I have seen a couple of his other films but Stalker is my favorite. An excellent brainy sci-fi flick which can be enjoyed on a base level or ridden out as intellectual head trip. The choice is yours to make but I recommend seeing it at least once, and if you did not like it the first time then please watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is beautiful, stunning, disturbing and very artsy. It is incredibly slow and metaphysical too. This is not the sort of movie you would take to a party, it is depressing, heavy and almost post apocalyptic. Its best to be consumed on your low day with a bottle of vodka - when you watching alone, in complete darkness. Then you can really enjoy the dark atmosphere of the movie. I think there are different layers in this movie including religious ones (well, this has been shot in SSSR in deep communism so this must have been really risky for the author). I liked the atmosphere, collapsed roofs of the buildings, decaying rooms filled with water, strange dark dog which is supposed not to exist in Zone - all these stunning visuals which just seems to "exist" in timeless Zone. The philosophy in the movie is probably a bit overkill which makes it really hard to swallow for ordinary TV viewer who just wants to relax with some generic scifi movie. Overall I have liked the movie but I do not intend to watch it soon again as it is really "hard to swallow".</fullReview>

The director, a sheer genius, made a film about what he saw in humanity, thus producing this masterpiece about mankind's struggle to face reality. Not only is the message driving, but every scene from beginning to end is art. One scene that especially stood out to me was the sand dune scene in which the writer confronts his own soul and questions his intelligence and ability to write. Another would be the dream sequence that the stalker has, though slow in pace, it is a brilliant scene that will leave you wanting more. Through out the entire film, if you have the patience to sit through this two and a half hour work of art, you will ponder and think and try to make sense of this film. You can only watch it though and enjoy the vision of a brilliant mind.</fullReview>

Especially the moment with a text from the Revelation. And to those who find this movie boring - you just have not grown to the level of this kind of movie. It's not a Saturday Night entertainment.

Fascinating atmosphere, unfolded slowly and with patience, full of contemplative images and symbols. The Stalker is a kind of a spiritual guide or Boddhisattva, sacrificing himself in order just to lead others to the goal - but the choice is theirs.

		<shortDescription>Tarkovsky criticizing the Soviet Regime back in 1979!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tarkovsky takes the opportunity with Stalker to heavily criticize the Soviet Regime, and he's so intense with some dialog that it seems unbelievable how the regime's censorship did not get the point of the film and allowed it to be made (I am not sure when it was shown on the Soviet screens).For instance, Stalker (the Guide), responding to his wife's remark that he would finish in prison if he went back to the Zone (the forbidden area) he replies: "For me it's a prison everywhere". In other parts, the 3 characters come up with phrases like: "People have no hope anymore", or "the future is the same as the present", or "give the people some hope, it's the only thing they're left with", or similar. It seems that Tarkovsky is crying out his personal thoughts against the Regime, being a dissident himself (in fact, a little later he defected to Italy).The Soviet reality in the beginning of the film is portrayed with a monochrome greenish depressing photography and ruins everywhere. When the three characters make it to the Zone (= the West?) things become colorful. Flowers and green plants are everywhere. They are facing a lot of dangers in their efforts to arrive in the Zone (machine-guns, bombs, etc) as if they were trying to escape the Communist Regime. But they take the risks, because their lives back home are meaningless.Stalker starts as a sci-fi, then becomes metaphysical (Tarkovsky was obsessed with metaphysics) and finally ends up with different versions! In fact, the surprise comes at the end, as the film doesn't really end! As if Tarkovsky didn't know how to end it! Interesting and disappointing at the same time.Those who will see the film hoping a sci-fi classic will be disappointed. If you only want to feel the unique poetic style and atmospheric camera moving of Tarkovsky, then it's a must. Overall, the film is a classic mainly because Tarkovsky is not anymore alive and cannot make films like this again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read all the previous comments, and I noticed very few were close to the deep (2nd plane, I could say) meaning of this movie. Andrei Tarkovski use the Strugatski Brothers' novel just as a pretext (or, maybe just to give the "superficial" - 1st plane - meaning of the movie). Maybe not many people are aware of the fact that Tarkovski was a devout religious person, an Orthodox Christian (as he declare himself in one interview). So, the whole movie is - in fact - a parable about the Orthodox / traditional Russian perspective of the life, man etc. We can equate the characters as it follows: The Zone = The Faith, the Path to God; The Meteorite = Jesus Christ; Stalker = Priest, Spiritual Father; Porcupine = Judas etc. The final monologue of Stalker's wife can be related, in this context, with the religious persecutions in Russia.I spoke of the movie as having two layers of understanding; I think it would be more accurate to say it's n-layered, as it can be understood in many ways - as these pages of comments proves. Nevertheless, I think the most closed one from director's perspective is the religious interpretation.</fullReview>

While the change in scenery is welcome, the characters continue to blabber on and on and on, sprouting boring and pointless philosophy.

		<shortDescription>A compelling and complex plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something very special about Tarkovsky's work. In his movies, he would tell very simple, yet grand stories. His storytelling is reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick in a way. However, I will argue that he is the Russian Kubrick. Before I start this review, I should inform you that this film is not for everyone because it has a very slow pacing with talk heavy dialogue. If you do not like movies of this type, turn away now because this will not be the movie for you. However, if you like movies that have a deeper and complex meaning behind them then you will most likely enjoy this.A man known as the "Stalker" leads 2 men, a writer and a professor, through a mysterious area known as the "Zone" so they can find a room which supposedly grants wishes. The Stalker is the hired guide because since he has walked through the "Zone" multiple times, he knows how to lead them safely through its complex traps, pitfalls, and sudden distortions. The Writer says that his reason for going through it is that he fears losing his inspiration. The Professor says that his reason for going through it is that he hopes to win the Nobel Pease Prize. The 3 set out and start to walk through the "Zone".Although it was slow at times, I never felt that I was wasting my time with this movie because of the stunning ideas that it expresses. This movie is a story of immense consequences. It is also made more compelling by how the characters constantly have arguments with each other. You can interpret this film in multiple ways and there are many ways one could view this film. While the film mainly focused on the meaning of life and both knowing and feeling too much, it was quite obvious at times that some of the dialogue in the movie were thoughts of Tarkovsky himself. At some points in the movie, it would talk about the 'unselfishness' of art and the shallowness of technology which claimed it to be no more than an 'artificial limb'.This movie is made even better by the unforgettable imagery in it. In the countryside scenes in the "Zone", the film is in color. When the film is outside the "Zone" and inside the tunnels and other inside areas inside the room, it is in sepia footage. This brilliant color scheme makes for some very impressive moments. I always like it when films have beautiful cinematography because even when you get bored by a slow pacing, you will be impressed by the unforgettable images they have.I've seen many theories on this film and there are some that I agree on and some that I disagree on. For example, I've seen some people say that it is unknown whether or not "The Room" had any powers to begin with. I disagree with this because the movie made it clear that it did have powers. The movie explained that soldiers were sent into "The Zone" and they all went missing. Also, it showed soldiers surrounding the place preventing anyone from going inside it. The soldiers wouldn't be there if the place had no powers. Also, it is made more clear that this is true by the final few minutes which evoke a sense of surrealism.In conclusion, this ranks up there with other Russian and Soviet films. It has a very simple, yet grand story. It has stunning ideas in it which will leave you puzzled, but interested in learning about them for years. At first, I was bothered by its slow-pacing, but I got used to it. I will repeat one more time that if you don't like slow pacing and talk-heavy dialogue then you won't enjoy this film (In fact, I'm pretty sure that most people will be very confused on their first viewing if they barely know anything about the plot. I actually had to check Wikipedia a few times to make sure I was understanding everything). However, if you like slow pacing then you will likely find this to be one of the deepest movies made in years.</fullReview>

One client is a scientist and one is a journalist, each looking to experience the "zone". It is more about dialogue than effects, but the cinna is great. I am going to try to buy six copies at least for xmas pressies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw Stalker, it was a version shown on the television channel Arte (a high-brow culture channel originally available in Germany, but later in France and Belgium). As a native Belgian I know some French, but with the subtitles of the film in a language I did not fully understand I could not follow the dialogue quite as intended. However from this experience I could tell that the cinematography was excellent and more than enough to intrigue even the most confused viewers (as myself). Tarkovsky uses camera-movements with utmost effectiveness; only when necessary and with elegance. The acting is also very immersive, not under- or overplayed but just right.Having it seen again today, with subtitles in my mother-tongue and for a second time, I understood more, yet not everything. I believe Stalker to be a film you can watch many times and still not completely grasp it, if that were even possible.The philosophical questions it raises, the critique it expresses, all are left half- written, for the viewer to be completed. This leads me to my opinion that Stalker is a subjective experience when it comes to the story (and I know some people who judge a movie solely on this aspect).All that is written above is the pseudo-objective review on the film, what follows is my subjective interpretations, read on if you are interested in mine as to compare them with yours, but do not expect to find criteria with which you can judge the film. I am intrinsically introspective and look for meaning even in the most abstract forms -i.e. music. What I experience when watching Stalker may differ from you.The first thing I noticed was the heavy sepia-tone used in the 'outside world', an extension of the idea that in fact "everyplace is a prison for me". The only exception to this rule is the 'outside world' through the perspective of 'Monkey' the child. I interpreted this as an externalisation of her youthful naiveté, still fostering hope, in contrast to the protagonist who experiences the need of man to control and command nature, leaving no room for doubt, irrationality or hope. This abandonment of faith leads to despair, the fear of the nothingness and the conclusion that we are meaning-seeking creatures in a meaningless world (Camus). The protagonist tries to revive faith through the Zone and the Room, but in doing so the participants -not by change secularised intellectuals, have to believe in something they do not and are incapable of holding any faith; themselves and others. The 'professor' does distrusts others, leading him to destroy the chamber, the 'writer' does not trust himself, as shown in his refusal to enter the room after his deduction that only hidden desires are fulfilled ( the terrifying prospect of knowing your true shallow self).The inability of the professor and the writer to place confidence in themselves and others raises the question if faith in anything is even possible, ending the film on a rather nihilistic tone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apparently Tarkovsky had to reshoot a large portion of this film after the original stock was damaged. What was actually released is such a striking piece of work, it's hard to imagine what the original version might have been. There is a plot: in a post-apocalyptic world, the "Stalker" is a man who guides people through a restricted Zone where the usual laws of physics and reason don't apply, and in which a room is said to exist that causes a man's deepest desires to come true. There is character development and gripping performances, particularly by Aleksandr Kaydanovskiy (Stalker) who really does seem to carry the weight of the world on the shoulders... ... but for a moment, forget all that. Instead, try watching Stalker as you'd watch, for example, a David Lynch film: think instead about the images presented on their own terms rather than trying to attach a conventional meaning to them, or put them into context. Don't worry about what it means - just enjoy the experience. yetanotherfilmreviewblog.tumblr.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone of us have dreams, colorfull pictures away from where we are. We often assume that reaching our dreams will give us eternall happiness.When we try to reach our dreams - room in a dreamy colorfull zone - we are accompanied by reality (professor) and our ability to narrate/describe (author). The closer we get, the more we are ourselves haunted by our doubt that realizing our dream will turn things better (dog). No one of course understand what we are trying to narrate and our mind tells to blow up the dream - as a dream is a fairytale, not reality.When we are close fulfilling our dream, neither the professor or author or the dreamer in us wants to enter - as it would destroy the dream we search for. With our dogs we return to where we started, though still having faith (supernational abilities).The film itself is difficult to interpret and rich of anecdotes. My interpretation as such is not any better than yours - I hope though for those totally lost will find with this some clues what the film can be interpreted to have. Best of Luck of finding your view on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been 5 years (already!) since I saw my last Tarkovsky. I had come to rest with Zerkalo, because here was a man, one of few, very few in the cinema, who can permeate so deeply into the essential mystery of how things move, and he only made a handful of movies really so I must make them last, and take them in when the time feels right. My next one might be in another 5 years time, but yesterday night the time felt right for this, one I've been heartily anticipating for years.This is Tarkovsky entering the mind once more. He never does it in any obvious, Inception way, it's never actually the mind; but we arrive at a place, a source of the imagining, where wind blows from and rings each thing into being. In Rublev he was the artist looking to paint the face of god in a godless world that concealed it. In Solyaris he was the cosmonaut. In Zerkalo, a filmmaker who recalled a whole life, receiving visions at the doorstep. Here he's the Stalker who takes us into the Zone, obvious enough.Each one is self-referential of course about the very process of stepping into the movie. The Zone as a Tarkovsky movie - full of desolate nature and a mysterious presence that bends logic. We first have to cross the iron border where censors (his illiterate Soviet patrons) prevent entry.This is the border guarded by the irongated mechanisms of reason that has to be crossed before we can begin our guided meditation beyond logic. One way he does this is by splitting himself into characters. One is a scientist, which is Tarkovsky's critique of a mechanistic worldview that reduces a tree to what biological facts it can explain. Another is a writer, a surrogate for Tarkovsky's intellectual self who despairs about the possibility of words to communicate sense. The Stalker himself as who Tarkovsky feels himself to be most purely, the guide who knows the whims of this landscape and wants nothing other than to bring us to the doorstep of miracle.It's his uncanny ability, as always, to pave the way for that miracle. We never enter "the room", as it were. But we are brought to the doorstep. He cultivates the space that leads up to that apperception, this is what people call elusive and dreamlike. Tarkovsky's real work is that he teaches, rewires, us how to see, effects this change in the whole of logic of space, so that we leave with Tarkovsky eyes to go back out. This is far more valuable, and insightful, than any of the imagery that blends industrial grime, fish and religious iconography (in one memorable instance, with voice-over from John's Apocalypse). It's that elements can swirl and reflect in this way.He does several wonderful things, some of them completely breathtaking like the meditation on music that rings a chord in the listener who responds to it with what we have no other name to call but soul. He stretches space, seemingly with no effort, both in the industrial segment early and then across the Zone. He makes the geography elastic, shuffles boundaries of forward and back. It's not that this means something again, it's that the place in which you can receive _anything_ (which is perception itself) can bent thus. The result is a marvelous sense of heaving. Thunderous views of a train, or waterfalls, crash across the frame. Same thing. It's his most sculptural work so far.The dilapidated Soviet locales provide ample opportunity for gnarly imagery, I simply shudder to think that it was actually filmed in places like we see. It's possible that we're seeing the place that killed him and several more from cast and crew.But there's also another side that I want to draw my distance from. In Zerkalo he had reached a point of equanimity that lets go of questions and accepts what is, that for better or worse a life was lived. This is gone here and replaced with a sense of tiredness and cynicism that narrows down to the personal. Now it's not about what is let go of, it's about what is clung onto. None of it is sci-fi of course. But too much is an artist's stream-of-consciousness on what place his own art has. Too much is angsty here. What am I to make for example of Stalker being escorted to bed by his wife, now a pathetic figure who complains that no one wants what he has to show? This is a dangerous path to take because it substitutes the struggle to make sense of life, with the struggle to deliver art about doing it and complain that no one appreciates it. The latter Tarkovsky is far less interesting to me than the former. I fear he would get worse in this regard, compounded by his exile from home.I've read about how Tarkovsy was possibly interested in Zen Buddhism and Tao while preparing for this and may have incorporated influence. There is the notion of spontaneous arising in the Zone as the Zen mind and the bit about how the soft endures while the hard breaks that comes from the Daodejing. It doesn't really venture into either, its preconceptions simply lie elsewhere. But Tarkovsky fails to make use of the Buddhist wisdom in his own predicaments. Instead of letting go, he clings to the burden of fixed views. He suffers their weight, for no reason I might add. The title of this post is a Taoist excerpt.So there are two sides here. The journey to where perception is made fluid and mingles with its reflection and the intellectual burden of its creator. One soft, the other hard. Maybe in another 5 years I will get to see what gives way in Nostalghia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fuction of Stalker (the character) as The Shepherd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is an aspect of Stalker that I have not seen commented on as yet. It is Stalker as the "suffering guide." This figure, that surely is part of the mythological/archetypal memory of humankind, appears fully formed in Stalker, the film. His ancestors are Virgil in The Divine Comedy, the Fool in King Lear, etc. Although providing the assurance of the knowledgeable insider (Stalker knows even the kabalistic movements--secret, and absurd to the outsider--that are the key to the room) to the "ones in passage," the guide has no choice but to take the traveler to destiny. It is his/her Cross. Just a glorious Puppet of the Gods, The Guide must carry the burden. He/she is but one in a long series of this pre-destined orienting beings. In the handicapped child that Stalker has begotten, we see a hint of the "heir," another human being that--maybe is as well unable to cope with the regular burden of the world, for she herself might have to carry souls to the metaphysical place where reality and infinite possibility either fusion or collide. Stalker's face expression--a neat representation of the standard Western image of "the suffering Christ"--is as well an classical in-film gesture of Tarkovsky's that might give the viewer some hints about Tarkovsky's own opinion on the meaning of life. The expression, besides betrays such an intricacy as to constitute a synthesis of the sensual aspects of the experience of existence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly Tarkovsky's greatest film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stalker begins in a black and white, industrialised, gated and despotic world. You feel the dampness permeated within the walls. Pools of water lay in mud; it falls from the walls and ceilings. This is the environment that we meet the main character 'Stalker' (played laconically by Aleksandr Kaidanovsky). His job is to guide people to their hopes and dreams. The place that he guides them through is 'The Zone'. The zone is the perfect juxtaposition of the dank world we are first introduced to. A place occupied by the elements of nature. However, this space is unpredictable.As the story goes, the zone is cordoned off to the masses as there was an unspecified 'alien' landing which, at its centre can give the answers ? both philosophically and ideologically ? to whomever reaches that core. Stalker is employed by people who want to find this out, as a guide through the treacherous landscape. They need a guide who knows how to manoeuvre through it as the land constantly changes, and can be utterly deadly. A writer (Anatoli Solonitsym) and a scientist (Nikolai Grinko), employ 'Stalker' as their guide through the terrain.This is without question my favourite of all Andrei Tarkovsky films (easily beating Mirror and the more well known Solaris). There is always a particular beauty with which he is able to film nature, and to transcend the normality of it, and present it as pure imagistic poetry. In the opening sequences, he conjures beauty from damp, decaying environments, and offers the most perfect of juxtapositions of our industrialised world, next to the beauty of nature. But in this filmic world, the natural elements seem to be the enemy; the alien 'other'. The answers which the characters are looking for become almost irrelevant, as the sheer poetry of the filmmaking transcends story. I just implore you all to watch this film, which I have to say, is one of my favourite films of all time.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

Many find this film a bit long winded. Tarkovsky makes the watcher suffer along with the characters. As they ride the monotonous train you too are sunk into the long boring views that they have. (boring is not bad if used properly).As the Stalker leads the group closer into the zone we begin to see the characters resolve crumble. Finally, the ending is divine leaving the viewer with as many question about himself as answers to the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Regardless of the magnificent sets(or are they? all locations?), the mastery of the photography (sepia/switch to colour + check out all the detailed, contrasted textures throughout the movie), and the insanely correct forecast of the Chernobyl disaster (Chernobyl,1986, Stalker 1979),this movie is what i've been waiting for for a really long time.It's got everything.Now Fincher, Spielberg, even Lynch look like freshmen (makes CUBE look like a 4 piece puzzle).Scarred by WW2, Stalinism and the cold war, this film is the greatest one I've seen so far. I watched it in Russian dubbed English, but this isn't a film by anybody's standards.It's a journey (3hrs). Something no one will ever make as good.I saw how people I admired (Darius Kondji, David Lynch, David Fincher, Dante Ferreti)pillaged this movie thinking i'd never see it. And I did.It simply and modestly ashames every directors I've enjoyed so far. They saw it, and copied the excellence. To a lower extent. Where did they film this (Estonia)??? What budget?? Every frame looks like a painting, the lights are astonishing. From the start, the textures, sound effects, photography and mood just takes it to another level. (1979).This is more than avant-garde, this is sheer genius.The plot? Wanna learn about the meaning of life? This is it. It's like kubrick's 2001, with a meaning. Philosophy, poetry, storytelling, music, beauty, filmmaking all tied into one. The movie I've been waiting for. A revelation.You gotta have three hours to spend, but it's not lost. I watch movies to change my mind. This one blew it right out of my head. Michael bay's fans will probably get bored, but when I'll care about them I'll review "transformers".Be patient and humble. Few gunshots, no action, mostly settings and dialog (poetry).Damn russians, the only thing that reached me and as profoundly life-changing as having my life flash before my eyes. They may drink vodka, but no one takes films or books as far as this.I love black dogs.So this is it, so ultimate that I feel sad, because nothing I will ever see will come close to this level of excellence.The ONLY film that deserves 10/10.PS, check out the very last scene. I'm still afraid of getting it. But that's gotta be a message. for mankind.A. Tarkovski is like a painter with a scenario written by some 95yr old dude from the gulag, a psychotic location scout and no budget. With a camera.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Words are not enough......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After so many wonderful comments it is difficult to say something else. Anyway, I cannot stop myself from writing few words for this amazing movie. It is probably one of the best ever made movies in its genre. Here it is, in few words, what the movie suggested to me. The whole movie is a metaphor to the human being, the passing through life and memories. I would like to consider it more philosophical than science-fiction. The human being is represented in this movie by the three characters: Stalker (The Human Instinct/Subconscious), The Professor (The Human Rationale/ The Reasoning) and the Writer (The Human Imagination/Humanism).All three are going together in the Zone and they never go one without each other. The target is The Room where you can have all your wishes come true. This Room would be like any ideal in life, you try to achieve it but you will never be able to do it. The whole trip to the Room is like the way in life. Never straight and clear, with a lot of strange things and a lot of details. The wolf in the movie represents DEATH. It comes closer to the Stalker when he sleeps ( I understood that when we sleep, we are the closest to the death state). I am not quite clear what represents Stalker's wife and daughter. Maybe somebody can give me a hint. Anyway, the movie is hypnotic. Just simple the best that can be done. I advise all Hollywood fans to not waste their precious time on this movie. They would have anyway only bad comments about it. Remember, the movie is almost 3 hours and is not an action movie. On the other hand, I advise all the open minds in this world to give it a chance and to try it once in their lifetime. Hopefully, they will enjoy it as much as I enjoyed it. Too bad that Tarkovsky did not leave more movies like this. Anyway, all his movies are masterpieces in their own way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A childhood theme was discernible in this movie, and it has been picked up by other viewers. The fact that the child, Monkey (is that a boy or a girl? I got confused) is both unable to walk but able to move objects at a distance, struck me as bitterly ironic. And both these conditions are caused by the Zone. It seems to act like a destiny machine for children (out of control of course). But as to the view on childhood this suggests, I'm blank.The other point concerns the Room. Neither the writer nor the scientist enter it, in addition to the stalker doubting it would work for his own wife - or defending her for some other conjugal reason. To me, that means the Room is fake. And thus, the stalker is deluded, and is indeed seen feverishly complaining about the "non-believing" writer and scientist (to his same wife who's tenderly minding him). The writer and scientist did seem to me, on the whole, more balanced than the stalker, struggling with their own demons perhaps but at least consciously so. Still, they are not taken seriously, since neither enter the room, and the scientist actually defuses the bomb. It would have been an interesting experiment to go into the room, wish for the bomb not to explode (in an "innermost wish" way to keep the fairy-tale aspect), and then detonate it.By the end of the movie, we as audience have outgrown the Zone, just as the writer and scientist have. Still we're looking for closure for the stalker, and the only resolution I could find is that the dog comes back with him to the city. Perhaps the dog will remind the stalker enough of the Zone that he doesn't need to go back there, and can finally move to the suburbs with his family.So if the room is fake, and the stalker wants desperately to believe without finding a suitable object of belief, and the other guys going home to resume their lives, where does that leave us? It left me with a sense of awe for great cinematography. Those long shots allowed one to immerse himself into the scene and make unseen, imagined connections. And there are plenty of jokes too. I liked the one where they are sitting in front of the room and the stalker says he'd like to get his family here because they'd be safe. At that very instant, thunder roars and a torrential shower fills that room, drowning them in the noise. The scientist throws parts of the dismantled bomb in the pond.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>-spoilers- The word "Stalker" in this film does not have the derogatory meaning one would probably first think of. The Stalker is a guide of sorts...more like a searcher. He uses his skills to lead people to a magical room in the center of an off-limits territory: the Zone. He doesn't stray from the path like his two "intellectual" traveling partners do - they have taught themselves that a straight line is the quickest and smartest way of getting to the Truth - he knows that this gets you killed. He respects the laws of the zone. That this is a tedious and drawn out journey that pays off in the end. The 'scientist' and the 'writer' have the brain power to chatter haughtily about the environment and their philosophies, but do not realize that without their Stalker, they would be dead. He's leading these would-be leaders... ironic, eh? And when the two men of the mind finally find what they are looking for - they wish to destroy it. They had a certain pureness to get them that far, but their minds have corrupted any hope of utilizing the magic of the room. Tarkovsky shot this film beautifully. And I felt he did a great job getting the audience to undergo a wide range of emotions. The movie itself is tedious to many - but mostly those that share the same personalities as the 'scientist' and 'writer'. You see: getting to the heart of this movie is in itself a tedious task, but with an equal pay-off if you get there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains SpoilersThe film is big, there is no denial. The discussion of what Tarkovsky film is his best may be unending, but he is one of those rare directors who only film chef d'oeuvres. What makes it especially Tarkovskian is the presentation of the principal hero, the Stalker. The source for the film, as is well-known, is brothers Strugatsky's novel "Picnic on a roadside", whose protagonist, Roderick Schuhart (the film's Stalker is the corresponding figure), is as simple a personality as one may expect. He's, essentially, nothing more than a street bum, just the sort one encounters in Dickens's taverns for poor people, he is quite ready to do as much law-breaking as required of his "profession", he is quite ready to take the young son - a completely innocent person - of his "colleague" to death (there is an obstacle on the way to golden ball of the book's Zone, to which an unsuspecting companion of a stalker must be "fed"), etc. He, actually, has no respect for other humans or mankind whatsoever. His "twin" the film's Stalker is a complete difference - he is human, yet he is the medium for other humans to the fulfillment of their deepest desires. What he suffers from, and deeply, is the kind of deepest desires these humans have, their inability to see what is there in human life. He doesn't hate them at all, that is important; he, maybe, even loves them as they are human, he despairs that, even as he shows a man his way to happiness, this man cannot see where his REAL happiness lie, cannot see what he is to do with his life. The suffering and weltanschauung of the Stalker is, as I see it, the principal theme of the film; no such thing for the book and Roderick Schuhart. So one may say that the film Stalker is, from art's point of view, a far greater success than the original book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not many people have seen "Stalker" because it is Russian and at first glance, it looks black and white. But, it isn't. It is a beautiful movie. Three men are on a quest to go to "The Zone", an abandoned city. There is a place called "The Room" where if you enter it, all your desires will come true. The beauty of this movies is how it is played out. Many times, you will watch the character sit or lay down or do something for five or ten minutes. No words are said. VERY few words are said. The movie plays music only twice and it sounds like it could be from China which really doesn't fit because the language spoken is Russian but because of the music, it makes it really cool. Nine-tenths of the time, they don't even play music. Eight-tenths of the time, they characters don't even talk which makes it have a haunting side. The director, Andrei, said once, "Everyone asks, 'What are the meaning of your movies?' and I always say 'It is not the story that matters but rather the feeling you get from the movie.'" This is very true. The feeling I got from this movie was...well, I was blown away. The end of the movie really got to me. It had nothing to do with the story-theme, but it left you a "Huh?" kind of feeling. This movie may be for the mature crowd, not as in it is dirty, in fact, it is VERY clean. But the fact that it is in Russian, made in the 70s may not attract people who aren't very bright. All in all, this is on my top five list.</fullReview>

Only draw back of the movie that it is slow at times, until you realize it is supposed to be that way to set the mood. Scenes like the so called "meat grinder" room sequence have become etched into cinematic history. To do a bit of a quick summary, three men each for different reasons attempt to get into the Zone, where a Room exists, in this room your greatest desire or wish is fulfilled, whether you like it or not. The three men are a writer searching for inspiration, a scientist whose goals are not known to us, and the man who leads people into the Zone the so-called Stalker. Watch the movie with your friends and ask them after the movie what they thought was the Room, the three guys, the Zone and their quest, guarantee each one will give you a different answer.</fullReview>

But his most durable blueprint for the cinematic imagination may be Stalker, allegedly an adaptation by Arkady Strugatsky and Boris Strugatsky of their science-fiction novel Roadside Picnic (1975). Stalker is exploratory in every sense - an undertaking in topographical cinema. In an unspecified future, a meteorite has created 'the miracle of miracles', the Zone, into which a haunted, specially qualified 'Stalker' (Alexander Kaidanovsky) guides two disillusioned men, a writer (Anatoli Solonitsyn) and a scientist (Nikolai Grinko). The outside world, filmed in black-and-white, is a militarized region of checkpoints and freight yards, patrolled by police: to all appearances a classic dystopian image of the Soviet Union. But the pastoral inner haven of the Zone - shot in a faded, chemical shade of blue-green - is just as unstable. Stalker's universe is, above all, porous: water flows everywhere. Even the extraordinary sound design is prone to a kind of seepage. The film can be read as a political parable. A field of abandoned tanks swamped by vegetation seems a clear passage of the fall of power. Tarkovsky, who died in 1986, is widely considered a spiritual filmmaker, and often attacked as such. Now it's easier to admire his work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgettable surrealistic imagery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I watched this movie I was like "How can you like something that goes so slow, that has characters speaking about mystical subjects all the time, lying on the ground, doing nothing, then deciding to throw small metal objects wrapped in tissue for unknown reason?" But still that movie succeeded in grabbing my attention. The images are so nice. Tarkovsky handles the camera in a way no other director does. Every movement is precise. The dream sequence with the little girl whispering and the camera showing different objects in water is just fantastic. There is something about the scene in the Chernobyl-like desolated building when a bomb is put into pieces and water starts dropping from the roof like rain for minutes. You'll never see something like that except in a Tarkovsky movie. The four elements are always present. There are many other memorable scenes, like the one with the psychokinesis and the one with birds flying over dunes in the Chernobyl building. Apparently, some of the actors and Tarkovsky himself died because they developed diseases after being exposed to the chemicals in the place where the movie was shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why should you see it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, because films like that are hardly made anymore. Second because the director managed to set a philosophical debate that doesn't get you bored (and the film is 3h long). I think the 'journey motif' it's what moves the action forward, and keeps you watching. Also the mood and the jumpy characters contribute to overwhelming sensation of unknown to be discovered. This film leaves space for interpretation and character analysis. It does not serve 'fast processed food' but let's you indulge in the cinematographic feast. Third because 'Stalker' was made in social realism period in USSR and somehow it gives me an impression of much freedom. I think the director managed to compromise without loosing his integrity. Metaphisical journey of a stalker,a scientist and an artist but I'm sure each viewer may see a different depth to it...not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Same level of complexity as in Bergman's persona. I believe all of the plot elements and dialogs and dreams in this have symbolical meaning driven from inside. Who and what stopped writer when he is trying to enter the building? How can the professor over take other two? Why a Black dog accompanying all three person? What can be interpreted by items laying in water surface in the dream sequence? Why there is a telephone inside the building? Why professor wants to destroy the room? What is the real meaning of the room? why writer doesn't want to enter room? Why the Stalker trying to grab the bomb from professor? What can be interpreted by mutant child's last action of moving three glasses and one is forced to drop.? What is the symbolical meaning of the zone? Who is the Stalker anyway? Is he the human desire?I believe highly attentive viewer of Stalker can answer all these questions by their own way and make a unique decision.That's what the director's achievement</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unlike any other science fiction film out there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure, it's really arty and a bit on the slow side, but if you have the patience, "Stalker" could very well be one of the most effective film going experiences you'll ever have. Ostentatiously a science fiction film, it lacks any of the flashy effects or campy histrionics the genre's detractors often associate it with. Instead, Andrei Tarkovsky crafts his work as yet another one of his metaphysical journeys, a completely cerebral film open to a plethora of interpretations. Several viewings later, I'm still not exactly sure what "Stalker" is ultimately about, but I love revisiting it in order to attempt to decipher it.Often, the film deals with man's lack of faith and willingness to venture into uncharted territories. Many times, when they do, it's for their own ulterior motives opposed to their own personal betterment. Since the film touches upon faith, it seems rather ironic to scan yourself for a quick and easy interpretation, as Tarkovsky was known to reject such. Certainly a film more to be experienced than exactly understood, "Stalker" bears repeated viewings. Past it's depth, it's a technically exception work, one without any mistakes along the way.

		<shortDescription>Great Art Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best introduction to this film is to say it is an art film. So saying may conjure up past experiences where entertainment takes a back seat to artistic expression. This is not true with Stalker. It maintains suspense and interest throughout the film. The story involves a strange journey into a heavily guarded Zone to which strange things are attributed, including possibly an alien landing site. But the journey in involves viewing nature and the ravishment of man's industrial footprint and nature's natural tendency to erase it, with fresh objectivity. It is a rather schizophrenic vision in which phenomenon so common as a gust of wind are perceived with the primitive fear of a savage. Or a dry wind of dust and leaves blowing across quivering quicksand. Nothing about it supernatural but so strange!In the long run no ET monsters or anything else is discovered. To borrow the words of Bob Dylan: Nothing Is Revealed. And so, there is a letdown in suspense, but the letdown is not without dramatic meaning. It is the letdown of a man unable to prove that he is not insane.I have to think that even in Russia--a land known for its industrial pollution--the makers of this film must have spent a lifetime scoping out potential visual material. To watch the camera pan over the submerged items left there by man and nature is to stand in the shoes of an alien ourselves. This is a great film for sensitizing one to man's effect on the environment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Just For Entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thats right, most movies are made to entertain, but not Andrei Tarkovsky's movies. His movies are the highest form of art, and not everyone can appreciate it, his movies are not fast paced, or very romantic or filled with comedy but his movies takes you to places where very few directors take you (Kurosawa, Bergman among few) a place where you begin to look for answers, truth, soul. This movie is no different than AK's other movies, The movie is about aliens, zone but you wont see anything which is usually expected in this genre, like too much make up, cool gadgets, aliens and what not..but instead here these are just in the background for three mens to search their souls, find the true meaning of life and being human. Direction is top class,cinematography is top notch and acting is good too. See this movie not with much expectation for entertainment but to see some highest form of art in cinema and just be amazed by the supreme art by the Tarkovsky.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Widest and Most Substantial and Coherent Movie Ever;Stalker is so authentic that it's _perplexingly vexatious to the unprepared mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>AT's Stalker might be the best movie ever; anyway, it certainly is the movie that I respect the most. On the other hand, most of what I have read about it was sheer nonsense, mere junk. His detractors might as well have said that they simply don't like cinema; all the rest is redundant.I don't give crap about why was Stalker received with so much obtuse animosity and ill?will and sarcasm by the extremely vast majority of the western public. The causes may be ever?so many; but they are also wholly indifferent. Now my small "Stalker history"?Stalker had on me, when I was 18, the same effect that "Kane" had had the previous year?when I was 17?I found them revoltingly and even unpleasantly and confusingly shocking and vexatious. I understood nothing; I was almost enraged and perplexed. I felt highly indignant at them. I was too uneducated, too unprepared. The second time that I've seen each of the two films was better (and even much better with "Kane"?seen for a second time when I was 27, and so much better prepared and oriented and apt). The third time was the best; now, this did become a standard of value, a test for the movies. The slow delving; I'm a slow delver. This is a very trustworthy test for the films. The shock that "Stalker" gave me on the first seeing was the confusing shock of the bigger?than?life, not the conventional delightful shock gave by the serial products; rather it was the shock of the unknown. A sort of a perplexing shock?the shock of the unknown and of the compact reality not yet understood. Like a brink, like a jump, like an edge, and then after so many years when I saw these films again I was now ready and I've found them full to the brim. (A third, still very different example might be "Vertigo"?first I've admired it wrongly?for phony and unreal qualities; then I disliked it; then I disliked it even more?"what a phony morbid decadent crime?movie!"; then I was as struck by its manifest beauty and truth.)Tarkovsky had, outside the sets, many interesting things to say; he was a cultivated and intelligent and perspicacious man and he moved through his life like a giant being. Nothing phony or extravagant with him?even to the point that this mere absence of defects becomes perceptible in him like a merit and like a sign of quality. His best film have infinite depth. Nothing in Tarkovsky, on the other hand, reminds the showman (as with the rest?with Welles, Fellini, Mikhalkov, etc.), the entertainer; he was a thinker, and a lonely artist.His human quality was of the finest. Tarkovsky brought the best. "Stalker" is not a film a frond, but of thought and of a fore-feeling of the subtlest things. It is not SF; Creature from the Black Lagoon, Revenge of the Creature and The Creature Walks Among Us and the other '50s classics are; but Stalker isn't.</fullReview>

However, it is all wrong unless you are child. because only as a child we should believe. These are the thoughts born in my head as watching this movie. As all other Andrej's movies it is simple and beautiful in its film language, music, pictures and rhythm. I feel deep sadness while watching this film, yet not frustration or depression.

		<shortDescription>Stalker is based on "Roadside Picnic"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm surprised so many people from outside the former Soviet Union were able to understand and appreciate this film. But anyway i just wanted to add that the movie "Stalker" is based on an incredibly deep and tragic novel "Roadside Picnic" written by the Strugatsky brothers. For anyone who hasn't read that book - find it and read it. It is a must.The characters in the film are actually based on characters from a few different Strugatsky novels. For example the writer clearly comes from the novel "Ugly swans" which is totally unrelated to "Roadside Picnic". The Stalker character in the book goes by the name of Redrick Schuchart and the story takes place in some imaginative East European town, which was turned into a filthy capitalistic city by the mere presence of the Zone and its artifacts that became an object of heavy trade. The film and the novel are correlated mostly in terms of surroundings. The rest is quite different. But both - film and novel - are probably among the best pieces of art ever created by human kind.By the way there's also a computer game out named "Stalker", which is based on both the film and the book. More so on the book, I would say, but still pretty far away from the original concept.</fullReview>

It describes the journey of three men who are traveling through a post-apocalyptic wilderness called the Zone to find a room that can grant wishes. There are no monsters or aliens in film, which the viewers are expecting. Threre are only 3 people &amp; nature.. full of strange artifacts and phenomena that apparently defy physics. But not only the idea of the film, which has actually something to do with reality(Chelabinsk-catastrophe, Tunguskij meteor) is good, but also way it is made from Soviet Union film director Andrej Tarkowskij. So it is really a unique film, which is worth seeing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the movie a second time, with the subtitles off. It's just incredible to look at. How does he get his sets to look like they do? Even the walls in the sepia opening scene, what amazing texture. How does he get the shot of the fish and the syringes and the junk and the reflected trees in the long water shot in Part Two? I couldn't even figure out how that shot could have been made -- regardless of how long you worked on setting it up and how much resources you put into it. It's as if Tarkovsky had a huge team of painters and sculptors who could see and create his vision so that it could then be shot.The sets, the photography, the pacing, the music -- the CINEMATIC quality of this movie is incredible. And it works with his questing/questioning thematic obsession. Some of the dialog and the character set-up -- with Writer and Professor -- was a bit too flatly allegorical for me. But what a transporting film to experience nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tarkovsky at his best. I guess it would be more respectable to say Andrei Rublev is my favorite Tarkovsky movie, since it's not science fiction, but I like this more.I admire a director like Tarkovsky who can make a movie strictly on his own terms, taking as much time as he wants to hold a shot, never being hurried by concerns over what "the audience" might think. I doubt I could be that brave were I to make a film. Probably the closest any other director came to this philosophy was Stanley Kubrick in 2001.I advise anybody interested in this movie to read Andrei Tarkovsky's book Sculpting in Time, the best thing I've ever read about movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even Heisenberg Would've Loved This Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dream-like story of a mystical room within a cordoned-off wasteland at the heart of run-down society. The room is supposed to fulfill the wishes of anyone who goes there, but is very difficult to approach and requires a guide (or "stalker") to help reach it. The film follows the progress of one stalker and his two latest customers (a scientist and a writer) during a day's journey through "the zone". Deeply philosophical themes of human desire and meaning are addressed, leaving the viewer with a LOT to think about, both during and after the movie.Tarkowsky was apparently obsessional about every single tiny detail of what appeared in every shot, and this resulted in the most visually perfect film I've ever seen: the stark black/white "real" world contrasting with the lush colours of the wild vegetation and crumbling buildings in the zone. The mood is set by the opening scene where the camera, VERY slowly, tracks into a bedroom, towards a chair being used as a bedside table, and then across the faces of a sleeping woman and child and then a man who is awake and looking back across the bed... so the camera tracks back the other way so you can re-view the scene in the knowledge that it is also being observed by the man. This is the only example I can think of in cinema of an attempt to address Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle! And this is only the first scene! There are so many other stunning scenes, but one that stands out in my mind is the slow close-up tracking shot of discarded objects and debris in the bottom of a very shallow, slow-flowing stream of water - a microcosm of the whole film, and of human life in general - this is a scene that only Tarkowsky would ever have thought of doing.This is a "proper" film, a work of art, that will still be watched and appreciated in a thousand years' time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I value Tarkovsky so much that I have saved this film. Watching an important film for the first time is such a profound experience that one should pace oneself. Conceptual gluttony may not be a sin, but its unwise if you take film seriously. It provides yet stronger reasons to hang around.I've saved this film for 30 years to watch for a special birthday, and opened it carefully. It did not disappoint. I recommend it to you as something worth saving. I think it is something best encountered after enough life to register ? it surely does not surf energetic hope as most films do.Some background, if you do not know Tarkovsky. I rate him as among the three filmmakers now dead who have influenced me. Recommendations at this level can only come from personal reports of the great voyage into the unknown and how the filmmaker has led one through dangerous, oracular terrain. It is what Tarkovsky does for me, as the most cinematic of the greats. And it is how this story is framed.There are three men here: a scientist, a writer and the guide. The journey is abstract, as presented visually through the most hypnotizing environments you will ever touch. These are textured spaces, always strictly architectural and derived (by wear, use and penetration of the wild) from ordinary built structures.The journey is presented in a way that can be seen as a general Godot-inspired existential drift. On reading observations from others, even serious thinkers, this seems to be how most people experience this. I would like you to consider a deeper experience. Elsewhere, I heavily criticize movies that depict mathematical or artistic breakthroughs and they might as well be depicting a sporting success. "Beautiful Mind," "Good Will," and "Pi" come to mind. The problem is that actual search, actual conceptual risk ? which is the idea in these movies ? is fully cinematic, strongly shaped by internal narrative and highly visual in the sense of escaping the images of worn dreams. These movies miss the boat, probably because no one involved has been there.Tarkovsky has, at least as a guide. He not only understands the angst of living in abstract webs of fluid risk, but knows the internal collaborative tension between the writer and the scientist, and between each and the outside world of reified happenstance, and also among all those and the edge of family and love. All of these we can literally see. It is an absolutely miraculous experience. Save it for when it can matter.This is quite different than other Tarkovsky works I think. It is more removed from experience of life, more deliberately unrooted in the flesh. It transforms sex into rougher refinement of urge. It will be less accessible than, say, the meditations on the body and place of in "Nostalgia" and "Mirror," which themselves are apart from the even more open notion of self and nation (as religion) in "Andrei Rublov." For this reason, I will advise working up to this because the biggest disaster would be for you to see this for the first time and not place yourself in it. Break yourself first.My rule for rating a film 4 out of three is that no more than two per year and two from each filmmaker. Andrei has two others rated 4, which I think are essential. This is more powerful and personal than those, but consequently more elusive.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watched this movie after reading all the praise.. didn't quite like it due to expectations and how the story was driven. --- Rant contains SPOILERSSlow pacing (even for a movie from 1979), lack of revelations and lots of self-exploration.. but dialogue was not strong enough to evoke submersion. Most time, characters are talking about the 'zone', a seemingly normal place people don't dare enter but still talk about. What is in it? Apparently nothing! There is such a poor explanation of it that it may result in expectations not being rewarded quite harshly. But then it is quite possible that (after reading about it) it is a place where radiation exists due to a nuclear-related explosion, which the government might have covered for years! So there is nothing magical about the Zone, it is wishful thinking.. but, even if it isn't such a crazy "revelation", you'd have to think about it yourself and realize the people are ignorant of the fact by yourself (or someone on the internet claiming this relation), as the movie doesn't even go there. Probably a message for the times. The rest of the movie-dialogue consists of quippy quotes that, sadly, don't go well with the moments where you would expect some sense of what is happening and not a philosophical analysis out of nowhere. These characters don't mash well in this 'scenario', they either know more than us and do not share such experience, or are written to not ask questions.. well, until they do at the very end, when there is not enough time to give an explanation (though the movie doesn't seem to care to do so). So, is this movie about the zone, or simply a tool to invest in these lacking characters with such poor/obscure motivations? Or is it as secondary as it seems to be? Why dedicate to much time to it if it's going to be ultimately useless or go unexplained? As a study of humanity, it is way to open-ended, and doesn't contribute strong ideas to help steer it, in my opinion. There might be a great movie underneath it, and hopefully someone will take this and inspire himself/herself to write a better and more coherent version. I don't like a story/journey that feels like a waste of time. A much better vehicle could be created to transmit these 'feelings' of self-investigation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stalker is one of those 'important' films that people who call movies films are very serious about. I mean, they LOVE Stalker and if you don't LOVE Stalker the way they LOVE Stalker it's because you don't UNDERSTAND Stalker. As in, you like spolsions and car chases and all those western cinema (oh, they call movies cinema a lot as well) clichés while they appreciate mood and lighting and probably opera.So, to be clear, I understand Stalker. I understand the journey the characters undertake and why. I just wish they arrived at someplace a little bit more - ambitious.The fun takes place in a future time in an unnamed country (Estonia). One day, a meteor strike destroys most of a small community and leaves behind a danger zone called 'The Zone'. The cool thing about the Zone is the rules of reality don't apply there and it even features a special room called 'The Room' which grants wishes! Highbrow!That's all preamble, the story proper begins with the title character Stalker saying good-bye to his very unhappy wife and setting off on his latest guided tour of the Zone. The two members of his party referred to simply as 'The Writer' and 'The Professor', cause, you know, names are dumb, both hope the Room will grant them what their hearts desire, in their cases to be relevant and famous.The journey that follows is populated with series of long conversations about the meaning of life. Interesting I guess, except the topics soon become repetitive and the mood sullen. These are not nice people. The Writer stating all human actions are selfish except for the creation of art is as debatable and it is smug. The Stalker claims his motives for guiding people through the Zone are purely altruistic yet he routinely sends his clients in first when exploring a dangerous path while he brings up the rear. And the Professor has a hidden agenda which I won't spoil for you because if you make it to the third act you deserve some sort of reward.At about the 60 minute mark it became clear to me Stalker was going to be about the ride and not the destination. That's fine and as other reviewers have said it is a very, very pretty film to look at I just wish the characters had moved beyond the trite 'What's it all about anyway?' Sunday afternoon coffee shop chit chat and actually tried to come up with some answers for themselves.Near the end of the film Starkers party is able to deduce (based on nothing) what the Room really offers people. This reveal serves the plot but it's no great insight into the human condition. It certainly isn't worth the 2 hour wait it took to get there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Stalker" (1979) didn't blew me away when seeing it for the first time just now in 2016. I kinda expected this movie to be "this kind" after seeing "Solyaris" (1972). And by "this kind" i mean: long, dreamlike movie with some long shots and poetry. It had all of that - and while i wasn't blown away by the overall experience, i must say i admired this movie while i was watching it. It also features a great settings and mood - i loved the whole mood and atmosphere in the "Zone".Overall, "Stalker" is surely not for everyone. This is sometimes (most of it) haunting experience, with some deep ideas (which i'm sure i didn't get most of them), nice acting and great settings. There can be millions interpretations of the whole picture or what one or other thing meant, but i think the point in here was for each viewer himself to find it own answers - as there can't be one explanation to everything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually came up with this movie from game 'Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl' which is motivated by this movie. I even didn't know it is a philosophical movie so then I tried to understand, or enjoy? This movie shows 3 guys that seeking Zone's special room for their wish but unfortunately they don't respect each other and only showing their way of life with closed ear, but hopefully they knows, understand themselves. I don't know if I understood this movie too different because I'm too young to think about this. I really hated writer that such depressed and forgot he is human with meaning of life. And then personally I had sympathy with him. this 3 guys represent cycle of way to live, Stalker(Seeker, Hope)-&gt; Writer(failure, Depressed)-&gt; Professor(Succeed but forgot to seek). I'm not going to tell each person's view that would make this review too long. However this movie is way better than other tones of terrible European movies. They want us to understand but this movie explained. I criticize one thing Long take was too bad because it didn't show enough things in shot. But Still none camera move was good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A guide to human's true nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A man leads two others, one a scientist and other a writer, to a mysterious zone to find a room that supposedly fulfills any persons innermost wishes and desires. This is about human nature. What does a human being want? When a normal person is asked about his/her biggest wish, they will tell you that it is to be a great person, do good things for humanity, win the nobel prize and such..But in reality, these are only expressed out desires so to conform the society, in reality, human is an animal whose only desire is to survive and satisfy its greedy desires. actual desires of people involve wealth, power, lust, gluttony that leads to violence..The scientist says that his motive for the journey is scientific discovery and his desire is to win the nobel prize while the writer says he needs inspiration.. Then when they come to the threshold of the room, we learn about the true story of the previous stalker, that he lost his brother in the trip and after getting into the room he committed suicide a week later. Because the room fulfills ones innermost desires and his desire was to be very wealthy instead of saving his brother. At that point the scientist and the writer understand that the best thing is not to pass the threshold, because they know that their real desires are different. The writer already confessed earlier that his intention is not inspiration, and the scientist makes it clear that hes not on an expedition as he stated earlier but he wants to destroy the room with a bomb. It seems they have the destructive desires just like most of people. . Actually the whole zone is full of remnants of violence; abandoned tanks, armory, and wastes as metaphor to man's sins. and most people couldn't make it because the room made their desires to destroy themselves; just like great dictators were swallowed by their own power, or greed and lust and other sins created ones own end..The stalker never trespassed the room because he knew the fate of the others. He had a crippled daughter at home. What would his innermost desire turn out to be? to cure his daughter? to give happiness to his loyal wife? to save his family out from their poverty and misery? or, well, is it some other desire, that he is afraid to face.It is interesting that the zone is perfectly analogous to religion. the stalker is the religious figure who guides the people along the way. zone is metaphysical and miraculous things are supposed to happen. note that almost nothing extraordinary happens though..and people are suspicious about the zone and its ability to fulfill desires.. As the stalker says; they don't believe.. And it is quite possible that the whole zone thing be just an illusion created by man. So, do you believe?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stalker, Writer and Professor travel through the Zone to the Room</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Stalker" is a philosophical-religious film, told using the powers of film that include both symbols, metaphors, the visual, and language. Some of the philosophy is distinctly Russian in emphasis, tracing back to ideas that appear and re-appear in Russian writers and philosophers. The story is very much concerned with man, the meaning of life, the nature of life, God and man's relationship to God, art, creativity. But this is not all that much explicit because it's embedded in an adventure story told in a science-fiction world.The film's imagery, its production design and sets, are all stunning. Think grime, decrepit buildings, industrial areas gone to waste and neglected, rusted tanks and artillery in a field, decaying buildings, underground caverns, water pools, muddy and teeming with detritus. Think surroundings like terrible urban decay with everything gone to pot. I cannot imagine how this film's makers managed to capture all the images that we see on the screen.It's all symbolic of the world that's inside human beings. It also symbolizes the Soviet Union of the time. They long for something else. The Room symbolizes that. The movie is like depicting a thorny path to God and the granting of one's innermost wishes. At one point, Writer puts a crown of thorns on his head. The journey through the Zone is dangerous. There are pitfalls and shifts even though the surface looks placid and it is quiet. Paths differ on every trip through it. This is like life. Although the exterior world of substance looks stable, the internal world is not. The dialog in this movie raises many philosophical points that, if we were reading them, would require time to ponder. In a movie, the moment passes and we move on quickly. The Zone is like a place where one travels a path to the Light, to Christ, to God. The Zone is life. Not everyone makes it through to God in this film's philosophy.Tarkovsky's camera movements are very slow and he doesn't use the conventional cutting and over-the-shoulder shots to show conversations. He might start at a distance and very slowly move the camera forward to the three men having a conversation in a small café. Viewing a movie like this requires some patience. It has adventure and novel dangers, but it is not anything at all like a Hollywood action movie. It reminded me at times, because of the presence of rain and water frequently, of "The Outrage" (1964). That film too has a small cast and a philosophical bent.This is far, far from being a conventional film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stalk it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Arkadiy and Boris Strugatsky's excellent novel "Roadside Picnic," which was the inspiration for this film, the perilous "Zone" where valuable but incomprehensible alien artifacts can be found becomes in affect a character all its own through the obsessive, ominous, and draining effect it has from afar on characters' lives. In this film, the Zone is again a character all its own -- but not from afar. It is constantly, oppressively present, and its effect is such that it seems just as frightful and mesmerizing despite the fact that in the film we are never told exactly why it is dangerous and why it is attractive. For the film media, the the Strugatsky brothers essentially created an entirely new work sharing a couple of key concepts with their novel. It's as much as anything a more formless and still very philosophical meditation on themes of their previous work, and one that (perhaps with the influence of its celebrated director) is acutely aware of the different needs that the film medium has as opposed to prose fiction. There are many people far more qualified than me to speak about just why Andrei Tarkovky's direction and camera work are as effective as they are. But they make this one of the most atmospheric films I havec ever seen. He has a very artful of making our views of things seems artless -- letting his camera remain still and wide for long periods of time so we can't escape the desolation of the landscape or cramped quality of the quarters. Characters move and interact within small spaces on screen, which makes for somehow more intense interaction. "Intense" intense is also the word to describe the acting, which rises to highs of drama, that, in contrast to the stillness of their surroundings, only highlight the desperation of the situation. The orchestration of this drama against stretches of stillness and silence is really a masterful handling of suspense. And it allows the moving and thoughtful philosophical discussions that its characters have to be charged with tension the whole while. "Stalker" manages to be that rare combination -- a deeply thoughtful mood piece. And it's done with high artistry in every aspect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Speed of the Film and the Presence of Fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is an incredible work of art that has helped to prove that special effects and elaborate scenes are not necessary to create a sense of fear among the viewers. Most people are not fans of this film as it's pace is relatively slow compared to most of the films created today. As a result of this unusually slow pace, people tend to stop watching it. However, those who do watch it all the way through will feel a sense of fear. Within the film, the "Zone" is presented as this ominous area that people do not fully understand but are still afraid of. The Zone is a place that most people will not enter as they are afraid of what might happen. This fear comes from stories of what happens to people who enter the Zone. Some of these stories suggest that people who enter the Zone risk being killed which heightens the fear of the Zone. Since the fear was created through these stories, it made me question whether the stories were made up or exaggerated to keep people out of the Zone. If this is the case, what is so important about the Zone that people need to do whatever is necessary to keep people out? The way that the story was told at such a slow pace added to the continuous sense of fear created throughout the entire film. As a result, I found this film to be incredibly well done and a great film overall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three men go into a guarded, yet uninhabited region called the Zone. Once inside, they attempt to reach the Room, which grants a visitor his or her innermost wish.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Andrei Tarkovsky does an excellent job emphasizing duration in the film - time slows down with the use of long durational takes. The long takes help focus the viewer as he or she needs to pay close attention to the dialog with the action being so slow. It also encourages the viewer to contemplate the philosophical dialog as pauses occur during the scenes. Through the men's journey, we as viewers learn that the men populate the Zone with their own fears. They imagine various traps as they throw bolts and proceed cautiously through the region. We get a sense that there is someone constantly watching the men with pseudo point-of- view shots that show the back of the men's heads in scenes such as the trio riding in on the train.We learn through the story of Porcupine that the Room does indeed fulfill wishes, your innermost one at that. But what is critical about that wish is that it is a wish that you may not even know - Porcupine thought that he really wanted to help his brother but he was actually seeking wealth - and this can cause the recipient to become ashamed, guilty, and even drive him or her to commit suicide. Though this film was produced by a Russian film director during the era of the Soviet Union, there is no clear Soviet ideology, but there are elements of philosophy and religion. Religious elements include references to the Rite of Penance and the Book of Revelation in the Bible, and the viewer watches as the men discuss life's toughest questions. I think that the pace of the film combined with the philosophical dialog makes this film incredibly fascinating, as the viewer is required to think a lot about their own beliefs and fears. I felt engaged throughout the film, and I would recommend Stalker to anyone who wants think critically about the philosophical elements of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Step Into The Zone...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie Stalker is first, and foremost, a piece of visual, moving art; it is moving poetry. The cinematography is stunning and quite possibly unparalleled. The primary thing to keep in mind when watching this film is that you will get out of it exactly what you put into it: if you look at it with brewing cynicism and little patience, you are bound to be either letdown or annoyed by this movie (or possibly both). But if you sit back and truly experience the film for what it is, you may walk away with a new-found appreciation for just what a film can actually be when one strips away the constricting limitations that we often confine to cinema. Stalker is loosely based on a science fiction novel titled "Roadside Picnic" by Arkady and Boris Strutgatsky. There was actually an original film that more closely followed the narrative of the novel, but when the original, undeveloped film was accidentally ruined, Tarkovsky chose to do an entirely different story in which he completely stripped away the character driven plot of the novel in favor of a visual story. The resulting product is a movie with minimal story and stunning visuals on a shoe-string budget. Two professionals, Writer (the cynic) and Professor (the reasoner) are accompanied into a derelict area known as The Zone by an individual called Stalker (playing the role of the hopeful "Holy Fool"). Their primary goal upon entering The Zone is to find an area known as The Room, a place where only the truly hopeless may enter and, in turn, have their wish granted, but there's a hitch: The Room does not just grant any wish; it grants your truest, most innermost desire, no matter what that may be. Upon entering The Zone, danger supposedly lurks in every corner, ready to spring up at any second, yet we see none of this. Why is this so? Is The Zone truly dangerous? Or has the myth, the legend of The Zone simply grown larger than what The Zone really is? That's the true beauty of this film: we don't know! There is so much subjectivity in this cerebral film, and a good majority of the film can argumentatively be left open to debate and interpretation. From a cinematographic standpoint, the film is visually stunning. The switching back and forth from sepia tone to color provides a stark contrast between The Zone and the rest of the world. A point of contention seems to be the use of long shots and lengthy pauses, thus making the feel seem unnecessarily slow and drawn out. It is this pacing that is actually crucial to establishing the tone of the movie, in turn inducing a feeling of paranoia and claustrophobia that runs throughout the majority of the film. So at the end of the day, what is Stalker? Stalker is a psychological movie with stunning visuals that can probably be interpreted a million different ways by a million different people. It favors cinematic style over plot, and, in turn, expects you to connect the dots and walk away with a meaning that is uniquely personal to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stalker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My third Tarkovsky's film (after SOLARIS 1972, 8/10 and NOSTALGHIA 1983, 8/10), STALKER is a startling eye-opener, set in a sordid clanking land of rural Soviet Union, after the falling of a meteorite, an enigmatic area "The Zone" has emerged, inside there is a room can grant incomers' innermost wishes, but cordoned by the government with armies, only with the guidance of so called "stalkers", one can reach the room. So the expedition involves one stalker and his two clients, a writer and a professor, one begs for inspiration and the other conceals an ulterior motive.As one can predict, the film is teeming with Tarkovsky's trademark static/panning long shots, mesmerizing and conjuring up a recondite sense of metaphysics, for example, a steady long shot of various items in the water finishes with the focus on a human hand, sometimes it's baffling, as viewers (as well as the two clients) have been warned numerous times by the stalker, the place is precarious, many a predecessor dies mysteriously in the zone, among a large chunk of the time Tarkovsky successfully maintains the stifling suspense to tally with the seedy locale, the movement is painstakingly strung out, so the audiences cannot shun the unknown danger but only succumb to a thorough wallow in the wasteland. Tarkovsky never resort to cheap horror to give vent to excitement or relief, instead, he utilizes a man-made natural surrounding to trap oneself in, and let our own inside demon out to divulge a sense of thrill and frisson. I don't speak Russian, so it probably hinders my apprehension of the dialog, only if the English interpretation could be better, nevertheless, STALKER seems bit chattier than Tarkovsky's other works, their debate ranges from the philosophy of human beings' psychological trials and tribulations, the socio-political radicalism to the awe and frustration towards the mystery and miracles plus the unselfishness of art, etc. I may not be able to fully cover all the implications from the first viewing, but one can not deny here the luxuriant imagery is louder than words at any rate.The cast is also memorable, the monochrome close-ups endow each character with a pictorial impact of their own resolution, the friend-or-foe association motivates the storytelling and excellently penetrates the harmony of the trio thus overshoots viewers' expectation. Myself find the supernatural elements have been fascinatingly deployed in this film, scattering into many inscrutable shots, sometimes only in a jiffy and most strikingly is the ending, with the daughter of the stalker, mind-controls still objects until one glass falls on the ground but the sound is drowned by the strident train running nearby, which ultimately veils the film with a stratum of mystique that qualifies Tarkovsky as one of the most unique and essential filmmaker of all time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With "Stalker" expect to be absorbed but not fulfilled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrei Tarkovsky is by all means an impossible director: his meticulous long-shots seem to unravel time itself; his sparse philosophical dialogue creeps into your vacuous head and spins around; his characters seem to be more caught up in themselves than in the world around them. All of this together creates a necessarily cerebral product, a film that both requires and repels your attention. With this methodology, Tarkovsky created some of his greatest masterpieces, including "Andrei Rublev" and "Solaris," and it is a methodology that does not exist whatsoever in Hollywood (the closest resemblance might be Gus van Sant's "Gerry"). Because of this, watching a Tarkovsky film is always a change, a change that I usually welcome.OK, now that that's out of the way, on to the movie. "Stalker" is a film that stretches the definition of sci-fi and fantasy. The setting very much relies on the viewer's imagination; it is clear that the actors are just parading around the Russian wilderness and a dilapidated country town, but the mood and atmosphere created by the long shots transform these common sceneries into mysterious territories known as "The Zone" and "The Town." The Zone is sanctioned off from the public by the government, but people known as "Stalkers" guide people through the zone. We watch as one Stalker leads a writer and a scientist through The Zone in search of The Room, a place where your wishes come true. Nothing in the film is given a definite label - descriptors are essentially proper nouns and the world is left too ambiguous for proper definition. This sparseness is actually what gives the film it's strength, because it plays on the exact idea that Tarkovsky is trying to display - a blend of the conscious and subconscious. On their journey to The Room, the characters reveal themselves to us piece by piece, what they desire and what their life means to them, but rarely is it through direct action, and most of the time the camera isn't even focused on them. This leads to a hypnotic composite of fantasy and reality, a confusion of what the character can and cannot control. What we are supposed learn is that our deepest darkest desires always betray what we want. What we witness for our characters is a loss of self and place in a setting that we don't understand.The plot of "Stalker" could easily be compiled into a 15 minute short and contain the same message, but that would betray the beauty of the film. However, I don't think that Tarkovsky's devices are necessarily to be praised for the film's effectiveness - like I said before, the craft of the movie was simply enough to make a cerebral product that will infect your brain, but the substance leaves a little to be desired. The writing itself is not that great and seemed to be checkered throughout when Tarkovsky felt like something needed to be thrown in. I also can't necessarily affirm that I understood the movie; still, the thought of watching it all again to understand it more fully seems a little too daunting right now. If you do watch it, expect to be tantalized, but not to be blown away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not my favourite kind of sci-fi movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is classified by the generality of critics as a masterpiece. I won't argue against this. A masterpiece must it surely be. Simply it is not my kind of sci-fi movie. My kind of sci-fi movie must have creativity and imagination in what concerns action and plot which this one hasn't got. It is something more like a philosophical or moral sci-fi movie taking place in gloomy and ugly sceneries and developing itself in endless dialogues, conversations and monologues. It has to do with the meaning of life and the moral human behaviour. The story is rather simple: a stalker who is a man that can enter an alien forbidden Zone guides hopeless people into a Chamber where they can have their wishes fulfilled. If it were not for the existence of the alien zone on an imaginary country this could hardly be classified as a sci-fi movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its Cinematography Is Astounding, The Narrative Is Scare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Stalker", I can only describe as a love it or hate it experience. Its narrative and hidden motif's I'll get to in a second, but what I want to say upfront is this. "I enjoyed the "Heart of Darkness" like attitude in it, but I also think this movie is grossly overrated considering Tarkovsky's earlier works". I want to say upfront immediately it is not because of the movies quiet, linear storytelling. I really enjoyed "The Mirror" (1975), and that was so ambiguous had you no knowledge of its autobiographical moments you wouldn't nearly enjoy it as much. It's not my least favourite Tarkovsky picture, but it certainly is an acquired taste and even its meanings remain shrouded today. Is it about the Gulags? The eventual Chernobyl disaster? Even some have made comparisons to "The Wizard of Oz" (1939). What I can say with assurance, is that "Stalker" feels somewhat more connected to nature than any other fiction movie out there.An expedition takes place led by a man known only as the 'Stalker' (Aleksandr Kaidanovsky), who has the ability to navigate the "Zone", a site that has a specific area that has the supposed ability to fulfil desire. His task is to escort two clients into the area, one is a writer (Anatoli Solonitsyn) seeking motivation, and the other a professor (Nikolai Grinko) seeking scientific discovery. The trio travels through these areas filled with ruins of modern society, whilst arguing with each other about the practicality of the "Zone", and the arguable aura around it.The infamous history behind this film is that Tarkovsky and Cinematographer Georgy Rerberg, had already spent a year filming all the outdoor scenes only to return to Moscow and find all the footage unusable due to a defect in film stock. Tarkovsky of course was despondent and wanted to abandon it, and soon Russian film boards were about to write it off until Tarkovsky hired Cinematographer Aleksandr Knyazhinsky, and began work again after making a deal with the company. The finished narrative was drastically different compared to the original vision. Its Sepia tones hauntingly fit its urban settings well, the "density" of time actually feels present and the colours of the natural world look astounding. I found the talks of philosophy nowhere near as deep as "Solaris" (1972), even with that movies large quantities of "techno-babble" I enjoyed them. I'll also admit that the payoff and my expectations on the discoveries made felt underwhelming. Tarkovsky was approached about the nature of the movie and how the audience may react to it, to which he uttered this quote I somewhat adore the man for saying: "I am only interested in the views of two people: one is called Bresson and one called Bergman".The film is crafted with particularly well executed long takes, and its sounds never betray the atmosphere the creators desired. The acting is strong and the dialogue is somewhat delivered well, given such an opaque narrative. There are moments where the fourth wall is broken both directly and ambiguously, and the film leaves many pleasant questions for you to decipher as Tarkovsky (I guess) intended. I suppose the final piece of trivia to mention is that several people involved in the film production including Tarkovsky, had met tragic deaths which has been debated that it was due to the fact this movie was filmed near a half-functioning hydroelectric station (Tarkovsky, his wife and actor Anatoli Solonitsyn all sadly died of the same cancer).Final Verdict: I believe it comes off as a little pretentious, but on repeated viewings I warmed up to it a little more. I stand by what I've said in this review, in no way did I hate it, but I would advise you to seek out the other directors work before seeing "Stalker". I don't know why, but a lot of production notes come into my reviews when it comes to Tarkovsky. All his movies are visually stunning works of art, but I also found his later pictures to be somewhat colder. 7/10.</fullReview>

There everything can happen and everything can change. But in this 'Zone' it's really difficult to approach the Room and when they approach everything change and of course the rules are not the same.I have a neutral opinion about this movie I neither like it nor hate it or I did not like it. There were some points that I like and some points that I did not like in this movie. It's a completely different movie than the movies that I have seen and this was something that I like on it. On the other hand I did not like the big duration of non speaking and no action or something and just to watch the actors thinking and considering something.Finally I have to say that "Stalker" is a movie that either you are going to love it or you are going not to like it but I also believe that some people will have the same opinion as me which will be a neutral opinion about it. It's a movie from these that it will make you think and consider many things about hope and ambition not for things but for life in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film about faith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stalker is my favourite Tarkovskij. Maybe because I can't fully appreaciate the greatness of his latter works, or because I particularly like post-apocaliptic settings, but I always felt attracted by this film. Visually, Tarkovskij's one of the best directors to date, so there's nothing to say there. The sets, if they were built specifically for the movie, looked incredibly realistic, if they were already existing ruins, they standed perfectly. The film is adapted by a novel, "Roadside Picnic", which has nothing of the spirituality added by Tarkovskij, and tells a different story. There have been various interpretations that critics way more important than me gave about the film, but I feel that mainly, 'Stalker' is a movie about faith. I won't do a synopsis to the film, but the Stalker brings two men, nicknamed Writer and Scientist to the zone, and during their journey the three discuss of various philosophical themes. His two clients represent the rationality of today. The writer simply can't believe in a room were wishes are furfilled, the scientist sees it as a threat. The Stalker is a lone man, who has faith in the Zone, and believes in the room. When the Stalker is at home, at the end, he asks something like: "how can people live without faith?" (don't remember exactly what he said, I watched it in Russian with hungarian subs). Even if the Stalker is sad at the end because of the others, and he and his family live in a decadent world, he's in peace. Writer's tormwnted with his anxieties, Scientist's firm, but lacks of compassion, on the other hand Stalker in the Zone lays down and breaths the air. I personally feel that this was the message of "Stalker", even though it is suggested that it is about humans not being able to reach the universal truth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the greatest films directed by Russian prodigy Andrei Tarkovsky. The film inspired by Roadside Picnic is directed by Russian prodigy Andrei Tarkovsky. Although based on the Strugatsky novel, there are many divergences from the written story. The Zone remains as the principle focus and its most cherished treasure is once again the target for the adventurers. Other than that, the origins of the Zone and the trespassers who are lead across it by the Stalker are all completely new characters and explanations. An unnamed Stalker, presumably based on Red from the novel, begins his day by trying to sneak away from his sleeping wife. He fails, but not even her most heartfelt pleas can persuade him to stay away from the Zone and the multiple dangers it presents. This is, after all, how he makes his living.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The BEST film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stalker (made by cinematography genius Andrei Tarkovsky) is a visually unforgettable film.It's my most favourite film of all time. It's based on short science fiction novel Roadside Picnic - written by Russian science fiction authors Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. It has a very deep storyline that held my interest from the first to the last minute.I was very impressed by the acting of Alexander Kaidanovsky. For most of the film there are only three actors - they did their job amazingly well. From a technical point of view - it is the BEST film ever made! I strongly recommend to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atmospheric, weird, intelligent, a little too slow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stalker is quintessentially Tarkovskii and stagnation-era. Tarkovskii's extended silences, slow painting-like shots, color filters, and obsession with dripping water permeate the film. From the stagnation era, Stalker borrows middle age, cynicism, nihilism, listlessness, and unfulfilled desire. The film is remarkably atmospheric; aside from a few strange occurrences, nothing actually corroborates the titular Stalker's claims of supernatural danger in the Zone, and yet the fog, the ruins, the unearthly electronic music, and the apprehension of the characters gives an air of ominous oppression to what is objectively a very simple film. Alienation is a constant theme. In one sense, the Zone disobeys physical laws, traps and kills, and inspires introspection in a terrifyingly sublime way. In another sense, the Zone is the most "real" place in the film ? it is in color, it is a place of hope, and it is the only place the Stalker claims to be at home, in opposition to the muddy-brown drudgery of the outside world. The dichotomy of Zone and reality, hope and cynicism, comfort and danger, unconscious desires and active passions are constantly at play, and often flipping. I couldn't shake the feeling that the film had something to say about communism and the stagnation period: the Zone is a place of refuge and also a place of weirdness, it attracts the hopeless, and yet offers possibility. One character wants to destroy it, due to the terrible power it might give to bad men. Another character argues that this cannot happen, because man's inner desires will always trump their ideological positions. The Stalker wants only to bring visitors to the Zone for hope and happiness, and grieves at the inability of "intellectuals" to give it their faith. His wife narrates, "If we hadn't had our misfortunes, it would have been worse?there wouldn't have been any hope." Whether or not these stagnation themes were deliberately placed or an osmotic result of the era is irrelevant ? the film is imminently malleable in interpretation. Stalker is nothing if not strange, and there are scenes that cannot be described with any justice in writing. The atmosphere is beautifully wrought, and the film thankfully does not spoil its own premise with over-exposition or ludicrous elements, as science fiction is often wont to do, but scenes tend to drag, and the film might have benefited from some more judicious editing. The most striking and well-timed scene in the entire story occurs in the last two minutes, and one wonders what Tarkovskii might have done with a little more money and a more hawk-eyed editor. Overall, Stalker is strange, atmospheric, introspective, and a little too long for its own good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The eternal quest for fulfillment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Stalker is one of many itinerants who spend much of their lives wandering through the Zone. It is an area that has been strictly quarantined by authorities due to an unexplained disaster that may have been caused by extraterrestrial beings or some unforeseen cosmic event. Due to his special knowledge of the area, the Stalker agrees to lead two men, a Professor and a Writer, through the Zone to a special place called the Room, where it is believed that one's most cherished wishes will come true.Much has already been said about Tarkovsky's 'slow motion' cinematographic style. Many like it, and, not surprisingly, many find it boring. However, judging from some of the other reviews, it appears that very little may been said about what the story actually means.On a symbolic level, the zone represents the mysterious workings of the human psyche and all the chaos and confusion therein. The professor represents logical reasoning, which, unfortunately, has been corrupted by a penchant for self-destruction. The writer represents our ability to dream and create things of beauty, however, he lacks inspiration. Unfortunately, despite being highly conscientious, humanity has nevertheless failed to achieve a harmonious relationship with nature, in particular, our own. It is to achieve this natural harmony that drives the Stalker to return to the Zone time and time again. To the Stalker, waterfalls, wild herbs, and warm sunshine are paradise compared to the dull, drab atmosphere of an industrial district. It is an emotionally inspiring experience he needs to share with others if only to make his own impoverished life meaningful. Yet, even he does not dare to take the final step towards eternal bliss.Like many of us, the three travelers don't actually know what it is that will truly make them happy, but it is certainly not the amenities of a technologically advanced civilization. It seems that everything that they had worked so hard to build, including social relationships (love affairs, friendships, families, professional partnerships, etc), lies about them in ruins, shut out, abandoned and left to waste. And, even though their goal appears to be only a short distance away, they cannot truly reach fulfillment unless they take the errant journey through desolation and despair that will bring them to a better understanding of themselves. However, the Stalker's companions are reluctant to take this circuitous route, partly because it requires a great deal more mental and physical effort, and partly because of an almost superstitious fear of the unknown.Is there any hope for these hapless itinerants, or are they doomed to wander aimlessly for the rest of eternity in a vain search for truth or some purpose to what would otherwise be a meaningless existence? By the end of the film, perhaps you will agree that there is still hope for humanity. That we are resilient enough to endure whatever hardships may befall upon us, and that because of the power of the human imagination, we will ever be capable of raising ourselves to still higher levels of conscious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Feel, touch, smell, see, live... all these are possible while watching this film. Simply pt - this is brilliant. The pace, the long shots, the character the camera plays, dialogs, colors, locations - there is not a single weak link in this film. I can't even think of something more to say. Put it this way: You've put on a bulletproof vest and gone out to fight this film. You are well prepared. It starts of with sticks and stones. Not much harm, but you can see the threat. But the film won't let you go with so easy. It jumps ahead and takes out a 9mm pistol. Still, what can it do. Shooting at you and you are proud of the bulletproof vest. You keep on going, the film calms down. And then out of nowhere it jumps in front of you and takes you out with an RPG. You lay for a while, murdered. Then some sense comes back to your head and you press the quick reload button. Here you are walking, regenerating and you've learned something - the skill to avoid an RPG + your vest is back to 100%. Proud again, feeling invulnerable... BAM!!! The film drops a nuke on you. Wasted you are with no way back. And it has the nerve to laugh by showing you the credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a cinematic endurance test, but worth the effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The late Andrei Tarkovsky was sometimes called a poet of the cinema, which usually means his films are beautiful to look at but difficult to understand, and this striking pseudo-sci fi allegory is no exception. In a world without hope a mysterious region appears--simply called The Zone--where conventional laws of physics cease to function. With the help of a privileged guide (called a Stalker), two men, one a disenchanted writer and the other a scientist, gain illegal entry into The Zone in search of a fabled room where the heart's deepest desires are said to come true. The film demands complete attention but doesn't make it very easy: like every Tarkovsky feature it's complex and cerebral and moves at a snail's pace. The journey into The Zone is a test of faith and doubt for its three visitors and often a test of patience for theater audiences, but if you're able to have your imagination engaged without the crutch of high-tech special effects it can be a provocative experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do not watch this movie if you dislike foreign films or have misconceptions....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you dislike foreign films, slow films, or have a misconception of what truly defines science fiction, then I will tell you now, that you will hate this movie. However, if you are fine with a film that actually attempts to do something, instead of aliens shooting at a protagonist who utters "bad-a**" one liners as he wins an impossible fight, then you will in most likelihood, love this one. Stop now, if when I say sci-fi you think of stuff like Battle:LA and Avatar. Stalker is a movie that explores the human condition. Throughout the movie, the scenes are defined by the long, drawn out, even sometimes awkwardly so, harrowing shots. Paired with the intensity with which the shots are taken, switching from a pan showing a lush green with three lonely figures centered within the frame, to tight over the shoulder glances following Writer down the Meat-grinder, the film builds its own unique, ethereal grasp. A common remark made on the lower ratings is that despite how dangerous Stalker keeps claiming the Zone is, nothing ever happens to them. If you have watched the actual movie, then you would know this to be false. Though, tie this to the over arching complaint that nothing happens in this movie. The point of the movie is not what physically happens, they want to get somewhere, they get there, then they come back to the bar, but what they understand due to this journey. The idea that men are, in essence, flawed by their selfishness, the death of hope in society, spirituality/empiricism etc, all are reflected in the resolution of the plot. All the men find that they are unable to actually find out their base instincts, as it is too horrifying for them to want to see. Don't get me wrong, this is an incredibly hard movie to watch, but it is more than worth the effort. It is resounding, deep, and unfortunately for some people, forces you to think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stalker Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following his greatly successful psychodrama, Solaris, Andrei Tarkovsky gratifies us once again with this 1979 post-apocalyptic science fiction epic, Stalker. Loosely adapted from the Strugatsky novel, Roadside Picnic, the writing found in Stalker is amongst the most compelling found in contemporary film. The dialogue seen throughout the course of this film cleverly knits existentialistic riddles through a series of whimsical tiffs between its players, ultimately creating a landscape for intelligent and thematic monologues to still come across as believable snippets of everyday conversation.As in most Tarkovsky films, the acting here is top notch. Aleksandr Kaidanovsky plays the role of Stalker, a deeply inverted bridge between the common world and the surreal Zone, where one's deepest wishes come true. Here we see a dash of religious imagery as the two "loyal" followers of the Stalker, The Writer (Anatoli Solonitsyn), and The Professor (Nikolai Grinko), struggle with belief and faith before entering this holy sanctuary. While these three characters take a good 80% of the screen time exclusively, they are immediately recognized as separate entities and are figures one does not tire of while watching their journey.The excellent performances and execution of Stalker is further complimented by its beautiful cinematography. The common world is introduced in a mish-mosh of grays and blacks to truly raise the impact of the colorfully vibrant Zone when its cast arrives. It seems as though film stocks are changed in mid-shot during a selection of the longer takes providing the ideal suit for what the film itself calls for. Stalker truly builds a foreground for its immense weight for when it finally reaches its once-in-a-lifetime climax. The concluding shot of this film might be payoff enough for its entire runtime as it burns an image in your short term memory that you'll think of weeks later continuing your own ritual.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Andrei Tarkovsky's 1979 film Stalker (&#x421;&#x442;&#x430;&#x43b;&#x43a;&#x435;&#x440;) is not the great nor masterful film its most ardent critical supporters proclaim, nor is it the slow, boring Eurotrash that its most vocal critics counterclaim. It lies somewhere in between- a film that risks and occasionally fails, although it is far closer to greatness than trash. That's because Tarkovsky has crafted a film of unusual visuals with even more unusual power. There are scenes that recall the old telefilm The Lathe Of Heaven, released the same year as this film, 1979; Carl Theodor Dreyer's great Vampyr, in its use of shadows and fog; the 1976 sci fi classic Logan's Run, in that the three leads of the film are running away from their society; Tarkovsky's earlier Solaris, in its mix of color and sepia images; and, most of all, with Alex Proyas' 1998 sci fi classic Dark City, which, like Stalker, creates a wholly believable alternate world unlike any other put on screen. Visually, Stalker most reminds me of the human portraits of the great Austrian painter Egon Schiele, with its myriad of gaunt, pallid, balding, dirty, twisted characters.But, as in most Tarkovsky films, it is not the visuals that dominate, rather the philosophic depth of the characters. What they don't say or dream is almost always as important as what they do say and dream. Stalker succeeds because its ellipses are more brilliant than its fodder. Stalker misses greatness, however, because its fodder some times fails . Of course, there are the usual misreadings by critics, who praise the very things that do not work- like the ending, or imbue their own interpretations of Stalker as a Christ-like figure (his being a religious character makes him no stand-in for a religious figure), when the film is surprisingly shorn of any religious mumbo jumbo (humanist philosophy and religion are not analogues), and the three lead characters are in no way merely symbols- of Christian Wise Men, the Trinity, nor any tripartite invocation. Do they bear some symbolism? Of course, since they are known only by their professions. But, each is a unique character, not a caricaturization. Thus, Stalker achieves a rare intimacy in film, one absent from most films, Hollywood or foreign, and if not a great film, certainly it is an excellent film, and one of the most unique visions committed to screen. See for yourself how even failure can fail better than most.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>how to bridge the gap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Stalker Tarkovsky searches for what lies beyond both measurement and intellect, and hooks the viewer by the senses. The first images after the credits are hypnotic, bleached, cold, that's home. Then there's a trip, some danger but nothing serious, in black and white, for a moment its sustained rhythm makes it almost warm, and then there's a search that takes the bulk of the movie, that's the Zone, a forbidden area outside society. The relatively normal colours of a cool climate are apparent but the visual elegance seems to persist. It's an abnormal normality, a vast natural stage emptied for the actors. The play begins and the actors search, first in open spaces and then in caves and rooms. They're a scientist, an intellectual and a stalker, a man for whom the totally rational world where he lives is insufferable. He's bullied by the scientist and the intellectual in a scene near the end. In the epilogue, the stalker's wife confesses to the camera that she knew this man was an outcast, that there would be problems, but she discarded the possibility of a better suitor. Their daughter, a girl with telekinetic powers, ends the movie.Constrained by a shoestring budget, and despite visually dazzling moments and an undeniable social element, Tarkovsky's exploration seems minimalist and geared towards introspection. The social and the personal are shown side by side. Lesser filmmakers are often incapable of telling one category from the other. "Intangible" and "tangible" apply to parallel or contiguous realities. The abnormal powers of the stalker's daughter displace the glasses across the table; the vibration by the train passing nearby affects the table and the glasses on it. Stalker is that rare artifact, it knows what to take from reality and what to expect from allegory, how to connect form and content in a coherent way that extends to the exacting relationship between the director and his medium. The Zone's travelogue may not always be top-notch. You sleep a little but wake up to a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tough test in a long film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Stalker" yeas ago, and what I remember most about is ithas the longest takes I've ever seen. I recall scenes that go on forwhat must be fiveto ten minutes of the three characters, facing intothe camera, walking through what looks like huge drainage pipes,with nothing changing. The entire movie is composed of shots like these. Long staticshots of characters that look tense and claustrophobic, and afterthe first hour, that's exactly how I felt. If this is Tarkovsky's scheme,he suceeds very well. The visual imagery is very limited and thecharacters don't say much, so there isn't a lot there to cling to.The film becomes a test of endurance, as the audience effectivelybecomes a character in the story, trying with the very act of will tobring about a change in the atmosphere. Tarkovsky seems to beimplying that change and success can only be brought aboutthrough patience, fortitude and suffering. That's fine, but I don'tnecessarily need to go through that to get the message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a sci-fi at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, despite its categorization, isn't a science-fiction at all. It is about the human being in its purity, told in form of a tale, but the meaning is far behind. This is a movie of patience and calm. Stalker and his mates never hurry anywhere. They simply sense their environment, and it's changing with themselves slowly as they advance. No matter where they heading, the supposed end of their way is just a vision of some goals, aims...Stalker is the movie of human admiring on nature and the existence itself without any conclusions to satisfy the viewer. There's no foggy ideas to follow or to get somewhere in life; the existence itself the miracle is. There are some breathtaking scenes of nature in the movie; their travelling with the rail-car into the Zone is somewhat a masterpiece of filmmaking, the slow rolling, the close-up of faces and the surrounding passing by with the music is perfect together. Also something to mention is the alternating of bw and color film techniques, which makes the difference between the inner and outer realities of human existence. A must see for everyone, 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

We don't really care to understand how you feel the film is pretentious and pointless. Philosophical questions are rhetorical and thus pointless, we know.Otherwise, keep reading, please.Tarkovsky is either hated or loved, depending on whether you watch a movie to be entertained or challenged. There is no punchline, and the pace is slow. Both facts can be either positive or negative, depending on your attitude to film making. Stalker requires time and good faith from the viewer. There are almost no special effects, and there are more questions than answers provided.The Zone is a place where your innermost wish becomes true. It's happiness, since your core wish can be satisfied, and it's confrontation, since you will really find out what you are made of. Do you care more about your wife and child? Do you care more about writing or about your attitude? Do you care more about revenge for your wife sleeping with your best friend? You'll soon find out that you're unable to choose. You are afraid of change, you're a conformist. Even though you're hopeless, you might just not enter.Feel the journey, it's nature, it's water.

His use of an undefined deteriorating industrial landscape is delirious; his use of extremely slow and long camera movements creates a non-pulsed filmic time in which hallucinations, dreams, mystical visions can be inscribed into the diegetic space of the film, as integral to the film as any conscious subjective action/narrative, in much the same way Nicolas Roeg used the lush, drugged-out decor in Performance to display subjective, psychedelic mindsets. And the sleeping scene with the waterfall: nowhere have I seen images like that, they are simply riveting. Master! Praise!</fullReview>

The writer seems to be the embodiment of Dostoevsky,and the thoughts of Tarkovsky himself. Tarkovsky's own thoughts of art, which he published, are also represented throught the mouth of the writer. Anyway, the movie is a must see, it is quite long, yet as I have read Tarkovsky, this was his intention. He wanted the audience to experience time, and I know of no other director that used time better.

My own would be that the room represents the innermost parts of the mind. When confronted with the opportunity to explore the innermost reaches of themselves all the main characters in the film back away. Perhaps the most significant element of the film for me was the manner in which reaching the room was made so difficult. Perhaps this is also the case with many people, who cannot understand the world they live in because they cannot undertake the arduous journey into their own mind to understand themselves.This is a truly thought provoking film. It is long, and often highly philosophical. But viewing it is a truly rewarding experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poetry...? Alchemy...? Or something else?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film seems to occupy a realm of perception akin to that of the prismatic reflection of light cast across your kitchen counter as the sun plays through it; or that of the whispering angular shadow of a swaying tree outside your window, beamed onto your ceiling &amp; slowly drifting across the room with the track of the sun. Both are singular phenomena and abstractions of light which one can embrace and perhaps even acheive some level of revelation through if the mind is allowed to 'lose the moment' as it were and embrace the uncommon beauty and inexplicable strangeness that such a simple event can generate. Just as easily, one can simply cast it aside; leave it unnoticed and nothing more than a wisp of light at the peripheral edge of vision. Stalker is, as well, one of these "abstractions of light", a flickering presence on the screen open to interpretation. One that may be fully absorbed and taken to heart as an illumination of the soul or brushed aside as nothing more than a faceless and futile attempt at 'nothingness'. Perhaps one may find their focus drifting in such a way that only a few fragments may be fully digested, comprehended and sifted through the back door of the intellect; vague impressions of no particular form or figure. Perhaps one could watch (and re-watch) this film and adopt all of the above viewpoints. Stalker is "that kind" of a film and one which is bound to polarize viewers. Unquestionably slow and brooding, yet uncommonly strange and beautiful by turns. It's meaning is shrouded and the ultimate resolution is tied up in metaphysical abstractions whose meanings are not entirely clear. One of the most impressive aspects of the film (and much of Tarkovsky's work) is it's ability to render the simplest images in a manner that transforms them into poetic distillations of a very high order. Tarkovsky is truly a visual alchemist of the highest order, as this film will certainly attest. Watch this film, take it for what it is, and leave with whatever impression and/or opinions you see fit. You may find yourself thoroughly bored or completely enthralled, but there is one thing that is certain. Whether you know it or not, a transformation of some order will have taken place. As the alchemists of yore would tell you, though the transformation of lead to gold may seem an utterly futile, unrewarding and ultimately impossible task, it is the transformation of the self during this process that really counts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I zoned out (ending spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The back cover of the video of this film quoted a critic describing it as 'a study in nihilism'. Not only is it as an inaccurate interpretation of Tarkovsky's intentions in cinema, it might also have put people off buying it, which is unforgivable. In his book on Tarkovsky, Mark LeFenu described Stalker as 'frankly a difficult film' which I think is euphemism for boring and opaque. It's not a film I see often and I don't think Mr T is as strong a scriptwriter as he is a film maker. Another critic said some of it came perilously close to 'hocus pocus'. Soviets who saw it held a more sympathetic view however, seeing in it a more sly and humorous dig at the communist obsession with the pursuit of reason and science above faith. The stalker uses thrown objects and string to take his followers the longest route round to the shortest destination. One Soviet viewer laughed: "Of course, that's JUST what it's like in Russia!"The lack of any seen threat, especially in the rather preposterous 'meat grinder' scene, and the slowness did get to me. Parts of this film were even pythonesque. Tarkovsky almost seemed to be sending himself up with one character teasing the other about having a 'soul meter'. Was it all a shaggy dog story? Everyone has their own take on why nobody goes into the room at the end, but I'm clueless.My father thinks Tarky is boring but he did sit nearly to the end of this film which suggests Andrei can intrigue even the most sceptical. What is indisputable is Tarkovsky's gift for great endings. That's because they are actually about something rather than entertainment which was anethma to him. The ending of Stalker leaves one with a question as there is a false miracle. The crippled girl only appears to be walking. This is followed by another question, did divine intervention move the glass or was it merely vibrations from the passing train? Reason or faith is left to you in an ending of such simple spiritual clarity it almost makes you think you've witnessed a masterpiece and the best film ever made. Almost, but not quite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ten to one, this is the best film around. I know, an American rating a Russian film, no I'm not a commie.But this movie is not only one of the best around, it has also got one of the highest replay values out there.When I was nine I was first introduced to it. I wet my bed for eight weeks straight. Then when I was twelve I watched it again, more to confront my fear than anything else, And I had a calming effect, less paranoia than at nine. When I was 18, and my views had changed, I watched it again on a rainy day only to find out it said more about me than any other film.This film speaks to each and every one of us on a different level, some people are terrified, others are pacified, while still others are thrown into convulsions. Andrei Tarkovsky lives up to his Homage as the best russian director ever with this film, possibly his best.Watch it with a friend, but leave the lights on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stalker is perfect. Not too long, not too short.It is meant to be experienced, to be felt. In my opinion, any analysis of the film can only serve to degrade it. There is no plot, so yes if you want to 'follow the action' or 'understand what they're getting at' then you might find it boring.At least, conceptually there is no plot. Not as expressed in words, or actions, or even thoughts. But in terms of impressions, of emotions, of perceptive experience, the film offers something that few other films can match. A virtual reality beyond today's technology. A film to be experienced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Stalker" is a tapestry of beauty and sorrow. Tarkovsky's visual introspection of human life and hope is hauntingly realized through a journey into the Zone--an enigmatic area encircling a room which will fulfill any innermost wish of its vistors. In the wake of the three protagonists follows the breath-taking dreamscape and their fear of facing the essence of life. What is hope? What is love? What is our reason to live? All of the questions echo through this heartbreaking journey.Highly recommended for those who seek profound sci-fi matter. Also check out the beautiful poems from Arseniy A. Tarkovsky, father of the director, in several sequences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This, for me, epitomizes ultimate, epic filmmaking. The film is the genesis for a completely unique world. I was further astounded by Tarkovsky's ability to create this new world using natural sets and a minimum of effects (currently the standard approach). Whether you like, appreciate, or feel comfortable in this alien world, this movie provides you with a unique opportunity like no other experience ever may; this is what it is like to look directly into someone else's brain (or soul, persona, etc.). Some have criticized the movie as being slow, but the process of transforming yourself into someone else takes time. I would encourage anyone seeking to expand their terrestrial understanding and experience to take the time to view Stalker, a movie of true fantasy. You don't have to like it, but it may just transform you into a person of more depth and understanding, as it did me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A guide known as The Stalker (Alexander Kaidanovsky) leads two men, "the Writer" (Anatoly Solonitsyn) and "the Professor" (Nikolai Grinko), through an area known as the Zone to find a room that grants wishes.Can you believe the film contains 142 shots in 163 minutes, with an average shot length of more than one minute and many shots lasting for more than four minutes. There is no question that the camera lingers, and no surprise that the picture is considered to be slow by many people (early audiences and critics definitely thought so).Almost all of the scenes not set in the Zone are in a high-contrast brown monochrome. What does this mean? That is for you to decide, but it does add an element of fantasy to the picture.The director reportedly said, "I am only interested in the views of two people: one is called Bresson and one called Bergman." Yes, folks, this is art and not entertainment. If you happen to be entertained, that is even better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a subtle film. One of the most gripping scenes is a half-asleep conversation between two characters, with eyes closed, great distance separating them, but the eerie quietude of the forest carrying their voices. The shots are long and sublime, and the camera obsesses on the juxtaposition of industrial ruination and nature. If you haven't come to terms with life you probably won't come to terms with this movie, because it enriches and examines life, rather than distract or provide escapism from it.Stalker almost becomes "stagey" at times with its emphasis on monologues, but retains a purity of meaning in every sense. A seemingly never-ending, close up pan through a gentle, golden stream full of mechanical debris, religious symbols and fish seems to suggest vast, vital universes hiding in every corner. Weather and environment become coloring for the individual plateaus of a shared spiritual pilgrimage. The wordless ending is somehow one of the most disturbing I've ever seen. This film is not just a vehicle for abstract philosophy, it is very pure and unpretentious. However, it does not pander to low attention spans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing, beautiful, profound and utterly baffling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, what a difficult film to give a score out of 10! I would say that this is one of the strangest yet most beautiful films I've ever seen. The philosophy and symbolism is so thick that it is very hard to grasp a coherent message. Set in some kind of post apocalyptic wasteland two men (a writer and a scientist) embark on a quest to the mysterious 'Zone' where in a certain room one's desires are made reality. On their journey they are guided by the Stalker - a man who understands the zone and is able to navigate through it's landscapes and hazards. Whilst in the Zone the Writer and the Scientist embody their two distinct ways of thinking through their actions and words creating a dialogue on the human condition. I think perhaps the Stalker represents the inner self - trapped in his life, searching for an escape and a purpose, displaying the strengths and weaknesses of human beings and perhaps discovering what is truly important at the end of the film.The cinematography is utterly fantastic: from the depressing squalor of the opening to the lush vegetation of the Zone with its crumbling vestiges of civilisation; from the confusing close ups of man made objects to the captivating close ups of haggard Russian faces; from the creative use of camera angles and lighting to the jarring and puzzling uses of sets and props, this film is so visually rich and an absolute feast for the eyes! The acting is great too but I especially liked the writer and the wife's scene at the end is very powerful.Be warned that this film is very slow and artsy fartsy to the nth degree - it's sci-fi Jim but not as you know it. I also found it totally baffling especially in the last scenes as it really takes you somewhere that you were not expecting, but I guess you wouldn't expect anything less based on the previous 2hrs! Having read other people's thoughts and now writing my own review I'm thinking that I would really like to watch it again and also read more about it's themes - it's deep man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of THOSE movies. You know the ones: come up in every conversation, is on every "must see" list, is referenced and quoted in every essay. It's also very good and very deserving of its attention. Tarkovsky's Stalker is the mapping of a labyrinth without walls. In a sort of Wizard of Oz style approach, Tarkovsky cuts between high contrast sepia and muddled green vegetation. The space in which this movie takes place is marked by water, fluidity, transition, rot, decay, and urban decay factors such as trash, abandoned guns, and hypodermic needles. The result is a mental, psychological space which is explored by a working man (the Stalker of the title), a writer, and a scientist, all to mostly open-ended and contemplative effect, though Tarkovsky does tack on an extra twenty minutes or so where he restates his themes, adds a confession, and then shows a bit of telekinetics, all of which I found to be entirely unnecessary, especially after the richness of the previous two and a half hours. Oh well.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

You also keep watching because you somehow hope that you will find out what these two seekers and their guide will find in the Room,never mind you know all the time that the Room isn't really a treasure chamber,star gate or anything like it.It's intriguing and at the same time you find yourself just as intrigued by their motifs and the deserted landscape(which I wanted to plunge into myself)which of course leads your thoughts to a nuclear disaster area. I guess you have to be of a somewhat poetic and gloomy disposition to really appreciate Stalker to its full.But it will take you on a journey you won't want to miss. I hope there will never be a English-language remake of Stalker(like Solaris).It's supposed to be in Russian,let it stay that way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tarkovsky's Finest Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker, an allegorical science fiction film like his earlier Solaris, was adapted from the novel Picnic by the Roadside by brothers Boris Strugatsky and Arkady Strugatsky.This science fiction depicts an expedition led by the Stalker to bring his two clients to a site known as the Zone, which has the supposed potential to fulfill a person's innermost desires.It features Alexander Kaidanovsky,Anatoli Solonitsyn and Nikolai Grinko. The title of the film, which is the same in Russian and English, is derived from the English word to stalk in the long-standing meaning of approaching furtively, much like a hunter. In the film a stalker is a professional guide to the zone, someone who crosses the border into the forbidden zone with a specific goal.The film follows three men namely:the Scientist, the Writer and the Stalker as they travel through a mysterious and forbidden territory in the Russian wilderness called the "Zone." In the Zone, nothing is what it seems. Objects change places, the landscape shifts and rearranges itself. It seems as if an unknown intelligence is actively thwarting any attempt to penetrate its borders. In the Zone, there is said to be a bunker, and in the bunker: a magical room which has the power to make wishes come true. The Stalker is the hired guide for the journey who has, through repeated visits to the Zone, become accustomed to its complex traps, pitfalls, and subtle distortions. Only by following his lead can the Writer and the Scientist make it alive to the bunker and the room. As the men travel farther into the Zone, they realize it may take something more than just determination to succeed: it may actually take faith. Increasingly unsure of their deepest desires, they confront the room wondering if they can, in the end, take responsibility for the fulfillment of their own wishes. Stalker is a complex, oblique parable that draws unforgettable images and philosophical musings from its sci-fiction thriller setting. Challenging, provocative, and ultimately rewarding, it is a mind-bending experience that defies explanation. It is not an easy film, but almost certainly a great one.Like Tarkovsky's earlier and similarly enigmatic science fiction classic Solaris, this long, slow, meditative masterpiece demands patience and total attention; anyone accustomed to faster pacing is likely to abandon the nearly three-hour film before its first hour is over. On the other hand, those who approach this movie in a properly receptive frame of mind are likely to appreciate the film's seductive depth of theme and hypnotic imagery. Tarkovsky films their journey as a long odyssey, or religious pilgrimage, and center of The Zone is where each of these men hopes to find a kind of personal transcendence. Despite obvious parallels to The Wizard of Oz, Tarkovsky's film is devoid of special effects or any fantastical elements typically associated with science fiction or fantasy. Instead, Stalker makes astonishing use of sound and bleak-but-beautiful imagery to envelope the viewer into the eerie atmosphere of The Zone and the dank, colorless landscape that surrounds it. And while the film's glacial pacing may be off-putting to some viewers, there's no denying that Stalker has a mesmerizing power of its own, including a thought-provoking and highly debatable ending that propels the film to a higher level of meaning and significance. Visually unforgettable,this is possibly Tarkovsky's finest work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unknown area, The Zone or The Path to God ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen Stalker just for one time and have to say here that I was almost confused in some parts of the movie. Too slow camera motion , worded conversation and many more ( now I'm not speaking about the art level of the movie - it is great) . But it could be due to the fact that I watched it when I was tired and maybe I couldn't focus on it. But now when I have already thought about it I suppose I can see the point of it. Next to the drawn human minds and men's deeds and instincts I found the similar path to the god. It is also guarded,it is hard to reach , not for everyone, but finally you feel heavenly great and your dreams come true. Some people are afraid to come in to the chamber - they are not prepared or are feared - the same with reaching the God. And when you want to destroy it - all for you the mythology or fairy tell - in your eyes - those who live only for it will try to stop you by any means that necessary. They blindly believe and don't hesitate to sacrifice a man - friend , brother . But after reaching that final point that can see their former deeds and than the suicide it the only suitable choice.So it was what I found in the Stalker. I believe that it is unnecessary to prove the artistic value of the movie that is something that everyone will feel while watching it. The acting was also very good but what impressed me the most was the chosen scenery where the story took place. It was - I believe - common heritage of the former industry in Soviet union - heavy industry factories break down by nature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is done by one of the most brilliant Russian directors Andrei Tarkovsky (solaris, Andrei Rublyov).His movies are released on DVD and you can find them almost everywhere so I had no problems tracking the movie down and watching it. Just as I hoped, the movie is MIND BLOWING! Absolutely wonderful! But I'll start with a warning: This is a slow intelligent movie, no action and no special effects.The story is about a Stalker that specializes in sneaking people into "The Zone" where there is a secret place in which their dream will supposedly come true. He takes there a writer and a Scientist and they have to sneak up to that place while following "rules" that are set by the place.The best thing about the movie is that it got the most wonderful cinematography that I've ever seen and it got great music and the most intelligent dialogs and monologues. Also the movie got a strong message... it's kinda like Kubrik's "2001: Space Odyssey" in style. I think that it's a must see for all cinema and serious sci-fi lovers. Also it's very recommended for anyone that wants to enjoy a good piece of cinema but to watch it you must be able to handle almost 3 hours very slow paced. Again, kinda like Kubrik's "2001: Space Odyssey".Enjoy!</fullReview>

If it had been shortened to the half hour it deserved, it would merely be pretentious and sophomoric.The photography was beautiful; the B&amp;W sequences had wonderful texture and there was a definite chiaroscuro effect. The transition to color and back again created a nice mood. The camera movement was effective and the angles as well. Too bad it was all wasted on a story which is a piece of crap.Even decent acting couldn't save this picture. The psycho/philosophical/pseudo-intellectual babble or attempt at such was worse than reciting a telephone book - at least the latter makes no pretense at deeeep meaning.There is an intellectual challenge to this film, though.

His clients are a burned out popular writer, cynical, and questioning his talent; and a quiet scientist more concerned about his knapsack than the journey. In the deserted Zone, the approach to the Room must be indirect. As they draw near, the rules seem to change and the stalker faces a crisis. A beautiful, great and puzzling film. But then if it revealed all its secrets straight off then, apart from the beautiful visuals and the soundtrack it would be pointless watching it again. Great art only leaches out its secrets gradually and only to those with the desire to learn them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The entire film is philosophical in the vein of science fiction. While the film moves slower than any you have ever seen, it does so in a manner that draws the viewer in, leaving you wondering what will happen next. From the very beginning of the film nearly every take is so long that the tension just continuously builds, and even if the character stayed in the same building the same type of shots would have carried the amazing feeling of suspense. The slowness of the movie also play an important role in the way that Tarkovsky wants the viewer to think about the film. It gives the viewer time to think about the coded messages that he presents from beginning to end. Furthermore, it also adds to the ideas we take away from the movie. Instead of viewing certain sequences as action based, it leaves a feeling that many tings are meant to be symbolic or purposefully exaggerated. Overall, the film does not disappoint from beginning to end with many slow turning twists that leave you scratching your head and asking what it was you had just seen. The acting and plot combine to complete what truly is a great film.</fullReview>

The film also allowed for the viewer to draw personal inferences as to what was happening, going to happen, and did happen in the film. This helped to make the film extremely satisfactory in an entertaining sense and provided the viewer with a sense that there was much deeper meaning to be found within the movie.

		<fullReview>Should you see this movie? Definitely YES, but you have to be aware that this is a 70'es Russian movie, a classic one, but the way to tell a story is slightly different from what we are used to in the west. Not in a dramatic way, though.First of all: This is not sci-fi, not a bit! Yes they mention aliens as a possibility, but that is not important, and there is no "science" here at all. Not that it matters. Yeah, and there are "traps" but I feel this is more psychological things, not literally. In a spiritual way.On my first attempt I was bored like hell, I found the dialog to be disjointed and weird, like when the woman says "Why did you take my watch? Where are you going, I'm asking you" or later on, a character called The Writer is trying to be philosophical: "There is no Bermuda triangle. There's only a Triangle ABC that equals Triangle A-prim, B-prim, C-prim". Like he is trying to be technical in a childish way. And why did the lady drive off with his hat on the roof ?. ? Then the slowness, the not very excellent sound effects and three people seemingly getting nowhere. I switched off after nearly an hour and was ready to give it up and forget about it. I totally understand some of the bad reviews. Then I started to think and I wanted to give it another chance. No matter how bad it is, I cannot rate something I haven't fully seen, right? So the next day I sat down with an extremely open mind, played it from the beginning, paid attention to all the dialogue, tried to absorb and understand the emotions. And it paid off! I am not yet a huge fan, but somewhere in between. Definitely a decent experience. All the good outweighs the bad.The story is linear and quite easy to follow. The dialog is something else, the talk is not always very clear, but pay attention to it nonetheless. And there is use of symbolism all over the place. But look at it this way: Like a dream. You may not always understand the meaning of it all, but it affects you. Probably you will understand more deep down than you could express in words.Give it a chance, but only when you are wide awake, with an open mind, and do not expect to understand it all. Never mind the occasional weirdness ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent atmosphere/direction but meddled and unclear in many aspects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To say, this is the first and only Tarkovsky film I've seen for the time being. It was pretty damn good but it has it's faults. I'll start by saying the positive factors.The film has an excellent sinister and mysterious atmosphere/mood that is developed sublimely throughout and makes you want to keep watching. The direction from Tarkovsky as he guides through this visionary world into the Zone through the conflict and relationships between the characters is superb. The acting is also very convincing and interesting to watch as their characters develop, save for the over-the-top excessive performance from the stalker's wife. The film also creates a great deal of mystery around the Zone, through the several disappearances of past visitors as well as its unnatural forces, which is intriguingly powerful to watch. The camera-work is also simply perfect, creating many memorable and unique mixture of tracking and still shots.Now onto the negative points. The film is extremely slow paced which at times was quite compelling as it created a great deal of tension but at some points, certain scenes and shots went on for too long needlessly or became slightly dull. 2001: A Space Odyssey had a similar pace yet it never ceased to be interesting for a moment; the same cannot be said for Stalker. Now onto my biggest and most significant problem. The film, despite being well crafted for the main part, seemed like it wasn't exactly sure of what it was trying to say overall. It had a great build up and everything but concluded in an anti-climactic fashion as it didn't end on a strong note or left any last compelling or unforgettable sequences (especially in the Zone); also the journey of all the characters seemed kind of pointless by the end. I may be mistaken and may see something new in Stalker if I ever re- watch it when I'm older but for now, all I can say is it's a very well made film in many aspects but it lacks good pacing, can become often too slow and most importantly doesn't have a true point or purpose to the journey of the characters or the story itself overall. Throughout I was often compelled though but from the last part of the film and by the end I found myself going ''Was that it?'' Although I am still interested to see Tarkovsky's other work. This one - worth watching but didn't see the masterpiece that I've heard so much about. 7.5-8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a film to be seen mainly for what lies behind its curtains</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>even if those curtains include the aesthetically appealing scenes and the overall "masterfully" lets say displayed cinematography. what makes me rate an 8 at this film is the philosophical background which i find quite deep and rare. it is quite disappointing that many people with the negative critics (and some of the positive unfortunately) didn't even grasp the meaning of this film (or scratched the surface of it). here i will briefly try to explain the message of the film and i really wish people would think it twice before being naive but harsh on judging something they didn't want or couldn't understand. **contains spoilers**so we have (really briefly): the stalker , the scientist and the philosopher. the stalker leads the two men in the zone that can fulfill their desires. they all depict different aspects of human perception of things. the stalker told them a story about another stalker called by the nickname "hedgehog". a hedgehog is an animal with spikes all around it but a soft warm belly beneath. as egoistical humans act for themselves, being harsh, suspicious and taking advantage of others but good with their precious self. true self awareness is very hard to achieve. he thought he would go in the room and revive his brother. but the room saw deep in his soul and when he returned home he tragically realized his true deeper desire was to be rich and comfy. so he hung himself. the two men were discussing and thinking in the whole course but when they reached near the zone a true fear started to strike inside them. as we people avoid looking in ourselves and "our mess", the two men where afraid that the thing for which they firstly thrived so much, will reveal their true selves and desires. faith is also a key element to the whole concept. don't forget Tarkovskiy is an orthodox Christian and his, allow me to say "masterpiece", is deeply influenced by his beliefs. the protagonist, stalker is almost an idealistic figure like don quixote for example who is not willing to betray his beliefs. the raw logic/ tender belief dichotomy is emphasized through the "clash"/"meeting" of these different characters and the value of love highly exalted in a tragic world that seem hopeless to explain itself without the existence of necessities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a political statement rather than a SF movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this movie for the second time, from the political point of view, it makes a different sense to me.The ''Obama mania'' that appears after the American elections, introduced a rather forgotten political myth, myth called by Raoul Girardet ''the myth of the savior hero''.In the collective imaginary the hero possess all kinds of ''special powers'' but in reality he is only a man, a mediocre one, a man who doesn't distinguish himself from the others.This hero appears only in dystopia times with many social and financial problems, in which people are putting all their hopes.Like the savior hero of the mythology, our hero, Stalker, discovers that he has a an unusual destiny and feels that is his obligation to save the people from all the mediocrity and the trivial of the everyday life. The similarity of the Girardet hero with Stalker comes from the fact that they both belong to a family, to a civil status, to a certain special environment in which he supports the burden of the family responsibilities.In the life of an apparent quiet city or country, his apparition is a tragic one. He addresses to those who are not respecting the established order, the normal course of life and the normal course of the time. For these men he is the ''providential man'', a ''leader'' a ''savior'' or a ''guide''.The challenge and the disruption that the ''guide'' makes in the ordinary life of the 2 men, is like a withdrawal in a fantasy world in which they can dream about everything ( i.e . Nobel prize ), and with the help of this savior guide all their dreams may come true. All their self confidence is restored and together they can face all the perils of their journey.In the journey the 2 men could be compared with ''new men'', because the journey itself has a initiation role and the guide has the all the power in their initiation, for them he is a role model which amazes and captivates them, and his every word has an important resonance for them.In the end we found out that one of them wants to destroy that mythological place, which can be viewed from a pure political perspective in which a man trapped in a close society is rather a destroyer than a builder, and in a society ruled by fear, the fear is the only weapon and the only logical judgment.From this judgment i made now i gave this movie 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>His storytelling is sublime, but it needs to mature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tarkovsky's film Stalker is unusual to jaded Hollywood eyes. The average shot length in a contemporary Hollywood film is three seconds. The average shot length in Stalker is over a minute. Some shots exceed four minutes in length. Not only this unusual, but the way the story is told does not progress at the same rate we are used to blockbusters proceeding, delivering plot like a machinegun.I didn't like this film to begin with. The first time I watched it I was totally nonplussed. The second time I watched it, I was alone and I devoted three hours attention to something I found beautiful and mesmeric in its power. The visual medium is the one that Tarkovsky works in. Particularly beautiful is the shot of the underwater debris and detritus shot from the top-down. I found the use of sepia tones while outside the Zone was stylistically interesting and the use of long and careful panning to take in the surroundings was beautiful and allowed the viewer to soak up to atmosphere and mood of the film.I find Tarkovsky to be like Sergio Leone in that his storytelling needs time, needs depth to make it effective. I have heard that this film could take place in one episode of Dr Who, and I suppose that is true. But the length helps to add to the depth and the power of the beautiful visuals being displayed.Based on the novel 'Roadside Picnic' and written for the screen by the author of the novel. Fankly the film is not a patch on the novel in my opinion, but what film is? The scope and depth of a novel is only part of a problem, a novel can describe in dimensions that are inaccessible to film. A beautiful film that subverts all of the expectations one might have of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On the other hand, it's beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tarkovsky's film, based roughly on the brothers Strugatsky's novel Roadside Picnic, is not the success his more-famous Solaris is. Where the book mixed reality with elements of myth, Stalker skips the reality and goes straight for myth. The result lacks the ability to convince. The bizarre dangers of the Zone that give Roadside Picnic its color appear here only by the most indirect reference. The Stalker's terror, and his apparent fetishism over a handful of nuts and bolts, are hard to take seriously. The film is partly redeemed by stolid acting (yes, I meant stolid) and beautiful, haunting cinematography.In a way, this film is Solaris turned inside-out: not the psyche as seen by the universe, but the universe as seen by the psyche.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the second version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just in passing, it is interesting to note that this effort is the second time Tarkovsky shot the film. The first version was completely destroyed in a freak accident, and Tarkovsky had to re-shoot everything in a short time with almost no budget.His artist's eye is so acute that he was able to produce this stunning film with a budget about equal to what the average Hollywood film spends on Doritos for the Key Grip.The original was made with a much larger budget, and one wonders just how good it was, because even this version is so good.One of the great scenes ever filmed is the scene where the train comes from the opposite direction from where it is expected. Just a great effect. Tarkovsky is so good at setting up his camera to use everyday objects and settings to create scenes that other directors would create with special effects.In effect, he asks if all "special effects" are in one's mind ... which is the ongoing theme of all of his work.Another point in passing: From some angles, Alexandr Kaidanovsky, the stalker, is a dead ringer for Woody Harrelson.Powerful filmmaking. Such a shame that Tarkovsky died so young, before he got a chance to make films with the highest-grade lighting and technology.</fullReview>

It doesn't feel staged, it looks really natural.Stalker is movie with gloomy mood. The director, Andrei Tarkovsky is Ingmar Bergman fan-boy....so yeah, now you know why and I hate Ingmar Bergman, so for me Stalker is just an OK filmBut I think he made better story than Bergman, his setting and cinematography arguably better than Bergman.If you are a movie fan that interested in the history of movie, yes you should watch this.

A very convenient symbol, because God is an ardently refuted and underestimated character in this extraordinary film, and the dog represents that. He is always following the Stalker; the dog is always with him, when the Stalker needs God the most, the black dog is always next to him.&nbsp;The expressionist cinematography, common in Tarkovsky's films, depicts properly the distress, isolation, indecision and desolation of the characters, and gives the film an even darker and disturbing tone. Is a wonderfully crafted work, Tarkovsky's creative choice of making it deliberately slow kinda drags a bit but it never ceases to be a fascinating film.&nbsp;*9.5/10&nbsp;*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First Tarkovsky film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, If you ask me about Tarkovsky I will only know about this movie here. Anything else, you would have completely lost me. As a director goes he is actually pretty good, my ONE complaint is that the writing didn't really get me into it's grasp until near the very end, but no matter. When it got me into the grasp I love the questioning of the wishing. It's very Ingmar Bergman-ish (which is funny because Tarkovsky is influenced by Bergman).Here is also a warning for any sci-fi lovers who are expecting to see the CGI extravaganzas will be thoroughly disappointed. Stalker is one that leans more on the dialogue rather than what Hollywood has managed to think up (as far as which type I prefer - I'll go with neither depending on what they are).So if you like Ingmar Bergman or any other type of film where the questions are the films underlying message then I will hand this to you. I will watch more Tarkovsky in the future though, That makes it THREE directors who live up to their reputation (Ingmar Bergman, Akira Kurosawa and Andrei Tarkovsky).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Approach with care... don't forget your bolts!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tarkovsky's second science fiction entry after "Solaris" needs to be approached with a good deal of caution - just like the protagonist navigating the zone with his metal bolts in order to reach his goal, that fabled room which grants your innermost wish. There's danger lurking everywhere, but in the zone's inner sanctum there is bliss waiting - or not, depending on what you want to get out of it. For sure "Stalker" is not the regular sci-fi tale, even though it was inspired by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky's novel "Roadside Picnic", who also co-wrote the film's script. Yet Tarkovsky made something entirely different out of the material: a slow, contemplative, philosophical excursion of almost religious proportions consisting of extremely long takes. "Stalker" is a mood piece as if it had descended from another world, the zone we enter is shot in lush colors, life outside in drab black and white. In this spellbinding composition an enigma is wrapped which has prevailed until this very day...So what exactly is "Stalker" all about? Some might say: Clearly an allegory about life in the USSR. An interpretation which Tarkovsky vehemently denied, even though there's strong subtext one can hardly ignore. On the other hand the zone of "Roadside Picnic" was inspired by the nuclear disaster in Chelyabinsk of 1957 - and after Chernobyl Tarkovsky's 1979 film feels like a foreshadowing and a déj? vu at the same time. And due to its unique place between history and fiction "Stalker" sparkles with a rare kind of magic. Aside from references to nuclear catastrophes there are also numerous religious allusions put in the film, most dominant being the repeated hints at the stalker's messianic role, even though he's just a human like everyone else, who refuses to walk the path. Discussions between the main characters circle around belief and hope, freedom and purpose in life, and poetry and metaphysics wait just around the corner to knock on your door and haunt or enlighten your dreams. Well, say, what do you believe in? Approach with care... and don't forget your bolts!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Visionary and artistic parable... "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Soviet-Russian screenwriter, film editor, poet, film theorist and director Andrei Tarkovsky's fifth feature film is a loose adaptation of the short science fiction novel "Roadside Picnic" from 1971 which was written by Soviet-Russian brothers Boris and Arkady Strugatsky who also wrote the screenplay. It tells the story about "Stalker", a husband and father who lives under hard conditions in a post-apocalyptic Soviet where he works as a guide. His next assignment is to lead a writer and a scientist to a Zone strictly guarded by the Soviet military. This Zone is said to have the ability to fulfil peoples innermost desires, but in order to get there one has to be cautious and follow certain rules.This reflective and exceptional science fiction film from the late 1970s is a quietly paced and character-driven psychological and metaphysical study of the human condition which is characterized by the stringent narrative structure, the subtle and acute camera movements, the long takes and the philosophical and condensed dialog. Andrei Tarkovsky's visionary and artful parable about man's relation to it's own existence, focuses on three internal studies of character which depicts the inner struggles of a writer, a scientist and a middle-aged man who wants a better life for himself and his family, but is misled by his obsessive relationship with a place he believes has mythical powers.The otherworldly and somewhat surreal milieu depictions creates a rare aura while the marvellous black-and-white and sepia cinematography by Russian cinematographer Alexander Knyazhinsky (1936-1996) and the poignant instrumental score by Russian composer Eduard Artemyev reinforces the significant atmosphere. This cryptic and existentialistic journey through an esoteric landscape where the minds of three men converges, has engaging and empathic acting performances by Russian actors Anatoli Solonitsyn (1934-1982), Alexander Kajdanovsky (1946-1995) and Nikolai Grinko (1920-1989). This poetic, meaningful and timeless masterpiece which was shot in Russia, Tallinn and Tajikistan, gained Andrei Tarkovsky (1932-1986) the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at the 33rd Cannes Film Festival in 1980.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The search for hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Former prisoner, nicknamed Stalker, earns money by leading people into the mysterious place called "Zone". This area is protected by the police, though even policemen are afraid to enter it. In the movie Stalker guides two men, professor of physics and writer, through Zone in order to find a room that is said to make the biggest wish of a person come true. On their way, Stalker warns visitors to follow his orders, because everything in the Zone is always changing, old traps disappear and new emerge, safe spots become impassible, and they are not able return the same way they have come. The shortest way to the room is not safe therefore they have to make detours. While characters slowly move towards their destination, everything in the place indicates wild nature's victory over human beings, represented by shabby remains of human technology (hooked electricity pylons, abandoned tanks overgrown with grass, weapons drowned in the river, all kinds of scrap metal, broken glass) and several human corpses. In this hostile environment the fear of death is always present, which makes the movie even more scary than most of the horror films I have ever seen. The most interesting part of the movie for me was to follow philosophical insights of three characters, all of them being totally different in their backgrounds, having different perceptions of the world, but all of them being somehow equally desperate in their lives. The writer is disappointed with the selfishness of the mankind and regretful about the bad things he has done in the past together with his current inability to write. The physicist, who most likely has lost his job and has unsolved disputes with his former colleagues, comes to the Zone with a purpose of blowing up the magical room in order to prevent bad persons with mad wishes entering it. However, his real purpose of this act is probably to create some meaning in his life, or, what is even more likely, to kill himself. And, of course, there is the former prisoner, who has achieved nothing in his life, is unable to make the lives of his wife and a handicapped daughter at least a bit better, but tries to find the satisfaction by guiding other people, who are as hopeless as he is, to the room, and giving them hope. Several other things I liked the most about the film were its beautiful shots and creative use of colors. The black and white scenes reveal how dull and dissatisfying is Stalker's life at home, and the colorful scenery of the Zone shows the only place where he can feel happy. There are also some colorless scenes in the Zone, representing Stalker being not sure about where he should go or about the way he should act. The only colorful exception of life outside the Zone is two scenes with Stalker's daughter, but they represent not Stalker's world, but rather the more interesting life of the girl. I admire the film of being able to clarify, strengthen not only the hopes and feelings of characters, but of the spectator as well. By watching the scene in which the three characters are sitting in front of the magical room and are staring at it, I could not stop thinking about my own biggest wish in life and what it would take in order to make it come true. Though the blowing up of the room is finally not committed, it is not clear whether either the writer or the scientist has visited the room. Actually, it is not even important. One of the final scenes of the film shows prostrated Stalker lying in bed. Although all visitors came back from the Zone alive, Stalker was not able to achieve his purpose, that is giving hope to others in order to make his own life more hopeful. He accuses the two men, and the rest of the mankind, of having too little faith. Another interesting scene is the monologue of Stalker's wife. She sadly talks about her difficult life full of sorrows, but comes to the conclusion that if there weren't any sorrow in our lives, there would be no happiness either, and no hope. It seems that in the end she is the only one, who still hasn't give up hope. And, most likely, her hope is in her daughter, which, as it turns out, is not an ordinary girl at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In Tarkovsky's Zone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a typically challenging film from Tarkovsky: ponderous and bleak; demanding without being impenetrable; guilty of omphaloskepsis, certainly, but too intriguing and unsettling to be switched off. Plus it's split neatly into two bite-sized parts, so no excuses.This is true art cinema, insofar as it has the look of a dream-like video installation, whilst seeking some kind of truth about the human condition. It is also, in its own, understated way, extreme cinema: as the Stalker, the Writer and the Professor explore the mysterious "Zone", they are really exploring the outermost notions of the innermost mind.What is the Zone? Everything. Nothing. Maybe paradise. (When the trio find themselves back in the bar, one wonders whether it was all just one boozy conversation too many.) With its mist-shrouded crumbling monuments, the Zone could represent some netherworld between terra firma and enlightenment ? and our nameless protagonists are struggling to bridge the gap. The tourists are deconstructing a place that already looks literally deconstructed.Through catacombs, we follow these protagonists, sharing their fears. Does one really want to discover what he truly desires? The film seems to suggest that to access to heaven is granted only to those willing to surrender a part of their humility, and dare to become as god is.Perhaps the film is about the limitations of the human mind. The Writer and the Professor constantly argue, fight and discuss, as if trying to pluck a revelation from the earth by its roots ? but they never manage to feel, while the Stalker (the Preacher?) is destined to break down, crippled by awe. Ultimately, the Stalker fears the death of faith. It may be that the (writers) Strugatskys and (director) Tarkovsky are proposing the necessity of faith to fill the gaps in our minds that cannot be filled with terrestrial philosophy.Finally, fans of Half-Life 2 may find some interesting comparisons in Stalker's grim communistic dystopian cityscape, and subsequent escape to the eerie hills, with their dilapidated barns, full of muddy puddles and the plastic corpses of consumerism. Don't expect the gunplay of Gordon Freeman's adventure; do expect to see stark parallels in landscape and ambiance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i was reminded of this film after watching the remake of Solaris because the original was associated with it in some cult showing on late night TV. I all ways read the best and worst reviews after i watch a movie just to see if i missed anything such as the plot or point.stalker appears to have attracted the criticism of boring and praise for its subtlety. it is long, the pace is slow and the conclusions subtle. those expecting the rush of an espresso should best stick to the classic Hollywood formula movie but even those of us who like the quirky or the curious may find stalker a little too slow, too long and plot too simple. But i do remember it 20 years on and there are themes and images from it that have haunted me since.the remake of Solaris was far more glossy with tight editing and short but it failed to satisfy and perhaps if it had the gentle pace of stalker where the characters grow on you and the environment and atmosphere slowly seduces the viewer it would have been better.and that is the issue, we have been trained by the 90-120 minute movie format to the point that we find it difficult to accept something quite different. don't get me wrong; the classic movie format works really well it is just that it is a little like approaching art. pictures used to have to be paintings of real things and then abstract and surreal and modern art appeared on the scene. Some people think it is just pretentious nonsense and some babble enthusiastically about the groundbreaking nature of the work.There are some artists, in movie making, whether writers or directors who are completely up their own bottom but that should not be a criticism solely directed at the art house movie maker, the latest King Kong remake is proof of that, but even if a movie is pretentious it should not matter if it works and Stalker does work it just does it in an unfamiliar way. Only i am not to sure if its up to me to make it work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, if all you listen to is rock music, then maybe Beethoven's 3rd Symphony is tedious. Why not throw in John Coltrane's "Love Supreme"? Is that tedious? Or is it you just don't have the skills to decipher what you are experiencing?There is a visual language, showcased in the best films, that is decipherable. Tarchovsky, along with many Soviet/Russian directors, is one of the true masters of VISUAL language. Unlike the Hollywood penchant for mere storytelling -Spielberg being a good representative of that school- Tarchovsky (and other much maligned filmmakers like Fellini, Antonioni, or Bergman, for instance) is concerned with conveying information visually. It's stunning and emotional. Alas, it is not easy.For a good description of film as visual language as opposed to storytelling, read "Hitchcock/Truffaut". Hitchcock is quite clear that film is a VISUAL medium. If you listen to the dialogue of a Hitchcock movie, you'll find that no important information is delivered via dialogue. Hitchcock delivers information visually. That you don't notice it is indicative of Hitchcock's art. Tarchovsky takes this type of visual cinema to uncompromising heights. Yes, it's difficult but NOT tedious. In fact, I can think of nothing more exciting that watching the great visual artists of cinema; and the work of Tarchovsky has to be considered some of the greatest ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The meaning of life and so...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having read the novel "roadside picnic" I just HAD to get the movie. Solaris was also already in my possession, so I did have a little expectation what I would have to face while watching STALKER. Even though I adore Tarkovsky's work I was missing some parts that (in my opinion) wouldn't have ruined the movie - like examples about what COULD happen in the Zone if you are not prepared enough. Not that it should have had a thrilling addition by putting corpses of "unsuccessful stalkers" into the scene, but only some signs or one more person that would get lost or overrun by some "zone-force" in his quest for the room.Brilliant about the book was the fact, that the scenario is being presented throught different eyes of characters: smugglers, stalkers, even a taxi driver... it's not being told by the typical "writer's view" that shows us mainly what's happening around the zone through god-like eyes. You put the world together very puzzle-like 'cause you are not introduced, no "once upon a time...", the story starts without description of the situation - you learn about it by learning about the characters and their work.Now, the movie too is the story of just "someone" (mixture between the guy in the book and someone else) living nearby the zone, making his money with it like hundreds of luck-hunters do - he does it by stalking. The movie is somehow like the first and the last chapters of the book being fit together: you're in the zone all the time - in the book you're mostly AROUND the zone, looking at people that are somehow involved in this fictinous situation.The thrill in the movie is only theoretically because you never experience in real how dangerous the zone really is. The stalker is kinda nervous all the time and describes possible traps, but you never see them. All the phantastic things have been erased for the movie. In the end, it's a very deep outworked answer to the question what people would do, if they could make their deepest desires, their biggest need - no fairytale wishes, no "I want a TV"-thoughts - come true... I think that - only regarding the story - the movie could have easily become a little more thrilling just by adding more proof of the dangerous forces like transcripted in the novel without losing the philosophical sources. Nevertheless - despite the very tragic, calm and deeply sad russian mood - it's a damn good movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think the movie could be anything less than 160 minutes--it would be a completely different film. I think that's the difference between a mood-oriented film (like this one) and a plot oriented film. There isn't too much of a plot, but that isn't the point.Personally, I find Tarkovsky's films spell-binding (and I have a short attention span!), and cherish the opportunity to just immerse myself in a different world for a few hours.Also, I find his films fascinating for the simple fact they were Soviet-made, and come from a different cultural perspective. I've read that Tarkovsky had problems with the Soviet censors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Expect hours of endless philosophical and sociological rambling. Things like out of nowhere a character starts blethering 'why do we enjoy music? do we really need it?'... Except for a young teenager encountering this for the very first time (to whom I intend no disrespect), many of us will have passed this kind of talk years ago, and is not anything profound, but supremely trite. Repeat ad nauseum.The idea of 'Zones' is a good one, but their unusualness is not displayed. And while there are a couple of lines about people having suffered because of, and in, the Zone, none of that fear is conveyed well. Characters staring past the camera for minutes is not the same as building suspense, tension or fear.Aside from a rather flat confessional from the 'stalker' at one point, the film's characters do not seem to have any substantial reason to enter the Zone. Nor is there any wider context, of the Zones, the town, other townsfolk, etc, anything that might help you care at all why 3 guys go into a dangerous, restricted area.This film is pointless (and a sad waste of good source material in the book). Basically three guys you won't care about enter a Zone, stare blankly a lot, pontificate insufferably, then the film ends. At last.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Tarkovsky brilliance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stalker may not be my favourite of Andrei Tarkovsky's films, that belongs to Andrei Rublev, which is from personal opinion the greatest Soviet film ever made. It's also not his most accessible(Ivan's Childhood), if anything only Solaris is more divisive. However Stalker is still an outstanding film, it loses momentum ever so slightly at the end but not enough for it to hurt the film.As with all Tarkovsky films, Stalker is brilliantly made. It is grittier and more muted in colour than with his other films, but still maintains that hypnotic dream-like quality that the cinematography in his films have. The scenery is evocatively atmospheric, mundane but in a good way. Tarkovsky's direction again is nigh-on impeccable, showing a mastery of visuals and mood. Stalker is hauntingly scored but never in a too obvious way, while of all his films to me it was Stalker that had the most thought-provoking writing. Not all of it is easy to understand at first but a lot of the lines really makes one think a long while after. The story is not for everyone, with some finding the deliberate pacing too much for them but the storytelling is actually very suspenseful and there is a chilling atmosphere throughout, the film is slow but the suspense, atmosphere and cinematography kept this viewer glued to the seat. The acting's of the kind with the actors having times where they don't say a lot or anything but their body language, eyes and expressions communicate an awful lot, which is every bit as powerful as when speaking.Overall, an outstanding film if not Tarkovsky's best or most accessible. If you are a fan of Tarkovsky, or at least familiar with him ,you shouldn't have too much trouble getting into Stalker. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is not as frightening as the poster appears to be. The movie is a landmark in Editing. The movie is shot in color and few scenes are shot in Black-and-white and tinted with a silver-gray texture that adds to the artistic and surreal effect of the movie.I felt the movie was a drag in the first half with several scenes deliberately shot for longer durations but that gave me ample time to observe, experience and appreciate the brilliant cinematography. The movie has some brilliant shots of camera that draws a thin margin between figments of imagination and reality. The movie has a euphonious background theme.The men risk their lives to reach the 'Zone'. As the three men reach the 'Zone', an inhabited land with an ancient myth of granting one's innermost wish, disparate views emerge and each one confronts the other two. The men are convinced of their perception of 'The room' while the Stalker is still skeptical and rubbishes their thoughts. The evidence for existence of the myth is left for the viewers to judge.A movie that reminds me of the works of the harbinger of the genre Fantasy, Ingmar Bergman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes, when I watch movies like STALKER I am asking myself, where all the revolutionary directors from the Soviet Union have gone. Comparing this movie to modern Russian movies (and let's face it, most of modern Hollywood movies)is like comparing a Shakespeare play to the Twilight books. Tarkowsky manages to create an atmosphere of suspense and danger, which is present in the zone, without any special effects. Until the very end you never understand whether there really is something supernatural in the Zone at all, or whether it is all part of the character's minds. Thereby it diverts from the Novel by the Strugatsky Brothers, but does it in a good way. A masterpiece of international cinematic art!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A work of art; truly captures part of human nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very odd film in the sense that very little happens yet simultaneously almost too much happens to keep track of; The plot is fairly simple, a group of people move from point A to point B then back to point A again. However throughout this long journey(almost three hours i think) reality, purpose, existence, desires, and fears are discussed in an oddly matter of fact casual manner. This combined with the sci-fi twist of "The Zone" makes for a truly bazaar but fascinating film.For me the film taking place in "The Zone" truly made the movie. The Zone is shrouded in mystery; there is no explanation to what it is, where it came from, or what the dangers of it are. Yet this eerie setting is the ideal place to examine something even eerier and more mysterious: people.There is little or no character development but yet by the end of the film you truly feel as if these characters have shown you a part of their souls.There were two things i disliked about this film: the beginning and the end. The beginning because there is a very long scene where the camera never moves, there is no dialog, and very little action. It is just not a good way to pull a viewer into a film. I also disliked the very end where the little girl is moving objects with her mind; It does not seemingly relate to anything else that has happened in the film and greatly contrasts the rest of the film in the sense that there is little apparent meaning.If it sounds interesting from what you have read here, then watch it; i recommend it as a good movie to watch while getting better from a hangover.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece or failure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are just two different ways of cataloging this film: a beautiful, poetic masterpiece, or a big failure from one of the most artistic director of all the times. Yes, both affirmations from above can be quite true. 1. Masterpiece. For an art lover, or a good connoisseur of Tarkovsky's films, this movie comes floating like a dove on the water. The techniques used here are never the less brilliant, and Tarkovsky-an, if I can say that?There are moments in the film that makes you say: STOP, rewind, PLAY it again?and again..and again..and again!!! Even for me, with so many art movies that I've seen in my life, this one is difficult to fully comprehend. I've read the novel that this movie is based on, before seeing the movie, BUT, Tarkovsky doesn't follow the book too much, so it didn't really help me understand it?Oh well, after seeing it the fifth time, I can say that I have a better idea than the first timeJ 2. Failure. Closed, hermetic, snobby, pretentious, boring ..etc. All those adjectives can be found in so many reviews about this film, and is quite understandable why. Tarkovsky did want YOU to understand so easy, he wanted to make YOU think about it, more and more?and in the end to still have more questions?Comparing with all the other films by Tarkovsky, Stalker stands up as the most `difficult' one, and maybe that's why most of the critics are having hard time recognizing its true value!I have just one recommendation: watch the movie alone, in a dark room, with tons of volume from your receiver (get the 2 DVD version, with the newly re-mastered 5.1 sound). Watch it in one night, and then the second night do the same. Then take a pause of 2-3 days, and do it AGAIN!! After that MAYBE you can comprehend what this movie is all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stalker Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw Stalker, an (almost?) legendary movie by Andrei Tarkovsky. As far as technique is concerned, the movie is defined by long poetic shots which are dominated by still image and rarely dialog, almost never sound or movement. Things are quiet and the director even employs mute shots from time to time, making the few `noisy' parts (like the waterfall) remarkable because of their very rarity. The entire film is a string of visual marbles with some results of outstanding power and charm, like the brownish, oily, contorted paint from the stalker's room, the fall of the `writer' into the bed of plants when dodging the bullets, the running dog, the black fountain of oil in which a stone is dropped, the flour silo. The movie begins with a very `ugly' scene. The color (black &amp; white at this point, very brownish and dark though), the textures and the props make this opening scenes some of the `dirtiest' I have ever seen in a movie. The still camera shoots a bar with the barman opening the place, a customer entering and being served and the bar tender leaving the customer alone drinking a coffee and staring at the camera. We then move to the stalker's (one of the main and nameless characters) room, where he with his wife and daughter are sleeping in the same bed in what must be one of the most beautiful and warm of all the rooms that should, in all rights, look nothing less than grotesque. The empty spaces, the huge, poorly painted wall, the poverty, the primitive looking doors, all filmed in very dark nuances are simply made to look splendid and not at all repulsive. Soon follows what I consider to be the weakest point of the movie, the hopelessly fake whining of the wife on the floor. The plot is somewhat classical: the search for hope, for believe, for ones true self, for redemption, any or all of these. It is immediately clear that `The Zone' is not the central thing here, it's just a symbol. All the traveling and the searching are done inside the mind, and this is valid for all the characters, except maybe the daughter, which is the least shown and most mysterious of them. As for what the zone is, it is hinted at first and then clearly shown (`The Room' is the core of a nuclear reactor) that it's ground zero of a nuclear disaster. It is an inverted situation that hope and redemption are looked for by entering the place of disaster, not leaving it. It is also ironic that the `cursed ground' is well guarded by police. This, I think, has something to say (though I'm not sure what) about the realities of living in an oppressive and dictatorial regime, suggesting that looking for the truth (artistically or otherwise) is a subversive action in a world of censorship and brutality. The supernatural and deadly qualities of `The Zone' are much talked about, but never really shown to exist, suggesting once more that all the searching that matters is in the mind. Wreckage and even corpses are shown, but there is no reason to believe that they are not there because of the nuclear explosion. This is a travel of discovery, and like the traditional initiating travels, it has its mythical elements: the point of no return, when the railway carriage is set to go back without passengers, the various tests and trials, the `messenger' from the other side (the dog). As they move on, the stalker constantly talks about `The Zone' as if being alive and he keeps ranting about the perils of not staying on course. The feeling of danger is helped by the very tall grass as any holes in the ground could not be seen and by the care with which they advance. The deserted buildings, the half collapsed structures give an industrial look to the scene, even if surrounded by lush, impossible green vegetation. Effects of radiation do not seem to be present, but this is a very metaphorical movie and we should not expect all these details to match or be realistic. One technique used by the director is the employing of both black and white and color shooting. The most significant passage from one system to another is when they first enter `The Zone'. After filming for several good second close-ups of the faces and heads of the three passenger of the small railway carriage in bleak black/white images he makes us hungry for a wide shot, of any kind, playing with our anticipation and curiosity to see `The Zone'. Soon after, we are served a beautiful color scene, dominated by the green of nature, the nature of `The Zone'. What is also classical about this quest for inner discovery and for new hope is the fact that three man embark on it, not knowing each other, each with his own agenda and each one's personality and motive being gradually exposed to his peers as they advance towards their destination. The stalker quickly emerges as the greatest believer in all the powers of `The Zone' and a preacher of these. The `writer' is the skeptical and the `professor' is the mysterious one. His motivation remains completely hidden until the end. The first moment when the director hints that the `The Zone' and its powers might be inside the stalker head is at the waterfall, where he and the `writer' walk in a circle and rejoin the `professor' and the stalker interprets this banal thing as a grave matter. This is when we are first offered a clear indication that he might just be imagining it. In fact, the stalker believes and, as we'll be shown later, needs to believe, so much that he becomes a manipulator and a deceiver. He deceives the `writer' into going first into a place he considers to be very dangerous, presumably for the purpose of making sure the `writer' is worthy of visiting `The Room', the final destination of their journey, the place supposed to make whishes happen. The stalker behaves in this as some kind of servant creature of `The Zone'. We will be shown in the end that he is, as a matter of fact, totally dependant (in an almost pathological way) of the `The Zone' and the need to believe in it, or in what it represents. This condition of his is not hinted at so strongly in the beginning. A very important scene and a very clear message from the director is when they rest near the waterfall and in a puddle of water are shown, sequentially and clearly, symbols of the main elements of the human civilization: an industrial tool, a syringe, a weapon and a religious icon. All three travelers are anti heroes. When they reach `The Room' one is shown to be a `creature' of `The Zone', one a cynical non believer and one, the silent `professor', intends to blow up the entire thing with a mini nuclear device, motivated by revenge and intrigue. A very nice post modernist touch is the phone that rings and they answer mechanically and tell the caller a mistake has been made. In the end, a heated argument and fight follows, each traveler exposing his true motivation for being there and arguing his case. The `professor' decides not to blow up `The Zone', but this does not save it from death: it is dead, fake, by this time, in the heads of all, including us, with the sole exception of the stalker. This is why he is the stalker: he is the only true believer, because he is the only one which can not live without this faith. The others were driven by petty reasons; he is the only one who will take it without question, the `priest' of the `The Zone'. There is a superb scene after they stop arguing and fighting where rain starts falling on `The Room', the reactor core. The pool of water already there is stirred by the rain drops and the reactor fuel bars centimeters bellow the surface become invisible and the entire things almost reminds of spring and innocence. This is the innocence they've been searching (the director clearly states that innocence is one of the targets, through the words of the stalker, somewhere around the middle of the journey). Beautiful as it might be, it lasts only seconds and the reactor bars show their ugly heads again. They make it back, their return trip not shown. They are together for the last time in the bar, not satisfied, not men who found what they were looking for. At home, the stalker has a crisis, feeling that his believe is not shared by anyone. He is comforted by his wife. Unlike the mirror jobs of `The Zone', the movie ends in true, unambiguous miracle. The infirm daughter of the stalker proves to have the power of telekinesis, though none knows this. This might very well be a message from the director that the entire zone hype is false, and all the searching is done in the wrong way and for the wrong thing. All in all this is a superb film, in which the poetry of the shots is outstanding and the idea of the plot is a fundamental one, a driving force in the human psyche. Every shot has its purpose, often more than one. It is a film very worth seeing, and from some respects (visual achievements and poetry of image) a masterpiece.</fullReview>

Even the dialogues, although sometimes long, are to the point and sometimes caustic for the viewer.What impressed me the most was this unique scene where the three of the characters are in the room which is full of water and the camera shots from a distance of 20 meters. It rains and raindrops come down from the holes on the roof disturbing the water. It is a bit dark. When the rain stops light comes in from a window opposite to the camera and deflects on the now calm water filling the room with light.Even for todays standards this would have been impressive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is of course a cinematic masterpiece, being made by the great Tarkovsky. The film is utterly hypnotic although not as spellbinding as Solaris. Just as Tarkovsky criticized Soviet Russia´s obsession with science and reason, he makes a good try at negating objective reality in this film as well. While trying to make a case of the need for spirituality in modern time he erases any notion of objective metaphysics. He then becomes a henchmen for the Soviet´s; not as a mystic of the muscle, but as a mystic of the spirit. The result of his philosophy is (whether he knew it or not), not a satire of Soviet society, but of objective reality. Ironically that leads to the same politics as the one he tried so subliminally to criticize. This fact gave me a bitter aftertaste to an otherwise cinematic masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow-breathing cinema tackling the big targets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film seven years ago on DVD. Don't do this yourself. Stalker is a film that needs a big screen. Not a mammoth, IMAXy, peripheral vision-saturating screen. Just something that allows the film its breadth of composition, its 160 minute, grand-themed, fog-drift poetry the space it needs to work.Stalker is a film about many things. It's about tension - the hope afforded by the Room at the centre of a mysterious Zone that grants all wishes and a very human reticence to use it. It's about faith - the persuasive certainty of the zealot which is bizarrely limp in practise... and it's about art, where the creative individual beats a path where religious conviction falters.It's also a film that uses the viscera of modern industry to help make its point. The landscape of Stalker could be the industrial slag plain of communist-dreg Russia or a war zone. It's equally an allegory for the conflict within a man's heart for the bucolic beauty and mystery, and the pride of industrial advancement and convenience.Tarkovaky shoots this all in black and white and then colour. But the black and white also has subtle filters and the colours also glow and shift with a livid dynamism. This all happens at the slow and settled pace of exhalation, of meditation. The images are beautiful, not least on the faces of the three fine actors and the other characters who bookend the bulk of the film.It's not a slow film though, be careful. The film moves at the speeds it needs to state its purpose. The opening keystone cop car chase is bizarre and frenzied but only to say these two things. After this the expansiveness increases to accommodate the density of the content and argument. Latter in-camera image tricks are thunderclap-coups at this meticulous pace. It's also funny, as vital a component as the deep breaths of the cinematography itself.The final tableau is a consequently concentrated parable, almost unbearably condensed. It's a fine film 8/10</fullReview>

It is our tradition to make deep as ocean films without insane cuts, deadly stunts, CGI, ruthless action, menacing aliens, wild explosions, bed scenes, etc. When I watch modern Russian movies and new wave of animation my organism refuses to accept them. It all goes on an unconscious level. Maybe, because bright lollipop-like flashy TV features are not our cup of tea. I hear people say something like: "Wow! A great cartoon, like "Nemo". Finally we make it properly!" Nonsense, to my mind. "Alisa" cartoons were great because they were so Russian-flavoured, so unique. And that's where the problem is. We always should keep our own route. If we try to make it in a western sort of way, we fall flat. We can (could, to be more exact?) create brilliant examples of entertaining cinema (cf. "Volga-Volga"), we can (could as well, alas?) create stunning sci-fi features ("Kin-Dza-Dza"), we can (again, could, damn it!?) create wonderful films for children ("Buratino") and I hope we still can make Russian films, which won't make us blush with shame in future. Our country has gone through too much gore and misery to just copy western culture. "Stalker" shows and emphasizes our genuine tradition and ability in film-making, the ability to create slow psychological dramas that go far beyond the reach of a common WYSIWYG TV. "Stalker" is an uneasy film to sit through but It definitely leaves a deep mark on the list of best movies created during the era of film-making. And if a movie is followed by a trail of sad happenings (it reminds me of "Rosemary's Baby"), then it also matters. Life is no laughing matter wherever a Russian sci-fi drama is on.Pointless nature of science and literature devoid of faith. Man without faith resembling an empty dustbin collecting pieces of... Not very common subjects for cinema, especially for modern movies, I guess.10 out of 10, though I cannot say that I enjoy the movie very much - I just certify that it is an outstanding achievement in film-making with a very heavy Russian sign upon it (globalization is given a finger). Thank you for attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning, but overlong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a brilliant movie in many ways. The visuals are stunning and haunting. Several of the scenes will remain imprinted on your memory forever. The script is literate and thought-provoking. Like any great work of art, it is not pedantic, but open to interaction with the viewer.If it were 90 minutes long, it might be the greatest movie ever made. Unfortunately, it is 160 minutes long, and the extra footage can be tedious beyond belief and seems to do nothing to further the story or enhance the mood.Tarkovsky makes every point with a sledgehammer, never with a scalpel. This can be supernaturally effective. It can also impel you to yell "get on with it" or "you already said that" at the screen.I view this film as a great achievement, and yet a failure in that Tarkovsky's acquaintance with Western literature apparently did not include an encounter with the phrase "brevity is the soul of wit". As great as it is, how great might it have been!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually stunning sci/fi drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved "Solaris" so I was quite curious about Tarkovsky's "other" sci-fi film, "Stalker", especially because I'd previously read "The Roadside Picnic", the book on which this movie is based. A terrific book, by the way. "Stalker" isn't quite as good as "Solaris" (or the book) but head above shoulders in relation to the vast majority of other sci-fis and dramas. Like "Solaris" it is slow (a tad too slow at times), quite lengthy, visually brilliant, and philosophical. But not to worry ? I don't mean the kind of fortune-cookie philosophical moralizing you'd find in a piece of trash like "Good Will Hunting". (The Zone is a strictly Hollywood-morons-free zone.) The dialogue is oftentimes fascinating, the only problem with it being that perhaps there should have been more of it. The silent scenes do tend to drag a bit. (Maybe Tarkovsky admires Bergman's early non-event movies too much; I personally can't stand him.) One of the few films in which the b&amp;w-to-colour transition makes sense and works well.</fullReview>

I've read the Bible, for example. Now THAT is slow. But it's also GOOD. And that's the problem with this film: it is slow AND bad. I suspect that this is what people who call it slow are really complaining of. The "philosophy" or "meditation" of the characters in this film is trite and full of bathos. It's straining for deepness, and many a viewer will constantly feel this strain. Almost every monologue or long exchange is weepy and overdone. The story would be much better captured by a novelist. Some people, apparently, are content to watch a bunch of mesmerizing images flicker by on a screen, but that's not enough for me...so I didn't like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read the awe-struck reviews claiming that this is the greatest science fiction film of all time. Well, it's not. I hardly classify it as science fiction either, although I suppose it qualifies technically. A better genre would be 'slow existential art-house'.A film may be frozen in time but still needs to appeal to an audience that currently exists. Classics can do this, but this film definitely does not. Few will have the patience for this film with its self-indulgent, ages-long shots, terribly mismatched sound effects and long and boring scenes without plot or character development.Having said that, connoisseurs of truly obscure projects from Eastern bloc countries decades ago may find some value in learning about what niche audiences once may have put up with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the room</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film years ago and at that time it did not leave me with any strong impressions except perhaps a few memorable images. My first (mental) words after seeing it this summer were not, I imagine, that uncommon ("what the ..."). It definitely takes time for this to settle down.Well, to the point. There's no entertainment value in this film (see below for a brief discussion) and for all I can tell it has no meaningful plot / message / idea or any other rational explanation. Following his eerie, sometimes near inhuman intuition, the director builds the visual field to become a unique kind of psychological tool, a mindscan, in which scenes, sounds, colours, long monologues, all serve as cues to instigate and transform both conscious (reflective) and subconscious mental responses from the viewer. Thus, the metaphor of the room where something deep and crucial about one's self can be discovered, crosses the boundary of the film and becomes a reality in the viewer's own perception.And that is of course, why Stalker totally fails (no, fails isn't the right word - it's never intended to be - does not work) as an entertainment, semi intellectual or otherwise. It's like a dark room in which mirrors, prisms and windows are all carefully set up to create fantastic combinations of colours, shades and shadows when lit up by a flashlight. Enter it with a light of your own, or, if came to be entertained, prepare for a long and extremely slow sequence with almost nothing connecting to the traditional genre of science fiction.Does the film answer any questions? The only point I could get is that one cannot carry away neither more nor less than they already have/are - and it may take a lifetime to find out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No repeat of the brilliance of Solyaris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was stunned by Tarkovsky's other famous sci-fi philosophical meditation Solyaris. Comparisons between Solyaris and Stalker are natural because of the genre and auteur.Tarkovsky proves again that he is a master of the visual and each frame is preplanned with the whole flowing seamlessly from seam to seam with long and languorous takes. Like Solyaris, Stalker is a deep, meditative work and a superficial first viewing is probably not enough to understand the significant themes of the film. I have only just finished seeing Stalker for the first time and it may grow on me. However, my first impression while watching Solyaris was intense interest coupled with a longing to understand more about this marvelous, enigmatic film after it is was over. In the case of Stalker I really had to plod through it at times. It was visually stunning but not beautiful. The characters may have been more autobiographical for Tarkovsky but they did not arouse empathy.There are may visual similarities between Solyaris and Stalker and if you've seen one, you can automatically detect the same visual style in the other. In Stalker, the scenes in the real world - first 20 and last 10 minutes - were black &amp; white while the zone was filmed in color. The real world was cold, grey and ugly and in many cases e.g. the tunnel, so was the zone. The Stalker did not have the presence or the sadness in his eyes that the lead of Solyaris did which I see as another major shortcoming. I will want to let my viewing of Stalker sink in over the next few days and may change my opinion, so this is just an immediate reaction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovely String of Soliloques in Which the Film's Subject is Actually Irrelevant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stalker, like most of Tarkovsky's work, is almost unsurpassed in visual quality and sensory aesthetics. Also in-keeping with the great director's tradition, the film features a lot of philosophical discourses delivered in sombre, almost depressingly serious tones, and exploits ambiguity very well.Stalker develops a cyberpunk atmosphere but is much more than the standard cyberpunk adventure. A Stalker is a person who can find the path into the Zone and is able to bring people back from it. The Zone is a forbidden place from which most people never return. It is rumored to grant those who can reach it their most profound desire. Most of the film takes place en route to the Zone, detailing the journey of three men - a science professor, a writer, and our stalker. The acting is superb.Every scene is a work of art and the minimalist soundscape and very heavy dialog complement the visuals very well. The film's setting is a major component of its themes. The setting was inspired by an abandoned town which suffered a nuclear accident in the 1950s, and it seems likely that the film was actually made in that same location. Tarkovsky makes a point in this film, and unlike many art films, the point is really not very open to interpretation. It is also a little surprising given the content of most of the film. No spoiler - so I won't tell you what it is. Despite the fact that I recommend Stalker very highly for thoughtful viewers with good attention spans, I can not recommend it to the average film watcher - it can be tedious and confounding to those used to films which do not challenge the intellect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the most erebral' science-fiction film ever made, but also one of the rarest to challenge perceptions and stimulate the senses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stalker is, based on the amount of science-fiction films I have seen yet, or at least those that could be considered true to whatever can be considered part of the genre, maybe the talkiest, the one with the least amount of any kind of action, and one that moves at a pace that might make Godard a little squirmy in his seat. These however are all positives for director Andrei Tarkovsky's goals with what could be considered a masterpiece, to use the term once again. It's a dense film, but within this density layers of interest that many of today's science-fiction films wouldn't even think to consider much less attempt are present and alive. Its visual prowess is another big piece of what makes Stalker such a triumph. Never do we get cuts too quick or shots that go by in the blink of an eye, far from it. Tarkovsky is putting the audience through long shots, as in surpassing five minutes, give or take a minute, and the craft is hypnotic; he uses his skills very simply in pans and tilts and subtle zoom-ins and outs, and there's even a few shots, like the pan up in close-up over the un-real/real objects in the river with metaphorical significance leading to the hand, that are some of the most haunting in all of cinema.It's not an easy trip through what is actually a very simple premise: a stalker, Aleksandr Kajdanovsky, is going to take a writer and a philosopher through the dangerous terrain to the zone, where anything innermost in said person can be realized. Aside from the surpassing of the guarded gates into the entrance, where there are gun-shots and the like, Tarkovsky isn't interested in "action" things happening, but themes expressed squarely through narrow, representative characters and mood. This mood is one that is wrong if looking at the back of the video box, which compares the ambiance and realm of science fiction to that of Blade Runner. In the sense of it breaking clichés, sure, it's similar, but that's really all on a shallow level. Tarkovsky's design for the picture is tantamount to being hyper stylized, but never too noticeable in the sense of it looking 'fake'. There may be a moment or two where the zone does look like a ZONE from a not-quite nuclear fall-out, like the one room with sandy dunes on the floor. But it's also right out of Russia, with industry and decay of the period all in direct view. The hopelessness is conveyed not just through the humorlessness of the characters, but in the zone itself, which looks like it's been not constructed completely by the crew.I was originally spurned on to see it not only because of seeing Tarkovsky's Solaris and Andrei Rublev- the former also an experimental feat of intelligent, emotionally complex sci-fi- but because of a couple of clips featured in the documentary The Pervert's Guide to Cinema. In it, Zizek uses Stalker to describe how there can be a world, or a form of a world, where the ideal of Godlessness is given full form into a world without belief, and where decay and industrialization are all there can be seen. But then there is also the 'Zone', which is also in line with the idea of there being order, of hope, yet also the total despair in getting something otherworldly. Does the Zone need human beings as much as human beings need the zone? Questions like these, as well as what it means to be a creator of art, as the writer goes to lengths describing, in a post-apocalyptic environment, or what it is to actually enter into an alien construct, or what may be an alien construct, as what may be illusion is stronger than that becoming a reality, or what the stalker has in responsibility to himself, others, and humanity at large, come up repeatedly. So, at the least, Stalker can't be considered as a work without a thought process to it. Quite the contrary, there's even a poetry to all of the thoughts and visuals that keep coming up, be they through the conversations on the way to the Zone, or in that "climax" on the precipice of the "Room" where the potential of destruction comes at a heavy price following all that's happened. Tarkovsky even tops himself from Solaris by making human need and suffering and, as a human construct, the fantastical imaginings of what is "out there" as here, paramount and affecting. Fear, greed and ego, and a desire for some minor level of any sense of peace through whatever medium is available, is what Tarkovsky suggests and prods, but never outright answers; it comes as a great shock and relief at the end, when the boy Monkey shows an unusual 'moment' at the table. This being said, Stalker won't be for everyone, surely not the Star Wars geeks looking for pomp and circumstance against motifs out of the old West. It might even feel too long and plodding by those who put 2001 at the top of their favorite movie lists. But it also has an astonishing appeal to those who may gravitate to it, where ideas and scenery, reflections on society and a specific take on a dark alternate future, get at a very high level of sophistication and artistry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, the story of a "Zone" that makes your deepest, most unconscious wishes come true is one that holds magical possibilities, but you won't find most of them here. Someone else has already called this film tedious and pretentious, and I agree. Actually, not to call "Stalker" pretentious would almost be an insult to Tarkovsky himself! (He even brought up the subject of why music touches our souls at one point). And not to call it tedious would be the same as kidding yourself; the film is downright unbearable at times, and probably always deliberately so. Moments of beauty and revelation do exist (like the realization of the true nature of "The Room"), but they are few and far between. Mostly the film will try your patience by having its three characters accomplish in more than two hours what they could've accomplished in less than 40 minutes. The ending is mega-disappointing.

		<fullReview>The movie starts in black and white. The Zone has been cordoned off by the military and police. It's an area affected by something unknown or aliens or a meteor. Within the Zone lies a Room where wishes are granted. The Stalker is a man with special attributes who guides others into the room. His wife pleads for him to stop. He leads the Writer and the Professor into the Zone. The movie gains its colors after crossing the police blockage. The questioning Writer wants to regain his inspiration. The Professor is quiet and more concerned about his backpack.This is for people who love reading long, depressing, poetic Russian novels. The premise is very fascinating but it is way too slow and too long for me. I lost interest after the movie gains its colors and the three characters wonder forever in the Zone. It's a lot of long quiet scenes and dialog that doesn't interest me. It takes too long to get to the Room. I guess it is suppose to transmit the time and difficulty of the journey but I find it repetitive. I need it to have a much tighter middle.</fullReview>

Some silent films have been able to say more about the human condition with constraints that this film did not face. It seems to have a message, but unlike Waiting for Godot - which is the only comparable work I've seen - it does not exploit it's medium. Waiting for Godot invites endless speculation about interpretation, but is entertainment in itself. With Stalker, Tarkovskiy somehow manages the opposite - there is some wonderful imagery, but slow laboured intensity generally without fulfilment - a painting would offer more because of its sensory constraints. The film moves through a succession of imagery linked by character and dialogue. What does it all mean? By the end of the film I didn't really care.</fullReview>

Then I remembered Tolstoy's description of the unfreezing of the land at the beginning of spring, how it seems to happen in an instant.Years later, I played the computer game called STALKER. Wonderful environment and atmosphere. I was entranced by the background world, even as I fought my way through the Zone around Chernobyl.The film, I found, explained something about the computer game (obviously the film was an inspiration for the game). Not the Zone and the pseudo mystical stuff, but the Russian land. Something about that annual regeneration after the harsh winter. And, I suppose, something also about the Russian character.Is that good? I'm a writer. What slips through despite the artist's control is always worth something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many other Tarkovsky film, this comes to no surprise that THE STALKER, is as epic, thought provoking, and lingering like a fluttering leaf(falling from a 899ft. tree) to the ground--as Solaris. It's effortless on bestowing great cinematography and venerable acting--but it leaves a first time viewer yearning for some answer, leaving him/her lacking, intrigue--aghast, and indignant. Thitherwards the director--or of how it manages to reveal your true patience--you can't help but try to blame the films ineptitude on something, or somehow.Now I may be jumping the gun here, for i'm only at an age where I endure life to an extent, and not to it's fullest(i'm 19)--and the film exposes subjects that I am not use to enduring in a film(except I have seen Tarkovskys' Andrei Rublev, and Solaris--this is by far, in my opinion, one of the most nastiest, when it comes to length)--and I may be jumping the gun here as well--for I've just seen the movie once--albeit on Video(So you can imagine of how I strayed away from society and the outside world--just to stay focuse and inert at this film!). But one can be sure--the effects of the director's intention (on setting fear on the MEAT GRINDER, and other 'use your imagination' traps in the ZONE) fell flat on making me believe. Now in some films--i can only think of THE BLAIR WITCH for now--that danger used in a fashion of cloaking itself sable mystery--leaving the viewer to fend for his/her-self on envisioning what the hell they're scared off--might work. But in STALKER--it felt as if the director is abusing it's prowess--knowing that the people formidably knows him as a story teller to things provocative, intellectual, things made that of the true nature of clandestine objects--that he can just exploit that power and gives us 'dogs', or 'the meat grinder'.I don't know, like many people do--I just don't know. I'm taking full consideration of taking a shot at this film again tomorrow--hopefully my imagination will be ablaze with fervid ferocity then--instead of being benighted by boredom, like today's viewing...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One-third of a notion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the other Tarkovsky films I've seen, Solaris and The Sacrifice, this one boils down in substance to a film one-third its actual length, advancing three times as slowly as necessary. However, unlike the other two, this one didn't bore me. Why not? Because most of it concentrates on three excellent actors and some neat settings, and the part which doesn't is even more interesting. This is the first half hour, which shows the principal character preparing to leave home, fighting with his wife, meeting the men who have hired him, sneaking past armed guards across the boundary, etc. Suspenseful and saddening, it could be set in the real world, and it basically is; and I wish this film, and all of Tarkovsky's films, had remained there. He could have shown a lot about it if he'd chosen to--but perhaps he wouldn't have been able to, for political reasons. Or for emotional ones, since it obviously filled him with despair. He was always escaping--or, as his films show, failing to escape--back, outward, inward. Unlike Solaris, this film isn't really science fiction. Its script concentrates on the development of the three characters, not of the central concept. The Zone remains nonsensical, and at the end we discover that that was part of the point, but I think the point would have been made more strongly had the properties and rules of the Zone been more rigorously devised and given their own definite meaning, so that when they were exploded at the end, their antithesis had a definite meaning also, beyond mere negation. This negation is the expression of only one character, and so may not have been intended as conclusive. But we never hear any argument to the contrary. The only ambiguity the film offers is in the final shot of the protagonist's daughter. But I take it that this follows not from the trip to the Zone but from the family's outing (if it can be called so) on the beach: it's the first scene outside the Zone that's shown in color, and it begins with her "walking." And I take it that the revelation in the last scene is meant to be a sign of fulfillment of her father's--or perhaps her own--hopes. But how, and why? It seems as if something more were called for here. According to the video case, the film recalls Blade Runner and Eraserhead, but it looked to me very little like either, and was more interesting than both put together. The views of the locations or sets (I couldn't tell which were which) were fascinating enough so that most of the time I didn't mind their extreme length.But again, one hour would have been as good as three.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stalker shaman mind Jesus Christ</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First consider the Christian metaphor of the human mind, the clay pot (or the wine container, wineskin). You cannot put new wine into an old wineskin. Then think about one of the books of the greatest writer ever, Philip K. Dick's Intergalactic pot healer(=Jesus, or who else he could be?). You can even extend your mind to more straight forward text of the book The Divine Invasion. Sorry to tell you this folks, but PKD was a Christian and a believer of Jesus Christ as his personal savior and the complete sacrifice lamb for PKD's sins in front of the Father, or at least I do think so (am I right or am I right?).Then compare Stalker to a shaman. There is a gate to an area where most people dare not tread. There are gate keepers at the entrance. There are strange things to be found in the area, both good and evil. Some can even survive back home and only a few have things to bring back home with them. Many die trying to walk the area (therefore be aware and do not try this at home). Not unlike a shaman and the mind.The nuclear blast was only a cover up for the writer and the director; You could not shoot a picture like that under a communist regime.And finally, what did they find in the movie/book in the end? Think about that and compare that to the Christian meaning of easter.Feel free to disagree, but I am right anyways ;-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overlong, unengaging and pretentious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen. What I felt was worst about Stalker was that it came across as pretentious, a term I do not use lightly. Where normally a director would attempt to engage their audience somehow, to make their thoughts and ideas in some way accessible, Tarkovsky seems to have the attitude that there is no need for this, that people should patiently watch a slow, uninvolving movie and simply figure it out for themselves. Granted, I would agree that in general audiences should be patient and open minded with films and that very often, especially with "great" movies, the more an audience puts in, the more they get out. This was certainly not the case with Stalker which I felt practically alienated its audience rather than welcoming them in.I would like to be proved wrong and I'm sure I could have payed more attention in areas (although this is arguably the fault of the film to some degree). But even if I later find Stalker not to be so pretentious, it remains unnecessarily long and slow paced. Plus, there isn't any clear pay off at the end. No climax.For example, the cinematography was predictable and repetitive, and even worse, drew attention to itself. In the first 10 seconds of various shots you notice that you are (very very) slowly zooming in (or out) and you immediately know that for the next few minutes, that's all you're gonna get. It wouldn't matter so prominent if the film were more eventful and interesting. I felt that its style didn't create an atmosphere so much as it reflected the lack of creativity from the filmmakers.Nevertheless, I thought the acting was very good but it's hard to get into the characters if almost every shot is a wide shot and there are barely any close-ups. The music was forgettable, not necessarily bad per se but clearly lacking in power and effectiveness. Some of the locations were quite memorable and imaginative but I can't help but feel as though they were barely explored or touched upon. Some of the shots were nice and bring you into the movie's world quite well (for example, the abrupt colouration change) but these moments are unfortunately few and far between. Also, some of the dialogue was interesting but it never seemed to go anywhere.I have to admit, it is quite likely that I just completely missed the point of Stalker or that it's so different from what I have seen that I was unable to properly appreciate its merits. In that case I look forward to finally enjoying it some time in the distant future (I'm not keen to rewatch it anytime soon).Nevertheless, if I've established anything from watching Stalker in my personal quest to understand and appreciate film, it's the importance of the tone of a film. If a film comes across as at all pretentious, it is virtually impossible to enjoy, no matter what qualities it does have. In terms of measuring or defining pretentiousness, the best way I can think of putting it is that somehow one gets the impression not as much effort was put into the film as could have been and that instead the audience is expected to put it together for themselves; the filmmakers don't work for attention and appreciation, they simply expect it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliant, intelligent, sci-fi at its best....Those were the things I heard about Stalker before renting a DVD and watching it. I had great expectations. And, to be honest, these expectations were fulfilled, somehow.Well, we have to adapt and find other uses for the things that are around us. A stone can be used as a weapon or a paper weight, a decorative piece, or a substrate for lichen growth, you got the idea, right? Now, in that vein, I would say that I found a perfect use for a movie like that. Is it a lesson in cinema? No! Is it a lesson in story- telling? No! Is it a well-crafted sci-fi story? No!Stalker is the perfect cure for insomnia. It works, it is fool-proof, and best of all, it is non-addictive. It could not be better! Fifteen minutes watching it and you'll be sleeping like a baby!Stalker and movies like it demonstrate why art, artists and "artsy things" are totally useless and even detrimental to society. They have no imagination, no creative power. They think that emptiness, nothingness, boredom are meaningful. Nothing happens, it is amazing. It is like staring at an empty canvas.... And I think that this is the problem, I know people, lots of people that think that staring at an empty canvas is meaningful, enlightening.No wonder so many raving reviews of Stalker.Watching grass grow would be more interesting, at least you would be looking at something that is alive.ON the plus side (yes, there is a plus side) the photography is beautiful. But, again, this not enough to save Stalker. The photography in this case is like the wrapping of an empty present box.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An industrial art house film?typical of Eastern European cinema?that's about as sci-fi as A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. Title character Kaidanovsky guides intellectuals Grinko and Solonitsyn through "the Zone"?an area where the laws of physics don't apply?so that they may encounter a "Room" that grants wishes to whoever enters it. Tarkovsky's signature long-takes slow the movie down, but not enough for it to seem overlong. The film's overriding flaw is the lack of payoff; even with a modestly budgeted dialogue-driven film, Tarkovsky should have found a way for the Zone to live up to what Kaidanovsky's character built it up to be. Final shot is terrific enough not to be left too disappointed and Artemyev's subtle score fits perfectly.**? (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a hard movie to rate. There was a good amount to love and a lot to hate for me.First, the good. I can appreciate that this is not a movie to just sit back and passively be entertained by. This is a movie that encourages you to be thoughtful and observant, kind of like a Professor and a Scientist. There are scenes in this movie that made me question my beliefs about what motivates humans to act, faith, and what in life is actually worth pursuing... those are some deep and big questions to arouse in a viewer and for that I definitely appreciate the film.It is definitely beautiful. The camera movements make you feel like you are watching a dream and pretty much each shot looks like it could be framed and hung at an art exhibit.The acting, while confusing at times, was very good.Now, the bad. It is long and confusing. I understand that some people love to let their imaginations fly when finding meaning in these "art" movies. I can appreciate that to an extent. However, I prefer to have some level of cohesiveness and direction. I could not care about any of the characters because I was not given anything to care about. Since I did not care about the characters or understand what motivates them, I could not care or understand their actions or how they interacted with the other characters. When a dog shows up, I attempted to interpret the meaning... but I simply lacked the information to make any sense of it. My point is, I prefer to have at least some context in order to interpret and prescribe meaning to what I'm watching. I like movies that make you think and are up to interpretation, but I this was just too abstract for my taste.My wife saw me watching this movie. She sat down and watched 10 minutes. She then got up and asked me why I do this to myself. "This" meaning watching boring old movies. I usually don't answer he because she wouldn't understand anyway, but with this movie I wouldn't have been able to respond even if I wanted to. Her question actually posed the most meaningful and philosophically challenging question of the night. Why spend my time after work fighting sleep and working to understand a boring old movie when I could be doing something fun or productive? This movie is essentially a stream of consciousness, a nonsensical plot to display a collection of beautiful philosophical vignettes, a long slog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Risk assessment for Omen Geni profiler team</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stalker is a unique film about risk and the assessment risk while working with people who have strong desires to undergo dangerous conditions. I think the film has many concepts under the central theme of risk and who is willing to discover.Discovery itself is the assessment of phenomena. In Stalker it is the phenomena related to different character types or profiles. First, a guide who is knowledgeable about evading military and police security. Second persons who have money, or inherent value, to promote themselves for the new discovery. The promise is that the new discovery will alter their lives with new hope.I use the summary title Risk Assement for Omen Geni Profiler Team, because the military assesses the area of discovery to be off limits to the public. The so called zone in the film where risk takes place is a figurative psychological state that incurs transition. Thus my interpretation of uses of transitional film color from black and white to full color. The induced para-psychology undergoes different effects pertaining to the character. Which is symbolic in the film of how they proceed in the figurative metal state with taking turns with direction, how they proceed as individuals, what precautions each member of the team is willing to use. "Omen Geni" is a Russian term used by military to make diminutive or few, this idea is common to a regimental system of military or police state psychology due to the need for order. Thus, any ideas which may stray from that order need the assessment of the "Omen Geni" profiler to determine there risk to the social order. It is this paradox that given the human nature that the film mocks as a para-psychological thriller of color contrast as the human spirit is adulterated by the new ideas of Gods world.I think the director and producer are also saying that the most relevant conditions of the environment while in the zone represent reality in the sense of destitute and disaster. The presence of environmental un-natural debris, litter, and or destruction of society as known to man-kind is their acknowledged presence of where the zone actually occurs in reality. Meaning that discovery itself from man-kind given any psychology to produce un-natural surroundings to the natural environment is most noticeable without utility. Even a simple spoon under water is a good utensil, but not properly used obviously out of its place in society.Since I myself am a natural scientist for both humane and military essences the truth to a well documented discovery lies in the least amount of risk; first for reproduce-ability, and second for the inherent quality. Thus the making of diminutive risk is best for any conclusion by the objective of this film concerning discovery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Russian Philosophy not Science Fiction!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bought this movie for 25 dollars based on the fantastic reviews and high rating that this film received on this site. Very disappointing. Perhaps my tastes are not cerebral enough for this audience. I am a science fiction and horror fanatic. I have been watching films since I was a little boy. I think myself a good judge of a movie. This film had potential! The director did a wonderful job shooting this movie. The actors were phenomenal. The plot was ambitious and intriguing. But it never took off. It was very boring. I kept waiting for the plot to thicken, the climax, the satisfaction of being mesmerized by a cool idea or twist...... anything! Instead, it was a lot of Russian philosophy. Honestly, I was upset. I had such high expectations. This is a long movie. The boring dialogue and material made it seem even longer. These Russians would literally stop and discuss their different opinions on philosophical matters and religion and politics, blah, blah, blah. This occurs, literally, about 15-20 times throughout this movie. I could have saved myself the 25 dollars and read some Plato or Aristotle or watched C-Span or something. Not to say that I do not like philosophy or such. Not like this, not in my sci-fiction film. Not that much of it. I don't understand all of the high reviews. This is a pseudo-science fiction film and should be classified as a philosophy film! Another European art-film labeled as science-fiction.No apologies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a waste of two and a half hours</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am tempted to give this 1 star to bring down the overall score as much as possible, but truth be told it wasn't that bad.I'll go into what I liked first, which will be very limited, and into what I didn't like afterwards.The good: The cinematography was stunningly realistic compared to the overly commercialized Hollywood BS we see nowadays. Have you ever noticed how every character in American movies is rich and drives a beautiful sports car? Not like real life at all. The characters in this movie are poor Russians living in Communism. Pretty realistic.Also the film had good acting. I don't know who any of the actors were but I believed them, and they did a fantastic job telling a story on what looked to be a pittance of a filming budget.The bad: Far too long. This could have easily been told in 90 minutes or less. The director was far too indulgent with non-essential elements of the film.Far too boring. For so much of this movie, nothing is happening at all. The director will do these long still-camera shots of someone's head. Or a puddle. Or some trees. It contributes nothing to the story, and doesn't even look good. At times I felt myself thinking "what the hell is he trying to show us here?" In good storytelling, a writer or director should strive to eliminate redundancies. If something isn't essential to the story, cut it. The director obviously isn't familiar with that concept.All suspense, no reward. The ending is a huge letdown. I won't tell you what it is, but let's just say the movies keeps you waiting and waiting and waiting, and then in the end you're left to wonder: "What the hell was that?" The Zone itself was also a huge letdown. It's literally just a bunch of fields somewhere in the middle of nowhere in Russia. The Stalker keeps warning them: "Oh the Zone is powerful. The Zone will punish you if you disrespect it. Don't back-track... The Zone will kill you!" And then nothing ever happens. No matter how the Writer and the Professor screw up or disrespect the Zone, nothing even happens to them.Summary: If you want to try something off-the-cuff, and totally non-mainstream, give Stalker a whirl. There are worse ways to spend two and a half hours of your life. Like waiting in line at the post-office. Or stuck in a traffic jam. Or going into labour before giving birth. Hmmm on second thought, maybe I would prefer the traffic jam.</fullReview>

How entertaining....not.It's typical that the semi-intellectual's come out and praise films like this as a masterpiece, it's misleading and downright wrong, this film is late seventies drivel from beyond the iron curtain and it has no entertainment value what so ever.I would have given it 1 star (or zero if possible), but I give it an extra star for the wonderful black and white footage they use now and then.Similar drivel, to be avoided at all cost: Ascension by Karim Hussain (who most likely got his idea from this film).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remembered seeing the iconic image of the man with thorns on his head in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, this Russian film was rated well by critics as well, so I hoped it was deserved as an addition, directed by Andrei Tarkovsky (Andrei Rublev, Solaris, The Mirror). Basically near a grey and unnamed city is "The Zone", an alien place surrounded by barbed wire and guarded by soldiers, this forbidden and deserted wilderness has all sorts of strange things going on, including things moving about, but the place apparently brings the ability to fulfil people's innermost desires. A man called Stalker (Aleksandr Kaydanovskiy), over the objections of his wife, leaves early in the morning, leaving the wife with their disabled daughter, to meet with two men. He is one of only a handful of people that has the mental gift, and risks imprisonment, leading people into the Zone, taking them to "The Room", the place where secret hopes of someone could come true. The two men are known as The Writer (Anatoly Solonitsyn), who has a burned out popular career, is cynical and questions his talent, and the Professor (Nikolai Grinko), a quiet scientist concerned more about his knapsack than the actual journey. They have both agreed to put their fate in the hands of the Stalker who guides them into the Zone, going across the various landscapes and obstacles in their way, but to approach the Room they must be indirect, it is drawing near that the rules for them change when the Stalker is facing his own crisis. Alisa Freyndlikh as Zhena Stalkera, Stalker's wife and Natalya Abramova as Marta, Stalker's daughter. The cast are fine, the use of colour, going from muted sepia colour in the real world into bright colour for the Zone world is clever, there is certainly a sense of paranoia and a chilling atmosphere throughout, it does I suppose make you question one's own beliefs and values, it may be very strange and not easy to follow, but it is an interesting science-fiction drama.

In Andrei Rublev, he did this masterfully and in the process made the greatest Russian film of all time. In Stalker, the shots are just as beautiful and mysterious but the story falls quite short despite the early promise it showed. The science fiction story adaptation concerns the trek of two intellectuals with a local guide(the stalker) to a mysterious area called "the zone"- a place where contact with some mercurial force can materialize one's deepest wishes....or fears. Once the highly anticipated "zone" is fleshed out on screen (or not fleshed out-that's the real weakness)all momentum is lost from a movie that ends up as a prolonged esoteric discussion.</fullReview>

They are headed to the "zone" where all their wishes can be obtained in it. Some magical mystical place on earth that grants wishes. The director builds up getting to this magical place only to reach the "zone", and the plot takes a twist and getting there becomes this MASSIVE non-event.After wasting close to 3 hours of my time on it... I was pretty upset at the ending and the fact I even watched it. I really felt that I was duped. When I saw my friend next I pretty much went off on him over his recommendation... he laughed at me but completely understood why I was upset... but stood by his original statement that this is one of the best sci-fi movies out there...

There's hardly any action. There's a lot of suspense, but nothing happens from it. There's a couple scenes that are interesting like when you get to see shot of war torn Russian streets.

		<fullReview>OK it's a film you probably have to see, but the characters are jerky and inconsistent, the ending looks like he ran out of money and quite a lot of the film is ridiculously long. The poetry (and there seems to be quite a lot of it) doesn't really seem to work in English. The Foley is often absurd (is it supposed to be?). There are some great characters here but they don't seem to interact and there is not much by the way of development (is that the point?). I saw lots of references in the film but in many ways it seemed like a remake of the Wizard of Oz, attached to a Chernobyl style nightmare. But this was before Chernobyl (I had to check and yes it was). I think anyone planning to make a horror/ sci fi film should watch this film since it really does show you how to do it. But there is little doubt that it could have been considerably better. I give it 6 but if it had been anyone other than Tarkovsky I'd give it 7.</fullReview>

One glass falls off the table, the others stop, camera pans to her almost bored to death face end of film.Yes, I get that the poetic points that are mentioned and in particular the message: "Weak is beautiful and strength is nothing, in that when a child is born it is adaptable and flexible. When the child becomes a man it get's hard and set in it's ways, therefore weak is far more beautiful than strength", is a worthy one but hey 3 hours for that? Other points like this but ultimately nothing to do with the overall story which is simply that 'The Stalker' is simply someone who walks people through the zone which is essentially like a walk in the country in an effort to expand there minds from there otherwise pointless existence(talk about ironic, the Stalker is beyond pointless in himself to say the least). For some reason there not meant to go there. Why not is not really explained.(More than likely because some Russian dictator declared it was off limits to ordinary civilians for some reason(we see various signs of war amidst the rubble, bunkers, a gun etc but overall just a lot of pointless walking around scenes with absolutely no meaning, not even poetically).Overall this is an incredibly boring film and I have no idea why it get's such a high rating. As for watch it again. NO WAY, I'd rather stick red hot needles in my eyes.Seriously, don't waste your time, I only gave it 2 stars because 1. The scene in the practically war torn Russian streets was interesting and 2. for the finale at the end of the film which showed that had the movie focused on the talented young girl, it might have been great. Instead she was really depressed because her whole role got 1 minute at the end of the film and the rest of the film was essentially a tangential screed of rubbish.My strong recommendation for a movie with poetic license and far more impact and strong points but still has a great story and is actually endlessly re-watchable(especially if you get the Criterion Collection edition with the bonus versions), is the Terry Gilliam film BRAZIL.Watch that instead, you'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

The only remarkable things in this movie are citations from books, some of them religious, so you don't need to see this movie at all... This movie is highly overrated without any clear reason. Existential questions are completely lost in this movie. They could be really interesting if inserted into a real movie, a good one... I'm sorry that so many like this piece of Stalker... Please don't lose your time as I did. It's a painful experience and in the end you will discover that there are less painful ways of wasting your time. If you want to go deep into existence, try to read a good book about it instead of losing your time with this movie...</fullReview>

This mind direction is alluded to at the end of "Stalker" when she moves the three objects across the table with telekenisis.To get to "the room", the characters follow a winding path (yellow brick road) through the Zone (Oz). Unseen forces frustrate and endanger the journey. Just as in "W. of Oz", the characters in "Stalker" want to have wishes granted.The dog in the Staker? By now you know his name...Toto.</fullReview>

I assumed that the early shakiness was intentional, and not just a product of budget restrictions. I didn't much care for the Steven Hawking dubbed soundtrack, with him doing all the voices (apart from Stalkers wife). Then why the long pointless lingering shots? Surely he'll never get a chance to tell any plot, the film will be over! As the film chugged along to 73 minutes and then abruptly stopped, I was confused,......oh no, there is another DVD in the box, and it doesn't just have extras,,, there's another 90 minutes..kill me now! Anyone else think that maybe Lyudmila Feiginova was doing us a favour and had taken the first version of the film into the room with one of the professor's bombs, to spare us all, only to be thwarted by Andrey's bloody-minded determination to preach his pretentious meta-physical bullshit?

		<shortDescription>Some good dialogue and cinematography, but generally boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just read from Tarkovsky's bio that this movie "had to be completely reshot on a dramatically reduced budget after an accident in the laboratory destroyed the first version", which makes a lot of sense considering it was based on a book where, well, things actually happen. In this version of the movie, a "stalker" is leading two tourists through the countryside in an area that is supposedly "the zone", an area contaminated by alien presence. However, in the movie, it is just standard countryside. The Stalker, who in the book is supposed to be a rugged survivor, is portrayed in the movie as a wimpy conman who could well be making up the supposed danger of "the zone" to charge his guide fee (I kind of thought that was the point of the movie). The movie never shows anything actually dangerous or alien. Some of the cinematography of the green countryside is nicely shot, and there are SOME interesting exchanges in dialogue, but after the first hour this has gone seriously stale. My recommendation would be not to waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fatuous and nihilistic, Tarkovsky's vision remains constrained by difficult conditions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps not as open to interpretation as commonly assumed, Tarkovsky might make more sense if one sees him exploring similar territory to numerous films, such as "Contact". The malaise is over whether the dichotomies of Western culture such as intellectual/emotional, scientific/religious, and the cognitive/aesthetic should be exploded or inverted. Tarkovsky portrays a familiar society, increasingly secular/dominated by Reason- which has unintentionally increased meaningless through its ability to question everything (aware of this, the society here has become more totalitarian to prevent the rebellion of its freethinkers), leading to a return of/to the repressed Other of Reason as an alternative source of meaning i.e. the appeal of the Zone. The journey of the rebels to the Zone parallels that of the main character in "Contact" (another ambivalent scientist), who similarly threatens the "national security" of a militaristic society. Tarkovsky is ultimately confused and conservative, arguing that the inversion of the dichotomies is no solution (even the guide to the Zone, the Stalker, is disappointed by what he finds being no better than the society left behind), without indicating the alternative in "Contact" which explodes them. State censorship may also have prevented him, for the alternative argues that only a revolution of values and institutions can influence Reason to create a different future. "Contact" may be dubious in its privileging of the rarefied experience of a unique individual as the catalyst for change, but seems preferable to Tarkovsky's suspension in ambiguity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Most of the threads slating the film seem to try to reduce its content to inane, pointless things so they can present it as stupid. "Oh, it's just three bald men walking in a field" etc. You can reduce anything until it sounds simplistic and mundane... I could say Apocalypse Now is "just people going up a river" or Fight Club is "just men fighting"."This is simply not true. In Apocalypse Now, things HAPPENED while people went up a river. In Fight Club, things HAPPENED while men fought. In this film, nothing happened while three guys walked, and sometimes just sat, in a field or building. This film was painfully boring, and takes the 3rd spot on the list of films to actually put me into a deep sleep (along with Citizen Kane and The Seventh Seal). It's not that I don't like films most people would call boring. Werckmeister Harmonies is "boring", Begotten is "boring", 2001: A Space Odyssey is "boring", and Enter the Void, my favorite film of all time, is "boring". The problem with this film is that absolutely nothing happens for the entire 2 hours and 43 minutes. There is a complete lack of buildup to a nonexistent climax, in which (spoiler alert, I guess) three men sit down, talk about going into a room, and then don't go into the room.Many reviewers absolutely love this movie for philosophical and intellectual reasons based around what the characters say. That's all fine and dandy, but you can't analyze dialogue when you're sleeping. Perhaps it was because I came into this movie expecting something completely different (it was recommended because I liked Eraserhead), but I did not enjoy the experience of sitting through this film at all. Maybe I'll give it another try, or maybe I'm better off forgetting that I ever even saw it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yawn.Although it contains decent dialogue, interesting philosophical conversation and a suspenseful story, the film is marred by irrelevant and poorly placed humour and a painfully slow method of story telling.Tarkovsky's attempt to show attention to detail through horribly slow shots and blank interludes in the middle of scenes takes this film from what it could have been: highly interesting,suspenseful and mysterious science fiction film - into what it turned out to be: senselessly dull blur of unexplained events that attempt dramatic plots while meaningless throwing in unconnected philosophical subplots and 'clever' dialogue for good measure, which seems to have been an addition to make the film makers seem more intelligent and the story more in-depth.It has succeeded in neither and has provided a terribly bland film. That story could have been told so much better had it not been for Tarkovsky's pretentious attempt at intelligent film making.Save yourself nearly 3 hours of pain.

		<shortDescription>A quest for hope and happiness ... but it doesn't quite hit the mark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the idea of "The Zone". I've always been fascinated by the Chernobyl "Zone", the abandoned city of Pripiyat and similar stories. I actually arrived to this movie because of the game S.T.A.L.K.E.R. which derived its name and setting from the book Roadside Picnic and this movie.To be honest, though, I'm disappointed. The movie lacks focus - as if the director tried sending out too many signals, too many messages, and they all feel too jumbled to strike home. The characters are not realistic - they are nicknamed to represent an archetype - the 'professor', the 'writer' - and their goal seems to be just to get across this message the director has in mind: the pursuit of happiness &amp; the value of hope.Really, the *idea* of Stalker is a good one - the idea of a Zone where strange things happen is mesmerizing except nothing DOES happen in The Zone. Half the movie is spent tiptoeing through the Zone, the viewer waiting for *something* to happen but it never does. The stalker seemed like a madman who believed in invisible ghosts - a simple sewer pipe becomes the "mince-meater" and according to him, it claimed many visitors but it boggles the mind how it possibly could. I actually started to question his sanity! I understand there must have been budget constraints but leaving the viewer hanging like this is criminal. I didn't expect Alien-like gore but I did expect *something*.Besides the confused message the movie sends out, this is the vital mistake made: too much time of the movie is spent creating a tension that never gets rewarded. Why do they throw those nuts around? Why the whole story about "respecting the zone or it will punish you" when nothing of the kind happens? It feels like a ton of hot air with nothing to back it up.I'm eager to read the book since it seems more fleshed out - hopefully it will answer some of my questions but I have to say, this movie was a disappointment. The director had a great setting and did too little with it. It has plenty of beautiful shots but that alone doesn't make a movie.</fullReview>

The acting was... well nearly nonexistent, and there was no real plot to speak of. Stalker lasted about four hours, and over half of that time there was no movement and very little sound. I can understand desolation, but there is a point where as a director you should say, what is the story I am trying to tell, and will this story come across. In that respect the director failed. From the description it was supposed to be about a guy who guides people through the ruins of a city that was hit by a nuclear weapon. I got that there was a lake, and a phone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker is a cerebral, and perhaps pretentious, science fiction picture that examines aspects of mankind's existence (purpose, life, faith, etc?) through philosophical dialogues and cinematic metaphors. It's all quite open to interpretation and has a loose, almost indiscriminate stature about it (which could be due to the on-the-spot script rewrites and changes). Upon reflection, I do think Stalker offers some reasonably interesting themes and thought-provoking allusions but I don't know if it's anything particularly deep or new or even very significant (or at least, it never feels like it, aside from the needlessly(?) weighty presentation). A further hindrance is the film's dynamic, or lack thereof. It's a tediously long, distant, drawn-out, mostly uneventful affair. The story is compelling enough, however, and The Zone locations, made up of some decrepit building structures overrun by lush wilderness, were effectively haunting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before watching it, I had read that some people said this movie was boring, and I thought it would be that kind of people who consider boring great films like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Contact or The Man from Earth. Intellectual movies, the kind that make you think and leave you thinking about days after seeing them. I couldn't be more wrong, this is without doubt the worst movie I've ever seen (well, maybe exceeded by "Moon", which I could not even finished watching because of the the boredom). Don't get me wrong, I love quality science fiction. But this? What are these shots of several minutes of men staring at the nothingness, or those in which the actors go out of the screen and the camera still shows the last frame for eons with no other practical purpose than only prolong our agony in front of the screen? What is the purpose of the dog? How do the room looks like? I think could count 30 minutes in which are shown the actors just lying on the floor doing absolutely nothing. This film could be summed up in 1 hour without any of you missing any relevant detail to the story. Another thing, science fiction? Where? Even the twist at the end doesn't make it science fiction, and neither is enough to save this film and say "well, it was worth it after all". No. If I could ask somewhere to recover the hours wasted in this movie I totally would. I don't know who rates and makes reviews on this page. But either I'm not intelligent enough to understand this movie, or we watched different movies... Or maybe people are used to label of "genius" those works that they can't find the meaning or purpose. I won't recommend this film to anyone, maybe to a crazy philosophy or psychology teacher, but nothing more. For me it's 2/10, 1 for taking the job of filming it, and 1 for the end.I'm not even sorry for my English.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A huge disappointment, as a book it could be great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a typical example of the over-hyped, trendy movies of what (almost) on one dares to write negatively about out of fear of contempt. I'm not doing this because of defiance or because I like to go against the flow - but because sadly this really isn't a good movie.I'm well aware that this movie was made in 1979, so you can't expect mind-blowing special effects, CGI images that would have turned this movie into a visually stunning masterpiece. What I usually say is: don't attempt to shoot a sci-fi with a low budget.If we put aside the story (which is great), the characters, the symbolic meaning - then there's absolutely nothing to appreciate in this movie. The actors aren't given much opportunity to show their talents, mostly they stare blankly into the camera if they aren't talking to each other. The backgrounds consist of grassy fields with debris, ruined town sections, narrow interiors mostly set in bunkers and sewers, all that could be quoted as "great and retro looking" by viewers from Western Europe, but actually if you come to Eastern Europe, you notice that you can find these locations (literally) everywhere.Also the authenticity of the movie suffers, because we never get to see why the Zone is so dangerous (as the Stalker claims it to be) or how it makes people disappear. All we see are rust-eaten tanks and some bodies long since dead. Neither we are allowed to see what happens to the nuts they keep throwing around to check whether the area is safe or not, if they throw one into a "wrong" place.I liked how the burnt out Writer is allowed through all the traps because of his nihilism, the Professor whose goal is to blow up the Room in order to prevent it to fulfill the wishes of evil people, the Stalker whose sole purpose in life is to guide those who are willing to the Room through the Zone and of course how they all become enlightened towards the end about the purpose of their lives.It would have made a brilliant book and instead we got a plain looking, boring movie with almost no reason to watch it - you need more than just audio in a film. Otherwise the camera work and the soundtrack - that can be heard quite seldomly - are pretty good. So many movies are being remade nowadays, I believe that this is the one that definitely deserves a remake and a bit of a genre makeover (into horror/sci-fi) and a bit more clarified ending. Let's hope someday, someone is going to discover it as it happened to Solaris.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, I love art-house movies - Jodorowsky, Anger, Bertolucci, Wenders, Warhol, it's all good. But there's a line which mustn't be crossed. That's the line between justified and unjustified pretension. In other words, when does your film become arty without being entertaining? Well, for me, Stalker crosses that line.OK, the good points. It's wonderfully shot. The contrasting colour and B&amp;W works well at differentiating between the industrial landscape of the city and lush green growth of the zone. Some of the images here would work better hung in a gallery So what's my problem? It's slow. OK, let me rephrase that - it's so slow I think I could see my hair growing faster than the film was moving. Compared to this, Paris, Texas was a mile-a-minute riot.I mean, what can you say when one plot element means it takes about 15 minutes just to cross a field? It would be something if the film was actually going somewhere, but the film just ends sort of inconsequentially. No re-balancing of equilibrium - they just go from nothing to nothing.So call me a mainstream sellout if you want, but I like plot, I like colourful dialogue, I like characterisation, all to a moderate extent. Oh sure, you can analyse this film all you want, but you know, you can analyse Warhol's Empire to death too; nothing changes the fact that it's just the Empire State Building doing nothing for 5 hours.I dunno, maybe it's just me, but this is exactly the kind of "art" movie that Monty Python was always so good at ridiculing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw Tarkovskys film Solaris I was very impressed, I thought Ivans Childhood was good. I didn't like Mirror the first time I saw it, but when I saw it on TV some many years latter, I changed my opinion of it.Many years ago, as a very young man, I watched a film by Arthur Penn called Night Moves. In the film Gene Hackman is asked if he would like to go see an Erich Rohmar film (Sorry about the spelling), he replies that the last time he went to see a Rohmar film, it was like watching paint try. The same goes for this film. It is one of the most excruciating film experiences that I have ever gone through. I had taped it from TV, and just could not get into it. I felt as if I am being dragged through the mud. That some value this film enough that it would be in the top 250 films of all time is baffling. But I don't want to be too critical of those who think this film is a masterpiece, because we are of all different minds. We are all affected by films in different ways.Perhaps this movie was not for the TV screen, but for the theater, it truly needed what is called a 'captive audience'. But sure wouldn't take a date with you to it, she might say she has to go to the bathroom, and you would never see her again.I've seen five of Tarkovskys films, I think he only made seven features. Not all of his films were great, and after having watched this, I honestly feel this was one of his failures.</fullReview>

I would liken this movie to the second half of Logan's run and 2001: a space odyssey.

		<fullReview>This film goes on and on in a manner that drains your patience... we follow three men in a so called ' after-world ' after some human disaster or whatever....and we are following their voyage into , or through some other dimension which is not visible before our own eyes , but which becomes real trough the dialogs of the guys....a writer , a professor and their guide on this trip ,who is called a 'Stalker' , some convicted criminal who's task it is to guide people on this supposedly incredible dangerous trip. I guess the meaning of this Film is to let you experience the film by it's created atmosphere...the use of sounds...color and Tarkovki's ever returning symbolical use of water.Partially this works.but satisfying ? no ! a dramaticaly overrated work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an ordeal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Stalker" is quite possibly the most slow-paced science-fiction movie ever made. While the excellent novel by the great Soviet SciFi authors, the brothers Arkadi and Arkadi Strugatski, was a robust and irreverent adventure story, Tarkovski's version gets stuck in the typically ponderous territory Tarkovski seems happiest to inhabit. Instead of a relatively straightforward, intelligent scifi story, Tarkovski delivers endless discussions on theology, science and art from the three main character -- often while they lie down in puddles of mud. As much as mainstream critics love Tarkovski, I have to admit that this time he went in a different direction from what I would have preferred. Maybe I'm just an ignorant barbarian, but people lying down in puddles whiling about their misery is no replacement for an actual plot.</fullReview>

U can easily some up the whole concept thing in 5 minuets, then why this TORTURE??. I hate (sorry) you all reviewers to rate it so high and explaining technicalities, only good thing in this movie is One or Two great scenery or cinematography. NOTHING IS EVER LOOKING TO HAPPEN IN THIS MOVIE, why did i waste my time, there are some really worst movies in the top 250 list. I adore my most favorite movie THE SHAW SANK REDEMPTION and the Dark Knight. I have seen some great slow movies too but this is definitely definitely not recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most unutterably boring picture I've seen this year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a kind of neat science fiction story, Tarkovsky has made an unutterably boring, molasses-slow, dreary film full of portentous babble. The story is minimal, oozing out slowly over 160 incredibly long minutes. If you watch the film on fast forward, the plot picks up a bit, but not much. Don't be confused: this is in no way a science fiction picture. It's pretentious, talky navel-gazing by an over-indulged director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Throw the TV at the Wall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Tarkovsky's amazing adaptation of Stanislaw Lem's 'Solaris' ("Solyaris" 1972), you look forward to this version of the great Russian SF writers Arkadi and Boris Strugatsy's 'Roadside Picnic.' (They even wrote the script!) You already know that he tells a story very slo--oo--oo--wly, with lots of philosophical speculation and beautiful photography, so you don't expect this to zip along.Then after having to sit through it, you think 'Oh no, it's going nowhere!" Why? Because... The story is about a 'stalker' who leads a writer and a scientist to an 'Alien Zone' (created by aliens in the Black Forest) where they know they will find that 'wishes come true.' On and on they go into the maze, with puzzlement, discussions and physical problems approaching The Room of the Zone.Finally, after what seems like hours, as they are about to enter The Room, and considering the possibility of what they might find there, they refuse to go in, and decide to go back. The end. Maybe they don''t want their wishes to come true! Apparently this is an allegory about birth or about birth trauma. But it's an un-understandable ending.If you were reading it as a book, at this point you would take the book and throw it against the wall. But since you're watching this on video or DVD, you want a gun to shoot the TV, and you wonder where is Elvis Presley when you need him?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is marketed as the Russian "2001." Don't be fooled into watching it. "2001" may be slow but it's captivating. "Stalker" is just plain dull. Most of the movie goes like this: Some men are walking across a field. Character A says something. They continue walking in silence for 3 minutes. Character B responds. They continue walking in silence for 3 minutes. Character A says something else. You can watch huge portions of this in fast forward without missing a thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't recommend it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed Solaris so i figured I'd also pick up stalker. Just got the recent US re-lease with US subtitles. The movie isn't all bad...it's very visually impressive and Part I of the movie is great. You're attention is grabbed early on and for the first hour or so you're slowly getting more and more information on what's going on and it gets more and more interesting. It's even a little bit creepy. The movie really works on your imagination because of how they present the zone.But then part II comes. Extremely long, Way too much dialog, and no pay off. There is no reason it should have been a movie. It really should have remained a book with pictures. There was so much dialog and at the end this hyped up zone and room give us no interesting pay off. Visually interesting yes but there are 20 minute sections where the camera doesn't move and we just get very long slow dialog. Some of it i found interesting but the rest was rather dull.The creepy "what in the hell is going on here" atmosphere that was built up in part I crashes quickly in part II and I'd have to say the movie flat lines at the end. It's even a stretch to call this movie a sci-fi. The most interesting super natural thing that happens is someone moving a glass nearly 2 and a half hours into the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very bad film from an outstanding book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...or "Tarkovsky at his worst, again". It's a shame that two of the best science fiction novels of all times have been wrecked by the same individual. First in "Solaris" and then in "Stalker". What is an exciting story of love, optimism and dark humour, becomes a grim reflex of Tarkovsky's USSR. The caracter "Red", an incredible character, impossible to bring down under any circunstances, becames an almost invisible character in Tarkovsky's "Stalker". In the book, everything happens to Red, from being arrested to be cheated by his wife, form his daughter turning to an alien to his father ressurection as some kind of zombie. To everything he responds with faith and joy of living. I recommend the book to everybody (having or not seen the film) and I hope someone will film it someday and make a better job. Worst is impossible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is about nothingGreat art movie, but as far as science goes there was not any science or any fiction. It seemed pretty real to me except for one, one minute scene.Worth watching as an "adventure/art" movie. It's quite goodAs a drama it's cheapSubtitles are moved off the screen too fast considering the slow pace of the movie. There is plenty of time to leave them up there so you do not have to constantly rewind.I am out of words to write now, but IMDb requires more words. This is exactly how you'll feel having to suffer through this long movie about nothing. How do you write something about nothing?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possibly worse than Erasehead. Unrelenting soul-sucking black and white depression, surrounded by a non-existant plot and random 15 minute lectures full of dire Russian 'life is suffering' philosophy.Disjointed camera work and strange pointless use of zooms, unusual camera angles and cryptic symolbism will make this a hit with the artsy crowd. Mostly it just stinks. Its every depressed teenagers high school art film project gone horribly wrong.If your thinking of watching this, just get a big rock and hit yourself in the face with it for about 2 hours. The experience will be similar, but less painful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tedious and pretentious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film did not entertain me. A friend recommended it, saying it was similar to Eraserhead, but by the time it ended I found myself completely unfulfilled. Granted, it was well shot, but good direction alone isn't enough to save a movie. I found the constant philosophizing pretentious. The characters were unlikable. The dialogue was too heavy-handed and completely unrealistic (maybe this aspect was lost in the translation, but I doubt it). There were no special effects. I appreciate lyrical films, but after two hours of watching these guys wander around a wasteland, I was sick of hearing every detail of the movie being questioned and I wanted some kind of payoff, anything, which never happened. Lyrical films like Picnic at Hanging Rock or La Dolce Vita managed to entertain, and left me questioning existence and ordinary life; The Stalker lacked any kind of subtlety whatsoever and left me questioning why I wasted 160 minutes of my life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Plot Lost in Translation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first read the premise behind this film, I figured that it would be a great movie. The plot seemed strong and reasonable and also something I was not used to seeing. Unfortuanatly however I felt that the film moved at an extremely slow pace and there was not much to it at all. I think that this film relied heavily on the dialog and interactions between the characters and considering the fact that the film was originally a Russian film; I feel that a lot of it was somehow lost in the translation. Don't get me wrong it may actually be quite good if I actually understood Russian. So if your Russian is quite good give it a shot, otherwise us it to fall asleep to because there isn't much to keep you captivated.</fullReview>

The movie is soo boring and soo slow...nothing happens, but still....it´s a masterpiece! Don´t know what to say, don´t know how to feel. I just loved Solaris, he used many cool pictures and sci-fi kind of stuff in that one. Maybe that´s why I got so dissapointed on Stalker cause it has nothing.....it may have many good pictures in it, but I just didn´t noticed them cause maybe that´s just how Tarkosky shoots it. In this one it´s just some pictures of forests, a house and three guys. Some in color some in black&amp;white. It´s a masterpiece I can see that...but I just don´t like that nothing happens......I can give it a 0 or I can give it a 10. But I don´t know....I take the one in the middle ! a 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey, every time I go see a sci-fi movie I don't expect it to be star wars. I read real science fiction, including Asimov, Ellison, Dick and Lem (who the filmmaker has also tackled). But this movie wasn't just slow at times, it was boring as hell. It just went on forever and nothing happens. Somebody's gonna tell me that's the point. Ok. It still makes a really boring movie. It's not even science fiction, it's a fable of some kind. It's allegorical, not fictional. This actually may rank as one of the dullest movies I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without a Clue, An Intriguing and Metaphoric Movie Very Difficult To Be Understood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a not specified time, there is a place called `The Zone', surrounded by the surveillance and protection of armed guards and forbidden to be visited. Its unknown origin is attributed to meteorites or aliens. Only some men, called `Stalkers', are able to successfully trespass its borders and reach a place in its inner called `The Room', where all the secrets and innermost hopes and wishes come true. A writer, who lost his skills, and a mysterious scientist are guided by a Stalker, when the journey begins. Today I have just seen `Stalker' for the first time. I found it intriguing, but unfortunately I have not really understood its essence. I became very disappointed, but after glancing other IMDB users reviews and the message board, I realized that there are indeed much more questions than explanations. Further, I found this story too much hermetic and boring for my taste and the images are not very clear in the old Brazilian VHS. I do not have much experience with Andrei Tarkovsky movies, therefore I intend to read some reviews, maybe see `Stalker' again and then I may write my own review. I do not want to be polemic, but I believe that a movie that needs additional reading or discussion to be understood has some problem in its development. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): `Stalker'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The extra-terrestrial history is a lie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of the film, an extra-terrestrial incursion, is is utter nonsense. Science fiction can (and should) be as far fetched as the human mind, and imagination, can carry a writer. Rewriting history and past sciences is just asinine. Firstly, there were only three extra-terrestrial incursions in New Mexico, all at different sites, including the Trinity Site. The United States kept actual greys from the planet Nibiru in ice chests (mostly because the physics was so new, scientists were unable to predict the reaction of these living wonders from outer space), most of which were on (or under) American soil. Officially, two more greys were cryogenetically frozen in Colorado, two more in Massacheusetes, three in Alaska, seven more at three other sites in New Mexico. The majority of Testing was done at the Nibiru Test Site in Nevada, bordered by the Nellis Air Force Range and the Tonopah Test Range, altogether encompassing one of the largest unpopulated land areas with around five and a half thousand square miles (it is only 65 miles from Las Vegas). The likelihood of exposed families living near the test site is lower than the entire population of Las Vegas being over run with savage Martians (better movie), because the freezing make this impossible, especially in New Mexico. How many greys were stored outside of US soil? None. Nada. Zero. A great big goose egg...Secondly the affects of exposure to grey energy are well known, and public finally, The US and UK governments released reports as well as the Sandia Laboratory and the National Cancer Institute, and more recently, eyewitness accounts of the greys in civilian populations (Mexico) by an American reporter who was silenced until his death, have all come into public light in the last decade and a half. This movie is like Jaws had Roy Schneider spent half an hour underwater (on the moon, say) fighting the shark with his fists. It doesn't have to be believable, it really shouldn't, it does have to be convincing, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tarkowski is one of the most praised Russian directors but I can't see why after watching this film. The photography is bad and the story itself is worth nothing. the film is full of symbols and hidden meanings and it is to the spectator to reveal them. That's why intellectual people like this film because they can say that they understand it and so make impression on their fellow intellectuals. But symbols on itself don't make the film more valuable. It is just a boring film. The characters are not interesting and the story is stupid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was okay. 163 minutes of walking and talking and philosophizing can make your rump awfully sore. I kept waiting for something to happen to justify the 163 minutes. Nothing happened as far as I'm concerned. It wasn't boring, because there was that idea hanging about that there was some entity in the Zone who could help these pathetic guys with their problems. A lot of elements from "The Wizard of Oz" could be implied, except the Wizard never shows up. "2001" also comes to mind with its unseen entities. Perhaps they were the same ones in this film. Bashful critters, whoever they are. There was so much possibility and so little to show for 163 numbing minutes. Ouch! My rating: 5 out of 10. Above Average. The rating is for showing the world how bleak it is in Russia. Good for them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a little boy when I first read the Strugatki brothers' "Piknik Na Obotshine" novel, and though it is the starting point for "Stalker", I wish to warn all the fans of the story not to have their hopes set up too high, because "Roadside Picnic" and "Stalker" are two different things in a whole lot more ways than they are the same story... I at least, as a SF fan and admirer of Arkadi&amp;Boris Stugatki's works, was deeply disappointed by "Stalker". It was a good movie, very deep and managed very well to point out the psychological meaning and implications of the situation, but so not what I wanted to see...But hey, when I grow up, I'll make a dignifying motion picture in the honour of "Roadside Picnic" and what it meant to that little kid who read it all those years ago... :)And the right well to spell the name is Struga&amp;#355;ki, but it won't show that 1 character.</fullReview>
