		<shortDescription>Brutal, brilliant, and one of the best Westerns ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A sprawling Western epic that follows the adventures of three gunfighters looking for $200,000 in stolen gold, Sergio Leone's `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' is a masterpiece, one that continues to get better and better with each viewing. In a way, it's a morality play, weighing the consequences of good and evil, but it does so in a realistic manner. Sometimes, crime does pay, at least in the short term, and sometimes good does go unrewarded. This film probably signaled the death knell of the traditional John Wayne `White Hat/Black Hat' Western.The three main characters make the film. Lee Van Cleef (`The Bad') is evil personified. Totally ruthless, he'll do whatever it takes to get what he wants. Clint Eastwood (`The Good') is the Man With No Name, not really `good' in a traditional sense . . . but he has a certain sense of honor and tries to do the right thing. (Watch the scene when he gives a dying Confederate soldier a puff of his cigar - powerful, and it sums up everything that the Man With No Name is all about, without saying a single word.) Eli Wallach (`The Ugly') is Tuco, and he's easily the most complex - if not the best - character in the film. All impulse and rage, Tuco spins wildly throughout the movie, stealing, lying, pretending to be Clint Eastwood's best friend in one scene, trying to kill him in another - Tuco truly represents `the ugly' side of people.The movie is long, but there's not a wasted scene in the film. Each one slowly lets the film unfold with a certain style and grace, revealing more about each character and what's going on. The pacing is incredible, as is the direction - Sergio Leone manages to build a lot of uncomfortable tension in the film, keeping the film from ever getting predictable. Any typical Western cliché that you can possibly think of is either given a unique twist or utterly destroyed by Leone's masterful storytelling. Of special mention is Ennio Morricone's score, which is absolutely perfect. Two scenes - one in a Union prison camp, one in the climatic gunfight in the cemetery at the end of the film - are amazing on their own, but they become absolutely astonishing with combined with Morricone's powerful score. This movie is absolutely brilliant. If you haven't seen it yet, I strongly urge to do so. Immediately. (And then, go watch `Unforgiven' . . . in a way, I think that `Unforgiven' is the sequel to `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly - it's the story of what eventually happened to the Man With No Name.) `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' is easily one of the best Westerns ever made.

		<shortDescription>Westerns don't get any better than this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the third,and arguably the best, of the so-called "spaghetti western" trilogy. It is ironic that, at the time the three Sergio Leone westerns were released, they were largely panned by critics as being poor and even laughable imitations of American-made westerns. The fact that they were filmed in Italy and Spain resulted in them receiving their amusing nickname which was intended to degrade them at the time.Somehow, over the quarter century or so since their release, the critics have tended to change their opinions, and now these movies are generally regarded as classics. Perhaps this is because Clint Eastwood was principally known only as the second banana, Rowdy Yates, in the television series "Rawhide" when the films were produced but since then has achieved superstardom. But I also think it goes beyond that. I believe the critics decided to take another look at these films and realized that they had been premature in writing them off. Actually, I believe the three films were considerably better than most of what Hollywood produced. In fact, I think that TGTBATU ranks among the best westerns ever produced bringing to mind the magnificent films of John Ford, the undisputed master of that genre, and his protege, the incomparable John Wayne. I have nothing but praise for this film. In fact, I rank it as one of my favorite films of all time. I could write volumes of what is good about this film. But since its qualities have been oft repeated in other viewer reviews, I will focus on what others didn't like about it. Most of the IMDb reviews had only one major complaint: the film is too long. I disagree. In fact, in spite of its nearly three hour length, I was disappointed that it ended. I was so absorbed in the film that I was disheartened to have to return to reality. The combination of story, cinematography, acting and musical score left nothing to be desired other than more of the same! The sequences that seemed to drag on in the opinion of other reviewers were necessary to fully create moods and to drive home important points. For example, the opening sequence might be regarded as needlessly long as Angel Eyes taunts a hapless man over a leisurely meal. But to me, scenes like that are what makes the movie great! The time allows the viewer to fully appreciate the amazing replication of the primitive home and the pitiful life of its dirt-poor inhabitants. I felt as though I was sitting there at the table; I was half tempted to reach for a bowl and spoon to partake of the meal. And all the while the suspense was building towards the inevitable climax. You know it's coming but not when and the length of the scene drives you crazy but makes it all the more satisfying when it does happen. Another example is when Tuco punishes Joe by forcing him to walk through the desert. This is possibly the only time that one might become bored with the film. But again, I think the time for the scene was justified in that we are able to receive the full impact of that experience and enjoy the haunting music at the same time. Joe's subsequent predicament might not have had much credibility had this sequence been abbreviated. In my opinion, one of the essential elements of a great film is creating moods that absorb our attention. This often takes time, lots of time. For example, many of the scenes in the magnificent film "Dr. Zhivago" were almost painfully long but they were necessary to create those startling surrealistic moods, and the film would not have been great without them. In many ways, TGTBATU has this same sort of greatness. It is a sweeping epic with very compelling characters and magnificent settings that draws the viewer in and doesn't release him until the closing credits begin to roll. When it's over, you feel that you've been on a long and exciting journey. Such a journey takes time.In summary, if you haven't seen this film, buy it right away. Don't rent it because you will not want to part with it once you've seen it.Then curl up with it on a cold, rainy Sunday afternoon when you are in no hurry to do anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The good, the better, the best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is without a doubt my all-time favorite western.The beginning of the film is so memorable, with the young, rough good-looks of Eastwood being labeled "The Good", the absolutely evil look of Lee Van Cleef being labeled "The Bad", and a dirty, unkempt, desperado Eli Wallach with booze and food flying being labeled "The Ugly". The ending fight scene with its 3-way showdown is one of the most memorable pieces of film I have ever watched.Leone did a great job with the camera direction in this movie and the acting is impressive. Eastwood, Van Cleef, and Wallach are absolutely fantastic.The only thing that might scare some viewers off is the length of the film. It is long, but you just don't seem to notice it when you are watching the film - you are just too damn busy watching the best classic western of all time.Do yourself a favor and rent this movie if you haven't seen it. If there was ever a perfect western, this is it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok- first, as mentioned in another review, the geographic/historical errors in this film are GLARING. You've got men carrying revolvers that look like old style cap-and-ball pistols, but they're loading them with metallic cartridges- historically about five years early. Eastwood carries a rifle that hasn't been invented yet, Tuco assembles a "superpistol" out of a Colt, a Remington, and a Smith and Wesson- impossible. And there was nothing of merit taking place between the North and South during the Civil War in the Southwest. Now, that aside, I must say that this is the Greatest western ever. I first saw this film when I was about ten. I'd never sat through an entire Western befor, even though my Dad watched them constantly. Since then, I've been through film school, watched hundreds of Westerns, learned to appreciate them- but NOTHING matches up to this. The Searchers, Stagecoach, Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, The Gunfighter, High Noon, Shane- all great films, but saddled with the standard American Western morality- the good guy never takes liberties with the eastern schoolmarm, the bad guy wears a black hat, etc. Coming from Italy, TG,TB &amp;TU isn't bound by these conventions. Blondie's the "good guy"- but he's also a bounty hunter. He makes a living in a highly immoral way, but is obviously the "good"- not because we're told, but from small acts- giving the dying soldier a cigar, making sure the Captain knows to hold on till he hears the bridge blow, the genuine regret he feel for having to let Shorty die. And while Angel Eyes may be the Bad, we at least know he has prinicpals- when he's hired for a job, he always sees the job through. And Tuco may be more immoral than the other two, but he's so savvy and his role so humorous that one can't bring oneself to look upon him disfavorably. In other words, historical inaccuracies aside, TG, TB, &amp; TU maybe one of the most accurate portrayals of the West ever put on film- there are no clear-cut lines of conduct, no black and white, or even grey, but just a swirled palette of various facets of the human condition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the greatest of the great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't sure if I was going to comment on this film because everything has already been said by the hundreds of other people who have posted their thoughts, but I decided that I should really put my two cents in since this is my favorite movie.This film, in my opinion, is not only the greatest spaghetti western of all time. It is the greatest movie of all time. Period. Regardless of genre. I could probably watch it every day, and be perfectly happy doing so.The music is perfection. The way the music drives this movie is absolutely amazing. The musical genius of Morricone and the incredible direction of Sergio Leone is a combination that will probably never be equaled. The theme song will forever be etched in your brain. In fact, it probably already is, even if you haven't seen the movie! The scene where Tuco runs through the graveyard with the song "Ecstacy of Gold" is pure poetry. And the showdown at the end with that great music- just incredible.The story is riveting. There is not a single dull moment. The movie is long, but Leone's direction is so good that you will love the fact that you can enjoy this movie for three hours.Lee Van Cleef is my favorite spaghetti western actor, and he is incredible as "Angel Eyes." It is the part he was born to play. Eli Wallach is perfect as Tuco. He really shines in this movie. Some people say he steals the show, and I can see why they think so. Eastwood is excellent as "Blondie," although I don't think Eastwood has as strong of a presence as Van Cleef (I know many will disagree, and that's OK because all three actors are superb in this film so why split hairs?).This movie is hypnotic. It's operatic. It's sad. It's funny. It's gritty. It's violent. It's art. It's action. It's pure entertainment. The film is just so incredible on so many different levels that EVERYONE should see it, regardless of what kinds of movies they are into. And it's so cool that the greatest flick ever just happens to be a spaghetti western. If you haven't seen this movie, stop what you are doing, and go get it now!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The King of Cool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a partial first viewing, I didn't like "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly." I thought it was a slow, tedious story about a bunch of unpleasant jerk characters involved in a bog-standard conflict over money. It all seemed very macho and self-consciously cool, and it had obviously inspired all the overrated macho directors I don't like in my own generation - Tarantino, for example, and Robert Rodriguez. In short, I was unimpressed.Years later, I gave the film a second shot, watching it all the way through this time. I loved it. What had changed? For one thing, I took more notice of the technical side of the film. I paid attention to Leone's famous use of close-ups, his selection of memorable character actors, and his wonderful scene-setting. I admired the detailed sets and the sweeping landscapes, the props and the costumes and all those weird, wonderful faces that Leone clearly loved to photograph.I also got hooked by some of the quieter moments that I had skipped over in my first viewing. One of the most effective scenes involves Eli Wallach's character, Tuco, quarreling with his brother when they meet after they've been apart for years. Their argument is great, emotionally charged stuff, made all the more effective by the suggestion that they really do love and care about each other. It's the kind of sensitive, human scene you never get to see in a Tarantino or Rodriguez movie.Before I get too fuzzy-wuzzy, I should also like to point out that, on my second viewing, I LOVED all the action, too. Every gunfight is great, in its own way, and they're all a bit different. The greatest of them all is, of course, the final confrontation between the trio, which is accompanied by some of the most rousing music I've ever heard in a film. And hey, there's even a huge Civil War battle to provide a change of pace from all the small-scale action.Ultimately, "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" is probably just a potboiler of a film, without too much to say about, for example, the human condition. But what a potboiler! It doesn't have to try to be cool - it simply IS cool. In fact, it probably defined heroic coolness for an entire generation. Eli Wallach's performance, Leone's direction and Morricone's music alone are enough to elevate it to classic status - and the fact that everything else in the movie is great, too, helps elevate it to the level of perhaps the greatest action film ever made.And to think, I missed all that the first time through...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best of all Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film probably had the largest impact on my life. It set the tone for everything I then got interested in. American Civil War. Film Music. Clint Eastwood. Real Westerns. This is the best of the Dollars Trilogy and by far one of the best Westerns of all time. It has drama, comedy, cracking dialogue, some of the most brutal battle scenes - especially around the bridge - that I'd seen up to then, music to die for and set pieces that just ooze atmosphere and tension. I have never forgotten the end shoot-out. This was unique; 3 people?! You can't do that. But Leone did, and he did it brilliantly - all cameras and music. I have now seen this film too many times to count but I'll be back for another blast of buono, brutto, cattivo, someday. My son owes his name to this film. Yep, that there is Clinton.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rather than a review of a 30 year old movie, here is my recollection of a 30 year old movie. When was the first time you saw this movie? I remember the first time I saw this movie. Back in the '70s, one night there was 2 things on TV to choose from, this movie or a baseball game. How do I remember a baseball game, it was the night Hank Aaron was going after Babe Ruth's homerun record. Baseball or a movie. Tuned into the the baseball game, flipped to the movie -a western, cool. 'Uh, what is this no one is talking it makes no sense'. After what seemed like an eternity somebody finally spoke, Lee van Cleef. The rest is Movie History. Since then I have seen this movie well over 25 times. Numerous lines that have been etched into my memory. Forget whatever minor flaws this movie has. Put yourself in the movie. Sergio Leon, John Ford these are the people that defined "The Western". On a scale of 1-10, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is nothing less than a 10. Plop the tape into the VCR, sit back and experience a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sergio Leone's penultimate Italian-western; a film that gets better with each passing year...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...and though those last several words could also be attributed to Leone's "Once Upon a Time" films (West and America) as well as the other pieces in his trilogy of films with Clint Eastwood- Fistful of Dollars and For a Few More Dollars- arguably this is the most ambitious and spellbinding one of the bunch, and one that has inspired (i.e. Quentin Tarantino, Sam Raimi, Robert Rodriguez) and will most likely continue to inspire filmmakers and fans into the 21st century. There's something in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly that's nearly (or perhaps is) mythical in it's craft, certain scenes come off as being more than relevant and exquisite for that scene/sequence- it transcends into aspects of humanity.For example, in the first part of the film (this is after the extraordinary introductions to Tuco, played by Eli Wallach, Sentenza or 'Angel Eyes', played by Lee Van Cleef, and as Blondie by a 35/36 year old Clint), Joe gets Tuco out of a hanging, which is something of a regular practice for them, but Joe decides to leave his 'buddy' out in the desert to walk the rest of the way back into town. A little later, the situation gets reversed, as Tuco has a horse and water and Joe doesn't, and they both go to cross the desert. Leone decides to not follow Tuco coming back to town as much as he follows in earnest Tuco and Joe going across that desert, as Joe starts to burn and dry up, going towards a story that will soon unfold. There is something to these scenes that I can barely describe, that they're executed in the mind-set of a Western, but in the abstract Leone lets the audience know this is a story that is bold and bigger than life.What makes much of the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly such a huge success is the trust Leone had in his own style he spun into his own after the first two westerns, his trust in his collaborators, and in his leading players as well. I, for one, had to mistakenly figure out that it is near depressing to watch this film on a regular VCR tape due to the pan &amp; scan process. There is such a clear, distinct visual scope that Leone and camera director Tonino Delli Colli achieve that it's practically a must to get the DVD (preferably the extended version, which was Leone's original cut more or less). The editing, too, is unique in many sequences (the climax is the most noted and memorable). The score, with usual collaborator Ennio Morricone, is one of the landmark movie scores, and themes, of not just in the western genre but in all movie history. And the three main players who take on the screen have their own chops to show off: Eastwood, technically, was playing a Joe that took place before Fistful of Dollars, yet by this film had it down to a T (it's still my favorite performance from him, despite having few words and reactions); Cleef's cold, cunning Angel Eyes steals the scenes he's in; ditto for Wallach, who gets under the skin of his co-patriots as much as he sometimes does under the viewer's. If anyone really stays in the mind, at least for me, it's Wallach - especially as he gets the most 'character', and one of the very best scenes is between Tuco and his religious brother. Without that scene, the movie actually wouldn't work quite as well, surprisingly enough. Overall, The Good, the Bad and Ugly, is an entirely satisfying western, at least one of my five favorites ever made, and it's an endearing bravo to all who were involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sergio Leone was a highly personal filmmaker!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone's film follows the adventures of 3 ruthless outlaws...The 'Good' is Eastwood's unchanging and unshaven 'Stranger With No Name.' An unprincipled killer who stands only for his 45... He is quiet, inexpressive and cool, only seen once with a brief moment of humanity where his classic disinterest contrasts with the real tragedy of the American Civil War...The 'Bad' is an excellent supporting actor, a Western figure... With his long, thin opening eyes, deathly pale face and cruel voice, Lee Van Cleef is the merciless bounty hunter, ironically called 'Angel Eyes,' always ready to kill for a price...The 'Ugly' is Eli Wallach, a wild spirit with devil attitude... Tuco is charming but extremely dangerous...The pairing of Eastwood and Wallach is memorable for its black humor alternating each other's fate, motivated satisfactorily by their excessive desire for collecting the reward money... The quest: a treasure chest containing $200,000 in gold buried in a Confederate grave in Sad Hill Cemetery..."The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" had many haunting moments: Complicated bounty-hunter's con-games; the Stranger, in a frantic hurry, trying to load his empty gun before 3 killers sent by Tuco; a torturous walk across the desert in a blazing sun; the epic battle between Union and Confederate soldiers for the control of a strategic bridge where Leone's camera takes a slow ride surveying the magnitude of the Civil War carnage; and the final showdown in a huge graveyard, where each character, naturally, wants the money all to himself...The amusing scenes are provided by Tuco, sitting in bathtub with a lot of foam and one armed man enters his room saying: "I've been looking for you for 8 months... Now I find you in exactly the position that suits me..."The memorable scenes are when the Stranger finds himself in a dangerous situation at the hand of Tuco, who is just about to collect his vengeance by hanging his former partner... The stunning scenes when Leone's camera captures the touching moment in which a young man plays sweet romantic songs on his harmonica, while his eyes are streaming tears of disgrace and grief...The unforgettable scenes when the 'Stranger' leaving Tuco with a rope around his neck and the bandit begs for mercy while teetering on a wooden cross...The ultimate confrontation between the forces of good and evil when Leone spreads out long shots adjusting sound with action... Tensions mounts as the three protagonists 'shape in a triangular cinema cliché' Leone gets the audience's imagination with a geometric fight to the death, accompanied by a clear exciting music... Leone's camera captures every straight lines, every nervous energy, every tactical movement, displaying, in huge close-ups, their faces, their power of vision, the slowly progress of their fingers toward their loaded guns, their worried eyes, their sudden need to be quick, to be the fastest draw...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly or the Good, the Better and the Best, as I prefer calling it, is a bizarrely sublime and a uniquely aesthetic masterpiece. The actors in title roles have given such extraordinarily superb performances, that it would be impertinent and disparaging to merely regard their swell work as acting. In fact their brilliant portrayals have immortalized Blondie, Sentenza/ Angel Eyes and the enigmatic Tuco. Lee Van Cleef is fiendishly unforgiving as the merciless Angel Eyes. Clint Eastwood is rugged yet suave, cocky yet adorable as laconic cigar-smoker Blondie, a role that laid the foundations of his illustrious career. But it is Eli Wallach, who steals the show with his captivating portrayal of Tuco, a portrayal that is as entrancing as it is enlightening. Wallach is amusing, capricious, nonchalant, uncanny and yet tenacious as Tuco, perturbed by his insecurities and dampened by his solitude. It is the tacit amicability between Blondie and Tuco and their mutual hostility towards the evil Angel Eyes owing to the vestiges of virtue present in them, redolent of their moribund morality, which gives the story, the impetus and the characters, a screen presence that is not only awe inspiring but also unparalleled.Sergio Leone's magnificent and ingenious direction in synergy with Ennio Morricone's surreal music, Tonino Delli Colli's breathtaking cinematography and Joe D'Augustine's punctilious editing makes the movie, a treat to watch and ineffably unforgettable. Initially aimed to be a tongue-in-cheek satire on run-of-the-mill westerns, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, continues to stand the test of time in its endeavor to attain apotheosis (if it hasn't attained it yet). It will always be remembered as European cinema's greatest lagniappe, not only to the Western genre, but to the world of cinema.It's a must watch for any movie lover. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Primal honesty and morality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After many years of barely watching any movies, I treated myself to several classics recently. And this was the best.That I so enjoyed this movie so much came as a shock to me. I literally never before have been able to even sit through a western, which (in my admittedly limited experience) was schlock action starring John Wayne as the taciturn all-American good guy being tough and beating up the outlaws. Watching GBU, I was enthralled for the entire three hours. Twice. And if I had time, I would have watched it a third time. The setting is typically western: a dry, dusty panorama in which men barely co-exist with each other; few wasted words; and lots of action, horses, and gunfighting in a wild west barely governed by incipient institutions of law &amp; order ? all shrouded within a morality play of good vs. bad. But what I liked so much is exactly what I hate about John Wayne westerns ? the seriousness and honesty with which moral context is considered. In Hollywood, good vs. bad is as thoughtlessly superscripted as the protagonists' white and black hats. In GBU every remnant of moralizing has been ruthlessly cut.Good, Bad, and Ugly are personified in the form of three characters: Bad ("Sentenza") is the easiest to understand. He is *very* bad, perhaps not so different from other villains, but much more sharply developed; murderous, sadistic, traitorous, and remorseless. Good ("Blondie") and Ugly ("Tuco") are more puzzling, but their labels are the key to the movie. Both Blondie and Tuco are outlaws and killers with only the barest hint of morality, but they're not evil in the same way that Sentenza is. Tuco is demonstrative, emotional, loud, wild, and unpredictable; but driven by survival rather than satanic urges. Blondie is cool, calm, rational and controlled ? in many ways similar to Sentenza ? but whereas Sentenza tortures, maims, kills, and lies for the hell of it, even apparently enjoys it, Blondie simply goes about his business coolly, and shows several poignant hints of empathy, decency, and a sense of justice.GBU takes place during the Civil War and strips away the high-level political struggle of history books, leaving us with the soldier's vantage point of brutality, pointless death, and some individual decency. The politics are indecipherable from this vantage point. GBU hits this point home when our protagonists wind up in a prison camp because the oncoming gray cavalry uniforms turn out to be dust-covered blue. Later, they encounter an army fighting over a worthless bridge, suffering countless pointless deaths and casualties. Because Leone has so rigorously excised traditional off-the-shelf morality, the few instances of humanity are remarkably poignant. One such instance is when Blondie shares his coat and cigar with a dying soldier; another is when prisoners are forced ? by Sentenza's orders ? to play music to cover up the screams of the tortured. Sentenza apparently enjoyed the irony of beautiful sounds used for such ends; the musicians are, of course, pained by it.That was one of many extraordinarily striking scenes. The honesty of the moral context was what I liked best about the film, but I liked everything else too. Indeed the same primal, ruthless honesty that characterizes the character development pervades the film. The music is unlike anything I'd ever heard ? it's an audible version of the arid west and the tensions and lawlessness that characterize the film. Underlying the entire score is one instantly memorable theme starting off with what sounds like a screaming hyena. The story took place in New Mexico, and even though it was filmed in Spain, it really does look like New Mexico; and just as in life in the American west, the wide, breathtaking panorama tends to subordinates dialog. Indeed, it is several minutes into the film before even one word is spoken.The plot was extremely clever ? and never predictable. High level suspense is maintained for the full three hours. It was hard to imagine how it could unfold ? three uncompromising outlaws in search of one buried treasure; cooperation was not in their nature, but nothing was ever done out of character. Any Western cliché that you can think of is either given a unique twist or destroyed by masterful storytelling. For example there is an utterly irreverent scene in which Tuco meets his brother, a sincere Priest, and turns platitudes upside down. The brother begins with the standard rebuke of the criminal's behavior, but Tuco punches back and says, "Where we come from there were only two ways out. You lacked the courage to do what I've done." The movie is also irreverently funny: For example, Twice Tuco gained the upper hand on Blondie and said:"There are two kinds of spurs(?), my friend. Those that come in by the door, and (crosses himself) those that come in by the window.""There are two kinds of people in the world, my friend. Those who have a rope around their neck and those who have the job of cutting." Later Blondie gained the advantage of Tuco and observed: "You see in this world there's two kinds of people my friend - those with loaded guns, and those who dig. You dig." In addition to all these specific attributes, a unique and strikingly cool style infuses the entire film: long scenes of tense silences ? never for an instant boring; and telling, startling close-ups and transitions. Most noteworthy was the film's climax. As the protagonists stand there with their fingers on their holsters, waiting for the first person to go for their gun(s), the transitions start out slowly, and speed up as the tension increases. As I write this, I wish I had my own copy of the film, just so I could see this scene again.Not just a great western, but easily one of the best movies of *any* kind ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best cinematic meditation on greed since "Treasure of the Sierra Madre"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Belfast-based comics writer Garth Ennis said it best: "There are two kinds of people in the world, my friend...those who dig Clint Eastwood movies...and dweebs." While I have to admit that my heart belongs to the opening act of "The Man With No Name" trilogy, "A Fistful of Dollars", there is no denial in my mind that "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" is actually the better film. Many directors have tried imitating it's style (including Don Siegel's substandard "Hang 'Em High" and Eastwood's own first Western offering as star/director in "High Plains Drifter"), but none have truly come close to the eccentricities on display here.I have a suspicion that the storyline is actually based on historical fact. Consider this account from Joel Rose's "The Big Book of Thugs" under the entry of "The Reynolds Gang": They were organized in 1863 by Texans Jim and John Reynolds. They were briefly interned in a Civil War prison camp for Confederate sympathizers and after being released, began making robberies that, according to Jim Reynolds, were to help out Jefferson Davis and the Confederacy. The loot was buried somewhere in the area of Handcart Gulch and Spanish Peaks in Colarado Territory and later, after Jim Reynolds and four members of his gang had been executed by Colonel John M. Chivington of the Union Army, John Reynolds, dying from a fatal wound during a holdup, supposedly whispered out the location of his old gang's ill gotten loot. Unlike the movie version, it was never found.Regardless of whether or not this was the actual basis for TGTBATU, it is nevertheless a film more grounded in history than a lot of it's comtemparies and, indeed, more than a few of it's successors. The Civil War is part of the backdrop, but it does so on a forgotten front of that war, the Western theater. Most high-school history classes would have us believe that nothing happened out West, but plenty did. In fact, the last skirmish of the war, if I'm not mistaken, was in New Mexico and, ironically enough, a Confederate victory.The central of this film is greed. You don't just see it in the quest for the Confederate gold by Blondie, Angel Eyes, and Tuco. There are signs of it everywhere; in the hotel manager talking about how he'll be glad to get the Northerners in town for the money they'll bring in, Bill Carson appealing to Tuco's greed for a single sip of water, the gang of cutthroats who are systematically robbing the Confederate prisoners of their goods. Set up against the harsh desert backdrop, it exposes the ultimate folly of that greed (the best symbol of it perhaps being the cemetary where the gold is buried). A little over a decade before the Reagan era of "Greed is healthy, greed is good", this film provides the ultimate rebuttal to that argument. Greed has gotten just as many men killed, if not more, than patriotism ever did. Such a subtext makes "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" the cinematic child of John Huston's "Treasure of the Sierra Madre" and the precursor to Oliver Stone's "Wall Street".As great as Leone, Eastwood, Van Cleef, and Wallach are, there is one member of this team that pushs this film into the status of greatness: score writer Ennio Morricone. Not only does he manage to write one of the most recognized theme tunes on the planet, he also adds the extra tension needed to convey the drama with the necessary oomph, the best examples being in Blondie's torturous walk across the desert, Tuco's frantic search through the cemetary (my personal favorite and so good that Lucasarts did a slowed-down version of it for their western shooter, "Outlaws"), and, of course, the final three way shoot-out. He still composes scores for many other films to this day, I've been told. A good example of his most recent work would be the 1990 version of "Hamlet" starring Mel Gibson and directed by Franco Zefferelli. But I truly doubt that he'll ever be able to top the legendary work he did here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sergio Leone's most visionary film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone is arguably the most visionary director of all time. They say that before he even had a written script he could picture exactly what was to be on screen and the camera's direction in leading his characters. It was Sergio's World - an alternate place in an alternate time that he was free to control. He controlled the audience and his story like no other director.To me, his best film was the one that was on many critics' ten worst films of 1984 list: "Once Upon a Time in America." I love the finished director's cut, the cut of the film Sergio Leone himself wanted and pictured in his mind while filming the movie. Unfortunately, the editor of the film cut everything into a two-hour picture and messed up the timeline for the theatrical release in 1984 - the result was a disastrous motion picture that now, with the director's cut, stands as one of the best of all time. James Woods once said that one of the critics who named it the worst film of 1984 later named it the best film of the decade."Once Upon a Time in America" was Sergio's dream project, one that took him ten years to get on the big screen and ultimately killed him by sucking the life out of him, but "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" (1967) was undoubtably his most visual film. The extreme close-ups, the great way he lets the audience see nothing but what he wants - as far as he saw it, the audience should not wonder what is off-screen; whatever is within the frames is all there is. Compared to "Once Upon a Time" it seems a bit more corny and unrealistic - but it is a spaghetti western, and that is simply the point. It stands above the rest as the best spaghetti western of them all.Leone is best remembered for his extreme close-ups. Director Quentin Tarantino once said, among many other things about Leone, his role model, that when he started out he knew not many camera directions, so when he wanted an extreme close-up in a film he'd shout, "I want a Sergio Leone on this guy!" Quentin Tarantino has such a respect for Leone that he even suggested the title "Once Upon a Time in Mexico" to director Robert Rodriguez, the title, of course, a derivation on "Once Upon a Time in the West" and "Once Upon a Time in America," both films of Sergio Leone."The Good, the Bad and the Ugly," a.k.a. "Buono, il bruto, il cattivo, il," is the final film in the Dollars Trilogy - "A Fistful of Dollars," "For a Few Dollars More," and, of course, "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly." I have yet to see this film's predecessors, but I doubt they are much better than this film. It isn't really about anything per se - it's a showcase of art and camera techniques. It is a showcase for Sergio Leone and a great one at that. I have no real care about the themes or outcomes - I simply enjoy being controlled by a masterful director such as Leone. When there's a director who can literally push in and give the audience specifically what he wants them to see, without the audience feeling cheated, you know you have a great director, because there's a fine line between a selfish director and a visionary director. Leone has a bit of both, so indistinct that it is hard to notice. The same thing was done in Carol Reed's "The Third Man" (1949), and the same is done here. And it is pulled off without any objections from the audience.Clint Eastwood is The Good - he rides around the desert kidnapping criminals, giving them to the authorities and claiming reward money, and then freeing the criminals before they are to be hanged. He meets Tuco (Eli Wallach), a.k.a. The Ugly, and does his routine - but The Ugly fights back and, ultimately, kidnaps good ol' Clint, taking him into the desert and practically torturing him in the heat.Then The Good overhears where a stash of gold is hidden from a dying man. The Ugly wants the gold so much that he nurses The Good back to health so that they can go off on a wild goose chase and search for the treasure. But there is already another man searching for the treasure - Angel Eyes, a.k.a. The Bad (Lee Van Cleef), a man whose skills at gunfighting match those of The Good, a true marksman if ever there was such a thing.There's a terrific scene towards the end of "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly," where three men have found the gold buried in a graveyard. At exactly the same time. They each have guns pointed at each other. They could all pull their triggers and die, or kill one of the three and the two could then take the money and split it. Leone zooms in with his extreme close-ups and truly gives the audience a sense of paranoia, a sense of what it would feel like in a circumstance such as that. Sergio Leone is a great director, perhaps the most visionary of all time, and now that his films are turning up again with their intended running times, the realization strikes and sinks in.He's an even better director than we thought he was.5/5 stars -John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sergio Leone always wanted every picture he made to be, in every way, bigger than the one which preceded it. With the Good, the Bad and the Ugly he continued his upward trajectory and rounded off his dollars trilogy in style.This picture was Leone's most stylised and grandiose to date, and brought all the themes and styles he had been developing in his earliest films to perfection. Among the most notable was his characterisation, particularly his all-important introductions of characters. Look at the introductory scenes of the three leads. We first see Tuco bursting out of a window, obviously interrupted in the middle of a meal, and straight away we get his freeze-frame and the title "the ugly" ? this is a simple character, and needs no further introduction. Angeleyes appears out of the distance, but grows towards us until his face fills the screen. We see him commit two despicable acts of murder and treachery before we get his freeze-frame and title "the bad", telling us he is pure evil. Finally, in Blondie's first appearance he steps into the frame from behind the camera, as if he had always been there. He rescues Tuco, but only for his own profit. It's not until we have seen him betray and abandon Tuco that we get his freeze-frame and title "the good" ? obviously a fairly ironic label given the way he has just acted.Leone's trademark long drawn out face-offs ? exaggerated versions of the shootouts of John Ford westerns and the sword duels of Kurosawa's samurai films ? are also brought to a peak here. Not only are they now taken to absurd heights of stylisation, they are also spread out and adapted to cover the whole picture, until the point where even two men sitting opposite each other eating a meal and glancing suspiciously at one another is treated like another stand off. In fact, the entire film can be considered one long series of duels.We also see more of the importance Leone attaches to church and family. The Dollars trilogy could be thought to lack emotion, taking place as it does in a world where there are no morals and everyone is out for gold. However the Good, the Bad and the Ugly contains several moments of poignancy, perhaps the most prominent of which is when Tuco confronts his estranged priest brother.Religious iconography and references crops up time and again. Leone loved biblical epics almost as much as he loved westerns, and there is something of the feel of those pictures here in the overwhelming landscapes and eerie, choral music. On top of this the central trio can be read as an allegory for God, the Devil and humanity. This arguably presents rather a cynical view of the Catholic faith ? given the treacherous and chequered nature of the "good" ? but it could be argued to be a typically Italian one. In a country in which the church is so omnipresent and universally accepted, it's sometimes said that God is cursed as much as loved. Having said that, this was clearly never intended as the central theme ? Leone wasn't trying to make some grand statement here ? it's simply part of the mix of ideas going on in this picture.This brings me onto the war theme. Anti-war sentiments are not directly addressed in this picture, but the way the civil war is woven into the plot makes a powerful statement. For the first half hour we don't see that the war is going on. The central characters aren't concerned with the it ? they are only interested in hunting down the gold. However the war encroaches on the plot more and more often, until it moves from background to foreground and takes over the entire picture, culminating in a colossal battle scene. And of course the fact that the film ends in a huge military graveyard is also very significant.I've spent so long talking about the themes and ideas going on in this film I've nearly run out of space to talk about all the genius that has gone into making it so enjoyable. The dialogue is superb, often funny and plenty of it quotable. Technically Leone has perfected his art ? he composes a shot like John Ford, edits like Eisenstein, paces like Kurosawa, but all with a degree of his own originality. There is brilliant acting ? Eli Wallach steals it as Tuco, probably his best ever performance. It's funny how Lee Van Cleef was cast as a villain here. Van Cleef's early career mostly involved playing mean-looking gang members, but as Leone discovered when casting him as the hero in For a Few Dollars More, while his face said "bad guy" his voice and manner could be warm and likable. The good guy Van Cleef obviously proved more popular, as in the dozen or so other spaghetti westerns he made for other directors he was invariably cast as the hero.Just time for a final word on the recent (2003) restored edition. While it's great that several lost scenes have been added, I have to say that very few of them were entirely necessary. The only one of the added scenes I really like is the one in which Angeleyes visits the field hospital ? it keeps his story arc going, and also shows an act of compassion from the "bad" when he lets the soldier keep the bottle. However the new dubbing for these scenes, strange as it may seem considering today's technology, is mixed absolutely atrociously. On top of this, Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach are now so elderly, they actually sound less convincing than the guy impersonating the late Lee Van Cleef. As a result the restored segments stick out like sore thumbs, and break up the flow of what is in every other way a perfect motion picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.This film revolves around threes of various types and pairings among those threes. The grouping of three that is of interest to me are the cinematic influences behind this film: Hollywood westerns, Italian iconic painting, Japanese starkness in representation. These Italian westerns are important. Most movies are about other movies, but this one affected much of what followed. The western vocabulary was mature and popular well before movies, and with the detective story drove the first revolution in modern mass publishing. Its simple abstractions were converted to film (then radio and TeeVee) without change: the boy scout cowboy in the usually white hat, often singing. (In fact the modern pop country music borrows from this simple vocabulary and reference to the `genuine.') But all that, including the country music bit is pretty flat, stupid and dull.Italian cinema is based on a similar set of national icons, specifically religious icons. It is a more visual, visceral painterly vocabulary. Equally simple in stereotypes, but instead there are religiously based connections that give the impression of depth. Symbology is expected, even demanded. To this add postwar notions of irony which permeated European popular art. So the good guy was still good, but in a twisted way -- the twists shifting according to the chaos he encountered.In the US, John Ford was creating soft lush panoramas that would subliminally inspire a generation of environmentally aware viewers, but something more important came rushing in from Japan: Kurosawa. His films are abstract, directly evolved from Japanese watercolor narratives. These are also lush and beautiful, but not soft -- instead dusty, gritty, sometimes cruel. This world is not placid, merely a machine to test color and honor.In the Eastwood/Leone films, these three influences were deliberately enfolded. And a whole world's visual vocabulary shifted. In the US, we have since reinvented a part of our national character to ally with these images. (America's love affair with guns is a recent phenomenon.) How powerful cinema can be!This film may be recommended by others for entertainment value or something similar. That's fine, but I think it should be seen to help you understand the default world you are handed, so that you can put it into perspective -- to see that much of it is man-made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know some movie fans who consider The Good, the Bad and the Ugly the best movie ever made. While I don't even think it's the best thing Sergio Leone made, it's a solid Spaghetti Western that has all but transcended the sub-genre. There are images, such as Clint Eastwood in the poncho, and music, like the main title theme, that are known by people who have never seen the movie. I also know people who wouldn't be caught dead watching a movie made outside of the USA who love The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. I can't think of another Italian made film, let alone an Italian made Western, that has become so universally known and enjoyed.There are so many moments in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly that I enjoy. One of my favorites is that of Tuco running through the cemetery as Morricone's "The Ecstasy of Gold" plays in the background. It literally gives me goosebumps. It's one of those movie moments that I look forward to no matter how many times I've seen them. I'm also a fan of the techniques Leone used in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Leone's use of the widescreen shots of the landscape inter-cut with extreme close-ups of faces is brilliant. It adds a sense of intimacy to vastness of the setting that allows the viewer feel like they're part the movie and gain some insight into the characters. It's a technique that very few other filmmakers have the guts to employ.But I sincerely doubt that Leone's film would be so widely and wildly regarded if it weren't for the music of Ennio Morricone. I've already mentioned the main title theme and "The Ecstasy of Gold", but these are only two examples found in this amazing score. Can you imagine the final showdown without Morricone's music? I can't think of many instances where music and film go together to create such tension and anticipation. I've already used the word "brilliant" to describe Leone, but it's also applicable to Morricone.Finally, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly wouldn't be the same without the three lead actors. Each, at least in this movie, is brilliant (there's that word again) in his own right. Clint Eastwood is "The Good". He's "The Good" in the sense that he's not as "bad" as the other two. Lee Van Cleef is "The Bad". He's a ruthless killer who would just as soon shoot you as look at you ? as long as the price was right. And then there's Eli Wallach as "The Ugly". As good as Eastwood and Van Cleef are, Wallach is really something special. Wallach's Tuco is one of the most crazed, but complicated characters I've seen. It's a special cast for a very special movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the few films truly deserving of the term masterpiece. Whether you view your films looking for great entertainment or great art, "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" will surely not fail you. Just about every aspect of the film is flawless, from the stylish direction of Sergio Leone, the memorable score by Ennio Morrecone, and a trio of ultra cool yet accomplished lead performances (Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach, Lee Van Cleef).Some have complained this film is overlong. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is never once remotely boring or slow paced, and an epic length is needed to tell such a good story. The length is just perfect. Sergio Leone was a master craftsmen and managed to create awe-inspiring action films as good as Kurosawa. This will always be his masterpiece, even though there are many who prefer "Once Upon a Time In the West". While that is a great film also, it never managed to stick out in my mind as well as this one does. The beauty of the closing sequence of the search for gold in the graveyard manages to amaze me with every viewing.Special note needs to go to the acting. As the Good, Clint Eastwood turns in one of his finest portrayals. Dangerous yet showing many redeeming qualities, its obvious Eastwood didn't want this to be a one dimensional character. He succeeded. As the Bad, Lee Van Cleef shows why he was such a criminally neglected character actor. As bad ass as Lee Marvin and yet as good an actor as Humphrey Bogart, its a shame he was stuck in mostly grade-b roles. And as the Ugly, Eli Wallach is also superb. Slimy, greasy, throughly unlikable yet oddly compelling all the same.I can't forget to mention Ennio Morrecone's score. It has become one of the most instantly recognizable in popular culture, and for good reason. Its instantly memorable and suits all the action on screen perfectly.If you haven't seen "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly", well, what are you waiting for? Its one of the few films that is truly essential. Hell, even the rest of IMDb seems to agree with me. (10/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In New Mexico Territory circa 1862, a mysterious bounty-killer known as "Blondie" (Clint Eastwood) and a shifty Mexican bandit, Tuco Ramirez (Eli Wallach), run a con job wherein Blondie turns Tuco in for money and then rescues him, splitting the reward money. However, the two engage in numerous double-crossings against each other, until stumbling across a dying Confederate soldier (Antonio Casale) who gives each man a clue to the location of a hidden cache of gold. Tuco and Blondie re-form their alliance to find the gold, only to find that Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), a ruthless hired gun, is already after the gold. The three men form a frequently-changing series of alliances to get at the gold, and they must avoid the Union and Confederate armies operating in the region."The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" is a landmark film in many respects. Its cultural influence is nigh-impossible to overstate, with its iconic musical score by Ennio Morricone, three memorably amoral protagonists, the close-ups, vast landscapes, and the title itself, all of which are instantly recognizable icons of cinema, having been referenced and replicated time and again in movies, TV shows, and even commercials. It is Sergio Leone's first truly great film, a transition from the low-budget Spaghetti Westerns ("A Fistful of Dollars", "For a Few Dollars More") to the big budget, artistic epics that Leone would make for the rest of his career ("Once Upon a Time in the West/America"). It is also a film of utmost importance to me; after watching this movie as an eleven year old, admiring its wonderfully quirky characters, style, music, and breath-taking cinematography, I realized for the first time that I wanted to devote my life to films, be it watching them, writing on them, or hopefully making them."The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" is a full-blown epic, and one with an interesting subtext. We see three completely amoral characters whose crimes - robbery, murder, and racketeering - are minor compared to the brutal carnage we see the Civil War inflicting. Taking place during the little-known Sibley Campaign in New Mexico, the film is not a documentary depiction of the war, but an allegorical one. This was the first total war, and Leone uses it as a metaphor for conflict in general, with faceless mass slaughter inflicted by rifles, machine guns, and artillery. Blondie, Tuco, and Angel Eyes' transgressions are minor compared to a brutal, Auschwitz-like concentration camp, spies being executed in the streets, towns being shelled, and vicious, stalemated trench warfare over a "flyspeck" of a bridge. Even our amoral heroes have amounts of humanity which set them apart from the machine-like slaughter around them; Blondie saves Tuco's life and comforts dying soldiers of both sides; Tuco struggles with a mixture of affection and hatred for Blondie, and his troubled relationship with his brother (Luigi Pistilli), and even Angel Eyes shows disgust at the carnage he sees.The movie is extremely episodic, the plot only secondary to the adventures of these characters. Leone's wonderful direction gives the film a fairy-tale quality, with an appearance of realism while being fanciful and at times almost surreal. The movie contains extremely memorable set pieces: the lengthy opening, with three gunmen going after Tuco; the "carriage of the spirits"; the prison camp; a shootout in a town under shellfire; an epic Civil War battle; Tuco running excitedly through the cemetery; and, of course, the unforgettable climactic "triello". Tonino Delli Colli's cinematography is simply breath-taking, with desert landscapes as impressive as David Lean's films contrasting with the most extreme close-ups imaginable. Carlo Simi's set designs, from shelled-out towns to prison camps to the cemetery, is breath-taking. And Ennio Morricone's score is, for lack of a better word, one of the most amazing ever written, the instantly recognizable theme tune and other brilliant pieces creating the movie's indescribable atmosphere.The cast creates unforgettably iconic characters. Clint Eastwood is back as the Man With No Name, here much more human in this film despite retaining his cool, detached, shifty nature. Lee Van Cleef, who had played a likable character in Leone's previous film, now plays one of the most memorably evil characters ever. Aldo Giuffre, Antonio Casas, and Luigi Pistilli are effective in supporting roles, and Leone's usual stock cast - Mario Brega, Benito Stefanelli, Al Muloch, Aldo Sambrell, and many others - create their own iconography. But it's Eli Wallach who steals the show, as the scenery chewing Tuco, a shifty, double-crossing, foul-mouthed bandit who manages to be the most likable and human of the cast despite his faults; truly, one of the most memorable film characters ever."The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" is one of the most well-known and influential movies ever made, and with good reason. In terms of style, it is an absolute triumph, being one of the most amazingly made movies ever made. Those only familiar with the movie for its cast, its score, or peripherally through its iconic stature, are missing out on one of the most breath-taking cinematic experiences ever. Thank you, Sergio Leone.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The west as a piece of art...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly has a very basic storyline - 3 cowboys trying to collect a fortune in gold. Sergio Leone then set this story against a backdrop of the American civil war. It is visually stunning, and has enough action for 10 films, let alone 1. Okay, so its not geographically or historically correct, but seriously, if you care about those things so much that you don't like the film, then you are just plain sad. The 3 main characters are excellent; Clint Eastwood as the laid back hero, Eli Wallach as his dirty Mexican partner and Lee van Cleef as the evil gunman who kills for a living. The whole film is like a work of art, leading up to the final gunfight in a stadium like cemetery, 1 of the best scenes in film history. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly isn't one of those films that is thought provoking, but it is one of the best simply because for 3 hours it is very entertaining, and a thing of beauty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sergio Leone is an underappreciated talent. His skill, in most cases, exceeds what he actually puts on the screen. This is, by far, his crowning achievement and the culmination of both his work and Clint Eastwood's career. After this, it is only pushing the plateau without success.The primary focus of this movie is not the characters, the story winds up being the least of Leone's concerns. Instead, he is concerned about the camera and the music. Ennio Morricone, a genius in his own right, was seriously ignored by the Academy for his compilation here--certainly one of the Top 10 ever. He understands the crude editing of the mid-60s and exploits everything he can from the vision onscreen. If Leone was dissatisfied with the Ennio's final product, something MUST have been wrong with him.The camera is another element that never lies. Modern filmmakers should study this before they try emulating MTV next time. With Leone's grandeur and a cast that understands that they aren't the real focus, how can he lose?The story, while it isn't the greatest, is better delivered than such works as The Wild Bunch. Perhaps only High Noon understands the value of pacing and what to reveal/not reveal to the audience. Then again, Fred Zinnemann is an entirely different director. The character interaction here is certainly better than what Gary Cooper has to offer, not to mention the dialog includes some uncanny deliver by Eli Wallach.Overall, a classic. This is a definer of the unconventional Western and visual literature. 4.5 out of 5 stars. A must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Old Idea Reworked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The basic plot of THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY has been done before. In fact, the film inverts the premise of TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE. In TREASURE, the three men searching for the gold worked as a team. The team broke down because of external pressure (the bandits) and internal pressure (Fred C. Dobb's paranoia). In THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY, the three men searching for the gold never team up. They are kept apart by internal pressure (the fact that one of them is a murdering sadist) and external pressure (the ebb and flow of the Civil War).In TREASURE, only one member of the team knew how to find gold. Here, the location of the gold is a secret. Two men know opposite halves of the secret. Blondie (Clint Eastwood) knows a name on a grave. Tuco Ramirez (Eli Wallach) knows the name of the cemetery. Their shared secret forces the two men into an uneasy alliance. The third seeker is Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), a professional killer. He has learned about the gold from one of his victims.The opening and Ennio Morricone's unique theme music set the tone: this will be a harsh, gritty, offbeat film. Freeze-frames tell us which character will be good (Blondie), which will be bad (Angel Eyes) and which will be ugly (Tuco). The difference between the three men isn't motive, since they all want the same thing. What sets them apart from each other is what they are willing to do to get it. Angel Eyes will torture and kill anybody who gets in his way. Tuco is a bully and a loudmouth, but he only kills in self-defense. Blondie is quiet and intelligent, a planner who carefully works out every detail well in advance.THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is set in a harsh, unforgiving landscape. The quest for the gold takes our characters through a desert, a prison camp, a war-ravaged frontier town, a Civil War battle and, finally the cemetery where the inevitable showdown happens. The few outposts of civilization huddle against a vast, imposing wilderness. In such places, even the best man has to be a little bit bad and ugly to survive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit that I had some doubts prior to seeing this movie, considering its length and some people's comments that it is slow as molasses. Well, they were mostly right about that. GB &amp; U is indeed a movie that does not always move very fast, and it does take a little getting used to. Yet if you manage to look past the slowness, this is easily one of the best movies ever made.This is one of those movies where nearly everything comes together in exactly the right way. First of all, there is a wonderful cast of characters. Clint Eastwood is at his best as the 'Good' (even though he's not strictly a good guy but more a bad guy with an honor code), Lee van Cleef is so truly evil that you'll long for his downfall with a passion, and Eli Wallach steals the show as the 'Ugly', turning him into a character that you'll root for even though he's quite clearly the least trustworthy character you'll ever meet.These wonderful characters engage in a quite complex plot full of twists and turns, as they are constantly trying to outwit and outshoot each other. There's quite a lot going on and in spite of the fact that the tone of the movie is actually fairly light (there is some truly good humor), it's actually a fairly good exploration of human nature and the lengths to which people will go to achieve their goals.And then, there's the music of course. Ennio Morricone has always composed some very distinct and recognizable tunes, which unfortunately were not always that great by themselves. The music here, however, is absolutely one of the most memorable scores ever.Of course, the cinematography is wonderful as well. The production values here seem to be a lot higher than in some previous Leone movies, and GB &amp; U contains plenty of memorable shootouts that will truly keep you on the edge of your seat. At the same time, the gunmen here seem not nearly as invincible as in some other Leone movies, which greatly adds to the suspense.As I said before, nearly everything comes together in this movie. Sure, it might be a bit slow, but it's got a great story of good versus evil, told in an impressive and truly epic way, with memorable characters and shootouts everywhere. Highly recommended</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best Westerns Ever Made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has style - in a very elemental way - so to speak. You get an idea of the deadly, dreary desert, the deadlier bounty hunters and the deadliest of 'em all - Clint Eastwood - the man with no name! The story is a simple one to follow and is brilliantly executed by Sergio Leone using just the right landscapes along with some pretty good sets too (like the one featuring the Civil War sequence). Some of the scenes were meant to be symbolic (especially the Civil War scenes) and they did their job well.Eli Wallach is simply superb with his "Blondieeee!!!" screams and curses. Lee Van Cleef seems as deadly as the great Eastwood himself as "The Bad" guy.Cinematography - not as continuous as one would like - but manages to convey the tension in the dueling scenes very effectively.Also, the music - Ennio Morricone at his best! He has dished out some very innovative and brilliant stuff for all the three "great" westerns and this along with "For a Few Dollars More" seems to be his best.Finally, the style! Sergio Leone can certainly teach a thing or two to Quentin Tarantino or The Wachowski Brothers - in fact Tarantino acknowledges Leone's great style. And then the epitome of style himself - Clint Eastwood - with a half-burnt cigar in his lips, unshaven face, tilted hat, ragged jeans, a worn out poncho and the sharpest scowl ever which can rub out any "Neo-with-million-dollar-goggles" off the face of the Earth.Not genre-defining, surely - it was invented by Hollywood. But somebody from Europe really showed the world how to make westerns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second best movie in Leone's superb spaghetti western "trilogy".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people choose 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly' as the best of Sergio Leone's superb spaghetti western "trilogy" (I'm putting trilogy in inverted commas because the three movies actually have no connection to each other, and Clint Eastwood, despite the "Man With No Name" tag, plays a different character in each). Now it's a very close call I admit, but as much as I love this movie I'm inclined to choose the one before it 'For A Few Dollars More' as my favourite. Anyway, this is still a superb piece of pure entertainment, and Leone's movies had a massive impact on not just the western genre but action and adventure movies of all kinds. Clint Eastwood is super cool playing "Blondie" just as he was as Joe in the first movie and Monco in the second. FAFDM added a strong supporting character by Lee Van Cleef, TGTBATU continues that (though Van Cleef is playing a completely different guy) and also brings in Eli Wallach as Tuco, who adds some nice comic touches. Blondie and Tuco have lots of great scenes together, but I could have done with a lot more Angel Eyes (Van Cleef), one of the greatest screen villains of all time. Having three strong roles instead of just Eastwood is one of the great things about this movie. Another great thing is the unforgettable score by Morricone. Morricone did some of his most memorable work with Leone, and this could just be the best of the lot. Certainly the main theme (a massive hit single in the late 1960s as covered by Hugo Montenegro) is one of the most recognisable and original pieces of film music ever. Another standout is the spectacular bridge scene, surely a direct inspiration for Peckinpah's 'The Wild Bunch', a movie which owed Leone a sizable debt in my opinion. It's very difficult to pick this movie apart and single out what is so great about it as it really works as a whole. There's almost nothing wrong with it. It's one of the greatest westerns ever made and a hugely enjoyable movie that is just as compelling on your tenth viewing as your first. If you haven't seen it before I still think watching 'A Fistful Of Dollars' and 'For A Few Dollars More' first is the smartest movie, despite the three movies being a trilogy in name only, and each of the three being able to stand alone. Each movie is brilliant stuff and each comes with my highest recommendation. Movies don't get much more entertaining than this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's not a lot to say about this one that hasn't been said. You have to enjoy the sweeping, desolate Spanish vistas. And, as it has been pointed out as a plot hole, it is an interesting technique that what ever is out of the frame, is unnoticed by the characters, such as Angel Eyes making it all the way to the Stanton grave without being noticed approaching (on horseback) over open land. I found it distracting the way many characters spoke in Spanish or Italian and were dubbed into English. I have always disliked dubbed movies and preferred subtitles, but this one was odd, with some characters speaking English, and some not. It must have made for interesting rehearsals and filming. I would have to agree with others that Eli Wallach largely stole the show. And does anyone know if Lee Van Cleef really was short part of his right middle finger, or did they splice in someone else's hand for that shootout scene?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See This If You Don't Like Westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was a kid, nobody liked westerns. Our fathers had fought in the Korean War, and the astronauts were racing in space. Cowboys seemed old, dusty, and boring. Then along came three guys to change all that. One was good, the other bad, the other ugly. Or maybe they all had those three characteristics in them. But they arrived at one hell of a showdown, and it changed things.This is not just an action filled western, but a sweeping commentary on the American character, as witnessed by an objective outsider. His aim was true.By the mid 60s, the western formula, and perhaps the action film itself, had become too stale and conventional to evoke any enthusiastic response. Leone gave us not just a new perspective on film violence, but for the first time a director blended the most fascinating elements of American history, both mythical and real, into a traditional western story.The storyline, involving three untitled men propelled by avarice into uncivilized territory, could serve as a fable for the expansion of the American frontier. Against the sun-blasted background we see the elements that have shaped, in different ways, the essential American character: warfare, technology, weapons, hardened individualism. Previous western films might have explored related themes, but never with the exciting visual style shown in this one.The characters are men we really have never seen before. They are enigmatic, inscrutable, and fascinating to look at. Leone leaves their pasts unmarked so we can eagerly fill in their backgrounds on our own. As their journey in pursuit of lucre ends, we are presented with the best showdown in the history of the western. The quest, exciting as it was, culminates in one of the best endings in movie history.The score of course is famous in itself but welded to the fascinating visuals and characters it becomes one for the ages. Amazing it took an Italian director filming in Spain to make the essential "American" western film. You don't like westerns? I urge you to try this and see things from an outsider's point of view. His aim was true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leone overcooks his spaghetti.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Good' is sharp-shooter Blondie (Clint Eastwood), although how someone who runs a bounty racket, betrays his friend, and shoots numerous people dead can be deemed good is beyond me. Bandit Tuco (Eli Wallach) is 'The Ugly', which I think is a little unfair to the bloke: he's no George Clooney, but he's not Quasimodo either. That leaves cold-hearted killer Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) as 'The Bad', which he most definitely is, even going so far as to kill a child in order to achieve his goals. After Blondie and Tuco chance upon a dying Confederate soldier who reveals to them the whereabouts of a fortune in gold, the pair come to the attention of Angel Eyes, who will do anything to lay his hands on the treasure.The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, the third film in Sergio Leone's Dollars trilogy, is an epic spaghetti western that benefits from iconic central characters, an undeniable sense of cool, and, of course, that classic Ennio Morricone soundtrack (Waaawawah, waa waa waa!). Where the film doesn't fare quite so well is in the pacing and storytelling, the basic plot?three guys go in search of hidden treasure?stretched painfully thin, particularly in the Extended Cut, which clocks in at approximately three hours. The expansive historical backdrop?the American Civil War?frequently detracts from the flow of the story and Leone has a tendency to labour a little too much over his style, lingering on his characters for an eternity and repeating similar shots ad nasueum, all of which causes scenes to drag. Fortunately, some nice touches of humour and a couple of neat plot twists help to make matters a little easier to digest.6/10. Not quite as hard-going as Once Upon A Time In The West, but not a patch on the earlier Dollars movies, or indeed, Leone's underrated A Fistful of Dynamite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie at least 20 years ahead of its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I was scrolling through IMDb 250, I saw "Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo" at #4. My initial thought "Huh, 1966 movie, not worth watching. Runtime(179 min) also convinced my mind against watching this. But another half of my mind said, "Dude, you can't afford miss an IMDb #4 movie. So, I saw the movie and till date I have watched it at least 25 times. Hats off to Sergio Leone for making such a great and legendary movie and that too in 1966 with limited resources. None of the "Spagetti Westerns" are close such brilliance, not even the other 2 in this series. Leone has extracted out a stupendous performance from "Eli Wallach". Clint Eastwood was good as usual. Shooting locations are brilliant and the supportive background score is very catchy. The movie is a bit slow in the beginning, but once it catches pace, it deeply involves the audience. Some people have argued that #4 is too high for this movie, but its not 'some' who make the IMDb list, its the majority. Speaking of Leone, I believe that he was at least 15-20 years ahead of time. He has served as inspirations for such genre in all parts of the world, be it 'Sholay' in India, 'El Desaro' in Spain, and many more. I would like to go with a 9 out of 10 for this movie and its a flick which you just can't afford to miss this</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterfully shot; masterfully scored; masterfully directed, Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a stunning and highly involving piece - just masterful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone's 1966 Western The Good, the Bad and the Ugly unfolds under this hostile, violent and hate filled umbrella of Civil War America; a fitting backdrop of ongoing warfare and hostilities to which two American men and a Mexican bandit strive to find a large box full of valuable coins buried out in the big country somewhere behind Confederate Army lines. In using a plot item as routine as said example and applying it to a relatively routine singular strand arc for the film's narrative to take, Leone essentially breathes so much life into a set up and plot plan that about half way through you forget the basic bare bones of the movie and find yourself going with it, utterly immersed in the tale the director's laying out in front of you. So much has been written and said about the film, like other such examples at the top of each genre, that further comment and analysis may seem futile. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly may very well be the pinnacle to the western as Psycho might be to horror or Apocalypse Now to the war, for instance. If it isn't, or either of the said examples aren't, then there will still be a large cluster of individuals that would sternly argue otherwise.The film begins with a loud and confrontational title sequence, a brash and expansive manner in which to announce your film has arrived; the sort that sees a flashing of character faces and arrays of different colour, a sequence in which even the little animated horse gets the full force of a cannonball that's been fired off. It sets the tone for a no holds barred ride of guns; gunslingers and no nonsense people with no nonsense attitudes as observations of greed and that of both a mid and post-war crumbling society plays out. The film features some of the best direction I've ever seen; Leone's ability to shift gears and change the film's tact from one thing to another, as loyalties shift and events take a turn for the different is near-flawless. His ability to essentially construct a number of small, minute set-pieces amidst this wide-open and dusty, hostile setting is immaculate; but the change of tact he applies later on towards the end of the film in capturing a Civil War battle between the North and South is just as impressive; portraying a larger fight sequence as the inevitable showdown between the film's three main players draws nearer and that sense their showdown will be of a similarly epic proportion, despite it being just another gunfight and despite the fact all of those thus far have been between grossly outmatched participants.Leone is all for spectacle and action to propel the plot, but his ability to capture the little things; the terrain and just the sounds that it omits is wonderful. The introduction of Angel Eyes, aka The Bad (van Cleef), for instance sees a young boy flee into his house on first sight of him as he arrives; Angel Eyes' boots stomping on a stone floor whilst he approaches an elderly man sitting at a table as a dog barks outside, all of it a routine use of composition and SFX, but the drawn out editing process; the fact a kid ran for his life at first sight of him and the semiotical driven noise of a barking dog which suggests a rabid animal or ominousness build the scene and character without anyone ever explaining or saying anything.They call him The Bad because he shoots without mercy and takes without conscience, leaving a family in tatters and on another occasion beats a girl to a near pulp until she gives him what info he's looking for. The name Angel Eyes is wholly ironic. This makes Clint Eastwood's 'Good' (aka Blondie) and Wallach's 'Ugly' (aka Tuco) perhaps look more favourable than they actually are when it's revealed they're mostly in it together against this blackly dressed; father/husband murdering; woman slapping figure of evil. Tuco and Blondie's relationship is a strange one, a mutual appreciation of one another and the death they leave in their wake. Tuco would no sooner shoot Blondie, than hang him, than act like they're best friends. No longer is 'The Good' of a western limited to wearing the sheriff's badge and/or cleaning up towns of drunks and no-good varmints; as here, 'The Good' would much rather come across as upstanding; fleece a local sheriff of $2,000 and then make off with the cash against the guy he was initially in tow with.Tuco's raging attitudes are captured in a single shot that encompasses a sketching of Christ on the cross as he swigs alcohol whilst wearing an eye-patch, the film at a point where Tuco seems to be doing good in aiding an old friend but perhaps with a traitorous eye still on the prize as the patch acts as a visual distinction of the two sides of his face doubling up as his sinful and righteous attitudes, whereas he gives the Holy Trinity throughout. But THE scene that encapsulates his character is in a store early on during which, betrayed and foaming at the mouth for revenge, he fondles some handguns in front of an elderly clerk before angrily discarding them. He then fondles some more and asks for bullets, drawing you into the scene in an utterly effective manner and its threat element within as we wonder what he has in store for the clerk above all else. There's a solid hour of character involvement and some set-piece exchanges which work wonderfully well; and a later juxtaposition between diegetic musical content with an interrogation brought a smirk to my face when I realised whom it was that felt so inspired to pay homage to such a sequence. The film is engrossing, rich in detail on so many levels and an absolute outright winner of a piece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One the greatest, most impressive, interesting, breathtaking, and groundbreaking films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is one of those movies that everyone has heard of but not enough people have seen. It pushed itself rather boldly into pop culture and 44 years after it first hit theaters in Italy, it still gains respect and admiration in the United States.It's the third part of the Man With No Name Trilogy, and was preceded by Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More, both of which are very commendable films themselves. All three movies revolve around the titular man, who goes by a different alias in each film, this time being called Blondie. The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly is a prequel to the first two movies, meaning that it is not required to watch them first and this film stands alone fine.The story begins by introducing us to our three central characters: the violent but childish Tuco (the ugly), the heartless mercenary Angel Eyes (the bad), and the mysterious bounty hunter Blondie (the good). While traveling through the desert, Blondie and Tuco come across a dying man who knows the location of a huge deposit of gold buried in a cemetery. Tuco hears the name of the cemetery and Blondie hears the name of the grave, but neither will tell the other for fear of being double-crossed so they are forced to work together. As they embark on an incredibly journey through 1860s Southern America as it is torn apart by the Civil War, they encounter various obstacles including but not limited to the involvement of Angle Eyes, who also wants the money. The whole thing ends with a heart-pounding standoff at the center of the cemetery in which all three men put their lives on the line.The story is gripping and genuinely interesting, the actors all put forth outstanding performances, the cinematography is as good as it gets, the music has to be heard to be believed, and the climax is one of the most intense events ever recorded on film. There's no such thing as a perfect movie, but this one comes as close as any will likely get.</fullReview>

Well those things hardly matter when you have Blondie, Tuco, Angel Eyes , The drunk Army Captain on screen exhibiting something completely out of this world in terms of cinematic achievement.I have never seen a better genre in movies than westerns and in that genre this movie stands out.

		<fullReview>I spent all day watching all three movies and this one beats the other two and near every other western out there. (with a few exceptions...) Usually, Spaghetti westerns annoy me do to the cheesy noises, unrealistic shooting, and lots of bore. But this movie was different. Unlike the other two, this movie had lots of simple comedy. (Most from Eli Wallach's silliness and stupidity as Tuco adds a perfect sense of comic relief and Clint Eastwood's slickness and intelligence as Blondie makes him so.... cool. Lee Van Cleef does a perfect job as the villain giving a sinister performance. Instead of the fact that the slow parts in the first two movies were boring, this movie took advantage of long shots for suspense and to get a sense of things which is a great directing tool. (Kudos to Sergio Leone) I can surely see why this is #4 on the IMDb top 250. It feels more realistic than the other two movies. No whistling noises when things fall, suspenseful music(and very famous), stellar acting, and nice shoot outs. One of my favorite Clint Eastwood movies and one of my favorite westerns ever! A+. 10/10 Watch this one right away. (I recommend watching the new edition DVDs, the white cases, because the quality is better, the sound is great, and newer, and the dubbing is near impossible to spot.) Don't miss this or you will miss one of the greatest, classic movies ever made.</fullReview>

I always enjoy hearing the famous opening title theme. (it's 10 minutes into the film before anyone says anything). the film revolves around the 3 main characters, Eastwood, Wallach, Van Cleef. I thought Eli Wallach was brilliant as his role as tuco/the ugly. and Van Cleef as the the bad, with those eyes, was the perfect baddie.The film really could be summed up as 3 gunslingers on there search for $100,000 of gold coins in a grave. Wallach knows the name of the cemetery and Eastwood knows the name of the grave. Van Cleef finds out by torturing Wallach when Eastwood and Wallach accidentally become P.o.W. The 3 men end up in the cemetery where there is a great showdown, one of the best the camera zooming into all 3 mens eyes and the music as well, classic stuff. Van Cleef ends up getting shot and Eastwood and Wallach split the gold.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And Sergio Leone had to show Hollywood how a western should be done. Earthy, gritty, moody, rambling, funny and just plain nasty too. One thing most people forget about the Sergio Leone Dollar trilogy films is that they were made when westerns were really staid and boring, with zero atmosphere and very mechanical. Then came these movies, with THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY being the last and the greatest of the three Dollar films. Cinema wasn't the same after it was released. And to show influential this film is, it transcended its "western" genre and influenced practically every type of films made after that. Heck, I'm not even a western fan and I thoroughly admire what Leone and the gang created here. It's big, bold, melancholic, lusty, giddy and operatic.The thing I really love about THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is the atmosphere. It's almost one kind. Never duplicated in any other film since (and that includes Clint Eastwood's dry cowboy flicks). One major contributing factor is obviously Ennio Morricone's unforgettable score, probably one of the greatest scores ever made. The music during the ending, when Tuco searches the cemetery, it's spine tinglingly powerful.Of the three characters, Tuco steals the show. He's the heart and soul of film. It's probably Eli Wallach's greatest performance. He immersed himself in the role and, in the processed, really became Tuco.My only complaint about THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is that it is a low budget film and as expansive and epic as it is, the film sorta looks cheap. Practically everything was shot outside. There are few sets in the movie and when we are within four walls, the sets look, hmm, cheap. I just wished the production design was as expansive looking as the vision Leone had in mind. The film would have been perfect then. But that's something I can clearly overlook.When I watch a movie like THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY, I get depressed. Depressed because at one time films were actually amazing, groundbreaking and entertaining. The 1960s were one of the greatest era in movie-making. Sadly today's films don't even come close to the stunning creative output of that decade. They should re-release THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY on the big screen. It's a classic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eight of Ten Stars. I was so enamored of this movie as a teen that my Northwestern University freshman dorm wall was papered with big B&amp;W posters of mssrs. Eastwood, Wallach and Van Cleef in the Fall of 1968. I was quite the little existentialist then; "If it feels good, DO IT!" was the mantra of my high school Senior English teacher. Well, it felt good, and bad, and ugly. I ended up dropping out of Northwestern after Kent State and, taking the soundtrack of GBU (in my head) with me to Vietnam in 1971, I proceeded to get a real-world education in the old 'ultra-violence' as an infantryman in the AMERICAL Division... WHAT you may ask does this have to do with an American Civil War movie, directed and written by an Italian Communist? (Sergio Leone's daddy may have been more of a commie than Sergio was, but the fact is that "A Fistful of Dollars" was STOLEN from Kurosawa, while "The Magnificent Seven" was PURCHASED years before. The end justifies the means? Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery?) http://www.fistful-of-leone.com/classic/articles/prof.html I found out firsthand the moral ambiguities of war. If only I had paid attention to the subtext in GBU! If only I had studied the Matthew Henry battlefield dead tintypes as Leone so obviously had! His hideous, rotting carcases of Union and Confederate soldiers, bloating in direct sunlight, would have sufficiently revulsed me from any notion that I could 'play soldier' and survive! But here I am, having just barely survived.... and I just got out of the fabulous Fox Theater here in Atlanta where the restored GBU was projected in all its Technicolor/Technirama glory at fully loaded, screaming Morricone volume.... there must have been at least a thousand people there, and hardly anyone moved. INCREDIBLE. It is said that the movie was made to the tunes Morricone made prior to production's start; i.e. Leone played the music while shooting the scenes! Hence, these epics are giant music videos - fantasias - symphonic cinema- they are huge, elegiac tone poems! And, God help me, I still love this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a classic. It's spectacular, it's thrilling, it's beautiful. You won't find anything like this now-a-days, no matter how hard you try. Anyone who hasn't seen this movie should be ashamed of himself.The plot is simple - Blondie (Clint Eastwood), the Good, Tuco (Eli Wallach), the Ugly, and Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), the Bad, are all after a stash of Confederate gold, holding 200,000 dollars in gold, during the American Civil War. Seems like a pretty simple plot for 1 and a half hours, let alone 3. So what drives this movie? Style. Cinematography. Atmosphere. Let me explain.The first scene in the movie is the (rather unappealing) face of a bandit. It then switches to a wide shot of the small town he and his two companions are entering. A few more shots of the bandits. They enter an inn, and gunshots are heard. Out the window comes charging Tuco, clutching a gun in one hand and meat in the other. The image freezes while he's in midair, and the writing "The Ugly" appears on the screen. The first half hour or so serves to introduce the three main characters in similar fashion. No plot progression whatsoever, merely introduction. Most movies would fall with a start like that, but not this one. It takes more than an hour before the rush for the gold begins, and by that hour you already know everything you can and need to know about the three anti-heroes: Blondie is the Good. He is not good at all under normal standards, as he is an outlaw, a killer and he betrays his "friend". But he seems good in comparison to the other slime-balls in the movie: Tuco is a villain, pure and simple. He steals, murderers, rapes, and does a bunch of other nasty things. But he is still fun and amusing, while the sinister Angel Eyes stands in comparison - a menacing figure in black clothing with an evil mustache, who kills and double-crosses without blinking for a few more dollars.And the movie doesn't follow a plot. The plot is just a background for the amazing scenes that come one after another and construct the movie - you go from one scene to the other. And there are many memorable scenes in this movie: The first time Blondie shoots the rope before Tuco is hanged to death. Blondie's march through the desert. Tuco and Blondie's capture by the Yankees. Tuco's torture. Tuco's gunfight in the tub and the classic line that follows. The showdown in the deserted town. The bridge being blown up. Tuco's search for the grave. And of course, the amazing climax. But I'll get to that later.We've covered the style, but I also mentioned cinematography and atmosphere. And the cinematography is amazing. Wide shots of towns and deserts zoom to close-ups of desperate and rugged men. The effect is amazing, especially during gunfights. It creates tension and suspense, and that leads me to the second point I mentioned: atmosphere. This feels like the West. The people look dirty and hard-working. The buildings look rickety. And when time is spent looking at each other before the guns are drawn for a few short seconds when the men fire at each other, you feel what it's like to be there.And finally, as I mentioned before, the climax. Possibly the best climax in a movie ever. A Mexican Standoff between the three main characters in the film - Blondie, Angel Eyes and Tuco. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Minutes pass as they stare at each other, each bringing their hand a bit closer to the gun. The music becomes more and more dramatic as time passes. You wait, and then... They fire, and it's over. A duel as a duel should be. It's mind-blowing.Few movies can reach the level of this masterpiece. Fewer still can surpass it. They don't make 'em like this anymore, and it's a damn shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Upon release of this movie the critics were not so mild with there comments, but this is in my opinion the best western ever made! Everything in this movie is well balanced. It shows how the west really was in my opinion. The director Sergio Leone takes his time to tell the story. He uses different types of camera angles, extreme close ups etc. This makes The Good The Bad And The Ugly a feast for your eyes! Also the actors are well casted. Eastwood plays his part with excellence as do the other two actors. Especially Eli Wallach is perfect in his role of Tuco. The music of Ennio Morricone is also the best! The openings-tune is known all over the world.It's a movie I can watch over and over again. And every time I do so, I discover new things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third of Sergio Leone's trilogy of spaghetti westerns is his definitive masterpiece.This epic,sprawling western is graced by breathtaking photography, a fantastic score and Leone's masterful direction. The performances are all iconic with scene-stealer Eli Wallach the standout.The earlier films in the trilogy don't have the same tremendous sweep and scope.The dry and dark humor also elevates this classic to greater heights.Although I'm always somewhat annoyed by the acting of the Italian supporting cast, with their excessive macho laughing and some assorted weird characters,it doesn't detract from the enjoyment of these movies."The Good,the Bad and the Ugly" is in my opinion one of the best westerns ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People like to throw the term 'Masterpiece' around and rarely is it ever as apt and as TRUE when concerning Sergio Leone's The Good the Bad and The Ugly.I mean, where to start? How about the music for instance, Morricone writes truly inspirational and masterful work, sure, everyone knows the theme tune, but his music has influenced EVERY western reference since. He captures the mood, the emotion and makes this movie EPIC with his wonderfully orchestrated scores. The landscapes and scenery are visually stunning and it's perfectly filmed for true atmosphere, intertwining with the aforementioned music, well it's nothing short of magnificent. Every scene is influential and significant, and equally as intriguing. The acting by Clint Eastwood can take no other meaning but 'cool'. He is what every gun-slinging', cigarette chewing cowboy is based on post-this and no doubt has inspired TONS of action heroes (Or indeed Villains) throughout cinema.But the storyline isn't as basic as one would first imagine: three gunmen searching for a rather large sum of money, it seems that simple. However, all of the gunmen have complex personalities and none are flawless in moral judgment, to which it is hard to judge who is indeed 'Good', 'Bad' or 'Ugly'. The classic 'Good Versus Evil' situation that is such a frequent theme in film (And coincidentally, more often in westerns) is slightly blurred in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly and I personally think there is no definite and it is left up to the viewer to decide.This movie is simply essential viewing, an all-time classic and much deeper than would first appear. Incredible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simple classic and a must see by every Eastwood fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a Clint Eastwood fan for years. But I have NEVER watched his Westerns. That's kind of idiotic isn't it?? Well suddenly I'm having an Eastwood movement and sinking myself into Westerns for the first time in my life and it only made sense that I start with what some critics and fans call "The Greatest Western ever made." In some respects I agree with that because it embodies everything that the Western is...even if you have never seen a Western you know the way they are supposed to go and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly encompasses every aspect of the stereotypical Western. Also a film like this has to be judged by it's release time as well and for 1966, this film's violent and gritty story would have made heads explode and Eastwood's trademark Man with No Name made Eastwood the gosh darned coolest, slickest man in history. The story explodes into an epic 3 + hour (extended cut) film about three man of completely different personalities, backgrounds, and goals trying to find a hidden treasure by a Civil War soldier and stay alive while basically beating the living daylights out of each other. The film is gritty, bleak, and the three main characters are so watchable that each one could carry their own film.Clint Eastwood...how can you possibly say that name and then try to critique the man's acting. If you looked up the definition of masculine in the dictionary...there his picture would be...probably from this film. Eastwood's raspy voice, his "doesn't take any crap" attitude, and completely violent personality (in his characters of course) makes him the best gun fighter in ANY Western. He is the perfect leading man especially for a Western and he had to be THE GOOD in The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Eastwood is Eastwood and that is the highest compliment you can give. Lee Van Cleef embodies THE BAD, I mean the man has being a villain down to a science and although he doesn't share a whole lot of screen time with the stars he has his own brand of justice that makes him the perfect villain. In a lot of ways he is the polar opposite of Eastwood. He still has the raspy voice, and the cool demeanor and he has this killer instinct that makes him petrifying to see on screen. But all in all he doesn't get the majority of the story and there is a lot of back story to his character left unexplored. I would have loved to see a sequel or another story where he plays Angel Eyes because it would have great to see him back on screen in this role. And finally I save the best for last. I have found a new absolute favorite screen character in Tuco played by veteran actor Eli Wallach. Tuco is THE UGLY in every way shape and form. His drunken, sarcastic, and annoying personality makes him the real stand out performance in this film. In fact he seems to get the majority of the lines and the screen time as we watch his journey to try and get rich. And on top of that the tumultuous relationship between his off again, on again partner Eastwood's "Blondie" as named by Tuco. The two of them start as partners until Eastwood turns on him and leaves him which only makes Tuco seek revenge in a horrible way, one of the great scenes where Tuco forces Eastwood across the desert nearly killing him in the process. But you know that can only mean Eastwood will get the last word and he does. Tuco is amazing. He's hilarious, he's bumbling, but he has fantastic good luck when it comes to getting away and on top of it all despite his humorous character he's not easy to kill or a push over. He's blood thirsty, crafty and skilled as a gun man and a villain. The whole film must be watched for Wallach's Tuco alone.This is my first taste but not my last of Eastwood Westerns and Sergio Leone who apparently is the be all and end all of Action western directors. I have the first two installments of the Man With No Name trilogy fired up in the VCR and ready to go. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly in many ways is not outstanding and yet it has this mysterious quality that just sucks you in and makes it an absolute classic. From the dusty streets of the Western town amidst the brooding Civil War and the front, this film encompasses everything. And you can't mention the film without pointing out that haunting Western theme which almost seems like it's used comically but perhaps that's because it has been used as such in the future. You can't ever start a love for Westerns without seeing this...I have no doubt. And it will permanently go down in my books as one of my favorite Westerns. I will say it didn't need to be as long as it was and perhaps more of a climatic ending would have been nice but it's a classic and you can barely pick it apart. Made on a million bucks and probably 100 times that made back. Just see it!! 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of westerns, but feel I've shoved myself in a sci fi horror orientated corner of ignorance so am slowly working my way through the IMDb top 250 in an attempt to broaden my horizons (and possibly catch that rare film that blows u away without expecting it) I did REALLY appreciate the level of accomplishment this film expressed. For its time the cinematic atmosphere of comedy, emotion and gritty drama was clearly above average for even now, and the acting skills were brilliant and really added personality.however (and i don't think its cuz I'm a girl) this film just wasn't for me. it was very slowly paced and i didn't manage to follow or care much for the characters stories.that said, i would definitely recommend watching it as its surely one of those films that depends heavily on personal tastes, and judging it as a western just doesn't give it the respect it warrants.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a bemusing, violent and stylish Western, it's the best Sergio Leone . The film takes part of ¨the man without name¨ trilogy united to ¨For a fistful dollars¨, and ¨ A few dollars more¨.The movie centers about the ugly (Eli Wallach) , the bad (Lee Van Cleef) and the good (Clint Eastwood) in search for a Confederate treasure buried on a cemetery whose tracks have got the three enemies and is set during American Civil War.It's too much violent but is neither tiring, nor boring, but entertaining. The film mingles noisy action , impressive battles, shootouts, violence with strong tortures, tongue in cheek, satire and a little bit of humor.The final showdown between the three contenders is breathtaking.In spite of the fact the runtime is overlong , nevertheless isn't dull . Direction by Sergio Leone is magnificent. Ennio Morricone musical score is extraordinary , the soundtrack has been imitated and copied by thousand occasions. Morricone's iconic theme music was designed in places to mimic the sound of a howling coyote . Production design by Carlo Simi and cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli is riveting . Shot in the deserts and landscapes of Spain : Burgos and Almeria , with 1,500 Spanish soldiers as extras .Eli Wallach is very well , as he steals the show , he interprets a humorous and greedy murderous thief , Lee Van Cleef plays a villain and ominous killer and Clint Eastwood makes a dirty and wry 'man without name'.This quintaessential 'Spaguetti' originated great influence of wide range in Western . It was such a good picture that had a great success. Followed by ¨ Once upon a time in West¨and ¨Duck you sucker¨.Rating: very nice, above average 8'5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a meandering nature about "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" that keeps me from enjoying it as highly as I think I should. It's certainly not as tight as "For a Few Dollars More", and it really tends to drag during the desert torture and the army scenes (which pop up with surprising frequency). Even the final shootout was too much; I just wanted Leone to get on with it. It's "epic" scope just seems to topple in on itself.That said, there's much to like here, and the built-up acclaim over the years is certainly merited. For one, the framing and composition in this film are amazing. Not sure I've seen such effective use of widescreen in another western. Leone knows how to make the western landscapes eye- catching. Each of the film's stars fits his character well (Wallach, especially, who just seems to relish Tuco's streetrat sense of guile). And it's just one double-cross after another, right up until the very end. It's fun from that standpoint. Just overinflated.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good, The Better, The Best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a span of 3 years, Sergio Leone changed the entire landscape of westerns with his Dollars Trilogy. The change began with A Fistful of Dollars, got accelerated with For A Few Dollars More but it wasn't until Leone unveiled The Good, the Bad &amp; the Ugly that the final nail on the coffin of the traditional westerns was hammered for good. Making major upgrades in all departments, the third chapter not only turns out to be the best of the three but is also one of the greatest &amp; most influential motion pictures ever made.The Good, the Bad &amp; the Ugly is the story of three men racing against each other to find a fortune in gold buried in a distant cemetery. The film begins with a stylish introduction of the trio, places its story against the backdrop of American Civil War &amp; manages to create some brilliant situations of escalating tension throughout its runtime that finally culminates with an unforgettable final showdown which, in my opinion, remains the greatest climax ever filmed in cinema history.The direction by Sergio Leone is an absolute class. Not only this film presents him at the creative heights of his career but also in complete control of his skill. The screenplay itself boasts many catchphrases &amp; is infused with lots of humour. Cinematography transforms the barren landscapes into scenic beauties but also contributes to the drama through multiple close-ups &amp; controlled stillness to add uncertainty to the scenes. And in spite of clocking in at 177 minutes of runtime, the film seems to fly over thanks to its clever editing.Coming to the performances, Clint Eastwood plays the good character with sublime style. Lee Van Cleef stars as the bad character &amp; impresses as the ruthless &amp; sociopathic mercenary. But the real show-stealing performance amongst the three turned out to be Eli Wallach's rendition of the ugly character. With effortless use of wit &amp; expressions, Wallach nails his role of an outlaw to absolute perfection, is also responsible for the comic relief in this film delivers &amp; even the story is more inclined towards his journey as we eventually learn about his background unlike the other two characters.Last but not the least, the most important aspect worth mentioning about is Ennio Morricone's famous score. Captivating from the very first frame, the way the music drives this film is sheer perfection. Staying true to its origins &amp; picking up from right where it left off in the previous chapter, the score makes extensive use of whistles, gunshot &amp; cannon fires that permeates the film seamlessly &amp; the main theme is something you've already heard even if you haven't seen the film. But where it's as its best is in the final climactic moments, turning the sequence into a truly bone-chilling, unforgettable &amp; haunting experience that remains unsurpassed to this date.On an overall scale, the ingenious direction of Sergio Leone &amp; musical genius of Ennio Morricone is a combination that yet remains to be challenged &amp; probably may never be equalled. And these two alone make this film pretty good. Add the strong &amp; scintillating performances of Eastwood, Van Cleef &amp; Wallach to that and the mixture just gets better. And finally, on adding this film's perfection in other filmmaking aspects like cinematography, editing, set pieces, every minute detailing &amp; the final showdown, we have a cinema that's simply the best.Immortal for its contribution to western genre, The Good, the Bad &amp; the Ugly is a stunning work of expert filmmaking whose significance to art, culture &amp; cinema will never be forgotten. It's the greatest western ever made. It's one of the greatest films of all time. And it's my all time favourite foreign language film as well. Extremely recommended.And no you don't have to watch the previous two chapters before moving on to this one. So, sit back &amp; enjoy the western that changed westerns, forever.Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Long before Clint Eastwood would wince his way into the ham-hock Hall of Fame as Over-Rated Actor and God-Awful Director he was used to perfection by Director Sergio Leone in his spaghetti-Western masterpiece, "The Good, The Bad, &amp; The Ugly."This is a film so visually rich it reads more like a novel than a motion picture. Leone gets off on the grit: the beard-stubble, the sun-chapped lips, battered hat-brim and dirty leather boot. Not only is this the greatest Western ever made it may also stand as the greatest visual story ever committed to film. Leone is so genuinely fascinated by this period and its mythology that every frame is full and compelling... action occurs in both sprawling long shots and lightning bursts of quick-cut gunshot. Eli Wallach is amazing as Tuco, the human rodent, and Ennio Morricone's haunting score adds tremendous humanity to the proceedings.I have to admit I am not a fan of most American Westerns... the vast majority of them seemed to be disposable action flicks shot at the same five ranches using the same twelve horses. "The Good" elevates the Western to a higher art form than even John Ford or Howard Hawks' greatest films... it would serve as the visual blueprint for almost every Western to follow, and I highly suggest watching the movie with a glass of cool water nearby... you'll be thirsty.The perfect Saturday-afternoon movie (but be sure to watch in Letterbox!) "The Good, The Bad &amp; The Ugly" is an enduring cinematic classic not to be missed... one of the greats.GRADE: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whew. What a week. Just spent the last few nights watching the Dollars "Trilogy" for the first time and only because they're deemed classics. Not my brand of movies, but for the most part they were good, with my absolute favorite, by a landslide, A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, or "Part 1." Not to say this wasn't good. It certainly was and tremendously better than "Part 2," FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE. Interesting story, some unexpected humor, a fantastic score and real good characters portrayed by both Eastwood and Wallach. Definitely went on too long, as each movie in the sorta trilogy got progressively, and unnecessarily, longer. Probably by minor opinions, UNFORGIVEN was my first Clint Eastwood western and remains my favorite of his. On a side note, it sometimes makes for unintentional hilarity, when your first introduction to either a theme or cliché in a spoof or homage. Much like: I watched the AUSTIN POWERS movies first and repeatedly long before I watched all of the James Bond movies they mimicked and unfortunately, that made the Bond movies often hilarious when they weren't meant to be. Here, I saw and heard a lot I've already experienced many times in Quentin Tarantino films. I was like, "OH! That's where that's from." Haha. I digress?Yeah, I liked it, but none of these movies will I ever see again. If you're into westerns, specifically Spaghetti Westerns, you might enjoy these. But, only then.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's this fellow with no name who is hanging around with a ne'er do well called Tuco - No Name collects a reward for Tuco then, just as they are about to hang Tuco, No Name shoots the rope and they escape. This scam serves them quite well until a stolen army payroll enters the equation at which point, together with a ferrety-faced individual, the three of them find themselves reluctant allies and less reluctant antagonists as, against a backdrop of the Civil War, they try to track down the payroll.Let me set out the bits which I would quibble with. The Spanish locations - undoubtedly photogenic - don't look even slightly like the places they are supposed to represent. The dubbing on the non-English speaking cast has some places where the English speech is hopelessly out of synchronisation with the mouth movements of the cast members. And, sad to say, it does ramble somewhat.So what is good about it? Well, Ennio Morricon's score is wonderful, and I don't just mean the seminal theme: it is full of haunting melody and dramatic arrangements. The set pieces are brilliantly staged, especially the bridge sequence and the entire closing section. Plus, notwithstanding that this is his third appearance, it is an education to see Eastwood's seminal character cemented into iconhood, especially as his costume is assembled bit by bit throughout the film.Take no notice of my quibbles! It is a classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best western i've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie more than forty years ago the first time. I was a little, stupid kid, and all i liked about this movie was shots and coursing, but now, when my sons watch at this, I can understand the master piece it is. The history is fantastic, the characters are all bad asses with sense of humor, you will love them, the art direction deserved an Oscar, and the acting by the fantastic Clint Eastwood too, for not talking about the music. About 2 years ago I saw "Once upon a time in America", by Sergio Leone. And I realized that this director was a master that deserved respect, remembering this movie. You will love this movie, I tell ya, your sons too, you maybe worry about the length, but that three hours are not wasted at all. And there are two more movies of the trilogy, but you can see this one as a separated movie. I loved it, it's on my personal top 5 rank.(with "The godfather", "12 angry men","Pulp fiction" and "Goodfellas") A little spoiler over here: the final scene with Tuco running at the sementary in just the most exiting thing I've ever seen, the music helped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never before has two hours and forty minutes whipped by so fast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" is one of the pinnacles of my experiences of a moviegoer. Not only is it my all-time favorite Western and therefore, one of my all-time favorite movies regardless of genre, but is a landmark in the history of cinema itself. First of all, it is proof that oftentimes the simplest ideas are the best ones. The plot is fairly simple: three men try to reach a buried fortune of Army gold coins while the Civil War erupts around them. The story is even simpler and yet the audience gets wrapped around in it as 160 minutes and those 160 minutes just seem to whip by so fast that when the movie does end, we're craving for more. The film is also evidence that the Western is not a dying genre, for this landmark film from Italian director Sergio Leone has aged like wine; time has done nothing to varnish its style and authority. And it is also proof that Spaghetti Westerns, which are low in budget and oftentimes flamboyant and over-the-top, can be art, too.This was the third and final time that Clint Eastwood worked with Sergio Leone. He returns again as the mysterious Man with No Name: a cigar-chugging bounty hunter quick on the draw and minimal in emotions. Here is the pinnacle of the vintage Eastwood as an actor, where he could manufacture a character by doing little other than squinting and hissing some sparse dialogue. Eastwood's in prime form here. The movie also features Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes, a mercenary/bounty hunter/Army colonel, the exact opposite of the warm-hearted character he played in the previous Western "For a Few Dollars More." But oddly enough, even though Eastwood gets top billing, the central character is Tuco, played with outstanding charisma and sharp energy by Eli Wallach. Wallach had played bad guys and anti-heroes before, but here as the bumbling, deliberately comical, greedy, self-centered, and yet somehow likable and personable Tuco, he steals the show. The movie stays interesting as these three men change partnerships with each other, whenever it seems convenient and when it'll bring them closer to the 200,000 dollars in stolen coins. These three characters, wonderfully written and acted, are an important column holding this film's roof up.Sergio Leone was very much the David Lean of Italy. He could set up beautiful landscape shots and cinematography tricks like few others could. That's part of the reason why so little can happen for so long and yet the tension mounts higher than most. The way he also contrasts long shots with close-ups and montages it all is sheer brilliance. His timing is also exquisite. He knows how long to go, when to cut, when to produce a long take, when to crop a short one, and so on and so forth.And I cannot leave out Ennio Morricone's music, which is even more famous than the movie itself. His main theme, which has been used in parodies and cultural references for more than forty years, is justifiably famous. But whereas it is usually used in parodies to produce a comical effect, here it fits the mood of the picture down to the bone. There's not a single weak cue of music in this marvelous soundtrack.But what's most remarkable about this movie is that it sustains itself for the entirety of its 160-minute length and throughout most of it, very little happens. There are long stretches - minutes upon minutes - where virtually nothing happens. Oftentimes there isn't any music. It's not just the suspense of waiting for Leone's trademark bursts of action; the cinematography and the montage and the directing are so taut and winded together that the audience cannot even force themselves to look away. And if one seeks proof, they have to look no further than the film's climax. Of course because it's a Western, it will have an obligatory final showdown. But consider this showdown. We have three men facing each other down and it goes on for four minutes. Four minutes and the actors are hardly even moving. The only real movement is the camera, which is locked-down, but montaging amongst what is very nearly static images. Coupled with Ennio Morricone's heart-thumping music, this showdown, where very little happens for so long, comes across as one of the most electrifying climaxes in cinema history. Sure the music helps a lot, but it's the directing by Sergio Leone that really makes this scene so intense."The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" is most definitely one of the most important films of all time and it certainly has earned its immortality in the realm of the cinema. It is undoubtedly the greatest Spaghetti Western of them all and Sergio Leone's masterpiece. The first film is this trilogy, "A Fistful of Dollars" was nothing more than an off-beat, but fun remake of "Yojimbo." The second film was also entertaining and fun. But the third movie is a masterpiece. Even at a great length of 160 minutes, and having most of it consumed by silence and stillness, the film never falters to goes on for too long. It goes on and when it does at last end, the audience is left craving for more. They can satisfy themselves in two ways: a) seeking out Leone's director's cut, which is about twenty minutes longer and b) watching the movie again, something I have done and will continue to do many, many times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How good can a film be? This good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is rightly called a classic. Regardless of where you place it in your own list of the greatest films ever made, it will most likely be near the top. And that is what makes this such a classic ? it is more than just a damn good Western. It is a damn good film.Plot ? simple. There is some buried gold. Three lawless gunslingers are after it. They continue to run into each other and this gives the film momentum during the first two hours.So much has already been written about this film that it is impossible to sum up all of its influences and innovations. The haunting whistles of the first moments of the title sequence are instantly recognisable even to those who have never seen a Western. Clint Eastwood is instantly recognisable in a career-making role. No matter your verdict, this is an immensely important film.Director Sergio Leone has a sense for painful irony. 'The Good', Eastwood's character, begins the film by double crossing his partner (Eli Wallach's conflicted Tuco, 'The Ugly') and leaving him in the desert. This irony goes to the level of sight and sound. As 'The Bad' (Lee Van Cleef's Angel Eyes) tortures his victims at a Civil War P.O.W. camp, he orders the other prisoners to play their instruments to drown out the screams. The expressions on the faces of the musicians speaks volumes, and is more affecting to a modern audience than the scenes of torture themselves, gorged as we are on Saw and Hostel. It is this attention to storytelling detail in every frame of the film that makes it so rich and deep. How film-making has changed.While the film is long and slow, it has to be. The tension built up in the early parts of the film is punctuated by brief flashes of action, but it is the waiting before the action sequences that grabs you by the insides and slowly squeezes. There are ideas and emotions being played with in this film that cannot be quickly explained or unravelled, and these need the full three hours of the film to come to their conclusion. With the luxury of time, Leone is able to make a shared meal as tense and troubling as the moment, hands on guns, before a shootout.Even if you think the middle sections of the film dragged somewhat (philistine!) the finale is something special. In so many ways, it is the perfect climax to a film filled with moments of brilliance. There are too many parts to the film, too many special moments, to comment on any more, so I will simply say that this is a film I should have seen long before I did finally watch it. It is a film that, if you haven't seen, you should as soon as possible. And if you have seen it, a second, third or fifty-seventh viewing is in order. This film has quality that we are not given the privilege to see very often.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone's massive epic is one of my favorite films, pitting a manic Eli Wallach as Tuco against an autistic Clint Eastwood (Leone: Eastwood has two acting emotions, with hat on and hat off). Lee Van Cleef hovers around the the center of the film menacing everyone, although his performance fades between the tension of Wallach and Eastwood. Ostensibly a story about the search for buried gold, GBU undercuts its exploitative surface by giving us almost Beckett-like relationship between a man that is wanted for murder and his partner who turns him in for the reward and then shoots the rope off his neck, a droll comment on human existence if there ever was one. Other existential moments occur in this rich film, such as the beautiful song the confederate prisoners sing while Angel-Eyes tortures Tuco, and the essay on the nature of the futility and pointless brutality of war appears when Tuco and Blondie witness a battle on a bridge they must cross.Chaotic, cynical, sentimental, violent, GBU resembles an opera more than anything. Amazingly, when this film first appeared in 1967, most critics wrote it off as one more Spaghetti Western, not seeing the fatalism, the grandeur, and the comedy of this world classic. How could you watch a film with a score like Morricone's finest and not be impressed? Don't mistake this film for realism and criticize it on that basis, as some reviewers have done. This is not a documentary-style Western (for that see McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller), but a Romance, based more in the imagination, more in symbolism, bowing to the classical westerns stereotypes and clichés.11/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We're all Tuco</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best depictions of war, and one of the best anti-war films. The best gunfight ever filmed. Consistently witty, often moving, brutally realistically ugly, and one of the most beautiful films ever shot, set to one of the most beautiful scores. The 'spaghetti' label on the can means that these westerns will never get the consideration and respect they deserve. If you fancy thinking a little differently about 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly', try the following. Look past Clint Eastwood's legend-founding performance and suppose that the central character is actually Eli Wallach's Tuco, the Ugly. A gross rogue, guilty of every possible vice, Tuco is after all the character we see and hear the most, about whom we learn the most, and through whom we experience much of the action. Eli Wallach makes him comic, poignant, and plausible - certainly compared to the unrestrained darkness of Lee Van Cleef and the impossible cool of Eastwood. The film is largely Tuco's struggle to survive, and to earn a little on the side, constantly battered between Eastwood's "blond Angel" and Van Cleef's angel of death. Angels? Indeed: Tuco is ultimately human, and Tuco is all of us - grubby, corrupt, uncomfortable and slightly desperate humans, veering between the good and the bad, subject to a perplexing God and an unrelenting Devil, and just trying to muddle along.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the late sixties and early seventies, in the days before video and DVD, I used to regularly go out to watch the Dollar movies in the West End of London. What more can you say about this fabulous movie that hasn't already been said. Not much more. To me the music makes it. I really think this is the greatest sound track of all time. There was a cover version of the title theme by Hugo Montenegro that was No 1 in the UK hit parade for at least 6 weeks and I can remember Jimmy Saville in his Blondie outfit with cheroot introducing the record on Top of The Pops. So this movie, the music and the characters were constantly in the public consciousness and at the office we were constantly using the line "There are two types of people in the world my friend...." To all the people who haven't yet seen this movie - lucky you. Do yourself a favor and go and get it. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the reason why Leone is the greatest at what he does.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching this movie, I have seen A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars more and I was quite impressed with both. However, after I have seen this, Leone instantly became one of my favorite directors. Leone has a distinct style in his films and this movie pulls it out 150%.The cinematography in this film is incredible. His use of extreme long shots and extreme close ups are unsurpassed. The film opens with the close up of a man with an expressionless face creating a sense of mystery and excitement. What will this guy going to do? What's going to happen? Then we are introduced to two new unknown men and the three walk towards the entrance. Silence. Then suddenly, the 3 bust in, guns are shot and Tuco busts through the window and escapes with a half eaten chicken (or pork) leg. One of the men is injured, tries to make a futile final attempt to kill him and falls to the floor; the other 2 are already dead. Just in that one scene, we are introduced to Tuco and can already guess his character, his background info, and skill... without a single spoken line of dialogue.As a matter of fact, nobody speaks until about 10 minutes into the film. It is all visual. We, the audience, are forced to imagine what the characters are thinking, what might be taking place. Leone gives the viewers a chance to guess what might happen. Even in Once Upon a Time in the West, we see his mastery at the No-Dialogue introduction. I also believe that this is his way to introduce the character's personality traits without the viewers actually knowing that they know it. A subtle technique so when they see a character do something later in the movie, the viewers can accept the character's actions.However, Leone would not be as great as he is if it wasn't for his partner Ennio Morricone and his unique and memorable soundtrack. The coyote-like music sets the mood for this film like no other western. It is something you must listen to and experience it to retain the full appreciation of it, and know why it has become the trademark music for the western genre.These techniques go on throughout the film and bring us to the ultimate scene in film history, where Leone's style shines to it's full extent. His incredible use of long shots to set the stage, close ups to catch the expressions, music to set the mood, montage to create the tension, expand it and finally when you are at the edge of you're seat, the scene goes off like lighting in the incredible climatic ending.Leone is not just any director. He is one of the best, and THIS is his western!</fullReview>

I have watched this movie twenty times and maybe more. It has been a part of my life and I find it to be a great why to kill a rainy afternoon. I see something new almost every time I watch it. this movie changed the way gun movies were made.Sergio in his wisdom or luck got it right, as they say three is a charm. If you are a fan of horses check out the Arabian that Lee rides in on, best western horse ever except for maybe Beau in True Grit. many forget that the horses are important too. this movie and director should have won the best movie and best director for 1966</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An instant reminder of what a movie really is!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Civil War, gold is up for grabs, and three dirty cowboys all want it. Seems like a regular Western. It's a good thing film-directing God Sergio Leone and cowboy-extraordinaire Clint Eastwood paired up, because in that genre, there isn't a better match. To this day, there hasn't been a movie that comes close to the depth and craft that his movie produces.It's a beautifully woven-together piece of cinema that Sergio knows what to do with. He creates a feeling of both intensity and humor by portraying the three key characters with one trait only; The Good (Clint Eastwood), The Bad (Lee Van Cleef), and The Ugly (Eli Wallach). These characters follow their own instincts, whether it be good or bad, and let nothing stand in their way of recovering the gold. The only problem is, they have to work together to get it. One knows the place of the gold (a graveyard), and one knows which grave it's buried under. Just how long does it take until the cowboys let their pride and betrayal ruin their treasure hunt? Though the beautiful directing is immensely distinct and original, the movie is very plot-driven. The characters don't matter to us. We could have The Good play The Ugly and it would still be the same outcome. But from Sergio's vision, comes a truly magnificent submission into the psychology of the Civil War civilians and determined, gun-shooting varmints.At first, we meet the characters by obviously seeing them do what they're intended to do. The Ugly robs a store, The Bad kills a few people, and The Good saves someone's life. After that, we see that The Ugly and The Good are actually working together to do what dirty cowboys do best; collect their money. Upon finding out about the treasure, all three characters become The Determined, and both work together and hang each other by the necks (literally) to find the gold.From beginning to end, "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly" is utterly entertaining and unique. It can be called both a Western and a War movie. As the plot develops and thickens, we see more of the setting than in all other Westerns combined. Everything is twice as big, and everything is twice as dirty. A definite classic, that defined cinema in more than one way, with its memorable score, to the never before seen directing, the movie stands as one of (if not the) best movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm going to start this review by saying this: there is not western that can compare to this, hell, there may not even be any movie that can compare to this. Only a handful come to my mind, and it's a very small handful at that.Sergio Leone's classic western provides the perfect ensemble of cinematography, direction, acting, story, and last, but not least, music. Leone's film about three greedy men in the search for 500,000 in gold exemplifies the dirty west. This is not your typical American western, where the sun-drenched west is romanticized. No, it's dirty and rough, just like the west was. If anyone wanted to watch the film that is the antithesis the "chick-flick," I would recommend The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.Clint Eastwood reprises his iconic Man With No Name in this final film in the Dollars Trilogy. Lee Van Cleef returns from A Few Dollars More; however, he plays a different (much different) character. The actor who steals the show has to be Eli Wallach. Wallach, a western veteran, plays Tuco with great viciousness and humor, making him likable and unlikeable at the same time; he truly is "ugly." Leone and his cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli pack the film with great shots of the west, from the tired sands of the desert, to the endless graves of a cemetery (which was actually located in Spain). Ennio Morricone combines Colli's lush cinematography with the greatest score ever put onto film. From the easily recognizable theme, to the sad Story of a Soldier, to the excitement of Ecstacy of Gold, this soundtrack has it all.What more can I say? If you haven't seen The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, see it now! I can not press you more. This is one of those films that could be considered perfect, or the closest to perfection. A classic that shall never be forgotten; a classic that shall always be admired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Westerns Ever Made...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Buono, il brutto, il cattivo, Il' was at its release in 1966 a very unconventional Western epic that follows the travails of three gunfighters looking for $200,000 in stolen Confederate gold.Also known as 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly', it was Italian-born (Rome, 3 January 1929) Sergio Leone's third so-called spaghetti Western after 'Per un pugno di dollari', aka 'For a Fistful of Dollars' (1964) and 'Per qualche dollaro in pi?', aka 'For a Few Dollars More' (1965).It is generally considered one of the best films of its kind ever made, a masterpiece, one that almost inexplicably continues to get better with each viewing. In a way, it's a morality play, weighing the consequences of good and evil, but it does so in its realistic portrayal that sometimes, crime DOES pay, at least in the short term, and sometimes good DOES go unrewarded.This film ushered in a new concept of a previously all too oft told Western story, probably tolling the death knell for the traditional American-made, Good guy/ Bad guy, White hat/ Black hat Western that was so prevalent before it.The three main characters of the film are as powerful as Leone's brilliant vision of the Civil War era America, he used as their backdrop. Lee Van Cleef ('The Bad') is evil in the flesh. Beedy-eyed and totally ruthless, he believes it only takes one thing to be successful: whatever is necessary.Clint Eastwood ('The Good') is the now legendary 'Man With No Name', but 'good' only in a Western concept of non-traditional good. He has a sometimes detectable and occasionally observable sense of honor that motivates his behavior and conduct from time to time.Eli Wallach ('The Ugly') is Tuco, and he's easily the most colorful character in the film. Impulsive and full of barely suppressible rage, Tuco gyrates wildly throughout the movie, stealing, lying, pretending to be a best friend in one scene, trying to kill in another. Tuco truly represents 'the ugly' side of human behavior.At two hours and forty-one minutes, the movie was lengthy for its day, but there's neither a single scene that seems unnecessary, nor does the film seem lengthy while viewing it. The film unfolds with a charismatic style and grace, slowly revealing more and more about each character and the film's story. The pace of the film expertly captures the flavor of the time, giving the viewer a rare peek into a page of American history come alive on film.Director Sergio Leone (who contributed to another epic of note: 'Ben-Hur' as an uncredited second unit director in 1959) manages to build a lot of sometimes unsettling tension in the film, thus preventing the longer than usual movie from ever getting uncomfortable or predictable. Every typical Western cliché possibly imaginable is either given a unique twist or utterly destroyed by Leone's masterful storytelling. Of special honorable mention is Ennio Morricone's original music score, which is about as masterful and complementary as it gets, culminating in the climatic gunfight in the cemetery at the end of the film. The music is so rich and powerful it easily stands on its own merits, and is one of the biggest selling original movie soundtracks to date. It is impossible to imagine the film without it.'Unforgiven' may well have been the sequel to 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly', the story of what eventually happened to the 'Man With No Name', and won Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director, and the nomination for Best Actor for Eastwood in 1992 (the film also was nominated in six other categories and won in three of those). Eastwood dedicated this movie to Sergio Leone who died 30 April 1989 in Rome, and who had believed in him early in his career.Call it 'Buono, il brutto, il cattivo, Il' or call it 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly', but after seeing it you'll call this movie absolutely brilliant at MANY levels, including the one mentioned above by Kitchener.It is a classic like no other, and is easily one of the best Westerns and films of its kind ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are hundreds of comments here on this movie and most of them are of high acclaim which comes as no surprise to me. Many have included this in their all-time top 10 films and again it comes as no surprise. With those I agree, this is a great film. There is little I can add that hasn't been said here but I will go back to the beginning. I was a Clint Eastwood fan when I was a kid from his role as Rowdy Yates in Rawhide. When he made the Spaghetti Westerns as they were called, I of course had to see him on the big screen. A Fistfull of Dollars and A Few Dollars More were unlike the typical Hollywood Westerns of the 50's and 60's. Italian and American actors in low budget productions with overdubbed dialog filmed in Spain which was supposed to be Mexico or the US Soutwest. Heavy on style with strange music. Raw realism emerged from this strange brew and I loved them. Then this came out. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Just the title itself was so impressive you knew this was going to go to another level from the first two. And it did. Ennio Morricone's music was so different and wonderfully strange and remains so even today. It was the perfect soundtrack score for this film. Sergio Leone's direction and his story and screenplay along with Luciano Vincenzoni and cinematography by Tonio Delli Colli are superb. A great cast with Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach. Eastwood's Hang Em High and High Plains Drifter that would follow were good but they couldn't top this. I've seen this dozens of times on TV but I haven't seen it on the big screen since it's initial release. This film ran a little long but it didn't matter because this was clearly a masterpiece. And so it remains. I would give this a 10 and highly recommend it. I'd love to see it on the big screen again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was never really a fan of westerns until I saw The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. This is one of the greatest movies ever. Sergio Leone is a master director, who has also made Once Upon a Time in America, and Once Upon a Time in the West. He is probably the best visual director of all time. He films the cowboys like they are a part of the vast western landscape themselves. His pacing is patient, which works very well in his films. Some criticize his movies for moving too slow, but that allows for much build-up and some scenes and sequences that you will never forget. Clint Eastwood is the ultimate western gangster in this movie. This is where he first truly showcased his brilliance as an actor. If you have not seen this film for some strange reason, get up and watch this masterpiece before you die. Did I mention the score? It is in the same league as the score for Jaws. Intense. Powerful. Mesmerizing. Beautiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Nostalgia is a product of dissatisfaction and rage. It is a settling of grievances between the present and the past. The more powerful the nostalgia, the closer you come to violence. War is the form nostalgia takes when men are hard-pressed to say something good about their country." ? Don DeLillo "God's not on our side because he hates idiots also." - BlondieItalian iconography meets Akira Kurosawa meets Hollywood Westerns, Sergio Leone's "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" marks the point at which cinema took its first big steps (if we ignore the works of Godard) into the arena of postmodernity. From here would spawn the likes of George Lucas's "Star Wars" and later Tarantino's "Kill Bill", each generation of Leone devotees increasingly flat and weightless.Leone's own work would become increasingly suffused with postmodernism's undertow of nostalgia and regret, films like "West" and "America" less about plot than they are a film nerd's feverish dreams, all the tropes of the gangster and the western genre fetishized and mourned, a series of melancholic referrals to Ford, Hawks, Boetticher, Anthony Mann, Raoul Walsh, George Stevens and the hard boiled literature of Chandler and Hammett (the first two "dollars" movies are essentially film noirs with horses). These films aren't about the passage of time, but the passage of cinema, a child's attempt to hold on to the images of his past. No surprise that Leone's cites John Ford's "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence" as his favourite Western, as it's Ford's most melancholic and nostalgic film.Leone's films are thus primarily concerned about living with the image of "America", and never "being" American. His films revolve around a vision of America as an all pervading presence always seen from a distance, through the image. In this regard, many of his films rely on flashbacks and memory. Think the nostalgia, longing and melancholy of Colonel Mortimer in "For a Few Dollars More", of Harmonica and Cheyenne in "West", and the protagonists of "Dynamite" and "America", all of whom reflect Leone's own nostalgic feelings towards an America which he imagined, discovered, idealised, desired and naively longed for as a child (and latter as an artist). Paradoxically, however, Leone's nostalgia doesn't owe itself to distance from or homesickness for real things and places; his is a purely artistic, and so dangerous, nostalgia. What he misses are signifiers, artistic representations, and so the constant in Leone's films is therefore not subversion (that's Altman), like many claim, but rather infatuation; in the end, myths remains myths and at most they can be restated and updated, but not overturned.French philosopher Jean Baudrillard dubbed "The Good the Bad and The Ugly" the moment when modernism died and cinema began its crawl toward postmodernism. Baudrillard uses this term in a negative sense, speaking of a cultural obsession with "lost objects", referrals and went on to predict art's progression toward a kind of "weightlessness" (eg "Kill Bill") or reliance on resurrection and pastiche. While this is true for Leone's later films, "TGTBATU" belongs more to that sweet spot in world cinema (the late 60s and early 70s) in which iconoclasts like Antonioni, Altman, Peckinpah, Kubrick, Godard etc were thriving.And so while "TGTBATU" pulls from everywhere, both stylistically (the opening credits are modelled on the James Bond franchise, a series which Leone loved) and logistically (the film had financial backers in Germany, Spain and America, the cast were from all over the world and all spoke different languages etc), it's far more than a celluloid mash-up. It retains a certain weight typical of the 60s, more akin to the violent works of Siegel and Arthur Penn or the revisionist westerns of Altman, Peckinpah and late career Huston and Ford. Of course during this period you also had other extremely important but less known directors like Monte Hellman, Sydney Pollack, Robert Benton, Abraham Polonsky, George Hill, William Wiard, Elliot Silverstein and Ralph Nelson all making different kinds of interesting westerns ("Tom Horn", "A Man Called Horse", "Soldier Blue" etc).The point is, Leone didn't "shatter the myth" of the Old West. Everyone during this period was doing that. Everyone was working against traditional concepts of heroism and justice. No, what Leone did was re-mythologise the West using the iconoclastic techniques of 60s and 70s cinema. He dirtied things up and then put these larger than life men back up on pedestals.Of course what "TGTBATU" is really known for is its wonderful "comic book" style. Bob Dylan crossed from folk to electric in 1965, and here was Leone making the same transition, serving up a rock and roll Western with electric guitars. And so we have masterful widescreen Techniscope compositions, powerful juxtapositions between wide shots and extreme close ups, Ennio Morricone's innovative score, a cast of slimy, dirty heroes (the film's sloppy sound dubbing works in its grimy favour) and a tale that is flippant, ironic and playfully told.Though thin like a comicbook, the film also has a very primordial undertow, a certain weight, with its dreamlike terrain of bombed out ghost towns and a soundtrack which mimics rattlesnakes, coyotes and horses. Its plot may simply consists of sweaty scroungers navigating a landscape perpetually covered in war, death and suffering, but there's nevertheless something very "human", existential even, about the film. Leone distills human nature down to simple elements and then injects a tone of regret such that the film seems to mourn the very "archetypal humanity" it revels in. Seems to mourn the very greed, violence and death that orbits around and within its small cast of characters. According to Leone, there's a little bit of good, bad and ugliness in everybody. Every bastard in this film earns our sympathy, even if we know they'd be the first to stab us in the backs.9.5/10 ? (TGTBATU) 8.5/10 ? (FAFDM), 8/10 ?

		<fullReview>Varying opinions on this film posted, but for me its a top quality, ground breaking film that is timeless. This is the ultimate test of a great film. It stands up with any modern classic, it has humour, twists, stylised violence, and its just a top film.It wasn't the first spaghetti western i know, but i think its by far the best. I just wish they had done a sequel to this. Some how i don't think Tuco was a man to take this lying down .... or hanging around."Hey, Blond ... You know what you are? Just a dirty son of a-bi ....."Tuco now had all the money he could wish for, but no one double crosses Tuco and lives . . .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredible film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is already a long time ago, I have seen this film for the first time. I think it was sometimes in the eighties. The impression was good but not excellent. But until now i have seen this film so many times!! And I must say, with every looking, this film gets better and better. I have also seen the two other films of the "Dollar"-trilogy and this film is the best by far. The sense of humor of this film is the key factor. Especially the performance of Eli Wallach is outstanding. For me the best actor ever. On the one side there are great actors (Eli Wallach, Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef) and on the other side there is a remarkable storyline. It's a story about three "criminals" who are playing some tricky games during the war between the South States and the North States. All in all its a very entertaining film with much suspense and great music! 10 points out of 10!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best Films Ever Made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" has become the ultimate iconic film. Its broad images have become a staple for all that would eventually follow from Advertising, Pop Videos to future Western productions and Horror flicks. None can or want to escape the extraordinary visual flare and style of its Director. It is just too damn fashionable. Sergio Leone's influence cannot be overstated.The exalted position of this Spaghetti Classic is #3 in the Top 250 films ever made according to The Internet Movie Data Base. Whether this position is justified is debatable but the good news is that this Classic Film was made over 41 years ago. The Top 250 list has proved somewhat unreliable because the latest Cinema Releases are voted on in greater numbers than the Classics of yesteryear and so it reflects a very modern bias. Substandard films like Martin Scorsese's poor re-make "The Departed" or "The Bourne Ultimatum" have found themselves in the Top 100 relatively quickly. The positive of the IMDb Top 250 list is that it is constantly evolving and it also represents the general publics take on the medium. A crowd pleaser like "The Shawshank Redemption" has found itself consistently within the Top 5 and at present is at #2. That film found its audience not in the Cinema but by word of mouth and subsequent DVD sales.The problem as a whole is that the general public forgets the older Classic rather quickly because they hamper for the newest release. In some cases what is old is regarded with contempt.At a dinner in Hollywood I sat next to a famous producer and his beautiful doll-like wife. We began to talk about "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" and what an impact it has had on modern cinema. His wife stopped our conversation with the subtly of shooting a blunderbuss into the air. "Why would you want to see that" she said, "its old!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i first saw this film i thought it was slow and pointless. It really didn't seem to be going anywhere at all and worst of all, the story didn't make any sense. A few months later i watched, A Fistful Of Dollars and For A Few Dollars More and i decided to give this a chance again, realising that it was part of the Dollars Trilogy. After watching it a second time all i can say is this ... Sergio Leonios Best, Clint Eastwoods best and the best Western of all time. The battle sense's were by far the best and most life like battle sense's i have ever seen , the best thing about this film is the music, that theme composed greatly by Ennio Morrocone has become a modern classic. The Story really came to me this time watching it. Clint Eastwood plays Blondie (THE GOOD), Eli Wallach plays Tuco (THE BAD) and Lee Van Cleff plays Angle Eyes (THE UGLY), three men who are after a fortune in gold. It sounds like a typical story, but to get to the gold they have to go through the civil war. Well, only Blondie and Tuco have too. Angle Eyes is a general in the war. I really don't know what made think this was crap the first time i watched it. I guess it was because at that time, i really didn't like Westerns at all. But now watching it a second time, it has become one of my top 5 favourite films of all time. One thing i'm happy to see is this is in the top 10 on the IMDb Top 250. It deserves it. 10/10. Perfect</fullReview>

Its a tense and edge of seat classic The music is nothing short of perfect, this is by far Ennio Morricone's best work and the music creates the films now clichéd stereotype which was such (and still is) a success in the 60's when it came out.In Conclusion, Don't be scared off by this movie because of its genre, I've never liked westerns but this was thoroughly entertaining a must see 8.9/10</fullReview>

When tuco and Blondie plant the bomb in the bridge i thought the blasting scene will not be realistic, but shockingly the blast was very realistic and i wondered that how would have they did that scene, really extraordinary. The ultimate scene in the movie is, when tuco,"who was eager to know the name of the cemetery from bill Carson, will kick Blondie when he was lying beside bill, but when bill dies and Blondie says that he knows the name of the cemetery, tuco suddenly cares for Blondie. This film has an excellent duologue's by making to understand the viewer indirectly. I think this movie has a best climax than any other movie. Adios..........</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the closest thing to perfection, with pure great action, pure story telling and pure acting from visionary director Sergio Leone who has directed the two prequels to The Good The Bad and The Ugly, they are a fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More. With Clint EastWood once again at the helm of the leading role delivers massive knockout performances as '' Blondie'' others in the supporting acting roles are Eli Wallach in the role of Tuco and the late Lee Van Cleef acting Angel Eyes. All of this though wouldn't have been possible without Sergio Leone, the man who set alight the Western frontier of films. Clint EastWood who has also been seen as one of the greatest Western actors of all time.Nothing could be greater and more pure than to have a top of the world actor and a great visionary director. I just cant get over the acting from Clint and the breath taking action set pieces. In one sentence: Truly worth watching!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Basically, if you have to see one western, watch this one. From the opening credits, you can tell its going to be a stylish, bloody ride.What I admire most about this film is the attention to detail. Leone doesn't rush scenes; sometimes we have shots up to five minutes without dialogue.Tension chews nearly every scene as we observe the eyes and hands of the characters. It's as much a film of greed and civil war, as it is about deception.The acting is perfect all round. Clint, Wallach and Cleef are all amazing in their roles. They manage to live up to their roles of good, bad and ugly well, but it's not as clear cut as that. The characters in this film are all morally ambiguous and so they should be. At a time like the civil war, even the "good" can be "ugly".Great direction, superb acting and amazing style. The film is very efficient at telling its story - and the ending is amazing.Definitely watch this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true epic and one of the greatest films of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the first time on my tiny 15 inch screen of my TV/DVD player, and even on this minuscule format I was still simply amazed by the sheer scope of it. Now I understand and acknowledge the usual complaints against the film, namely the fact that the movie is almost three hours long with many scenes that tend to drag on for minutes with little dialog or action, however it is these scenes that make the movie the masterpiece that it is. Every shot whether it be an expansive landscape or an extreme close-up Sergio Leone draws you into his own version of the old west. A world where three men chase each other across the desert in search of 100,000 dollars worth of Confederate gold. Along the way they encounter Yankee and Confederate soldiers, Mexican bandits, bounty hunters in a journey that culminates in one of the most riveting showdowns in cinema history. What I found most interesting about this film however was the influence it obviously had on modern filmmaker Quentin Tarentino. Many of his trademarks (very memorable characters, long shots centered on a single character, intense standoffs involving multiple characters) can be found in abundance in this film as well. In fact Tarentino's Kun Fu epic Kill Bill goes so far as to barrow multiple songs from Leone's Dollars Trilogy. In the end all this adds up to make The Good the Bad and the Ugly in my opinion one of the greatest films of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>probably the best western ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i first saw this film in about 2003. i had seen A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE on the television and i thought they were really good so i decided to buy them on DVD. Searching the shops for them i found that they came in a box set with a third film, THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY. I hadn't seen THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY at the time but I liked the first two so I thought that I would buy the whole box set, as that was all that was available at the time. What I didn't realise until after I watched all three was how great THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY was and I thought that the first two were good. it turned out that THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY was the best of the three. THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY was probably the only film I had ever bought on DVD without having seen it before and I'm SO glad I did. This film is excellent and although i have seen it many times it still stands up well after multiple viewings. it may be nearly three hours long but it is never boring. all the elements work so well (music, acting, dialogue, setting etc...) i can't really find fault in it. i liked it so much i bought the special edition DVD just to see the extra footage incorporated into the film. if you've not seen this, then rent it because i guarantee you'll soon be buying it shortly afterwards</fullReview>

His films have a specially charm, though are full of the outrage. They are can watch for hundred times. It is a quality of the great artist what was S.Leone. The fine story, with a wonderful photography and adequate music of the greatest film music composer E. Morricone plus the rhythm generates a masterpiece.

		<shortDescription>Spaghetti Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good, The Bad and The Ugly has become a metaphor for the relentless and ruthless pursuit of wealth (the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow) and the victims and victors (mostly victims) it produces along the way. The beauty of this film is that it does not take itself too seriously, it is a precursor to movies like "Sin City" , "Natural Born Killers" and "No Country for Old Men" that have a comedic and "matter of fact" feel to the graphic violence. Plus the musical score and cinematography are excellent. Who would of thought that a "spaghetti western" would become such an honoured classic movie masterpiece? Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef all play characters that are right out of a Greek tragedy who represent different aspects of society. Watch, enjoy, and don't take the movie too seriously, that's how I believe the director wanted the audience to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not only sheer entertainment, it has the most profound music in the number 'ecstasy of gold' by Ennio Morricone. Although there is no comparison in the quality of one musical piece with another, but I would rate 'ecstasy of gold' as the best orchestral piece ever - simply a masterpiece from Morricone, who has produced the best music for western genre films. The theme music is also superb.The mood of the film transports you to that time and world and gives a feeling of that time and places were everyone was desperate, adventurous, daring, even reckless for the most coveted thing - gold. It has been called the yellow fever - a state in which people were willing to die or commit massacres for gold.This is the theme, and although it is a sad and haunting picture of man turning into wild beast - more savage than the so called savages, the action, the plot and the acting turns it into an ecstasy. Not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the last of the so-called 'Dollars' trilogy Eastwood now plays a man called Blondie (despite clearly having brown hair) who has hooked up with Tuco, a bandit with an amusingly long list of crimes, to run a reward-and-release scam with various towns and cities across the Old West. Soon tiring of Tuco's behavior, Blondie ends their volatile partnership and heads off on his own.Angered by the double-cross, Tuco exacts a laborious revenge on Blondie, but just as the punishment reaches its zenith under a burning hot sun in a remote part of the desert a wagon carrying dead Confederate soldiers interrupts. With his last breath, the sole surviving Rebel tells Tuco of a stash of treasure buried in a cemetery, and, while Tuco is distracted, tells Blondie what grave it is buried under. Their difficult partnership is quickly restored as they trek across the West, through Civil War conflicts, towards the treasure.So far I've only covered the Good and Ugly. The Bad just so happens to be Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), a ruthless mercenary who has also learned of the hidden loot and eventually crosses paths with his rivals. He has the least screen time, but is necessary as a pure villain to lessen the crude vulgarity of Tuco.It's a long film. But it's not about the destination, it's about the journey, and Sergio Leone allows himself plenty of time and space to indulge in quirky idiosyncrasies. I especially like Tuco having a bubble bath in the midst of his current location being blown to smithereens.Villains always interest me, and actors mostly choose villains over heroes as they make for better characters. Blondie may comfort dying soldiers and play with kittens, but he's just too bland. Angel Eyes, is hardcore, and a better character, but he's nothing compared to Tuco. Eli Wallach owns this film, and takes most of the screen time away from Eastwood and Van Cleef. The scene where he searches the cemetery, as the camera spins around and around and around has such a beautiful innocence to it. Even though Tuco may have killed and robbed many this scene makes him seem like an easily excitable child at heart. It's absolutely wonderful.If you've got an evening free, and just don't know how to spend 3 otherwise empty hours, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is a fine way to spend them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Good, The Bad, The Ugly (1966)A classic? Well, not so fast. Are we really okay with brutal (if brief) mistreatment of women, fast and senseless bloodshed, and lots of bad overdubbing of dialog?Maybe.Yes, this is a cinematic movie, and if you can overlook its flaws (some) you will be wowed and dazzled by its merits (very many).Overflowing with archetypes, filmed with huge widescreen effect, brimming with familiar scenes vividly re-imagined, this is a movie that is dramatic (or ironic) in softspoken (or cynical) ways. There are gunslinging shootouts, long lonesome treks across the desert, and showdowns between tough guys. Yup. And it's all built around a story that leads scene after scene to one big moment after another. There's no question this is a movie that is great fun to watch. In fact, for its visuals, the sheer cinematography and sets and editing, this is as good as it gets, amazing stuff. The man behind that was Tonino Delli Colli, the cinematographer for some other of director Sergio Leone's legendary movies beyond this one: Once Upon a Time in the West, and Once Upon a Time in America (and well as the astonishing Life is Beautiful.) But overall, for its content, its plot, its message (if that matters), is TGTBTU a great film, a masterpiece?Well, the movie is smart. It deliberately plays off of its genre, which had worn itself thin by the 1960s, so things push over the top in a campy, awesome, excessive way. It almost feels obliged to revisit and exaggerate all the themes of American Westerns, including the Civil War, including slapping women around and killing people in a flurry of fast six-shooter magic. Even the title makes clear this is about a stripped down, pumped up version of older classics. Whatever his aura over time, Clint Eastwood is no great actor, not in my book, and here he is easily out shined by Eli Wallach, who plays a less attractive type, and by Lee Van Cleef, who plays a more attractive one. But Eastwood isn't meant to be acting, not exactly. He has aura. He's stoic and inscrutable, exaggerated make-up and all, and he shoots a mean Colt, or Smith and Wesson, something classy and throbbing. He's a great archetype, in a movie that is about archetypes. It's not a "realistic" movie, of course, not at all, and it's actually a comedy at times, overall, and it's totally fun and never laughable.Go ahead, compare it to The Wild Bunch, and then to Butch Cassidy, both coming just after this one (and no doubt influenced by it). Both of these later movies have more impressive acting, and more intense intentions (both in brutal violence and in cinematic innovation). But all three have a similar effect, playing within a genre that has always, since the 1939 Stagecoach, been beautifully trapped by its limitations (that's part of its staying power for fans). The Searchers (1956) and High Noon (1952), for starters, are working within the genre, and gnawing at it, as if its something to feed off of. That's where The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly really shines. I have trouble with aspects of it, but I really like it in a bigger sense, looking the other way as needed. I switch to first person because I think it's a personal preference, and a lot of guys I know love the movie to pieces, and a couple women I know think it's either stupid or insulting or boring (actually boring!). It's an Italian production, which explains some of the out of sync dubbing. Sergio Leone obviously has an intuitive sense of what makes a movie moving, something sorely missed in a lot of productions since. It's gritty, dirty, and it pounds "profound" hard in a male kind of "toughness prevails" way. Sorry guys, but bite that bullet. Oh, and the soundtrack? Amazing, perfect, and rising above the movie, which is great in its own way, I admit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinematic brilliance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A big, bravado, bold and exquisite film for its time, Sergio Leone's "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" remains one of the most seminal, influential, and exciting films of all time. With its superb cast, its beautiful and wide scenery, and its superior action sequences, this film is a masterpiece. A picture that embodies the perfect personification of masculinity. A true man's picture, and one that will stand tall among most movies today.The simple tale of how three gunslingers form an unlikely alliance of hate, in order to find $200,000 (that's $6 million by today's standards) worth of stolen gold, in a country that is ravaged by war, is elegantly told by the maestro of westerns, Sergio Leone. For its time, Spaghetti Westerns were not considered genuine art, but rather, entertainment instead. Sergio Leone is probably the only director who is smart enough to make his film compelling to mainstream and critical audiences alike. His direction is smart and strong, and you see how well his direction is as per the amount of manpower and creativity in handling the action sequences. The action sequences are raw, crisp, grand, explosive, and taut. Especially the Standoff at the end. Leone should probably be awarded a Nobel Prize for that scene alone. Leone is probably why westerns are popular among the youth of the '60s, hell, he probably influenced would be filmmakers at the time. I know of one who was particularly influenced by Leone's direction - Quentin Tarantino himself said that this film is the best-directed film of all time. And yes, although the film may be long, there's not a scene that goes by that you'll say boring.Clint Eastwood - The Good. The legendary Man With No Name. His character perfectly embodies with the true meaning of masculinity. As per in his previous films, he plays a mysterious gunslinger, one with a deadly aim and a strong sense of honor and pride. He is the perfect hero, and this film stands out as one of Clint's, if not his, best film ever.Lee Van Cleef - The Bad. Here, instead of the fatherly Doug Mortimer in the previous "For A Few Dollars More", we get the stone-cold assassin Angel Eyes. Van Cleef plays him chillingly to the bone. He is wicked, he is ruthless, he is cruel. He would kill anyone, be it his targets or even his own client.Eli Wallach - The Ugly. He is Tuco, a criminal on the loose. He is the most interesting character in the film, as we see the ugly side of man through him. He is two-faced, slimy, arrogant, and hate-able. But that what makes his character great. There is no substitution for Wallach, he will always be Tuco no matter what.The cinematography is absolutely beautiful. We get to see the backdrop of the glorious Wild West and the battlefields of war in all its unfaded glory. Even the cemetery scene is filmed extremely well. The music - that's another thing. The music, is masterful, so sublime, so grandiose, and so haunting. It's mesmerizing, really, to hear the great Ennio Morricone's score while looking at the actions of people, it perfectly matches the film. Not forgetting to mention the iconic and haunting theme song that's embodied itself in popular culture even until today.So, yes, this is truly cinematic brilliance. If you want to see the film in all it's glory, I reckon you readers get the extended cut DVD of the film. It's Leone's true version of this film, and it would do you some good to see his true film, not to mention the remastered picture and 5.1 sound so that you can hear the gunshots and explosions in all its fury. Make no mistake readers, this film is one of the most iconic movies ever made, and it can be proud of its status as "Greatest Western Ever Made". Now if only movies like these were made today as well...Overall rating: 10/10Delton</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take A Slug Of This Captain - And Keep Your Ears Open</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three separate mercenaries drifting through the US Civil War in 1862 hear about a cache of looted Confederate gold, rumoured to be buried in a cemetery. Picking up clues, and with many criss-crossing adventures en route, they each make their way to the treasure. Can they find it, and who will emerge alive ?The Good, The Bad And The Ugly, or Il Buono, Il Brutto, Il Cattivo to give it it's proper name, is simply the finest western ever made. Many accused Leone of being a hack; he made westerns, but he made them in Spain, and he wasn't even an American. Not only was he not a hack, he made pure cinema - a genre stylist unburdened by all the boring moral constraints of so many westerns (clean-cut good guys, white supremacy, social responsibility). As a result, this film is the purest distillation of the western myth, with the most amazing cinematic treatment ever committed to film. Its style is beyond criticism and its influence cannot be underestimated; Leone's themes, his camera angles, his use of music, his intuitive widescreen style, his moves, his incredible closeups - all have been and continue to be copied by lesser men. At a time when everyone was making crappy new age films like Barefoot In The Park and Georgy Girl, Leone was going back to his cinematic childhood of Gone With The Wind to create an astonishingly mythic epic which is the greatest depiction of the American Civil War despite not being about it. The three main characters are larger than life in the best way possible; Eastwood is extraordinary as The Man With No Name here, his character gradually mellowing from the hardened bounty-hunter he was as he witnesses the horrors of the war. If you do not cry at the scene near the end where this hardest of hard men dispassionately comforts a dying boy you are truly heartless. Wallach is amazing as Tuco, giving one of the greatest physical performances I have ever seen, all darting eyes, fastidious little movements and operatic comedy; he can be scary, funny, vicious and tender, all in the same scene. Van Cleef on the other hand is the purest depiction of black-hearted evil in any film. His introduction, as he rides a black horse out of a desert sundown and commits three horrific murders is amongst the greatest screen villainy of all time. These three incredible turns are all-time career bests for three astonishingly talented and prolific actors. Also superb are Guiffr? as the doomed drunken Yankee Captain Clinton, Pistilli as Tuco's brother Pablo and Brega as Wallace, Van Cleef's burly henchman (Brega plays similar heavies in the two previous Dollar movies). The other unforgettable element to this movie is Ennio Morricone's astounding music, which I think I must say is simply the greatest score ever recorded. There is no movie I can name with better, more original or dynamic music. The music is in unique harmony with the images and emotes from the first note to the last crescendo. The music completes every scene. It is lustful, haunting, touching, humorous, ominous, grandiose, suspenseful, operatic, delicious, magnificent, riveting, quiet, melancholy and philosophical. There are too many great musical moments to mention, but perhaps the greatest of all is the L'Estasi Dell'Oro sequence as a crazed Tuco runs amongst the graves of Sad Hill accompanied by the silken soprano voice of Edda Dell'Orso. Morricone is probably the most gifted film composer who has ever lived - he is certainly the most prolific - and this is the finest of his many many great scores. In an average movie I hope for maybe five strong scenes with atmosphere and originality. In this long movie, every single scene, bar none, is a brilliant little vignette, yet each flows into the other with perfect rhythm. What else is there to say about this extraordinarily beautiful film ? It is a diamond, an absolute diamond of world cinema, made by one of the few truly original directors, and don't believe for a second anyone who tries to write it off as trashy or simplistic. It contains so many moments of pure storytelling genius it would take me forever to list them. It is a great story, an astounding assault on the senses, a hugely entertaining masterpiece and an everlasting testament to Leone's total command of cinema. Featuring exquisite photography by Tonino Delli Colli and fantastic sets by Carlo Simi, it was shot at Elios Studios in Rome, in Castilla-Leon in northern Spain and in Leone's favoured locations in Almeria. Stunningly well written by Agenore Incrocci, Furio Scarpelli, Luciano Vincenzoni and Leone. Re-mastered and re-released in 2003, with several additional scenes which didn't make it into the original US release, notably a sequence where Tuco reunites with his gang and one where Angel Eyes visits a ruined fort. Trivia - Eastwood/Blondy is the good (buono), Wallach/Tuco is the ugly (brutto) and Van Cleef/Angel Eyes is the bad (cattivo); the latter two are often transposed in much of the English-language publicity and merchandise for the movie. This is the great Sergio Leone's best film, the best film of the sixties and the best western ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was born after 90-s and this film make me familiar with the genre "western". I want to say, there was one of the best three hours in my life, the atmosphere of that ancient times transmitted as good as it possible. You just forget about the present and dive into west with it bewitching characters, revolvers and gold hunting. Not the first time I notice, that films of 60..70-s are much better transmit the picture for viewer, directors of that time exactly knew what to show. Tongue does not turn to call the special effects "pure" or "funny", cos they seems more real in this picture, than all modern effect together. The great soundtrack was the thing, because of which goose appears on my hands and the room fill with heroes's tension and resoluteness. So, I was very pleased, watching this film and soon will continue getting familiar with this genre and creations of great Sergio Leone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We all know this is great, but here's my 2 cents..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well first off, having seen so many films, I'm not sure why I waited so long to watch this but I'm glad I finally did, and you should too! It's unbelievably clear to me now where Tarantino borrowed his camera shots and editing techniques from in the likes of KIll Bill and Inglorious Basterds! (I knew about Morricone)The film was years ahead of its time, but I have two gripes with this movie that stopped me from giving it the full 10/10. 1: The dubbing- All the foreign actors acted their roles in their native tongues which were dubbed over afterwards. It was quite noticeable and threw me off a bit, I'd much rather a foreign film with subtitles than dubbing any day.2: A tad too long. I do feel the running time could have been shaved byt 20 mins.Having said all that, it's a great film! Ennio Morricone's soundtrack is outstanding and the ending is spectacular. Overall opinion: Milestone!Other films from the time I rated 9/10: Cool Hand Luke. Bicycle Thieves. The Italian Job</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Western Masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨You see in this world there's two kinds of people my friend, those with loaded guns, and those who dig. You dig.¨ I wonder what would've been of Clint Eastwood's career if it weren't for the ¨Dollars¨ trilogy. Before working with Italian filmmaker, Sergio Leone, he had a career as a television actor in Rawhide, a western based TV series, but he couldn't get a decent job in Hollywood so he began to look for work abroad. He reached international success thanks to Leone's reinvented spaghetti westerns: A Fistful of Dollars (1964), For a Few Dollars More (1965), and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly (1966), known as the ¨Dollars¨ trilogy. He proved producers wrong because they thought that people wouldn't pay to see movies of actors they could see for free on television, but audiences were more than willing to see him in the big screen. His pairing with Leone couldn't have worked out better for him since the director's trademark was combining long wide shots with extreme close-ups. These wide shots couldn't have been enjoyed as much on the small television sets at home. Eastwood's rough features and manly charisma also contributed to Leone's success, and both seemed destined to work with each other. There is no need to see the previous ¨Dollars¨ movies as The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly stands out on its own and is actually a prequel since the movie takes place during the Civil War in the early 1860's before the other plots take place and they are all separate stories that only have Clint Eastwood's character in common. When I see Eastwood's latest films as a director I can't help but think how much he was influenced by the great Sergio Leone. He must have learned a great deal working with the Italian director in this masterpiece. It is just shot beautifully and to perfection by Leone, the cinematography and scenery are amazing and feel real, and the score is perfect. Eastwood may be a different director than Leone was, but he pays close detail to his craft and also knows how to shoot beautifully.The plot is pretty simple for a movie that is about three hours long, but Leone's use of the camera and extended shots makes the film longer. He also adds several side stories that work really well in the narrative. The film begins by introducing each character (although in the opposite order: The Ugly, The Bad, and The Good). The film begins with an extreme close up on a bounty hunter (Al Mulock) and then when we see the wide shot there are three of them who are quietly entering a bar. Once the men enter we hear three shots and out comes Tuco, also known as The Ugly (Eli Wallach), who escapes. In the next scene we are introduced to The Bad, Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), who is tracking down a peasant farmer. The scene is truly a classic as no words are spoken for about ten minutes, but the tension can be felt. Angel Eyes is actually looking for information on the location of a treasure of coins lost during the Civil War and he is told a soldier named Bill Carson has it. Finally, we are introduced to Blondie, The Good (Clint Eastwood), who saves Tuco from a group of men who want to turn him in because there is a reward on his head. Blondie saves him only to collect the reward himself, but once Tuco is about to be hanged he shoots the rope and sets him free as part of a scam in which they divide the money. They later turn against each other only to discover the location of the treasure that has been buried and the race begins to see who can get to the treasure first as the three men have different information regarding its whereabouts.The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is my all-time favorite Western. Any other film in the genre will always be measured by its standards. The opening scene in which we are introduced to Angel Eyes (The Bad) is just so beautifully shot that no dialogue was needed and we were already hooked (Ennio Morricone's amazing score can also take some credit for that). The first ten minutes have no dialogue whatsoever but it sets up the general tone of the movie: several wide shots where we can see the great landscape and deserts combining them with extreme close ups of the characters facial expressions, the tension and suspense is built with long and slow scenes and suddenly the violence happens so quickly that we are caught off guard. The film doesn't celebrate violence, it portrays it truthfully. The main character is the quiet Blondie (The Good), but without a doubt Tuco (The Ugly) is the one who has the most lines and brings some unbalance and goofiness to an otherwise serious picture. One of the funniest scenes is when he is in the tub and one of the bounty hunter shows up to kill him but before shooting he begins the classic speech villains tend to give and Tuco pulls out his gun and fires at him saying, ¨When you have to shoot, shoot, don't talk.¨ Tuco plays a key role and his character is kind of the gray in an otherwise black (Angel Eyes) and white (Blondie), good guy and bad guy western movie. He breaks the conventionality in the genre. The final Mexican standoff scene is also truly memorable and one of the best shot sequences. This is a truly unique film that has stood the test of time; it catapulted Eastwood into a movie star, and has influenced him on his way to becoming a great director. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is one of my all time favorite movies and is a must see film.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You may run the risks, my friend, but I do the cutting"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This week I was fortunate enough to see 'The Good, The Bad and the Ugly (1966)' (namely, the 2003 extended English-language version) in the cinema, perhaps the only place that Sergio Leone's classic Spaghetti Western can be properly appreciated. This was my second viewing ? the first being in 2006, when my interest in cinema was still in its infancy ? and, just as Leone's film gained status only in subsequent decades, my admiration has since grown substantially. By the early 1960s, the Western had become a tired genre, and even the best American entries {such as Ford's 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962)'} could more closely be described as somber rather than thrilling. Leone's low-budget Italian productions breathed new life into the Western, the director's highly-stylised (and purely cinematic) film-making style tackling the recently-emerged Revisionist Western sub-genre with a cheekily-parodic sense of humour.Though 'The Good, The Bad and the Ugly' clearly identifies each of its three protagonists with a titular adjective, the separating lines are decidedly blurred. Blondie (Clint Eastwood) is the archetypal anti-hero, a laconic, cigar-smoking bounty-hunter who makes every word, and every bullet, count. Tuco (Eli Wallach) is a slimy opportunist, a bottom-dweller whose unabashed enthusiasm ? especially opposite the apathetic Eastwood ? makes him an oddly-likable character. Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) is a crafty, intelligent schemer, greed and contempt mixing behind those cold, steely eyes. Leon's film revolves almost exclusively around these three characters, and the American Civil War is utilised purely as a historical backdrop. As was the director's style, the film is a triumph of contrasts: an epic period of American history is used merely as a stage for an intimate battle-of-wills between three determined men with their own selfish aims.Contrast, too, is evident through Leone's camera lens. Few directors (perhaps David Lean or Sergei Bondarchuk are his only true rivals in this field) have more inspiringly utilised the cinema screen as a canvas. Leone switches between landscapes and portraits, at times cutting unexpectedly from a distant long-shot to an extreme close-up of Eastwood's sweaty brow, his eyes narrowed and alert. I wrote in my review for 'A Fistful of Dollars (1964)' that that Leone's landscape was the human face. Unlike Ford, to whom setting was significant (one reason why he so adored Monument Valley), Leone's Westerns unfold in an anonymous landscape, dry and unremarkable and unforgiving. Colour is instead injected through Ennio Morricone's score, perhaps the most memorable ever composed for a film. The composer's contribution is uniquely cinematic, refusing to linger in the background and instead serving to overwhelm and enhance Leone's imagery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sergio Leone's Western Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I avoided seeing this film for many years. As a whole, I do not like westerns, they are typically clichéd and hokey. Finally after reading the raving reviews and a strong urge by my film instructor, I rented it. I was blown away and left in awe of Sergio Leone's spaghetti western classic.The acting is very intense, especially from Lee Van Cleef's character Angel Eyes. Clint Eastwood does a great job as the righteous Blondie, but Van Cleef's character stands out to me more. The camera work is greatly done, especially in the graveyard scene and the associative shots used during the Mexican standoff scene. Being a huge Quentin Tarantino fan, at the end of the movie, I thought to myself "so that's where he got his inspiration" (meaning his later works such as the Kill Bill series and Inglorious Basterds). The thing that makes the film to me is the soundtrack. The music is used in very good taste, whether it is the classic theme from the beginning or the use of Ecstacy of Gold during the graveyard scene.If you love westerns, this is a definite must. If you do not like westerns, this is still a must for any movie lover. Overall, it's a 10 out of 10 rating for the greatest western ever made and one of the greatest and most influential films of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies ever made - will leave you breathless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood returns as The Man With No Name in this final installment in Sergio Leone's epic Dollars Trilogy (or Man With No Name Trilogy). He plays Blondie (the Good), a sharp-shooter of debatable honor, iron will, and questionable motives. Leone also brings back Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes (the Bad), a sadistic man who always keeps his promises ? as long as you pay him for it. Eli Wallach rounds out the trio as Tuco (the Ugly), a thief worried only about his own hide. The three men are held together by the wish to locate a stash of gold, its location imparted to them by a dying man. Alas, things are not so simple. The man whispers some of the information to Tuco, but only Blondie knows the true location. And so our thieves must overcome backstabbing and betrayal, as well as their mutual enemy of Angel Eyes, to reach the treasure.Sergio Leone creates a visual masterpiece. Not even Orson Welles can hold the audience in his hands the way Leone can. The cinematography and editing are perfectly in sync, working together to mold the audience as Leone sees fit. The famous Mexican standoff, with its rapid-fire cutting and incredibly close shots, is jaw dropping, forcing you to hold your breath. And of course, the film simply could not work without Ennio Morricone's incredible (I repeat, incredible) score. Even if you don't bother seeing the movie, look up The Ecstasy of Gold on YouTube. It will leave you speechless and blow your mind.After a disastrous experience with my first foray into Westerns (for the record, "Shane" is a horrific movie), I all but damned the entire genre to the pits of hell. But after repeatedly spying "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly" atop film lists, I decided to give it a try. It had me on the edge of my seat, my eyes shining, my entire being entranced. In my opinion, "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly" is one of the most spectacular movies ever made. Is it historically accurate? No. Is the plot nice and tight? Not really. But those are trivial matters in the face of what it is ? an incredible spaghetti western. And as far as I am concerned, it is one of the best movies ever made.</fullReview>

Sergio Leone knows how to build a scene. Ennio Morricone's music is absolutely perfect with this film. It's hard to think of a movie with a better soundtrack actually.To summarize: brilliant, breathtaking, mesmerizing...and like a fine wine, this one just gets better and better.

		<fullReview>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly Hey, Blond! You know what you are? Just the greatest son-of-a-b-! Sergio Leone was a director of boundless vision and ambition, a man with no little ideas. Everything you see is big, and ambitious. In a film that runs about 180 minutes... One could argue that Leone tells the story more with pictures than in words.Thus is The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. A story of three men who are all after the same fortune of Civil War gold. In fact, the secret of its location is spread out among them (one knows the cemetery but not the grave, and the other knows the name but not the cemetery). The men involved are Clint Eastwood ( The Good), Lee Van Cleef ( the Bad) and Eli Wallach ( the Ugly). Each man knows that they will remain alive until the grave is found.....but just as it always is- it is more than likely that each of them will try to kill the others for the gold.They are also men who really never need to explain anything, their eyes and actions could simply be deemed more important than their words. ( The obsession in Van Cleef's eyes) Though, Eastwood's character. Blondie. ( The Man With No Name) says very little, Eli Wallach's: Tuco never stops.In fact, some of the best dialgue from the film is of Wallach's 'speeches' about the differences between people. 'You can be one thing or you can be another.' He compares himself to Blondie, and to his own brother, who became a priest. However...... Blondie has the last word! Though there is no shortage of ideas in the film, there is also a film within a film. Thus, a grand Civil War sequence. One of the best scenes from the film is a scene in which a Union Army Captain ( Aldo Giuffre) explains the war to the best of his ability. The commander who has the most booze to get his troops drunk before the battle is the one who wins. However, probably my favorite scene from the film was the haunting runaway wagon scene. That cemetery scene with Wallach stumbling around is also a highlight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sergio Leone is one of the best directors to ever touch a camera and this film proves that he is a master. The camera work of this film is brilliant. This also Clint Eastwood Best Film and also the other actors best film. I am shock that this film didn't get any Oscars and it has Oscars written all over it. This film should be honored and praise for it's brilliant film making, acting and it's cornerstone of film making. Sergio ranks as top 3 film maker of all time due to this films brilliant close ups and the length of the events that happen. Leone first when he was casting for the main role he wanted to cast Henry Fonda but could not afford him so he got Clint Eastwood and I'm glad that happen. This film also has one of the best villains of all time angle eyes also Tuco does a great job too. I must this film is a true masterpiece due to it's classic feel to and having the best gunfight ever. I highly recommend this film to anyone and if you like this one I highly recommend Sergio Leone Other Films.</fullReview>

Also, when Tucco can't tell the difference between the Blue and Gray, and to his surprise along with Blondie's biting sarcasm, is priceless. Guess Eli can't see very well.... My son who is studying film at Yale believes this to be one of the better films for all other kinds of reasons...It is very much a black comedy and yet set the tone for other movies to feature anti-heroes.

It's probably significant for being significant (e.g. making Eastwood a star) than for its true content.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Good......it is one of those "New", groundbreaking, and completely different Movies that was quite influential, broke Taboos, and in the midst of a Decade of change was an announcement from a Director that said..."take this, you Western Movies", and the Western Movies did and never looked back......The Cinematography expanses and lingering affection for landscapes brought the John Ford aesthetic to a new Generation and to a new level of opulence. There are some other Camera Tricks here that are playfully fresh (for 1966) and it was without doubt, Psychedelia before it was fashionable......The Soundtrack that is now an indelible part of Pop Culture and reminds us Today of how different it really was.The Bad......Endless Closeups of squinting eyes. A tendency to elaborate on already elongated Scenes to add to the already established Suspense......The Character Tuco becomes relentlessly obnoxious, overbearing, irritating, and unlikeable immediately and this keeps up for almost 3 Hours. It is an overacted Performance that makes the Movie less engaging......The length seems padded and indulgent.The Ugly......All the Characters, their Personalities and the Makeup. This is truly a Panorama of Ugliness throughout and given its length, a bit too much to bare......There is for your viewing pleasure...flies, filthy Faces (almost always in close up) chewing little cigars and sporting blood, pus, scabs, and other assorted flavors like food being shoveled into salivating mouths with Technicolor glee......Ugly could be a word that would describe this Movie. Another would be overrated.In conclusion......The best Spaghetti Western is from the same Director...Once Upon a Time in the West (1968).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Third time is the charm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood is good, Lee Van Cleef is bad and Eli Wallach is ugly. Sorry about that, Eli. Eastwood again plays the Man with No Name whom we have already seen in A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More. Our hero, this time referred to as Blondie, may be "good" compared to the other two leading characters but having seen the first two films we know he is not the traditional all-American hero. He's not all good, he's more complex than that. There's not much complexity to Angel Eyes, the character played by Van Cleef. This guy is bad to the bone. Meanwhile Wallach threatens to steal the show. He plays Tuco and this is a guy who, in an otherwise very quiet movie, never shuts up. Good, bad and ugly are searching for $200,000 in Confederate gold known to be buried in a cemetery. It's a very simple plot for a very long movie but the time flies by. Director Sergio Leone ratchets up the tension and keeps you on the edge of your seat.The events of this film, unfolding during the Civil War, actually take place prior to the events of the first two films in the Dollars Trilogy. And the war certainly intrudes on the story, causing complications for our characters in their desperate search for that gold. A big war battle scene lends a bit of grandeur that the first two films didn't have. Leone is making a film of much larger scale this time around. But while the war looms over everything this is still a story about our hero and the two companions he would very much like to be rid of. There are great twists and turns as at different times in the movie different members of the trio have the upper hand. Sometimes you're at the top, sometimes you're at the bottom, sometimes you're forced into an unholy alliance with your great adversary. All along the way there is much drama. And along with the drama there is plenty of action too. This is a movie which grabs your attention right at the start and holds it throughout.Blondie is the nominal hero, making Eastwood the nominal star. And, as already established in the prior two films, Eastwood suits the role perfectly. He's the perfect embodiment of the quiet, cunning, not totally heroic hero. Van Cleef played a good guy, more or less, in For a Few Dollars More. This time around he gets to play a total baddie and he sinks his teeth into the role with great relish. Wallach is a little over-the-top but delightfully so. Tuco is a crazed, maniacal character and Wallach pours his heart into his performance. He brings so much energy to the film. Three great actors, three great characters. Leone could hardly go wrong. And the film has so much more to offer. With breathtaking visuals and a truly memorable score the film both looks and sounds spectacular. Story, actors, cinematography, music. This film is the total package. It is certainly the best of the Dollars Trilogy, this is the Man with No Name's greatest adventure. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is often found on short lists of the greatest films ever made. That kind of acclaim may be overselling things just a touch. But there is no doubt this is a very good film, a thrilling last chapter in the story of one of the most iconic characters to ever grace the screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And so concludes the Spaghetti Western Dollars Trilogy. Following A Fistful of Dollars and For A Few Dollars More, The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is the final film in Sergio Leone's trilogy that redefined the traditional American western.Many people have described this film as the best Western ever made. Without a doubt, as a standalone film, The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is simply superb. The complex relationships between the three protagonists had me on the edge of my seat throughout the film, never knowing if they were going to work together or kill each other in cold blood.The soundtrack too is utterly iconic. While I associated the predecessor's tones with cowboy music, I often associate the whole Western genre with The Good, The Bad And The Ugly's backing tune. It has also become quintessential as the accompanying music to any stand off, whether it be in a parody or simply on the school playground.Any fan of the series will know that Eastwood's character appears alongside van Cleef's character in For A Few Dollars More. This would be my only criticism of The Good, The Bad And The Ugly, as this previous relationship has been forgotten (or is cleverly disguised in the fickleness of the characters) as they both appear to not know the other exists.As a result of the latter paragraph, I have literally spent days deliberating over whether to mark the film down. It did make the film more confusing for me - but only as I'd seen the previous two films in the trilogy. But, crucially, Sergio Leone's trilogy is rarely marketed as a trilogy set piece and the films can be watched standalone. Anyone who watches The Good, The Bad And The Ugly by itself will happily watch the film in sweet ignorant bliss of my character confusion.So, as a standalone film, The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is the pinnacle of Sergio Leone's Western renaissance. Simply brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best, maybe the best Western ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the definitive of the so called Spaghetti Westerns. Everything about it is so great. For a rare this Man with no name trilogy is one that just got better and better for each film. Sure all three are stand-alone adventures but Sergio Leone really got it perfect here.This film absolutely has it all, the action, violence, humor, great characters and the music. Clint Eastwood is always cool but as a cowboy he is the coolest. The man with no name so though, secretive, fearless, hard facial expression, cool clothing. It is a quite long film but still it never ever gets boring. The slow pace works just perfect for the films tone and style. An impressive combination of great humor and hard violence that works just perfect, impressive because it never feels awkward like one might fear it would get. The style of the action is perfectly done and like stated it is quite violent maybe more than one might suspect if you don't know anything about the movie. The characters are superb, Clint Eastwood is of course the best and the coolest. The bad is a really brilliant villain and the ugly is great comic relief. Even though this might seem like a light weight no depth movie with stereotype characters, it's not because they are so well done and brilliantly acted that the viewer gets a stronger feeling for them than any other film like this. Sure the story is not that deep but it's neither predictable, just perfectly balanced. Then the music, must be among the best ever for a Western film, especially at the ending such a feeling it gives. It brilliantly helps build up the suspense in the action.It's hard to put in words how good this film is. A classic that most have seen and those few who haven't should. Maybe the best in it's genre and even outside it's group I would rank it among my top movies ever. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a timeless classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leone and Eastwood define the American "cool"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Good, The Bad and the Ugly" is cool with brains. Most other action films, especially westerns, are celebrations of cool, but this film masters cool -- heck, practically invents it -- and also applies it sensibly. Nothing is merely for cool's sake, it is for the sake of telling a story full of mistrust as well as one that searches for depth in the blanket adjectives of its title.Set in the West during the Civil War, the film identifies its characters right away: The Good, Blondie (Eastwood), The Bad, Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), and The Ugly, Tuco (Eli Wallach). Each is after nothing but money, making the word associations merely relative to the principles that they live by. Distrusting of one another, they are soon forced to work together -- specifically Tuco and Blondie -- in order to find 200 K in buried gold, because one of them knows which cemetery it's buried in and the other knows which grave.Gold is also every word that comes out of Clint Eastwood's mouth. Although his body of work today is enough proof of his talent, he clearly owes much of his career to director/writer Sergio Leone. In this their third western collaboration, Leone knows what Eastwood's strengths are and he gives him some killer lines. Every man supposedly wants to be James Bond, but every American man should want to be Blondie. Every time he speaks, you know you're either going to be impressed or enlightened with his machismo and/or wisdom. Wallach is also invaluable to the film as Tuco. He keeps things interesting playing a money- grubbing rat. In a film of this length, he helps keep things from getting too serious and dull.Leone also hones his craft in this movie. His gritty close-ups and split-second gunfire shots give this film its style, suspense and power. There's some "it" quality to his film-making that is hard to describe, but every shot feels important or at the least cool. Distinct "chapter" breaks also contribute to the Western mythos/tall tale idea that has made the genre an important one of the 20th century. There is a clear journey-like story line that recalls what made Homer's "The Odyssey" one of the first great Western (in the global sense) literary classics. There is a clear objective with obvious obstacles, unlikely partnerships and plenty of surprises.If all that wasn't enough, there's the score. Ennio Morricone not only provides one of the most memorable themes in movie music history, but the timing of the music, the way it lifts the important scenes up into a realm of cinematic immortality is unlike anything before or since it. It's exciting and epic when it needs to and it's suspenseful and emotional when the action gets intense. With so much silence in this film, picking the right moments to break it is challenging, but Morricone nails it. And if it doesn't do all that for you, well, it's still cool."The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" proves that all three of those descriptors are relative. It's no great revelation, but it's interesting to see how you watch and form opinions of characters assigned to general moral stereotypes and then to see how those opinions are affected as the film goes on. If that's too deep, than at the least you can appreciate how cool everything is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive western, masterful music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I have seen my first classic Western finally. This is a genre I tried my best to avoid. I am more into thrillers. But this one was special.The plot is interesting in itself. 3 men are determined to get to the cash box that was buried under the ground in a certain place(trying my best not to reveal the plot here!). The excitement is in watching the many twists unfold. The characters are known as Blondie, Tuco and Angel eyes. The real names of the characters are not revealed here. We come to know a little more about Tuco in the course of the movie. It could be said that Tuco is the central character in this movie as he appears in most of the movie. The plot moves throughout America and they go in search of the cash box even to war torn areas. The story is set in the late 1800's during the civil war. So the movie also effectively works as an anti-war movie as well.The most impressive thing about this movie is the great music by the legend Ennio Morricone. This might be the best ever music I have ever heard in movies. Maybe that's an exaggeration but surely this is one of the best. The music in the scene where Tuco searches frantically for the cash box is filmed brilliantly and the music builds into a crescendo at the end of the scene. Another aspect that impressed me is the beautiful cinematography in certain scenes of the movie. The long shots showing the beauty of the place are absolutely breathtaking. The war scenes are shot well and I was surprised to hear about the budget. With this budget I was surprised to see the advanced effects and the meticulous depiction of the war.I also came to understand a few things about a part of history I didn't know - the American Civil war. The bridge destruction scene is also another one I totally loved. The closeups of the character's faces is also another feature that I liked specifically about the movie - especially when they are actors with such great screen presence such as Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach. I have never thought of Clint Eastwood as particularly good looking or talented. But this movie proved me wrong. His performance as the calm bounty hunter with a sense of humour enhanced his image considerably in my eyes. His quiet sexiness is something I have never seen in other movies of his(Maybe I am biased because I saw only his newer movies). Lee Van Cleef is notable for his portrayal of the villain. Eli Wallach's portrayal of the crooked and funny Tuco is IMO one of the best characters in movies ever. His line "When you want to shoot, shoot, don't talk" has become one of my favourite quotes as well.Finally this movie has encouraged me to seek out more "Sphagetti Westerns" and regular classic Westerns as well. The movie is quite a classic and is highly recommended for all movie fans because it is more of an exciting adventure movie with beautiful camera-work than a Western.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See it in High Definition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HDNet just broadcast "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" in High Definition. I haven't seen the film for many years and I was astounded.It is not apparently available on Blu-ray yet so try to catch it on HDNet. I hope they repeat it. The DVD cannot do it justice.In spite of historical inaccuracies, some preposterous scenarios and other plot weaknesses, brutal violence, some awful acting, and lip-sync problems with the Italian actors, it is a great film that engaged me completely for three hours.It is visually stunning with Leone's extreme close ups and its recreation of the time of the American Civil War. The protracted scenes (often whole stories in themselves) add to the visual poetry and to the evocation of the time.It is Leone's homage to the classic American Western. It relies heavily on the standard Western conventions but it is not constrained by them. Leone does it with his tongue planted firmly in his cheek. It should not be taken literally or even seriously and should be enjoyed for what it is.The characters are multidimensional. Eastwood's non-acting and Wallach's over the top performance add to rather than detract from the movie.It is possibly the most accurate portrayal of the American Civil War on film, showing it as the brutal and senseless conflict that it was.Its comments on greed, violence and human nature are poignant and yet the humor leavens the lessons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't generally like "Western" genre movies because they romanticize violence. But, this movie was an exception. It is so stylishly made that it is difficult to criticize its portrayal of violence. Director Sergio Leone has transformed a simple treasure hunt story into a finely crafted piece of art. Even though the movie is pretty long and slow moving, it still keeps you engaged till the end with its many, unexpected twists and turns. The background music is brilliant and conveys the feel of an anarchic and violent climate. The actors fit their character roles perfectly, especially Eli Wallach as Tuco. Though, I would not rate this as the best movie ever made, I would certainly agree that it is one the greatest movies of the last century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The old, gritty West and life in general</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great many people of our current iPod generation have missed out on some of the most brilliant, daring and artistic endeavours in film during the sixties and seventies. That was a period when film still held onto its artistic impulse, when the modern day blockbuster, complete with stunning visual effects, mind-bogglingly fast action sequences, and miraculously thin story lines and characterisations was still in its infancy. Over time, as some nostalgic folk of the 'then' would say, 'the world has become too fast, and kids today don't give a damn about deeper stuff'. Indeed it has; through the development of film over the decades, we see - at least a glimpse of - this seemingly reductive summarisation of the vast social and cultural changes in the world. The legendary final scene of this film, where the three principal characters face, is roughly about five minutes long, from the time they implicitly agree to this 'solution' to the first 'bang' of Eastwood's pistol. In these five minutes, Leone uses music and recurring shots of the men to create the tension, engineering a sense of finality and fatality in the situation that could quite possibly take all their lives. At that critical moment, greater importance is given to this all-encompassing tension, where the entire film's plot and the journey must culminate in a decisive end, than to the eventual outcome, which would be revealed in all eventuality. As audience, Leone wants us to participate in this tension, to completely transport ourselves into the simmering, immoral West, and feel the presence of death as the characters do, and therefore to achieve a cinematic orgasm that involves both the intellectual and visceral, in turn immortalising it. This painstaking attention to detail, the need to go beyond the bare plot and action, and the urge to create a cinematic environment that transcends, is something that we see too little of today. Indeed, we are privy to this intellectual desire from the very start. The first shot in the film, of the brusque, brutally masculine face of a minor character (who returns later) that somehow eerily seems directly born out of the harshness of the desert is wonderful example of heightened realism that epitomised films of that time. We can almost smell and feel the sweat on the man's face; we can delve into his eyes, into his soul, and through it, witness the moral degradation that Leone wants us to observe. This film could easily have been given a title, with something to the effect of earning some 'dollars', as are the other two in the trilogy, but Leone decides to punctuate it with an exposition on morality with the title he gives it. As any discerning viewer would infer, it is dichotomous to the nature of the pertinent characters. All three are 'ugly', and Leone tries of remind us with his concluding piece that morality is a vague, invariably overlapping concept that is too often oversimplified. Using the west as a setting, we realise that people are too complex, too evil to start with, and any attempt to glorify one is to shun this gruesome reality. This perfectly explains the unique collection of faces in the film, with are all polished with the desert's sweat that makes them impenetrable to scrutiny of any kind. The three adjectives that form the title function almost completely on one side of the moral boundary. And yet, no one can call the film entirely immoral or fatalistic, for we witness traces of humanity in the most absurd of circumstances. Blondie offering a cigar to a dying soldier and providing him warmth is once example of this. Understanding this moral equation, we can then justify the labels given to the three protagonists. Unlike the other two, Blondie keeps his sadistic impulses to a minimum. Also, he tellingly suggests the method of resolution to decide the recipient of the money which leads to the final confrontation scene. Most notably though, he underlines his seeming sense of fairness by taking his rightful share of the money, albeit making it impossible for Tuco to collect his. Unlike him, Angel Eyes shows no pretence of such selflessness, and is perfectly willing to brutalise Tuco (another chilling scene) to get the secret out of him. However, even he believes in simply completing his job, and would not resort to perfidy that Tuco is culpable of, making him the 'ugly' version of humanity. As we see, all three differ from one another only in degree, unlike the ironic suggestion of the title.Overall, this is a complete auteur's film, where Leone underscores memorable action sequences with great atmospheric detail and an underlying message that is so finely sewed beneath the more palpable layers that most of us tend to overlook it completely. This may not be the pinnacle of artistic cinema of 'that' time, but it reflects the sophistication a film can manifest beneath the superficial layers. Its slowly unraveling scenes and attention to detail is reminder to all of us to stop, and sometimes look at life with a keener eye, instead of being constantly pre-occupied with our daily, routine existence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of the trilogy, Leone at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By a fair margin, the greatest out of the spaghetti western films, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is a cinematic triumph that will always be remembered most of all for the legendary score and stand off scene. What surprised me most of all was that a long film with quite a slow pace to it actually appeared to move quite quickly; this is thanks to Leone's superior direction and the frequent change of locations within the film. Clint Eastwood's iconic status was firmly established in this film as a bad ass desperado with compulsory cigar attached, Blondie makes Dirty Harry appear meagre in comparison! Whilst the characterisation provided by the supporting cast was over the top to an almost comic book standard, their performances and characters were still memorable and enjoyable as they provided a stark contrast to Eastwood's quiet loner.Where a lot of westerns fall short is the plot, they tend to become a victim of style over substance but this film is an exception as it provides us with a fairly intricate plot. The way Tuco's (Wallach) murderous intentions regarding Blondie are quashed by the fact that Blondie knows the secret of the treasure, leading to Tuco fighting to keep him alive rather than kill him, is very commendable. The tie in with the American civil war is very enjoyable and provides some further tension and heightens the predicament that the main characters are in, especially considering Angle Eyes (Cleef) is a high rank in the Unionist regiment that Eastwood and Wallach have infiltrated. The tension is built up fairly well, even though it requires patience. The final stand off, for instance, takes a matter of minutes for the main characters to get in their positions with the camera ranging from extreme close ups to the characters' eyes to shots that appear to be a mile away. Whilst this sounds potentially frustrating, it induces overwhelming anticipation and once again, the music comes in to play, setting up a true piece of cinematic history.Whilst there are no award winning performances on show, the leads are very good. Eastwood played greatly on his tough guy image and manages to tell us a lot about the character despite not saying much. Eastwood illustrates fantastically, a character devoid of trust and sentiment but also a character of great honour. It is plain to see that Blondie is world weary and he knows that it's kill or be killed. Eli Wallach is very good, probably the best performance in the film. His animated performance brings his character to life as a thoroughly dislikeable loudmouth who is too stupid to avoid trouble but greedy enough not to let his desire to kill Blondie stopping him get the treasure. Lee Van Cleef is even more dislikeable because where Wallach's Tuco is untrustworthy, Cleef's Angel Eyes is brutally honest with ruthlessness to match. The interrogation scenes in the Union camp really highlight this nature and makes sure that the audience knows he means business. The best thing about these characters is that they all flawed, it's not all black and white. Even Eastwood's 'The Good' is not all that good.Laced with brilliant set pieces and memorable performances, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is very memorable and definitely a classic. Watching Wallach hunt Eastwood with his cigar stubs proves the film had a sense of humour but that didn't take away the fact that the film depicts a life of brutality where not even women and children are safe when they stand between power hungry men and their goal. Effective story telling mixed with macabre imagery assures this films place in cinema history and possibly even the title of the best western ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hands down, the best Spaghetti Western movie ever! "When you have to shoot, shoot! Don't talk." Sergio Leone knows how to shoot a Spaghetti Western.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is just amazing to watch. I'm watching the 2004 extended version, with all the delete scenes in it. Directed by Sergio Leone, this movie is the third film in the Dollars Trilogy following 1964's A Fistful of Dollars and 1965's For a Few Dollars More, serving as a prequel to them. Thank Goodness, the movie wasn't call 'The Two Magnificent Tramps', its working title. In the United States, United Artists considered using the original Italian translation, River of Dollars, or The Man with No Name, but decided on The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. The title, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly suite the plot so well. The plot revolves around three gunslingers, 'the Good' AKA 'Brodie' AKA 'The Man with no name (Clint Eastwood), 'The Bad' AKA 'Angel Eyes' (Lee Van Cleef) and 'The Ugly" Mexican bandit Tuco Ramirez (Eli Wallach). All three are competing to find a fortune in buried Confederate gold during the American Civil War. All the actors in this film are great. Clint Eastwood is great. I love that the producers finally explain where his character got his trademark poncho. Granted, the other two were morally worse than him, but Blondie's not exactly a nice guy, too. It's more like 'the good enough'. I love, how Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach work with each other. Lots of chemistry there, yet a lot of backstabbing triathlon with the trio. Tuco is the only one of the trio, the audience really gets to know all about. We meet his brother and find out where he came from and why he became a bandit. The other two are more of a mysteries. The names "Blondie" and "Angel Eyes" aren't exactly threatening, but workable. Blondie's hair is sandy brown. This is due to imperfect translation from the original Italian. Mad props to Eli Wallach for doing all the dangerous stunts as he almost got killed in real life like three times during the making of this movie. Eli Wallach pretty much steals the movie with his character. Originally, Leone wanted Charles Bronson to play Angel Eyes but he was already committed to another movie, and Leone choose Lee Van Cleef as the villain, playing opposite to the character, he plays in the 'For a Few Dollars More'. I glad, Lee Van Cleef was chosen for the film. He was best as the villain. Still, it does get kinda confusing, story wise seeing how the films are supposedly connect to each other. In the theatrical trailer, Angel Eyes is referred to as The Ugly and Tuco as The Bad. This is due to a translation error; the original Italian title translates literally to "The Good, the Ugly, the Bad". Still, the Good, the Bad and the Ugly had tons of memorable lines, funny scenes, and epic action, but the movie is really long. It takes forever to get to the buried treasure part of the movie, even if you watching a way cut down version. Angel Eyes besides the opening, doesn't show up, until half way to the film. Lots of desert scenes that they add in the 2004 version was cut out for a good reason. The movie takes a lot of side steps missions like blowing a strategic bridge, bounty hunters, and money-schemes that were entertaining, but kinda distracting as the gold plot takes a backseat, most of the first act and second. The movie has a great sweeping widescreen cinematography by Director of photography Tonino Delli Colli. The Cemetery showdown is intense. I love how the movie is shot with all the dramatic extreme close ups to give the audience, a sense of tensed. The movie got tense, due to falling out between Leone and Clint Eastwood, as Eastwood got tired of all the camera shooting in different angles, sweeping long shots, and extreme close ups. Both never work together again, after this. I can see why Eastwood might had got upset. There is a bit too much artsy in the film, but it's not too bad. Many of Leone's trademarks, hugely influential to modern filmmakers. Unlike A Fistful of Dollars nor For a Few Dollars More, this film had a bigger budget and its shows. Mad props to the people had to build the bridge in the blowing up scene, it had to be filmed and build twice due to the camera being destroy in the first shot. Another to the crew building a cemetery, just for the Sad Hill shootout scene. The money was well-used. I love the Civil War theme. The theme shows how brutal the backdrop, the Civil War was during that time and how absurd it was. The dubbing on my version was really good. Love the Curse Cut Beep. Ennio Morricone composed the soundtrack. The main theme is turned into one for each protagonist: The Good's has a whistle, The Bad's an ocarina, and The Ugly's screamed. It works so well. 'Story of a soldier' is beautiful. It's eerily in a way, since it play during the torture scene. I also love the score, Ecstasy of Gold. It's haunting at the beginning, it draws you in, slowly. Then it smacks you in the face like a ton of bricks and voila! Depending on what version, you're watching this movie. It can take from 161 min to 186 min. The 186 minute is dubbed. If you find the 2002 extended, it's in English, but cut to 179 min. Then you have an old copy, like the 1984's version, its 142, but its cut as hell. In my opinion, just get the 2004 DVD. Tons of special features on the behind the scene production, documentaries, and additional footages like too badly damaged film negative. All of them are worth the price of 2004 DVD. Overall: One of the best cinematic film. Worth watching if haven't yet saw.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three; The Good Blondie played by charming Clint Eastwood, the Bad Angel Eyes played by excellent Lee Van Cleef and the Ugly Tuco played by cunning, clever, comic and many more shades by terrific Ellie Wallach. These three are caught up in the hunt of the treasure worth 200 thousand dollars and what you get as an audience is the treasure of dialogs, acting, action, storytelling, music, back ground score, screenplay, camera work, immersing western atmosphere and in summary an extraordinary entertainer which relies on it wits just not its charm. Directed by western specialist Sergio Leone, the movie is funny, witty, clever, stylish and unforgettable from start to end. There are numerous scenes and conversations which you would like to revisit again and again. Ellie Wallach gives you a delicious portrayal of cunning and clever Tuco who befriends good guy Blondie in the hope of reaching to the treasure. Lee Van Cleef as bad guy gets less scenes and action but all are done with lots of style. All in all, coming from the old school of western thriller, this one is ageless entertainment. Don't miss any chance of watching it!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say about this magnificent epic film that hasn't already been written or spoken? Saw this first as a teenager in the 1970s and was glued to the TV along with my two brothers. Great story, acting, scenery, and the score is fantastic. Clint Eastwood plays the Man with No Name who along with Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach hunt for a stolen cash box filled with gold coins buried in a cemetery during the American Civil War. They each know only one part of where the gold is buried so they have to keep each other alive despite the fact they want to kill each other. This 3 hour movie moves along gracefully and never gets boring. The final cemetery scene and standoff between the three main characters is riveting. Once again the score is unforgettable. Yes I have seen this film over 100 times and love every minute of it. Not only a great western but one of the best films ever made!!Watching this great movie again on TCM in 2016. The difference is they now play the restored extended version with an additional 25 minutes included. These "new" scenes makes the story even more riveting and tie in some loose ends. To the director Sergio Leone all I can say is thank you for your talents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leone, Morricone, Eastwood, Wallach, Van Cleef - the Western at its peak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching a Sergio Leone Western is like sitting down for dinner Italian style the way Leone enjoyed it: You've got the whole family there, its slow but keeps coming and coming and the whole affair eventually lasts for hours - but you savor every minute of it.Part of the family are: Clint Eastwood ("the Good") of course in his third and final installment in a Leone movie, Lee Van Cleef ("the Bad") and Eli Wallach ("the Ugly"). Viewers familiar with the Dollar movies need no introduction to Eastwood's Blondie character, the gunslinger who spells cool, but his two adversaries/companions on the bounty hunt are on par in this one. Especially Eli Wallach steals the show with his twisted opportunistic, rough, down-to-earth, yet also outright funny performance, and Cleef's angel eyes never looked better and deadlier than in a Leone close-up underpinned by Ennio Morricone's extravagant, almost surreal soundtrack. The latter is a given considering Leone's previous collaborations with the master composer, but just as Leone's understanding on filming, Morricone's music reaches a new level in "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly". As for Leone: You've got it all here: The long shots over deserted lands, battlefields, hundreds upon hundreds of graves, counterbalanced by the extreme close-ups of characters digging deep into their minds and souls, plus there's the deliberate time the director takes to tell his story about greed, full of twists and turns, spiced up with irony. Unmissable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest movie ever made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young man enters a movie theatre with a bowl of popcorn and a big coke. After all he was going to see The Good the Bad and the Ugly, an epic 3 hour movie. The movie starts, it blows the young man's, my, mind and suddenly it ends. 3 hours have gone and I haven't touched my popcorn and only once sipped from my soda. This movie changed my perception of the art of film.The Good the Bad and the Ugly is not only the greatest western ever made, it's one of the best and epic pictures ever. Still in my opinion probably the most underestimated movie. While watching this masterpiece you can enjoy it with all senses. The scenes are beautiful in many ways, the music is spectacular in itself and really carries the film into new dimension, the story itself is grand and ambitious and the characters revolutionary for their time played by fairly good actors. It seems there are not enough adjectives to describe the greatness of this movie.Sergio Leone had a very unique style in his movies, which I think culminates in The Good the Bad and the Ugly and in this film you can see this style has grown mature to its true glory. There is something unbelievably beautiful in those wide screen shots of rough plains and desert terrain, the close-ups of faces time after time and long drawn scenes where tension can grow. Sometimes it almost seems Leone was testing how long he can hold on a single scene. The visual art itself tells a million stories without any words needed. For example it takes almost 10 minutes in before anyone says anything at all. Still you can sense the film and the tension. Another one is the final "triello" where the main characters stare at each other for what at first seems like an eternity, but before you know it, one of them lies in a grave dead. What other director has the guts to extend his scenes to the ultimate? And all the worn faces? They all have a story of their own to tell about their scars and wrinkles and adds to the epicness. The desert scenes are like from a surreal and captivating painting. A glorification of visual art!The music by Il Maestro Ennio Morricone is epic itself, bold and different. The score of this film is not like any other. At times it makes you cry, at times it makes you excited. It sometimes adds to the visual of the movie and sometimes supports and carries the viewers through those long scenes making sure you will not be bored for even a second of those 179 minutes, making it an experience you will not forget. Not only the main theme, but any piece of music played is a symphony of its own e.g. "The Ecstacy of Gold", "La Storia di un Soldato" and "Il Triello" just to mention a few. The work of a genius!The story about three greedy renegades searching for a case of gold coins is a good story in itself, but it certainly doesn't end there. The story has many levels. For one there is the Civil War and when you start to dig deeper into the story you can truly see the anti-war reflections and symbols. For one condemns concentration camps in WW2 and other wars and also shows how brutal the trench wars of WW1 could have been for the gain of nothing. The film also shows how towns get filled with veterans without legs or arms and cemeteries grow gigantic in days. The crimes of the Good, the Bad and the Ugly suddenly seem minimal in scale in comparison with the war. Another thing is, we really don't seem to get any information about the lead characters and only Tuco seems to have a background. Still we see these three know each other from a long time ago as they refer to each other as "old friends". There is some serious tension going on between the three of them. The Ugly is a criminal of the worst kind who cheats everyone and has an obscene language. The Bad is pure evil incarnate and seems to have no feelings at all. He calmly shoots everyone in his way in search for the gold. The Good you cannot really figure out. He is a mysterious and obsolete character who seems to be above all moral, but in the end shows he has some feelings after all. You can't really say he is a good person though, being a quite controversial character.In a sense I think it is, or at least was, the most underestimated movie of all. At the time it was made critics hated it. It's not a Hollywood production, Leone was at the time unknown in the world, so was Eastwood just being in the beginning of his career. Eli Wallach wasn't that famous either and Lee van Cleef was a forgotten movie veteran. It contained brutal violence and it was dubbed and worst of all, westerns was a dying genre. But this movie only grows with time. Not only did it solely revive the westerns, it recreated the movie hero to its modern shape: the controversial Clint Eastwood character. Its score was revolutionary and has affected to modern film score probably more than any other. Still it remains unique. No one has been able to copy the style of Sergio Leone.To me The Good, the Bad and the Ugly truly is the greatest movie ever made in almost any aspect you can measure it in. The works of at least two recognised geniuses and men with visions. A piece of gold shining brighter every day!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie on Amazon Instant Video. This movie is excellent and its story has a lot of ups and downs, the movie also has the famous western movie star Clint Eastwood. So I was mesmerized by the movie and recommend others to appreciate it.The movie has three leading roles which has different characters. The good person is called Blondie. The bad person is called Angel Eyes. The ugly person is called Tuco. The story happened during American Civil War, and developed gradually among the three western cowboys.Along with the story developing, a man tells the ugly man that there has a huge government wealth worth $200,000. The man tells the region of secret wealth, and the region named Sad Hill Cemetery has thousands of graves. However, the man does not tell the ugly man what the name of the grave which conceals the wealth, but tells the good man. Thus, the good man and the ugly decide to find the wealth jointly. Meanwhile, the bad man who disguises as a Union soldier also begins to find the huge wealth, and the three people meet in battle coincidentally. Then, they against each other by fist and gun fight intensely. Finally, after a lot of fights, the good man and the ugly man find the way to Sad Hill Cemetery.However, the way is blocked by the war between Union and Confederate, and the two forces fight constantly in order to occupy a bridge. Finally, the good man and the ugly man destroy the bridge by bombs. In the end, the bad man arrives in the region of secret wealth at the same time. The three cowboys decide to gun duel and the winner can get the wealth. Finally, the good man kills the bad man in the duel and releases the ugly man. The good man separate the wealth with the ugly man, and the good man leaves the ugly man in the desert. The final scene is that the good man rides his horse and disappears in the distance.The movie uses third person view to describe the fantastic story. The story depicts three different people deeply. They have different dispositions and distinguish each other brightly. The movie has a strong western atmosphere. For example, the whole story develops in the desert, and this is the typical character of the west of America. The three people have classic cowboy's appearance and trait. They have cowboy wear, especially the classic hat. They have a cool handgun and good gun skill. So they can hit a thin rope from a long distance. They judge other people with narrow eyes.This movie is different with former western movies. People do not divide to good or bad clearly. There is no a totally good person or a totally bad person. The good man also wants to gain the wealth and more money by fighting with others. The ugly man can be touched by some sorrowful things and help others by his own way. All people have two sides, good and bad. This idea in the movie causes big change in future western stories and movies. This movie also uses huge scenes to describe the most destructive of wars. Hundred thousand people die in the war and their bodies fall apart on the desert. This is a big satire of three people shuttle between two armies just in order to find the secret wealth. The movie also uses fierce gun fight to make the story ups and downs. For example, in the end, three people duel each other. They stare each other last 5 minutes and no one open the fire without careful thought. This scene makes audiences feel nervous and exciting.Personally, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is a very legendary movie and shakes me a lot. Thus, I saw the movie 3 times and think it is very wonderful. This movie not only is a lot of intense gun fight, but also reflects people's inner thoughts vividly. The three people have the same purpose but have different characters, so there are a lot of conflicts in the story. In the whole story, many scenes impress me a lot. For example, a command of Union is wounded in the war and will die soon. After the good man and the ugly man destroy the bridge between two armies, the command smiles and dies in happy. This sorrowful fragment reveals that people do not want to battle in war and they want to pursue peace. Another scene is that before the good man and the ugly man arrive in the destination, the good man meets a nearly dead soldier of Confederate. The good man puts his clothes on the soldier's body and gives his cigar to the soldier. The soldier smokes the final cigar and dies. This story tells us how the cruel is in the war.The movie also reflects the spirit of the Wild West. Like in the course book, the three cowboys are strong and do things without the law. They kill people cold and unconcerned. They are individual in most of time and there is no woman to accomplish them. They solve problems by dangerous fight or duel and do things what they want to. They are uncontrolled and use unscrupulous divisive tactics. They pursue the material wealth and have can-do spirit.I love this movie is also because of its wonderful music. In intense gun fight, the music is strong and curse. In sorrowful environment, the music is slow and emotionally. Especially before the end of movie, the ugly man run between thousands of graves to find the right name of the grave which conceals the wealth. The music describe the situation coordinately and becomes classic until today.You cannot miss this excellent movie, despite the language in the movie is Italian, but this does not block you to understand the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best western movie in the world. Even after 45 years, no movie came even a bit closer for a challenge.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is completely frank. It shows us everything that could be possible in any western movie. The only thing that makes it different than other movies is that it does it with style. All three of them are of course brilliant. They were given many cool dialogues. Ennio Mariconi's music does half the work. You probably must have heard it. It brings more style and character to the story. Each of the three acted well and lived up to their pet names. Simply by looking at them makes you feel that it's great.If you have not seen this movie, don't waste anymore time in reading these reviews. This is a classic movie used almost as a standard to measure any other film's greatness."When you have to shoot, shoot, don't talk"10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arguably the best spaghetti western of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone's "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" is perhaps the finest 'spaghetti western' ever committed to film. It was the final entry in Leone's 'Dollars' trilogy, which made a star out of Clint Eastwood. Here, Eastwood ('the Good') and his partner in crime, Eli Wallach ('the Ugly'), have to work together in order to locate a fortune in buried gold while Lee Van Cleef ('the Bad') hopes to get in on the action too.This trio of American actors leads the pack on the acting front, though it is perhaps unfair to compare them to the Italian actors whose lines were dubbed. To me, the dubbing (while it is typically pretty good) is the film's biggest flaw.Leone's direction, on the other hand, is top-notch from beginning to end. His signature style, mixing extreme close-ups and wide shots, is in evidence throughout. Also worthy of note is the iconic score by Ennio Morricone.The story itself is an entertaining one. Even though the film clocks in at nearly three hours and Leone really takes his time with some scenes the film doesn't drag at all. The plot does venture into seriousness occasionally but mostly it's just an engaging yarn about three rogues pursuing a fortune in gold.The film is currently ranked at #4 in IMDb's list of the top 250 films of all time. While I wouldn't rank it that high I do think that it deserves a spot somewhere in the list. It is undoubtedly a must-see film, especially for guys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Magnificent Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, this is the greatest western ever made. It's better than "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" and "High Noon". It really is that good. All three of the main performances, Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach are spot on. Being the last of the so-called "Dollars Trilogy", you get a sense that director Sergio Leone wanted to out do his first two westerns ("A Fistful of Dollars" and "For a Few Dollars More") by having everything in it, the American Civil War, a Treasure Hunt, and the best climatic shoot-out of all time. An interesting thing to note, is that it was the first Western Epic. Running out over three hours it was the longest Western of its time.If you haven't seen "Il Buono, Il Brutto, Il Cattivo" see it, if you have seen it, see it again now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Of The Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There really isn't much to say about this film.Three men,three guns, beautiful scenery, high tension, excitement...A work of art. You can almost feel you're there,trying to avoid bullets. This is Leone's final western from the trilogy, and clearly the best.Here, he showed all of his directorial techniques,the legendary close-ups,the 10-minutes-of-silence-and-tension scenes and similar. Ennio Morricone composed a truly remarkable soundtrack for this film,and,as a musician,I would say it perfectly fits in the whole story.Every character has its specific tune played with another instrument every time(Man With No Name-flute,Angel Eyes-organ,Tuco-human voice). Clint Eastwood shows us what we'll see from him in the future with his smooth talking, laconic speech, mean looks, and that ever persistent cigarillo in his mouth.Don't forget the legendary one-liners he is saying throughout the film such as- Man With No Name: You see, in this world there's two kinds of people, my friend: Those with loaded guns and those who dig. You dig. I laugh every time I see it. Lee Van Cleef gives his best performance here.His little,piercing eyes make him ideal for this role. Eli Wallach is also perfect as Tuco, the nosy bandit who never stops talking and has a key role in the film. Finally,I think everybody should see this film, simply because of its greatness,magnificence and cinematic significance.It defines the word "cool"-and makes you wonder every time you see it.It holds 4th place on IMDb 250,it deserves it in every aspect,but for me,damn it,it's the best movie ever made.Seriously.</fullReview>

Massacre at Grande Canyon 1963 Minnesota Clay 1964 Ringo and His Golden Piston / aka Johnny Oro 1965 The Specialist 1968 The "Comedy Spaghettis" with the Terence Hill/Bud Spencer, known as the "Trinity" films (Whether you find these Hill/Spencer westerns funny or not is a matter of taste. The Italians love them, I personally prefer the first three more serious Westerns they made in the 60's to the Trinity films. I have already mentioned Ace High which also stars Eli Wallach, above. Actually, it was part of a non-comedy trilogy with the Hill/Spencer team. Boot Hill and God Forgives, I Don't are the other two.) God Forgives, I Don't 1968 Boot Hill 1969 They Call Me Trinity 1971 Trinity is Still My Name 1971 ------------------------------------------ *Well that's it for the "top 50". Actually, I'm not so sure about 26-50, but 1-25 are must see and rock-solid. If you can't get enough of this type of movie, rather than wasting your time with the mostly substandard 400 to 500 hundred remaining Eurowesterns (the vast majority of which stink to high heaven), I would recommend trying the Clint Eastwood films Hang 'Em High (1968), Two Mules for Sister Sara (1970), Joe Kidd (1972), High Plains Drifter (1973), Outlaw Jose Wales (1976), Pale Rider (1985) and Unforgiven (1992). Obviously, they aren't spaghetti westerns, but the Leone kinship is obvious. Think of them as the Leone/Eastwood films they never got around to making together.Also, the films of Sam Peckinpah, especially, The Wild Bunch (1969), The Ballad of Cable Hogue (1970) and Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1972), which were also key films in the "deconstruction" of the Western. Oh, McCabe and Mrs. Miller (1971) by Robert Altman is another key film.P.S. By all means, avoid Spanish "Paella" Westerns, which are even worse than the very worst Italian made ones. Especially A Town Called Hell (1971) by Eugenio Martin, it is absolutely lousy despite the stellar cast.P.P.S. Contrary to what some people may try to tell you, there are no Late Spaghetti Classics (after 1973). No, Keoma, Four of the Apocalypse and China 9, Liberty 37 are not lost classics, they are pretentious, preposterous failures, deservedly (and mercifully) forgotten. The two post '73 spaghettis I did mention were only due to the involvement of Leone and Corbucci, I wasn't endorsing those films necessarily.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as A few Dollars More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's surprising how your memory can play tricks on you. Having watched many westerns in my childhood i could have sworn that i had seen The Good , The Bad and the Ugly . Surely everyone of a certain age has? Well as it turns out i probably hadn't , or if i had i remember nothing of it. This is the final film of the Sergio Leone " "Dollars" or " man with no name" trilogy of which i have been watching recently and although this is the most famous of the three ' for me it's not quite the best . Blondie (The Good) and Tuco (The Ugly) are con artists, trying to steal as much money as possible during the Civil War. Angel Eyes (The Bad) is trying to locate a bank robber going by the name of Bill Carson, in order to collect his stolen gold. After a few scams, Blondie cheats Tuco by keeping his share and leaving him in the dust.Tuco eventually finds Blondie and drags him off into the desert, torturing him in revenge. Then they run into Bill Carson, who tells Tuco the location of a graveyard where his stolen gold is buried. As Tuco looks for water to keep Carson alive long enough to help more, Carson tells Blondie which gravestone marks the buried gold, and dies before he can say more. Angel Eyes soon figures out that they know, and all three want a 50% share of the gold, but only two of them will get it.The amazing thing about this superb trilogy is that they all were made within three years. Each movie having it's budget increased. A fistful of dollars - 200K . A few Dollars more - 600K and finally the good , The bad and the ugly 1.1m. In the latter it really shows that leone had a lot more money to spend. Lavish sets , a huge amount of personnel and no doubt an increased salary for the ever popular Clint Eastwood and Lee Van cleef but as any movie fan will tell you an increased budget does not always make a better film .I have no doubt which is my favourite of the trilogy and that is " A few dollars More" . It is the perfect western. This film is not, simply because it's trying to do too much. It's an hour too long and the plot drifts off in different directions. Sure it has all the superb hallmarks of a Sergio Leone western. It looks amazing , it has a wonderful soundtrack and it finishes with typical tense showdown but it's the bits inbetween namely the civil war scenes that distract from what should have been an amazing western. Angel eyes , the lee van Cleef's character is not engaging enough and i would have loved to have seen him return as Col. Douglas Mortimer who we saw in the previous film instead we get a character who is given third billing behind Blondie and Tuco. In fact the best character is Tuco ' who is played by Eli Wallach and he gets the vast majority of the screen time.This lacks the brutality of the previous films and maybe that is because Sergio Leone was going for that wider audience. 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolute brilliance. Ever wonder why this movie is rated an average of 9.0, and is ranked #4 on IMDb's all-time Top 250? It's over 40 years old, and it's still a stunning movie.I noticed some people on the forums wondering the ages of the people who enjoyed this movie, well I'm 23 and I've just seen it for the first time. I've heard my dad talk about it before, but never being a huge fan of westerns as him, I hadn't really gone out of my way to check it out, until recently. And what an adventure I had. What I enjoyed most about The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly was the gritty realism and attention to every detail. This is really top notch directing by Mr.Leone. Every person, and I do mean EVERY person was very cautious and wily, just like it was back in the Old West. Good, honest people don't live very long, if such people even existed back then. It's just brilliant. The music and sound effects are great as well.Clint Eastwood's Blondie character will be memorable no doubt, but IMO it's Eli Wallach who completely steals the show with his character, the sidekick, Tuco. If there were Oscars back then he should have nailed it without a doubt. Unbelievable acting, and further helped that Tuco had some of the best lines in the movie. I also loved the church scene where, in a span of about 5-8 minutes of character development, it showed that Tuco also had a good, sensitive side despite being a rascal. That was very touching and as I've said many times, just a work of ART. There are many more memorable scenes that I will remember forever: - Tuco getting angry and yelling "you bastid! you SOB!" - Blondie lighting a match with his thumb like a lighter - you pig! - at the last scene after Blondie shoots Angel Eyes, Tuco tries to finish him off but his gun goes click-click-click! - the many times Tuco crossing himself (those that come in by the door *cross*) - Blondie lighting the cannon with his cigar, great prank! Tuco is the classic sidekick. He has inspired many, many actors and scriptwriters to follow his path of the quirky, funny, and sometimes double-crossing sidekick. The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly proves that you don't need excessive swearing and car chases to make a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Definitive western....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A truly magnificent 3 hour long tale of three bandits, on the trail of half a million dollars in stolen confederate gold. Clint Eastwood is Blondie, a mercenary gunman who partners up with the Mexican bandit Tucco (Eli Wallach) to play a con on several different western towns. Tucco plays the part of captured bandit, Blondie the part of bounty hunter who has captured the wanted criminal. Subsequently he collects the reward, and Tucco is to be hung. But being a con, naturally Blondie just shoots Tuccon down off the hangman's rope, and into the sunset they ride to their next con job. Into the fray rides Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef playing the role to menacing perfection), a ruthless killer on the trail of the stolen gold after two of the thieves turn on each other, both hiring Angel Eyes to murder the other. He may be a ruthless killer, but he does have a perverted sense of honor, and thus fulfills both contracts, but not before one of the men tells him the story of the stolen gold, and whom he should seek out to get it, another thief in on the heist, who has now joined up with the Confederate army. As the broad backdrop of the Civil War rages on, we are given a microcosm of the conflict with not two, but three competing sides. What's interesting here is the dichotomy of the characters being almost mirror images of one another. Each a skilled gunman, and proficient killer. However, what separates the three is the degree of morality each has; Blondie killing only when necessary, when he's confronted with no other choice. Tucco kills for convenience, his life of crime has made him many enemies, so he's often faced with the end result, those out for revenge. But Tucco has a softer side, and we see several revelations about his upbringing that place him in a somewhat more heroic light than he first comes across as. Finally, there's Angel Eyes, a demonic killer with no empathy, sympathy or moral direction. He's out to get everything in life for himself, and will sell out anyone that tries to stop him. He delights in torture, but seldom sullies his own hands. He prefers to let others do the dirty work, and enjoys the spoils. I really think he's a representation of the Devil. Someone that enjoys manipulating, killing and causing chaos. A being totally involved with the pleasures of life regardless of the cost to others. The film's climax with a Mexican standoff is priceless, and the entire film is a enjoyable, riveting experience that should be on the beginners list for Western film viewing. Interestingly enough, it is so deep and nuanced, it can easily go onto an Experts list for WEstern viewing as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beautifully shot and packed with a wickedly grim sense of humour this is one of the finest westerns this side of John Huston. Starring a stony faced don't-laugh-don't-blink Clint Eastwood and a crafty, weasely Eli Wallach it covers most of the genre's typical themes, albeit in a more gonzoid fashion, ranging from public hangings to duels and back.Sergio Leone goes to great lengths to create just the right atmosphere, filming even the smallest rolling tumbleweed if it improved on his vision. Consequently this an epic of epic length, which is bound to put some people off.However, the huge amounts of iconic moments, the sweeping Morricone soundtrack and the sheer wide-eyed sense of adventure it oozes turns it into a great slice of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest western ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing to say about this movie is that it is probably a prequel to the first two dollar movies.I say this because towards the end of the movie Clint Eastwood's character actually finds the poncho that he wears in the first two films. This is a great movie and in my opinion the finest western ever.I think that it has gained respect critically with each passing decade and rightly so.It comes in at almost three hours and it really does need to be that long. What is so great?The three leading actor's are all top notch here.Clint Eastwood fits the role to perfection,Lee Van Cleef oozes menace and Eli Wallach chews up every scene he is in in probably his best loved role.The story is basically a hunt for missing gold set against the backdrop of the American Civil War and is beautifully told.Then there is the music which is tremendous throughout. This is a pretty long and violent journey but boy is it worth it.The final 30 minutes of the film are tremendous and the final shoot out grips with tension.I remember the first time I saw it and couldn't believe that Clint could possibly leave poor old Tuco to hang in the middle of the graveyard and even though the character of Tuco is a bit of a swine I was really pleased Clint decided to save him after all.Watch this movie.Not only is it a great western,it is a fantastic film in it's own right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is totally brilliant. It is with out a doubt the best western ever and (I think) the best movie ever. The last scene in the graveyard were Eli Wallach is running and the shootout after wards is easily the best scene ever. I just love it. The drama in this movie can probably never ever be achieved again. This is the masterpiece of masterpieces. For those people who think this movie is boring and do not understand what I mean with drama I will explain - what you think is most boring in this movie is what makes it the best. What you think is the most boring is the drama.The plot is brilliant in its way of not building up the conflict right away as it does in many movies. I mean it takes more than an hour to get to the real conflict and then the journey to the resolving of the conflict is not long. The cast is incredible and simply genius. All the actors fits perfectly into their role they all do a solid effort. Eli Wallach and Clint Eastwood being the best actors in this production. Their characters are a perfect match and they play out against each other making them grate. The only downside when it comes to the cast is that all the actors look like crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Western's Best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've borrowed this DVD (the English/French/Spanish version) from a college friend of mine. Boy, was that movie long! But still, this is a great western. A spaghetti western, actually.I loved how the authenticity of the old American West was depicted in this film (even though it was all shot in Spain and Italy). I also liked that this starred Clint Eastwood; he was a great cowboy movie star ala John Wayne and Gene Autry. Some of my favorite parts included action with guns, getting down hanging people, and best of all, the bridge explosion, which required a lot of time, effort, and work to do! "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" is considered the best western movie ever made according to this website. I certainly agree.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely love this movie. A perfect balance of casting, dialog, and soundtrack. After seeing this movie I had to go out and buy the soundtrack, which is an amazing blend of ridiculous, sentimental, and beautiful. Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and especially Eli Wallach really get into their characters. I suppose this could be classified as a guy film (I'm a woman), but it is a really good one! I don't think the movie makers made much attempt at portraying events accurately but instead focused on mood. I hope they never try to remake this one because it is so perfect.None of Leone's other movies comes close to this one ("Once Upon a Time in the West" is his second best). It is one of the few movies I have seen that has an amazing ending. It might be a little long in parts for some viewers, but I enjoyed the humor and dream-like quality. Please try this movie--even if you don't enjoy it you'll at least get some of the references in Kill Bill vol. 2 (a lesser movie by far in my opinion) and other films that are influenced by it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the spaghetti westerns and one of the all time best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the beginning of the sixties the western genre was going through a crisis. It was suffering from lack of ideas, also the great directors and technicians were getting old and were not being replaced. That is when the spaghetti western came in, which was more violent and also had a somber mood. Initially the spaghetti tried to pass as American westerns by giving fictitious American names to the actors, directors etc. With time they were accepted on their own, and started becoming more elaborate. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is undoubtedly the highest level reached by an Italian western. It can easily be placed among the ten all time best of the genre. The choice of the actors was superb, the music was superb, and so was the story. Eli Wallach stands out as the ugly, his facial expressions show his thoughts more than any words. It shows that in spite of him being a killer, with no morals and self respect, there is a fraction of goodness in him which makes it possible for him to become partners with Clint Eastwood. Lee Van Cleef is a totally bad guy, no way of him being partners with anybody, he would eventually kill them. To call Eastwood good is almost a joke, he is also a killer, but considering the type of guys he is dealing with, among them he is certainly the good one. As they go on the search for the money they meet a group of Union soldiers on an useless fight over a bridge. This sequence is meant to show how life is worthless on a war, and it does it very well. Eventually you get to the climax of the film which is the three facing each other and ready to draw. By that time you realize that three hours have passed, three enjoyable hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The King of all epic westerns.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nearly forty years after it was made this movie still holds and rightly deserves it's place at the top of the heap in western genre.Adding yet another big American star to his company, (this time Eli Wallach,) Sergio Leone delivers his most optimistic effort in the Man with No Name trilogy. This film makes the previous two pale in comparison, not only in it's duration but on its grandiose and panoramic scale.With an exiting plot and battle scenes which would make Sir David Lean green with envy, Leone pushed the Italian western boat out further than it had ever been before. If Leone's association with Clint Eastwood was to come to an end, then this was the high note for it to have ended on.Eastwood plays our favourite anti-hero yet again, this time showing more humane sides to his personality, for instance the comfort he gives a dying soldier in his last few minutes of life and the fact that besides his life of killing, he is not beyond sitting down and stroking a kitten.Lee Van Cleef, the veteran of many B westerns of the fifties and of Leone's second No Name yarn, plays Angel-eyes (the Bad) and he is evil to the extremes. Brutality and violence seems the key to his whole character and he plays it so well.Wallach is out-standing as Tuco (the Ugly) and practically steals the whole film. His character is completely without morals or scruples and seems to have the longest criminal record in history. It is the interaction with Eastwood's character that makes this film so entertaining.In the beginning, Tuco and No Name have formed an uneasy partnership to the effect that No Name catches the wanted felon, turns him in for the reward money, rescues him from the noose where-after the money is split and the same system is worked in the next town with equal success. This provides a few entertaining scenes between the two which rival most conventional "buddy" movies.However, when they learn of a cache of hidden gold the two reform their reluctant partnership in their efforts to find it. This is purely because Wallach knows the name of the graveyard in which the gold is buried and Eastwood knows the name of the grave it is buried under.Add to this Cleef's interest in the hidden gold and his murderous ways of getting to it and provide a setting as bloody as the American Civil War, you have an exiting film full of gun-play and double-crosses, that is both original and unique.It is certainly the most bloodthirsty of the three movies and is at times horrific in it's violence. For instance, the scenes where systematic beatings are administered to the Confederate prisoners. If these images aren't graphic enough, the soft mellow music being played in the background is in such stark contrast to the action, you sense the suffering and pain more.I think my favourite scene in any film has to be Eli Wallach running around the gigantic graveyard looking for the one grave he suspects hides the fortune. Accompanied by Ennio Morricone's now famous score and fantastic spinning camera angles, this scene is movie making at it's best and everything the cinema was created for.I think it would be hard to find anyone on this planet who has not seen this film, but if you haven't do so NOW. Not only will you be entertained but you will have the gratification of knowing you have seen one of the greatest films ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this world, there's two kinds of people, my friend - those who like spaghetti westerns and those who don't. Personally, I think this is one of the greatest films ever made. Nothing can match Sergio Leone's masterful direction, the twangy score by Ennio Morricone, or the ever-cool presence of Clint Eastwood. It's near enough perfect. There are also memorable performances from Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef, who as always has an air of menace about him. The film is also packed full of memorable moments - such as the climactic final showdown - and there is plenty of wry humour to keep you amused as well as amazed. Idiots? It's for you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Film ABOUT the Civil War Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During his 25 years as a director, Sergio Leone directed only eleven films. Remarkably, eight rate a 7.0 or better among IMDB members, and five are the on the IMDB Top 250 film all time best list! GB&amp;U is the highest rated of Leone films by IMDB subscribers. GB&amp;U is also the final segment of the most successful western trilogy ever made, the "man with no name" series; though GB&amp;U is a prequel to the first film, A FISTFULL OF DOLLARS. Narratively, I've always felt GB&amp;U is the weakest of the series. However, now that I have seen the DVD version with the excised scenes, I believe it is the strongest. Two scenes in particular tie the film together. The first, and most crucial, is a scene where Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) visits a battle-damaged Confederate fort and is told the best place to find "Bill Carson" (if he is alive) is in the Union P.O.W. camp. So Angel Eyes appearance later in the film at the camp as the chief jailer makes sense. The second excised scene shows Tuco (Eli Wallach) taking the horribly dehydrated Blondie (Clint Eastwood) to the nearest confederate camp, and finding out the mission where his brother lives is nearby. Now, Tuco's assuming the identity of "Bill Carson" makes much more sense.I can still quibble with some other shortcomings of the film. Lee Van Cleef did such a terrific job as a the heroic Colonel Mortimer in the previous film in the trilogy, FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE, it is almost impossible to accept him here as the cold- blooded killer Angel Eyes (Could the name be referring to the "Angel of Death?" The narrative never explains.) Second, though Eastwood's hair is blonde in highlights, the name "Blondie" seems rather arbitrary and, again, jarring. Still, these are minor quibbles about a film and a series that transformed westerns completely. The influence of the "Man With No Name" series can be found in virtually every great western made since.Though the narrative is, on the surface, about three incredibly ruthless men pursuing $200,000 across a landscape of the Civil War, GB&amp;U's underlying agenda is "anti-war", particularly the Vietnam War. The film makes these points effectively without being offensively preachy.Critics of the time criticized the film for "putting a desert in the middle of the South." What a crock! Although not in thecenter of the War Between the States, quite a bit of action took place in New Mexico and Texas, and the film's writers even got the generals' names right!This is the handsomest of all of Leone's films, and that's saying a lot. The art direction and set decoration are particularly impressive, down to the mortars, gatling guns and naval-style artillary of the time. Amazingly, CLEOPATRA, made four years before, cost almost 30 times as much! Never before or since have I seen so much of the budget up there on the screen.If you plan to see this film, make sure you watch it on a DVD with additional scenes. You will need to turn on the English subtitles, since the cheap distributors didn't bother to hire "sound-alikes" to dub these "fill-in" scenes. Hopefully, CRITERION will one day release a restored version of this films with the additional scenes inserted in the film where they belong. After seeing the additional scenes, I raised my rating of the film from a "7" to a "9". THAT'S how important they are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is impossible to explain just how good this movie is without having you see it. On the face of things this movie should have been a disaster. Made by Italians, filmed in Spain and with only two of the cast members speaking English. In addition this movie has more historical and geographical errors than a Monty Python film. The plot is meant to take place in the South but the landscape is sheer desert (with sand dunes and all) and the weapons are completely from another era. But, despite all this, this is by far the best Western ever as well as having the best opening and closing scenes of any movie I have ever seen in my life. Absolutely brilliant!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's debatable of course, since there are legions of fans of the first two films in Sergio Leone's Dollars Trology, but with each film there not only came a longer running time, but also a rise in quality - debatable of course!Here for the third and final part of the trilogy, Leone adds Eli Wallach to the established pairing of Lee Van Cleef and Clint Eastwood, and brings all his tools of the trade to the party. Plot is slight, the three principals are on a collision course to find some buried gold, with each man having varying degrees of scuzziness, so how will it pan out?Such is the genius of the narrative, it's a fascinating journey to undertake. The characterisations are ripe and considered, the various traits and peccadilloes beautifully enhanced, and with Leone being Leone, there's no shortage of cruelty and humour. He also brings his style, the close ups, long shots and some outstanding framing of characters in various situations.The story encompasses The Civil War, which pitches our leads into "The Battle of Branston Bridge", where here we get to see just how great Leone was at constructing full on battle sequences. It's exciting, thrilling and literally dynamite, whilst Aldo Giuffr? as Captain Clinton turns in some memorable support.The Euro locations pass muster as the Wild West, superbly photographed by Tonino Delli Colli, and then of course there is Ennio Morricone's musical compositions. It's a score that has become as iconic as Eastwood's Man With No Name, a part of pop culture for ever more. It mocks the characters at times, energises them at others, whilst always us the audience are aurally gripped.There's obviously some daft coincidences, this is after all pasta world, and the near three hour run time could be construed as indulgent. But here's the thing, those who love The Good, The Bad and the Ugly could quite easily stand for another hour of Leone's classic. I mean, more barbed dialogue, brutal violence and fun! Great, surely!From the sublime arcade game like opening credit sequences, to the legendary cemetery stand-off at the finale, this is a Western deserving of the high standing it is held. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just come from watching that pigswill, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, so I thought it only fitting that I review what I believe to be the greatest film of all time.I don't say that lightly. If you dislike this film, you have a problem. This is why:1. Characters are perfectly cast and perfectly executed. 2. Story is perfectly executed. 3. Dialogue is perfectly executed. 4. Screenplay is perfectly executed. 5. Pacing is perfectly executed. 6. Tone and feel are perfectly executed. 7. Acting is perfectly executed. 8. Direction is perfectly executed. 9. Music is perfectly executed. 10. Set design is perfectly executed.And I mean PERFECTLY EXECUTED.There is not one negative I can find about this film (apart from the fact it ended). Not one. Even the added scenes were brilliant and only added to the spectacle. The whole film is a masterpiece, and unlike a lot of films with that tag, this film deserves it. I have not seen another film this perfectly executed across the board. I haven't the words to describe just how well made this film is from every point of view. I never get bored of watching this film or quoting it.And guess what... no CGI, no stupid chase scenes, no action scenes for the sake of it. The film couldn't be made today because people just aren't capable of this level of magnificence anymore. Finally, Eli Wallach stole the show as Tuco, even upstaging Clint Eastwood. If you haven't seen this film yet, I envy you.DLPB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember when my Dad was able to find the DVD for GBU in 2002. So one day my Mom and Dad watched it, granted I was only ten at the time, I wasn't really interested. However I saw it last year with both of them and I realized that five years ago I chose late night Nickelodeon over one of the greatest films ever made! It truly didn't take more than two minutes to get me obsessed with the picture, and I had to watch it ten more times. It was a true classic! Every single scene in that picture is a definite classic, most particular the scenes where:1. Blondie helps and shares his cigar with the dying soldier, which was one of the most moving scenes ever.2. Tuco ends up at Sad Hill, and how he runs to find the grave marked "Arch Stanton". That whole scene is one of best in film history. 3. And obviously, the final Mexican standoff between Blondie, Tuco, and Angel Eyes. The score is simply amazing; whenever I see the standoff with the score reaching it's final crescendo, I get the chills every time. Who wouldn't?

		<fullReview>Oh yeah!, I just Love Spaghetti Westerns Most of All Sergio Leone's Trilogy (Per un Pugno di Dollari, Per Qualche Dollaro in pi? and of course Il Buono Il Brutto e Il Cattivo. But I would not rate or comment on this movie only as a Western but as a Motion Picture that is watched by generations and has a great influence on filmmakers today. I watched this film for the first time when I was 13 and I just love it more each time I watch ItIl Buono Il Brutto e Il Cattivo is different from the classic Wayne and Ford Westerns, this movie as all "Spaghetti Westers" (called like that because of their Italian Origins and filmmakers like Sergio Leone) They show the darker Uglier and dirtier side of westerns and in my opinion also a more realistic feel to how people really where during the civil war, instead of the usual Twinkle from John Waynes bright teeth, We see three men who are ten times more believable real dirty and gritty. Eli Wallach's superb acting as Tuco (The Ugly) makes him my favorite character in the movie, constantly changing facial expressions based on each situation first he is angry then he is nice, he shows the brutal and greedy side as well as the genuine and caring human side So Thumbs Up Mister Wallach. Clint Eastwood on the other hand is in his usual cool self you see in the other two movies of the No name Trilogy, Very careful on which words he uses as well as not using any words but sending a strong emotion (when he offers his cigar to the wounded man in the broken down house) that cigar makes him unique , apparently Eastwood asked Director Sergio Leone if he could stop using it in some scenes, Leone answered by saying " If you don't have the cigar, you don't have the same character."The Screenplay is very original and leaves a lot of suspense in certain scenes, you never get bored or tired although the movie is pretty long you don't feel time passing by you are just captured by the story and cant wait to see what happens next. Of course this film would be only be half as good if it did not have Ennio Morricone's Fantastic Score which sets a perfect mood to each scene, and I am not surprised to see many songs from this scored used in so many other movies, I am surprised it took so long for the Academy Awards to recognize him by giving him an Oscar.Overall this movie is a must see for Western Lovers and Movie Lovers in general and I am very pleased to see it in IMDb's Top ten Movies.Favorite Quote: "You see , In this World there are two kinds of people my friend, those with loaded guns and those who dig, You dig!."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are a lot of westerns made but this one takes the cake. I loved tombstone but this movie had it all. You really don't appreciate this type of film or Clint Eastwood until you watch a really crap ass film like "Hang Em High". Before anyone watches any of clint's films you have to watch a fistful of dollars, for a few dollars more and then The good the bad the ugly. This story is just awesome on so many levels, it keeps you watching every minute (even though it's a 2 hour and 40 minute film). The best part is no part really drags, its all toward the main purpose of the story. Watch Hang em high and you'll see a traditional American western get dragged out (i can't stand that flick.) Anyways if you want to watch the film that made westerns popular as well as western games (Red Dead Revolver) watch this film! By the way, the draw at the end is the probably one of the best and creative draws i have ever seen in any western</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is so rewarding to be able to see this: after 35 years my favorite movie ever has made it into the top 20 as voted by IMDb readers. It is the more rewarding if we consider that this single movie made me a cinema lover in the first place, a Clint fan in the second, and has kept me tied to a screen for the best part of 35 years.But to all the young cinema-goers who read this and might be wondering why I say this, I must remind them that in 1970 Leone was not, repeat, was not, the mythical director that he is today, and Clint not only hadn't won any Oscar, on the contrary, most of the critics were just killing him for the same reasons the whole world loves him today. The guy can't act, of course his directorial debut (Play misty for me) is not SO bad, but sure he won't make it on the long run, etc.If you told the Kaels, Eberts or Denbys of that time that one day TGTBTU would be considered not only the BEST WESTERN EVER, but among the 20 best films ever, they would have had a diabetic coma. I remember writing to Spanish movie magazines to make sure they gave TGTBTU its due, only to be scorned at and being said you guy better change hobbies, maybe chess, bird spotting or something, because as a cinema-as-art reviewer you're pitiful.Of course today this seems a heresy, but I assure you, down in 1970 spaghetti westerns were very "seriously panned" and considered to be a sub genre in any branch of the 7 arts, down there with graffiti or comics, or steel drum music.It has taken a whole new generation of moviegoers and the expansion of DVD to reverse this long standing apprehension about TGTBTU. Thanks to them this absolute master piece of cinema has been enshrined where it belongs, where it has belonged all these 35 years, but now at least there's a way to certify it and make sure it will remain there forever.And Clint, read my words, one day you will win the best actor Oscar, and that'll be it.</fullReview>

In my opinion this is the greatest and most stylish western ever made. With a superb mix of action, adventure and drama? and not forgetting the humour.The cinematography is brilliantly captivating (will the great mix of flashy camera angles), the music score is downright dynamic &amp; undoubtedly absorbing and the backdrop of the film is simply breath taking.This is one truly drawn-out western film that feels so surreal at times. It runs for just under three hours, the pace of the film is quite good for a very long film, as Leone's direction is really top-notch that it just doesn't seem to matter as this film is really compelling and dense that you could watch it over and over again and it would still seem fresh.The performances are excellent, Clint Eastwood as the quietly spoken Blondie (the good), Eli Wallach as the humorous Tuco (the ugly) and Lee Van Cleef as the menacing Angel Eyes (the bad). Whenever the three share the screen it's thoroughly imposing and intriguing, though that's greatest thing it doesn't just focus on Eastwood's character- but it has another two strong leads.The story is tremendously set in the background of the American Civil war, with its twists and turns, comedic touches between Blondie and Tuco, powerful images and great shoot-outs.Wow, what a spectacular movie this is by Sergio Leone. A defiant must see for movie lovers.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive Completion of "Nameless Man" Trilogy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone's completion of the "Nameless Man" trilogy is definitely the most popular of all his films. It is the Civil War-era West and the three titled characters (Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach) are all after a hidden fortune of buried gold in an old graveyard. The typical twists and turns come with chess matches aplenty among the three leads as alliances are made, broken and made again. Eastwood became an icon with this one and has not looked back since. Once again, this film has little to do with "A Fistful of Dollars" and "For a Few Dollars More" except for Eastwood's mysterious drifter. Van Cleef plays a different role from the latter film and Wallach makes his first appearance in a Spaghetti Western. Leone shows a real love for the David Lean-styled epic with "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly", but sometimes the film admittedly drags and becomes a little too long. It also does not become quite as complicated as it would have liked to be. Personally, I thought "For a Few Dollars More" was a better production and a bit deeper. Overall though this is another winner from the new-age cinema that came about in the mid-1960s. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of Eastwood's "spaghetti westerns"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly is the most ambitious of all the "Dollar" films. The backdrop of the Civil War aids in this epic that involves three characters, all out to find a stash of Confederate gold. Leone piles up the images, outdoing himself each time. Morricone's score is one of the most memorable scores ever written. The final shootout in the dry lake bed is filled with tension that is so thick you nearly fall off of your seat anticipating the outcome. A great film, that will only get better with age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overly-long western with iconic scenes and sadistic scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of the "dollar trilogy", this is the last, and for me, certainly not the best. The plot line is meandering and it's simply too long for the content. By the time that both Eastwood and Leoni had gotten this far, they had both "made it" in professional terms. The Good, The Bad and The Ugly was the first studio (UA) financed film that Eastwood had starred in and Leoni had produced/directed. Eastwood's role as the man with no name was beginning to jump the shark in this movie and he correctly decided not to appear in Leoni's following movie, Once Upon A Time in the West. For sure it contains iconic scenes, which are often beautifully photographed, but also contains sadistic violence, which even now I find shocking. Part of great filmmaking is plotting an adventure that lasts mosts people's attention span of about 90-120 minutes. This is a 60 minute story in a 180 minute movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone is the definition of artist and director. This movie is just the masterpiece of the art of cinema. The pictures, the dialogs, the actors, the location, the music, everything in that movie makes you feel that what you see is art. There is harmony, rhythm and especially there is realism in that film, something that's missing from the typical westerns. When i first saw that movie i felt like a car had run over me. Since then i still feel the same way when i see that film. Despite the large amount of films that i have seen since then this movie still remains the best film i have ever seen. I think Leone was a man with a very certain idea about cinema that personally finds me agreed. Of course that's just my opinion and i just want you to respect it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best westerns ever made. My personal opinion is that it lacks the drama of 'once upon a time in the west', which makes 'the good' second best to me. 'the good' has more humor, action and plot twists in it, but less scenes that make me shiver (except from the final shootout, which tremendously builds suspense). This is surely a 'must'.'There are two kinds of people...'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Morricone's stunning score is too good for Leone's film. Now, the acting is good, the casting is perfect, the idea is great. So what went wrong?For one, it feels dull. It has a slow pace and often times it becomes irritating. Moreover, some of the scenes have little, if any relevance for the plot. This has an alienating effect on the audience.Another problematic thing is the humour. The film tries to insert humour quite often, but these attempts by and large fail and scenes come across as silly rather than funny. Too often one is left feeling disappointed that the punch line failed to materialize.The action scenes are quite dull as well. The huge numbers of extras in uniforms and all the guns and explosions fail to create any real sense of war. They remain as a rather pale mat painting in the background. As for the revolver duels, they too are surprisingly dull. Granted, the final showdown is quite memorable, but the others are unfortunately rather unimpressive.There is also a lack of logic, which is quite frustrating. There is little in the film that makes sense, the decisions made by characters are often absurd, and the audience is left wondering what actually happened and why.Regarding protagonists, 'the ugly' steals the show, but Eastwood is not given enough things to do. His character remains undeveloped, although Leone makes some attempts to give him depth. Also, the antagonist is not menacing enough. He is given too little screen time and never manages to be a genuine threat.Unnecessary gratuitousness. This is something Spaghetti Western is known for, and something I tend to dislike. There is a scene where Tuco is beaten about in order to extract information from him, and this goes on forever for no reason. Throughout the film there are moments where we are forced to endure protracted, often violent scenes that may seem grand and intense, but carry no emotional punch and have little relevance in terms of advancing the plot. Leone does this time and again, and it is clear that he experiences these scenes in a way that is peculiar to him, but which remains a mystery to many viewers. Too often I feel that he is aiming for an emotion I simply do not experience while watching the film.I will not go on about what else is wrong. I will conclude with some more positive things. As I said, the music is superb and does wonders for the film. Also, I like the general tone. His depiction of the warring parties may be inaccurate, but Leone does manage to create a sense of dread and disgust. The scene in the graveyard, accompanied by Morricone's score is excellent. The counterpoint between the greedy misfits in search of buried gold and the solemnity and horror of the huge graveyard littered with graves of men who died for their ideals is quite effective.The story is definitely a good one, shame the actual script is too weak and Leone's sensibility and sense of humour are, at least in my view, somewhat peculiar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Good, The bad, and the Ugly is a great film. You can't find a better Clint Eastwood movie where he just does he acting (not acting and directing like in 'Million Dollar Baby' which, in my opinion is just an inch better.) Casting no-names for Tuco an the Bad (I can't remember his name) was a humongous risk, but it pays off. This is a film needed for you to buy on DVD. All of the actors (including the family at the beginning, who got killed quickly into the film) were superb. This film told us what it was doing and when, they didn't make curves, the plot was straight forward. This film does definitely deserve the number four rank in IMDb's Top 250 Films. But when you think about, it should be number one.</fullReview>

It took me 5 hours, 3 for the movie and about 2 for the 'specials' (which aren't so special, but hey the film is 40 years old, what can you expect?) Then I spent 2 hours reading opinions about this movie on IMDb. After being exposed to Leone for so many hours I really knew I think this movie is the best movie ever. (I 've thought that for about 15 years now but sometimes bad influences get into my mind and somehow convince me that inferior movies like the Godfather or Lord of the Rings *cough cough* are better) no no without a doubt. THIS is in my opinion the best movie in history. It's just so great. I don't need to tell you. EVERYBODY agrees! read the comments! Oh yeah that's what I was doing remember? reading comments for about 2 hours.The first 50 (or last chronically) comments I read were ALL positive. Not one of them was negative and most of them were lyrical. A+++ Best 10/10 Greatest of all Time it's called... Do I need to say more? then after 50 or so entries finally somebody dared to tell the world he hated this overrated movie. Fortunately for us worshipers he didn't give any reasonable arguments, just told the world what a spoiled brat he is and that this boring movie couldn't entertain him. Fine, go away and go play with your playstation.I went on and the good reviews kept coming. And written by smart people! I learn stuff from these comments. I get the feeling the world isn't such a bad place after all, there are more people in the world with brains. Maybe some of them are even American people! God I love this movie and I love all people that love it too. Thanks for sharing your comments with me. Let me once more assure you we are all right (in this case) this IS the best Western and probably the best movie of all time. and it's great to see appreciation for this movie is still rising the rating are getting better with each passing year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but incredibly overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third and final chapter in the Clint Eastwood/Sergio Leone/Ennio Morricone "Dollars" trilogy is regarded by many as the crowning achievement of the trio,s collaboration.It boasts towering star performances by (as usual)Clint and his old co - star Lee Van Cleef and his new co - star Eli Wallach,a memorable score,an unforgettable showdown in a graveyard and is possibly the most visually stunning western ever made.However,it is also overlong,slow and episodic.The main problem with the film is Leone was trying to do too many things at once.He was trying to be a more epic director,thus making scenes at an almost excessive length and simultaneously he was trying to make anti -war statements,which the film is littered with and sometimes brings the film to a standstill.Also,after the casting of Wallach as Tuco,he was finally directing someone who,s work he,d always admired,resulting in him shifting the focus of attention towards Tuco at the expense of The Man with No Name,which is a big problem I have with the film.I thought Wallach was fantastic as the greedy bandit,but a bit less of him and a bit more of Clint and Van Cleef would have gone a long way.The title is The Good,The Bad and The Ugly,not The Ugly Tuco show.The other problem I have with the film is the plot.Although good,it is very awkward and illogical.In the beginning of the film,Eastwood and Wallach are in the same town as Van Cleef pulling off a bounty hunting scam.Then sometime later after Wallach and Clint fall out,Wallach spends a lot of time tracking Clint down and they make a long trek across the desert.And just as Wallach is about to kill Clint,low and behold,a carriage of horses gallop along just in time to save Clint,s life (having already been saved earlier in the film by an exploding cannon).Then it turns out,inside the carriage is the very man that Van Cleef has been trying to track down.Then after Eastwood and Wallach are captured by the Union army,they end up unbelievably in the very same camp where Van Cleef is.And the contrivances go on and on.The Dollars films always had black humour,but this played like an unintentional spoof.In For a Few Dollars More,Leone was stylish,but never lost track of the plot.And he shifted the focus towards Col.Mortimer,but The Man with No Name was still part of the story.But sadly in this,Clint is too much in the background and at times it comes across as if he,s too aloof from the main action.I don,t really like to slam the film because it does contain some great moments,and I,ll always watch Clint as The Man with No Name,but his shrunken part in the story,some slow pacing and some laughable plotting are three reasons why it will never match the criminally underrated For a Few Dollars More.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among the finest Westerns, though not for all tastes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I have given some pretty long reviews to Clint Eastwood's Westerns--particularly the wonderful FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE, I will only give a brief review of this movie because there are so many reviews already I doubt if my pontificating will actually influence many people. After all, this is widely seen as one of the greatest Westerns ever made and since I liked it immensely, there isn't much need to say more.Well, there are actually a few Westerns I liked a bit more--I am a HUGE fan of THE BIG COUNTRY. But, when it comes to style, originality and the epic proportions of this film, none can match it, though ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST comes very, very close. The acting and script are just fine and the music is intensely weird but effective. Of all the films I have seen with music by Ennio Morricone, this is his most intense and strangest. And it works perfectly in this film, but I also appreciate much of his more restrained work in other films and would never want all Westerns to have such distinctive and bizarre music as in THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY--it would just lose its magic and might even tend to overwhelm the film.About the only negatives about this film are the title and it is a pretty violent film that the little ones probably shouldn't watch. There is a lot of blood and violence and you do get to see (yuck) Eli Wallach's butt. As for the title, sure, Lee Van Cleef was truly "BAD" and Eli Wallach was cure "UGLY", but Clint as "the GOOD"? Well, his character was far from good--but of course, who would like the title to be "The Kinda Good, The Bad And the Ugly"?! Not to be missed by any serious fan or the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't sure if I was going to comment on this film because everything has already been said by the hundreds of other people who have posted their thoughts.This film, in my opinion, is not only the greatest spaghetti western of all time. It is the greatest movie of all time. Period. Regardless of genre. I could probably watch it every day, and be perfectly happy doing so.This film is the kind of thriller where takes you away from the real world of criminal narrows touch was comic character as the director in cash to the situation said the scientist after the war, the silence in some time was fun and very interesting, because it was attracting the attention of the viewer of what will happen. I enjoyed it for the first time and when I saw the second time increased my love for this very wonderful film.The music is perfection. The way the music drives this movie is absolutely amazing. The musical genius of Morricone and the incredible direction of Sergio Leone is a combination that will probably never be equaled. The theme song will forever be etched in your brain. In fact, it probably already is, even if you haven't seen the movie! The scene where Tuco runs through the graveyard with the song "Ecstacy of Gold" is pure poetry. And the showdown at the end with that great music- just incredible.The story is riveting. There is not a single dull moment. The movie is long, but Leone's direction is so good that you will love the fact that you can enjoy this movie for three hours.But there is no doubt this is a very good film, a thrilling last chapter in the story of one of the most iconic characters to ever grace the screen.</fullReview>

There is the opening shootout, involving unrelated characters. There is the con game in which Wallach plays a wanted man, Eastwood turns him in for the reward, and then Eastwood waits until he is about to be hanged and severs the rope with a well-aimed shot. There is the magnificent desert sequence, after Eastwood abandons Wallach in the desert, and then Wallach does the same to Eastwood, and the sun burns down like a scene from "Greed." There is the haunting runaway wagon, filled with dead and dying men.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good western but overlong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This takes place during the American Civil War (but was shot in Spain). Three men (Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef) form an uneasy alliance. They don't trust each other and all hate each other but they all want $200,000 hidden away in a cemetery. The first hour is introducing the three characters--the remaining two hours deal with their journey.This has been called an epic and operatic western. I agree! It's beautifully directed by Sergio Leone. He knew how to frame shots and use the wide screen perfectly. Most of the film is told by images not dialogue. Heck there's no dialogue for the first 10 minutes! There's plenty of shoot outs and action. The acting is OK. Eastwood was never a great actor but he's OK here. Wallach gets annoying but that's his character. Van Cleef is just so-so but has little screen time.There's one big problem here--the length. There is no reason for this to go on for three hours. Scenes ramble on inconclusively quite a bit. There's also a long battle scene and talk with a drunken captain that add nothing to the main storyline. The battle scene is impressively done but it's not needed. Still it's an epic and should be seen at least once. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pinnacle of Spaghetti Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone's third piece of the Dollars Trilogy, years ago I watched A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS (1964, 7/10), but FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE (1965) is still sitting laid-back in my waiting to see list. I wish my jumpy sequence might not hinder the logical understanding of the film, although it is never a major concern of Mr. Leone and his team.I cannot claim myself an ardent Western genre follower, also without any trickle of fetish towards neither guns or other weaponry, nor killing for fun, plus being an out-and-out urbanite, my natural response over the usual tonal settings of Western films is quite nonchalant (also the bleak milieu is not my preference to admire), what I need to fathom is whether it will evince any on-screen dynamite to maintain a buoyant vibe through its storytelling and action. THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY, without any doubt, has done a crack job here, the lengthy narrative never cease to fall into tepid, three leading characters are richly depicted with accumulated details and minor plots, Eli Wallach's the ugly, who receives the most amount of screen time and rendered as a complete hypocrisy and opportunist, is the arch-protagonist, Eastwood and Van Cleef's roles are less colorful but more pragmatic to be idolized in the hero and anti-hero cinema realm. One cannot evade Morricone's masterly work (not only in Leone's filmography), but here, his knack of enhancing the whole film's temperament has been comprehensively facilitated, the hyena-mimicking theme tune for me is something worth persisting for my entire life. The very much discussed and highly appreciated Mexican standoff could be regarded as the pinnacle of the wholesome western films, Leone's obsession with relentless close-ups is another trademark of its own kind. Leone's film career is an underachieved one, and most of his fame has been accruing after his untimely decease in 1989 at the age of 60, with only 7 feature films under his rein (another one I have watched is his swan song ONCE UPON A TIME IN America, 1984, 8/10), if only he could live a bit longer, his feat would easily stride outside his comfort zone and evolve himself and his work with the time, like what Martin Scorsese has attained. What should I whine about the film? I really cannot say it explicitly, the only thing impedes me from rating it higher is the innate trait of the grumpy and grubby world, which seems to me like a pit on earth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing movie by Sergio Leone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, when I was a kid I wasn't a fan of westerns mostly because they were old movies and I was skeptical of them. With age I realized that the films made in the past are way better then today's. So a couple of days ago I watched The good, the bad and the ugly for the first time and a bit of skepticism was still present but this movie blew it away.This is a great western movie even if it has been made by an non- American director. Sergio Leone did an amazing job leaving me breathless after a 3-hour adventure. In the focus of the movie are three bandits, lone-wolfs during the civil war in search of a hidden 200 000 dollar treasure. The "good" is Blondie played by Clint Eastwood who is a cool, intelligent and reasonable man and has a sense of justice and kindness in him which makes him good against the other two main characters. This is visible in the way he treats his "friend" Tuco, he gives him a hard time but hesitates to kill him (in the final scene) although Tuco was trying to kill him and tortured him in the desert; as well in the scene when he gives his jacket and a cigar to a dying soldier. The "bad" is a bandit called Angel Eyes played by Lee Van Cleef. He is ruthless and cold-blooded, he knows what he wants and does everything needed to reach his goals. We can see it clearly in the opening scenes of the movie when he is trying to get information from a ordinary man in his house. The man is terrified and reveals the information and gives Angel Eyes his money and Angel Eyes kills him like he has a rock for a heart. The "ugly" is Tuco played by Eli Wallach, the third bandit and the most complex character in the movie. He has a twisted personality, he's a cheater, a liar, a hypocrite. At first he's was Blondie's enemy and wanted to kill him and the next moment he was his friend because he had interest from him. He has a temper and is quick-minded which gets him often into trouble. But he has this special characteristic - he gets under your skin and is very likable to the audience as well to Blondie.The movie is very interesting, there isn't a wasted scene in the 3-hour play. Scenes are a bit long but gives the viewer enough time to get in it, to fully feel the scene. It is also very tense, many times you know or assume what's going to happen but the length of the scene and the tension blows you away when the scene reaches it's peak. Music in the movie is amazing and I just love the work Ennio Morricone did. I especially loved the music in the scenes in the soldier camp when Wallace was beating Tuco and in the final scene. The Final scene is breath-taking and intense. The three main characters meet at the Cemetery and there is a gun fight going on to see who will collect the money. Blondie assumed Tuco was going to go for Angel Eyes for revenge but sill he wasn't sure because of his nature so he unloaded his pistol some time before, so his only concern was Angel Eyes and Blondie killed him. One of my favorite scenes was the bridge fight with the Alcoholic Union and their captain. That scene has a symbolic meaning i liked. The two opposing armies are fighting over a bridge that must not be destroyed. Every day they meet on the bridge and kill each other for nothing. I think Sergio Leone was trying to say how war is stupid and makes no sense. They wouldn't be fighting there if there weren't a bridge but the bridge mustn't be destroyed. It's is an endless circle. The captain also sees no point but keeps on going because it's bigger then him. The idea of war is terrifying and he uses alcohol to get himself and his soldiers drunk in order to turn their minds of it and give them courage to continue going despite the horror and terror of what lies in front of them. Union Captain at the Bridge: "Whoever has the most liquor to get the soldiers drunk and send them to be slaughtered... he's the winner." Leone's main characters don't care about the war and are only interested in money, they are surrounded by it and get involved in it a couple of times but only not to raise suspicion and to settle down until they can go forward. He simply divided them and the war which I like. He also acts through them and has impact on the war part of the story and that is when Blondie and Tuco blow up the bridge in order to prevent the fights and get across unnoticed, they did it because they needed to pass to not because they wanted to stop the fighting and useless dying on the bridge, but Leone wanted and he did it through his characters. It also has symbolic meaning.Overall, this is a great film. I don't know much about the movie elements and can't comment on that, but I did Anallise the story and some events as I saw them. Anyway, the movie is great and is defiantly on the top 10 all time best movies list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Good, The Bad And The Ugly features one of the best film scores ever, by Ennio Morricone at his creative greatest, and it soars in the way it's applied to enhance even the most routine scenes; dazzling cinematography, by Tonino Delli Colli, including some of the best and most realistic battle scenes ever filmed; and well written and well acted characters, by the Good- Blondie (Clint Eastwood), and the Bad- Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), this film is dominated by the Ugly, Tuco Ramirez, the Mexican bandito played by Eli Wallach. The character is sort of an even more stylized riff on the bandito, Calvero, he essayed in The Magnificent Seven, which saw that character absorb some of the lunacy of the samurai played by Toshiro Mifune in Seven Samurai; but that's what makes it even better. It's simply one of the greatest comedic performances in film history. He owns the picture, much in the same way as the Lee Van Cleef character owned For A Few Dollars More, and like Van Cleef's character, in that film, Tuco often outsmarts the Eastwood character, One simply cannot turn away, lest miss a sight gag or joke or wince of frustration that sets the screen alive. Much of this is due to the fact that Wallach is, simply put, one of the best and most versatile actors of the last six decades, but much also has to be granted to the film's screenplay, penned by Leone, Agenore Incrocci, and Furio Scarpelli, from a story by Leone and Luciano Vincenzoni. It crackles with depth, humor- especially quotable one and two liners, pathos (see the scenes with Union and Confederate soldiers), and rage, and is one of the rare films that deserves the moniker epic.The Good, The Bad And The Ugly, despite some flaws, is a great film, for it is so engaging and well written that it moves far faster than its three hour time, actually 'feeling' more like a 90 minute film; an effect that often occurs in the long and slow films of Bela Tarr. From its opening credits to its end the film never takes itself seriously, which helps mitigate said flaws, and the trilogy, as mentioned, and as a whole, is probably the best example of an artist recognizing his own flaws and correcting them with each subsequent film. This trend would reach its apex in Once Upon A Time In The West, but it started here, in this trilogy. Watch all three films, and especially this one, to see the proof that the terms 'high art' and 'fun' are not mutually exclusive. Now, get going'!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Spaghetti Western!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this is not THE best ever, then "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly" has to be ONE of the greatest Westerns ever made.The plot is classic, with all the appropriate twists; the (American) actors are excellent, particularly Eli Wallach as Tuco. He gives depth to what could otherwise be a stock bandit character. Lee Van Cleef gives probably his best performance as Angel Eyes, simply the most chilling villain to ever appear on film.Even the music is top-notch, especially the score heard as Tuco searches the graveyard and at the final shootout. Director Sergio Leone is at his best here, with his trademark extreme closeups intercut with sweeping panoramic landscapes. Don't miss the huge Civil War battle or the three-way(!) shootout.The action is great, the dialogue is great, and there are some really memorable quotes to be found here ("Whoever double-crosses me and leaves me alive, he understands nothing about Tuco"). This is a five-out-of-five winner that every fan of film must see again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Eastwood Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good, the Bad and The Ugly really was appealing. I watched the director's cut version and although it was quite long in time, it didn't feel like very long film. Shortly, I liked the film, because I liked the spaghetti western features in it: like long scenes where the camera just shows the faces of people. Spaghetti westerns really have something that westerns which are made, for example, in Hollywood lack.The movie had everything in order. The plot was interesting, scenery fit the atmosphere perfectly and of course the cast was great. The main characters, including Clint Eastwood as the good, were credible. Unfortunately I have not much experiment in other westerns, so I have no proper film to compare it to. But I think it was a really good film.And there is no better gunslinger than Eastwood!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early Eastwood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At three hours in length, the word epic can be applied to Sergio Leone's western. Clint Eastwood is Blondie, or the good, Lee Van Cleef is Angel Eyes, or the bad, and Eli Wallach is Tuco, or the ugly. He does a fine job portraying a Mexican bandit, who begins the story in a shoot out with bounty hunters. He kills two of them, and wounds the third during an escape. Blondie is a lone gunman who captures Tuco and collects $2,000 for turning him into the law. At the hanging, he shoots the rope, allowing Tuco to run away. They later meet up and divide the money. They repeat the scam several times, but Tuco complains constantly, and so Blondie leaves him in the desert and takes all the cash. Tuco later tracks down Blondie with three guys who shoot at him, but they are killed in the battle. Tuco manages to hold Blondie at gunpoint, and as he tries to hang him, a cannonball hits and Blondie escapes. The reunite and find another guy for the hanging con, but the rope isn't shot and he dies. Tuco then marches Blondie into desert again with to die. Blondie asks for water for giving Tuco information about the name on a gravestone where Confederate gold is buried. Further adventures take place until the apparent final resting place of the gold is reached and there is a Mexican standoff. Eastwood and Wallach are standouts as the pair of gunslingers, and Leone just lets them rip. Patience is required for this western, but it is worth the journey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Spaghetti' Western is a misleading term, this is some fine Italo-American cuisine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First up for a spaghetti Western this doesn't appear anywhere near as hackneyed and half-arsed as the label might lead you to believe. In fact the blu-ray I rented looked pretty awesome.The tale of the three titular desperados is long and elaborate. How long? How about 3 hours long. Long enough to have two on screen deaths and a full meal eaten before a line of dialogue is uttered.The Good is Clint Eastwood, a rough n tough cowboy who plays as fair as you play him. He sports a perpetual three day growth and an equally permanent short cigar propped out of the corner of his thin lips.The Bad is Lee Van Cleef, a dodgy soldier on the lookout for a man with one eye, for reasons that I will explain later.The Ugly is the only guy with a name used regularly, Tuco (Eli Wallach). In fact Tuco is pretty much the star of the show, though Good n Bad get their moments.Good, Bad and Ugly are eventually all in pursuit of the same target, stolen gold coins, the whereabouts of which are only known to a one eyed soldier who sports a patch.The greater part of the film plays like those riddles where the farmer must get the chook, the fox and the wheat from one shore to the other without something eating something else, only he can only fit one thing in his boat at a time. The Bad knows the location of the gold, the Good knows not the location but specifics once you get there, and the Ugly is the key to bringing all loose ends together.Each of the grimy trio spend ample time getting to know ? and beat the shtuffing out of ? each other. They take turns leaving each other for dead and at various times all seem to hold the upper hand, only to have it taken from them.There are loads of close ups highlighting shifty eyes, many slow drawn out scenes including what must be the longest Mexican stand off on history, and I must say the makeup jobs were quite well done. As the film is set in the US civil war era some of the settings are surprisingly intricate and feature a cast of thousands of well costumed extra, further dispelling any notion that I had of a 'spaghetti Western' being a cheap knock-off, and though the length and long periods of inactivity were a little different to my modern day ADD sensibilities I was rarely bored, which in a three hour 45 year old film might be the strongest recommendation I can give.Final Rating ? 7.5 / 10. I wish I could explain it better but the circular sounding whistle that forebodes every gun fight (and parody) know to film originated in this film. If you only watch once Western this year ? or this decade ? you could do a lot worse than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The decent, the bad and the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is where the "Man Without a Name" trilogy ends. Or rather this is where it begins (in a minor major plot spoiler). Clint Eastwood for the third time dons his trademark multicoloured poncho to mark his place in the international hall of fame, while Sergio Leone imprints himself as one of the greats of world cinema. After a poorly remade "Yojimbo" and a barely passable "For a Few Dollars More" Leone manages to take hold of all that worked in his previous movie (long focused eyeshots, Enrio Morricone's soundtrack, quirky but memorable one-liners, the Eastwood character) and molds it together with a very good plot, great cast, witty dialogue and a markedly improved budget. The end product is an absolute classic Western. Despite a wacked-up moral compass it permeates with a sense of profound humanity, which manages to entice in between the wit and humour of the main action. Running a mere 3 hours in the extended version time flies by unnoticed, which says a lot about how well and how entertaining this movie is.The 'bad' is money-hungry (albeit all three of our antiheroes love their piece of gold) and scrupulous hired killer Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef). The 'ugly' is wacky wanted dead or alive criminal joker Tuco (Eli Wallach). The 'good' is a morally ambiguous gunslinger, who seems to be more interested in cash than the idea of right or wrong. In the first scene with him in it we see Clint gun down three bounty hunters simply because they were after the same man. Somehow however in this dastardly world, where the Civil War reigns supreme, his character always seems to come out as the better man. Naturally being the fastest gun in the state with the bestest aim period always helps. Especially when there is treasure buried in a cemetery deep in the Civil War front-line. Given the era in which this is based the moral ambiguity of good seems to speak in volumes that in such times of war and strife the definition itself seems to shift drastically. The grey area is vast in Sergio Leone's wild west and suitably so. Nonetheless both Tuco and Blondie (the Man Without a Name has a nickname) are extremely likable antiheroes, while Angels Eyes makes for a memorable... eee... villain?Given the budget and scope of the production Leone manages to create a shameless epic, where simultaneously the small-mindedness starkly contrasts, but also beautifully completes, the tragic enormity of death and war. The audacity of war seems to be reflected in these petty squabbles over money, as if the war itself is nothing more than such an feeble argument enhanced to the stage of mass slaughter. Within this logic Blondie turns out to be an almost angelic figure, who in all his money warmongering is able to have brief flashes of sincere and unabated selflessness. But than again it hard not to agree with Tuco and he exclamation that Blondie is nothing more than a dirty son of a &amp;^%$*.An absolute classic movie with an influence on Westerns, cinematography in general and pop-culture that is impossible to undermine. The iconic eye shots, music, showdowns and characters remain as influential as they were over 40 years ago. And if this doesn't convince you than the longest staring contest in movie history shall blow your socks off (fast forward to the final act for five minutes of nothing else happening but people staring at each other).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most brilliant movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone films are about people and life. The Good, The Bad and The Ugly shares an "anti-war" thematic with A Fistful of Dynamite. The term "Anti-War" is in quotes because the film is not a simplistic "Jane Fonda style" "war is bad and evil and should be ignored and if women ran the world everyone would be lovey dovey." Instead both Sergio Leone films illustrate the brutality and the profitability of war...combined with the inescapable fact that people in military command are fated to destroy human lives...and this is a waste of human lives.The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is a story of humans who have an opportunity to cash in on stolen money. Their plans do not work simply as they would like. Along the journey they learn about each other and make decisions about each other based upon trust...or lack thereof.There are 550+ reviews on this website for the movie so it provides no benefit to re-hash the story; suffice to say that if you do not enjoy this or other Leone films my opinion is that you have a lot to learn about being human.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The high point of the Spaghetti Western sub-genre, Sergio Leone's dubiously-titled masterpiece is a living, breathing encapsulation of everything that made its peers so notorious. Whether you're after atmosphere as thick as smoke, tight-lipped anti-heroes, charmingly bad audio dubs or a cast of thousands, this grand adventure delivers in excess. With a run time of just under three hours, it should go without saying that the narrative sprawls at times, yet expert cinematography, intriguingly era-authentic landscapes, a variety of fresh, varied locations and rich characterization keep the picture from stagnating even when it's been ten minutes since the last line of dialog. Naturally, Leone regulars Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef bring the goods as remotely feuding foils with a penchant for sharp, icy glares; though I preferred their dynamic in the preceding For a Few Dollars More, the two make for a stunning combination whenever they share the screen and it's a shame this marks the end of that brief partnership. It's a terrific picture if you've got the time to really pore over it, but works equally as well as simple background noise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the yardstick used for measuring Spaghetti Westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The quintessential Spaghetti Western put some teeth back into a dying genre, recognizing the American Frontier for what it really was: a patchwork of legends and lies best recreated through broad exaggeration. The result here is a ruthless, violent, oddly skewed facsimile, spread out across a Techniscope landscape with enough dramatic flourishes to suggest a larger-than-life parody. The title roles are played, respectively, by Eastwood, Van Cleef, and Wallach, who steals the film with his brash comic performance, but the real star to emerge from the film was director Sergio Leone himself. All of his now familiar stylistic tics are on display: the portentous wide-angle compositions; the sweaty close-ups; and the director's trademark, patented gun duels, featuring ten minutes of relentless crosscutting between beady eyes and itchy trigger fingers, while Ennio Morricone's classic music score builds to a typically overwrought frenzy on the soundtrack. The body count is surprisingly low (not including the soldiers killed during the geographically imprecise Civil War battle scene), and Leone was already learning the power of myth, testing the waters for his next and last great Western epic: 'Once Upon A Time in the West'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A benchmark in the history of film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was a classic. It was one of the trend-setter in the history of film-making. It not only changed the face of Hollywood but throughout the world. It is a movie which has everything. It has action,drama,suspense and comedy. Although the movie was approximately 3 hrs long but throughout the movie there was not a single instance where one would feel that the movie is boring or is going out of the track.The story of the movie revolves around 2 bandits Tuco(Eli Wallach) and Blondie(Clint Eastwood) who share a common hatred and want to kill each other but are forced to work together to find a hidden treasure whose secret is half-shared by both of them. While they are on their way for the gold they are being chased by a bounty hunter Angel Eyes(Lee Van Cleef) who also knows only the half secret, the part of Tuco. But the journey is not as easy as it seems to be. The mainland is not just a common mainland it is a battlefield where a war is going on and these criminals have to make their way through it.The storyline of the movie is very good and the director has kept a good hold on the story from the very beginning of the movie. The direction is superb and the climax is quite nice and thrilling. This movie has a unique style and the background score is excellent. All the actors in the movie have done a great job. When one sees this movie he feels himself 150 years back in the land of outlaws. A really remarkable movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>could not help but enjoy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I did not hate this movie. I did not love it. I did enjoy it. My main problems with the movie is the music. I was sick and tired of that little piece used for blondie. It got old quickly. The other main issue with it was the whole war scene. It felt so out of place and I feel as if it gave Leone a reason to throw a schmaltzy anti-war message into the film. I did not enjoy that scene and it felt forced and out of character for both the characters and did not fit into the movie. I did enjoy the little quips between blondie and "the ugly". Their dynamic was enjoyable. I do enjoy the sweeping epics with huge shots showing off the landscape. I watched this movie when it was 90 out and I felt like I could really feel the oppressive heat. The desert actually felt like the fourth character in a way that does not happen that often. The acting was alright even though it was over the top. I did enjoy all of the movie with the exception of the one scene. I really liked the opening and it really showed how to slowly build tension. The movie as a whole was extremely well paced with bits of action thrown in there to keep up an overall slow movie. It never felt slow to me and I really just enjoyed looking around. Overall a good movie and maybe if I enjoyed westerns a bit more I would have liked this movie more, but I guess that is just personal preference.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I'll start by saying that when I was younger, I did not see this movie. In fact, yesterday evening was the first time in my life I watched it...I love the movies from the present, movie's like Casino Royale, Avatar, Mission Impossible III. But after seeing this movie, I guess all those movies are almost nothing to me anymore. Let me say, that I have never watched a western movie, or anything with Clint Eastwood.So after the first half hour of watching, I had to stop, but I couldn't. I was so absorbed by the whole setting, music, events... I actually forgot this was a movie. I found it beautiful the way the 3 main characters were introduced, because it was so epic. All I kept doing, was smile during the movie, because of its cleverness. And knowing this was the base for every nowadays western movie, I felt like watching the best movie ever.I really liked the role of Eli Wallach(Tuco) as he was very convincing to me as this antagonist, but also sort of hero. But the star was Eastwood. I just know that he was the perfect guy as Blondie. He acted cool, and did a splendid job at that. Kudos, sir Eastwood! I have come to the conclusion that this movie is my second favorite, and even Avatar can't top this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally got to view this film for the first time, and I'm glad. Since my first viewing was via the blu ray edition of the film, digitally remastered with high definition audio. I can see now why people consider this to be one of the best westerns or THE best of all time. Leone sure loved his wide lens and made brilliant use of it. The cinematography was amazing.Clint Eastwood as usual was a pleasure to watch. He truly has a on screen presence that you can feel. It was the first time I ever saw him in a role that wasn't purely a good guy, if anything he was an anti hero. But even with some "bad" traits he still remained a stoic hero. The actor who played "the ugly" was amazing. Truly comical, but when it came down to business he knew what he was doing. The title sequence was great. And last but certainly not least, the musical score MADE this movie. The film would not be the same without it.I definitely recommend this to all western buffs and fans of classic cinema. But watch it on Blu Ray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three independent gunmen wander through the hell of war in their quest for riches...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The setting: the American Southwest (Texas?) during the Civil War. The set-up: three gunslingers wander through the war-torn country in search of personal gain.Lee Van Cleef is a hit-man (the Bad), Eli Wallach is a bandit (the Ugly), and Clint Eastwood is a lone gunman with scruples (the Good). Wallach's and Eastwood's stories are intertwined, and they eventually meet up with Van Cleef, although he disappears for long stretches of the film. The saga is long and drawn out and the characters are put through a lot in their quest for riches.But I'm not sure that's what the movie's about. It seems to preach the gruesomeness and pointlessness of war, showing wounded soldiers, some who've lost their legs or arms on the battlefield. The three main characters are just passing through. They have no allegiance and their outsider's point of view helps emphasize the absurdity of all that meaningless killing. I wonder if the gunmen's quest is merely the framework for an anti-war movie...Still, there's plenty of gunslinging action, as well as cannonfire and explosions. This Italian-made western is a pretty big production. The biggest of Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, yet, following the low-budget "Fistful of Dollars" and "For A Few Dollars More".If Eastwood's "man with no name" in Leone's "Dollar Trilogy" is meant to be a single character, this film (the final of the three) shows the birth of that man. This is where he acquires his iconic poncho.As far as westerns go, this isn't the usual John Wayne cowboy fare. If you've seen Leone's earlier westerns, you have an idea of what to expect, except this movie is different even from them. It's not about saloons or cattle trails, cowboys or Indians. It's not even about a ruthless villain that must be stopped. It's about three men all looking out for themselves and all after the same thing. Three men who don't trust each other and who can handle a pistol. The movie is violent, but fun. It takes place across many locations, right in the middle of Civil War action. The war is the backdrop, not the Old West. The whole thing is not quite like any other western film I've seen.IMDb currently rates this as #4 on its Top 250. I don't know if I'd rate it that highly after my first viewing, but it's good. There are many effective stretches with sparse dialogue and the film is full of black humor. There are several memorable sequences. An enjoyable watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sergio Leone's magnificent, operatic Western is a benchmark in cinema... Outstanding stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good The Bad and The Ugly (1966)Sergio Leone's masterful last part of his 'Spaghetti Western' trilogy is perhaps the greatest Western of all time. This is hardcore Western stuff for any aficionado of the genre. The scenery, the dodgy characters, the morally flexible hero, stand-offs and sensational music and superb direction.Ennio Morricone's score is one of the very best ever committed to film. Truly outstanding. It is a joke that it did not win the Academy Award for Score (it wasn't even nominated).Clint, Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef provide suitable and exciting performance as the 'good', 'ugly' and 'bad' in this bonanza of a western! The last sequence in the graveyard is one of the greatest scenes in the history of cinema and a breathtaking finale to this great western masterpiece. All credit to Leone for directing such a scene in a breathtaking, pulsating manner.Flawed, and perhaps a bit too long but a classic nonetheless. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Il Buono, il brutto, il cattivo" is a great movie, and ties for my 1st place among westerns. Personally I think "Per un pugno di dollari" is equally good, but in another way. It's tight, clever and exiting with a simple but excellent storyline all the way through, and I couldn't keep my eyes of it.Anyway, this is a review about "Il buono...". I found it a little slow in the beginning and that is the only thing that keeps me from awarding 10 stars. From the moment that Tuco finds out about the gold, no western (or movie at all) is better. Van Cleef is very good as Angel Eyes, Wallach is even better as Tuco, and Clint himself is as always PERFECT as "The man with no name".The movie ticks in at 175 minutes, which is very long even though it didn't feel like it after the slow first half hour or so. It has a complex story, unlike the aforementioned "first" spaghetti, much happens before the good, bad and the ugly gets on track of the treasure, and even more happens after they begin to seek it. You can never tell for sure what's gonna happen next, and this keeps the excitement top-notch. It's indeed very entertaining.All in all, highly recommended. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a long movie, at a shade over 2 hours and 40 minutes, but it needs to be long, unhurried, with lots of closeup shots and no dialog, relying on mood and expressions. In fact there is a key scene near the end that goes for 5 minutes with just 3 men standing in a triangle, looking at each other, no dialog, tension building, and it doesn't seem over long.. The 'ugly' is Eli Wallach as Tuco. He has no morals, will steal, rape, or kill on a whim, and with a smile on his face, if it suits him. He is good with a gun and has the ability to survive and come back under extreme adversity. The 'good' is Clint Eastwood as Blondie. But 'good' is relative. He and Tuco form a sort of partnership. Tuco is wanted for various crimes and the reward on his head is $2000. So Blondie turns Tuco in, and as he is strung up and about to be hanged, Blondie from a distance shoots the rope so that Tuco can get away. They split the $2000 and run their scam again in a different area.Lee Van Cleef is the menacing Angel Eyes. His motive is only money, as in a stash of gold worth $200,000. He has to track down the man who knows where the gold is buried.The story is set during the Civil War. In their strange association, Tuco and Blondie take turns turning on each other. One of those times as Tuco is forcing Blondie to march through the hot desert without water, they come upon a military wagon. All but one are dead, but the one still alive is the man Angel Eyes is looking for. He manages to tell Tuco the cemetery where the gold is buried, but when Tuco goes for some water to save the man long enough for the whole location, Blondie hears the dying man name the grave, but Blondie did not know the location of the cemetery. So the two men need each other, each with half of the information.With that the rest of the story unfolds. There is lots of gunfire and explosions, and lots of characters die. But in its essence the whole movie is a type of Western Comedy, and very enjoyable.</fullReview>

This movie here has both.After watching it, I felt like I was on a roller-coaster. So much happens throughout, it is hard to remember every last bit of it, which doesn't mean you wouldn't feel it. I'm always in fever when Tuco runs around on the cemetery, with Morricone's unique music in the back. A truly haunting moment.It was a smart way Leone let Blondie develop. He's starting of as a great gunfighter and always shows a little bit of different sides coming up on his harsh surface. And in the end, he gets his poncho. What a moment! And it makes sense. After having seen all this, it is clear, why he is so cool in the other two DOLLARS: This one here was just way much more of a challenge.Lee van Cleef does a terrific job, especially after having played the hard but good colonel in the movie before. It shows some great quality as an actor to create so much sympathy in one movie and so much horror in the next.Eli Wallach brings up a character, you can compare with Jack Sparrow. You never know, what he really is up to, but everything he does is a circus and you love to watch him being the greedy underdog of this trio.The plot is the greatest quality in this movie, if you ask me. So many twists, settings, side characters and events are unique in the western genre, probably in every one.It is impressive to compare ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST and THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY. Since Leone was forced by the studio to make ONCE UPON according to the great success of the first three western movies, it is surprising that he didn't produce another one of his "Nameless" tales but the epic itself within the westerns. When you don't know that, you could easily think the two movies were shot by different directors. I like ONCE UPON better, just because I felt more emotions watching it.But still, THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is a terrific achievement. They had almost ten different languages being spoken on the set. The bridge was first blown to ribbons accidentally with no camera rolling. Eastwood and Leone had their conflicts. Leone couldn't speak more English than "Look" and act what he wanted. It must have been a mess.And yet, such a fine picture came out.It also wins the price for the most haunting melody ever created. People who haven't seen nor heard about the movie whistle the theme. I wouldn't know of any other piece of music being honored like this. Maybe Beethoven's 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood portrays and embodies the true meaning and the nature of "tough". A action film that is more than just mindless action, and that manages to avoid cheesiness. A entertaining film first and foremost. Yet it also has other qualities such as a memorable soundtrack, cinematography that one can appreciate, and three main characters that almost warrant their own films. The story is weaved together well and has some legendary moments, especially the finale.Cool. Fun. Memorable.Yet it doesn't sacrifice itself for entertainment purposes. A quality film that personally I enjoyed because it managed to incorporate a little bit of everything.Keep your mind open. Grab some popcorn. Enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm almost ashamed to admit that I had not yet seen this gem until recently. I tend to scoff at supposed 'great' movies as they often don't live up, but "The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly" is a tremendous exception. Leone is a massively underrated genius and his work is timeless. From the ever-punned soundtrack to the over-quoted quotes this movie is one of the classics that will open your eyes to the redone, over processed, plagiarized drivel that steals $10 from your pocket every visit to the local cinema. Every new movie is nothing more than a cheap version of something else. I guess that's how it is with everything...music, cars, etc. What a sad time to be alive...unless you're a classic film fan! Attention: LOTR fans...keep your light sabers at bay...your films are original, just not the kind of originality that should add to anybody's life.RIP Leone RIP Film Industry</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there is anybody out there who has not yet seen this magnificent movie, then get to your local store and rent or buy it NOW! I first saw this film when I was a kid about eight or nine years old, and even though it is three hours long, I was transfixed to the screen for the duration. Now I am not a big western fan. In fact I hate those corny John Wayne and Ronald Reagan movies where cowboys are either good or bad and the women are even more obedient than the horses. Nobody in this film has any morals and they all inhabit a dog-eat-dog vision of the west that not even the civil war can civilize. And that's the other great thing about this movie. It weaves in the U.S. civil war as effortlessly as other westerns introduce the Stetson hat. Lee van Cleef,Eli Wallach and Clint Eastwood are the men who personify the good,bad and ugly of the title. As the movie rumbles on however, we soon see that those descriptions are interchangeable. To offset the bitter and often violent tone of the movie, there are also some touching scenes. Particularly when Tuco (Wallach) visits his brother in a monastery. Humour also, riddles the fresh and coarse dialog. Wallach has the best one-liners. All this is of course brilliantly set to Ennio Moriconne's outstanding score. A soundtrack which, over the years, has come to be as famous as the movie. I have probably seen "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly a dozen times now, but I'll never tire of it. Don't say you don't like westerns till you've watched this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The wild untamed west, the quickness of the draw, the thundering of hooves, the stylish lighting of the cigar, the ruggedness of the landscape, the matching intensity of the characters...all captured beautifully in this gripping trilogy of "Fistful of dollars", "For a few dollars more" and "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly".Based on the life of a bounty hunter, "the man with no name", played superbly by Clint Eastwood, the series takes us through his eventful journey, one that is in search of lucre, and one, which, alike all such journeys, has no end. The character of mwnm (short) leaves one in amazement at the beautiful shades of grey that Hollywood paints its characters in. On one end, the hard, ruthless killer, the fastest hand in the west, stopping at nothing to get his bounty and on the other, the tender caring humanitarian, uniting a mother forced into prostitution, with her husband and child, saving a man who stood by him, giving a dying soldier his last smoke. Eastwood excels in an underplayed role, mixing quiet aggression with an angelic demeanor; a potent combination, which any hit-man today would kill for.Ably supported by an array of Mexican acting talent and the likes of Lee Van Cliff and Eli Wallah, this trilogy, transports you to a world, where people wore their heart on their sleeves, had a contempt for their own lives and for that of others, a world where surviving each passing day was as challenging as moving from one dusty town to another, as though one were moving from one battlefield to the next. The savagery of the wild west is given a sublime touch by the hauntingly soulful soundtrack; the musical mastery of Enrico Morricone. Kudos Amigo! And to borrow a line from Tuco, "The Ugly" one, "There are two kinds of people in this world my friend, those who have seen this masterpiece and those who have not".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best out of the Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember this movie like the greatest movie memory ever kept. A true Western and one of the best ever made. Clint Eastwood became a superstar. The music was brilliant, i even own the CD Soundtrack of this movie with the DVD. That is because this movie is so profound and made from the heart of a director.I watched this movie somewhere in 1992 and since then i was astounded and mad after it. This is because of my father, who introduced me to Western movies and gave me the essence of watching movies with a different perspective.Clint Eastwood is brilliant as the Man With No Name, in supporting cast Lee Van Cleef is cool as Angel Eyes and Eli Wallach got a rising start due to this western. The Build-ups are superb, they hold you so much that you forget you are watching a movie. The Settings and the Authenticity of the Civil War period is all in the frame. Sergio Leone has a keen eye for Cinematography, each of his frame looks like a painting, it simply cannot be found in many of todays movies anymore. The Picture, even after passing 30 years is still alive and breathing to inspire our generation directors, and giving a knockout to an person who watches it.I seriously comment to everyone for watching this movie as it will be an experience of a lifetime.10 out of 10 to the ages of the best</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>exceptional wild wild west movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To all Clint Eastwood's fans, there is no comment. To all who did not view yet, should consider it as a movie of the day to plan for.The story outlines Clint as a perfect gunslinger and accurate shooter who arrests wanted hooligans and hands over to the respective civil courts. This is the third sequel of the trilogy marked by "The man with no name". The viewers should also see "A fistful of dollars" and "For a few dollars more". Though none of them are linked by stories but the time-line in America and the lifestyle in wild wild west. In this movie, Clint partners with Tuco who is already an infamous outlaw under search by many counties. Clint hands Tuco over to the courts, gets the declared money and during the time of punishment (to be hanged) he shoots the hanging rope to separate Tuco and escape. This is a business to him.Soon Tuco demands lion's share what Clint denies to do and he punishes Tuco by leaving in a deserted land alone. Tuco just survives and seeks for Clint to revenge. He finds him at the point of his gun, forces Clint to walk long over the sandy desert almost ruined and suddenly meets a horse-cart running unmanned but carrying dead bodies.One of the passengers in that cart was dying, Bill Carson, gave Tuco a route to a cemetery where huge amount of dollars is buried under a grave. When asked about the name of the grave, the man was listing and Tuco ran to collect some water for him. Returning, he saw him dead, Clint faintly sat beside him and Bill Carson told him the name of the grave before dying.Another man was in hunt for that treasury, Sentenza. He already killed a family and few other men to find Bill Carson. Suddenly he found Tuco and Clint. Tuco had to speak the name of the cemetery under extreme torture. Yet Clint had been untouched and Sentenza took him with. Tuco managed to escape from Sentenza's guards cleverly. En route Tuco and Clint met again to form the partnership and they flew from the grip of Sentenza. Then they took part to a battle between American armies of different belief. Ultimately they found the cemetery.The rest of the story is unique and to be seen in screen only.The cameraman has taken very close shots of the faces full with expression. The dresses of the actors are very authentic to the time of the story. The acting of Clint, Tuco and Sentenza is superb! The spot selection is excellent! The surrounding environment and respective city dwellers are really as per the best of it. Above all, the background guitar tune of this movie is worth to hear, this alone represents the fearlessness of those freemen in the wild wild west.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie of All-Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely LOVE this movie. In my opinion, it is the best movie of all-time by far. I love all the 3 main characters. Eastwood is such a PIMP in this movie. I loved the format and I love the theme. Best theme in movie history in my opinion as well. It is by far my favorite movie right next to Shawshank Redemption. It is a tad lengthy but worth it. The mix of western, action, adventure, and even a little comedy mixed in is fabulous! The revamped version on DVD (in color) is wonderful. The way that the movie is put together in general is wonderful. The catch to the movie is simply spectacular. The cast is perfect. Clint Eastwood as "The Good" is perfect. His changing relationship with Tuco (The Ugly) throughout the entire movie is well thought out and can be quite humorous at times. And "The Bad" is your prototypical bad guy. He'll do anything to get the money...as will everyone else in the movie. Hands-down awesome movie. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without doubt the best of the genre and one of the best of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 13 years old when i first watched this one and ever since then i watch it at least once a month, now i am 19 years and haven't lost any pleasure in watching it.Sergio leone's The good, The bad and The ugly is a true masterpiece, the third in "man with no name" trilogy and the best, though the other two are also not lacking behind and considered classic westerns. usually the length of the movies bother moviegoers but believe me you will never feel the length botherig in this case and will hope it to get even more extended somehow.The musical score scores above all which is a trademark of Sergio leone's westerns and adds more epic value to the movie. there can't be a better soundtrack than what "the good, the bad and the ugly has.the storyline is simple and brilliant, three characters finding their own ways to some great fortune and conflicting each other in the backdrop of civil war.The movie does have a comedic sense to it in some good ways and thus amuses the watcher throughout.characterization really did play an important role in making this movie what it is.Each lead character is developed so well that you even feel thinking what any character may be thinking or about to do.The action scenes can't just be described in some sentences because they are so immensely powerful that they will completely draw any movie-watcher to them.The final showdown is may favorite of all and the the perfect mix of music with tension of what will happen.So many years after knowing and watching the final showdown i still watch it the way i watched it the first time, for me it has the same tension and delivers the same way.This movie is getting even better with every day passing, it has hardly aged which definitely is another of it's excellent features.Movies like this are not made anymore and that is very sad thing but those who know and can feel the greatness of this may live their lives watching it again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film almost as good as once upon a time in the west</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great film and rather like the other reviewer this is a film that I watched with my father all the way through as a young child. What I would say is that once upon a time in the west also directed by Sergio is better especially to a film buff. But this like all of Sergio's spaghetti westerns (called so because they were made by Italians yet often filmed in Spain) is fantastic, quite often the guns used maybe historically inaccurate but Sergio did this on purpose, and was more interested in the western films that influenced him and payed tribute to them in some way which is now called intertextuality or post modern directing on Sergio's behalf. Even though these are all great films I have to watch them without my wife, she won't touch them with a barge pole. Ideal for a night in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A western for those who think they don't like westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the one western that everyone should see whether you like westerns or not. The pathos, character studies, separate story lines and acting draw the viewers in to such a degree that one forgets the genre and gets immersed in the richness of the script and its diversity. Clint Eastwood's portrayal of the Man With No Name is his signature role. Eli Wallach makes Tuco the man you love to hate, and Lee Van Cleef is simply evil (and "ugly"). The score of Ennio Morricone has become iconic and the core and side show to film festivals featuring director Sergio Leone's other films. The quest for greed and the twist at the end are enough for anyone to identify with who has bought a lottery ticket. The grittiness of the Civil War battle scene and the actions of "Blondie" and Tuco to both end the bloodshed and clear the way for their treasure are effective to convey the sense of agony of the Civil War. The prisoner scene and the music played during the torture scene is macabre and surreal.So in other words there is something to trigger a variety of emotions and thoughts. The camaraderie created between Blondie and Tuco through their reward escapades to the march across the desert forced on Blondie by Tuco to their ultimate decisions at the climax (no spoiler here!), is twisted but understandable.The brief interlude at the mission fully explains Tuco's choices and makes us understand clearly the relationship between Tuco and his brother. We get a glimpse of Tuco' mentality and why he's where he is ( a practical choice in life!). Lee Van Cleef's scenes show what motivates him and that there is no morality that stands in his way........... All in all a movie not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First: When this came out I was just a teenager who loved movies including westerns and greatly admired John Wayne. This movie put me off because it was SO DIFFERENT the guns didn't sound right, it didn't look right, and where was the good guy? But even then the film came to an end quickly despite it's length. Well years later and seen again this movie has gotten better. It keeps getting better as one matures. How many movies do that? Have ever done that? Even the critics matured to worship this wonderful film. Anything else I say is merely repeating what others have said. If somehow you have not seen this movie which would be hard to believe go see it tonight. It's one of the greatest movies/westerns of all time at least that's what the world at large says.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As you all know The good the bad and the ugly is the best western ever made not just because of the good plot, the good acting but also the scenery of Sergio Leone because he took time and entered civil war scenes in the movie that makes it interesting and it shows how the battle took place and how hard the man fought for there country at the time. The acting in this movie is very good for a movie of the 60's and the script is brilliant and i'm glade that Sergio Leone chosed Clint to be the man with no name. Anyone who like western movie and you never seen this one i suggest you go see it now and does who doesn't like western movie well this one is still worth watching so go rent it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this film for the 1st time and i must say that it is excellent. The Slow suspenseful moments mixed with the lightining quick action scenes are a good mix. Every single feature about the movie is remembered, i mean just look on the top 250. It's the highest rated western on there.The action although quick is sastisfying and hilarious with Joe and Tuco piping off One liners.The musical score is still used today in parodies of cartoons and such.The Camera tricks in the film were very nice, with the constant zooming close ups on the The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly's face. They use this as a trick to reveal their emotions including: Fear, Happiness, and sadness.All in all, an excellent film that deserves it place high in the top 250, and is a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tagged "Simply the greatest western of the 1960's and all time" -- and I cant help but agree</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good, The Bad, and The UglyYou've herd all the reviews. For the past 40 years, there has been a name that has been called everywhere, in reviews, in movies, in newspapers and books, using the tag-line "The Good the bad and the Ugly". People use this name for saying reviews for movies like "The good of the movie, the bad of it and the ugly". But what exactly is "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly", and how did it spawn? It has been tagged "The greatest western of the 1960s, and of all time -- and I cant help but agree. I discovered "The Good the Bad and the Ugly" through my good friend who owned the DVD. I had seen the raving review of the film but I had never really been a fan of westerns. But seeing as it was there, he let me burrow it.I was blown out of my mind.Never had I ever seen a movie so full of surprises, great writing, and action, it literally had me watch it all the way through with no brakes, not realizing how long it was, I started the movie at midnight, and when it was over I had realized how late it was. It kept me attacked from the introduction to the mind blowing standoff in the cemertery at the end.Directed by master Sergio Leone, and starring Clint Eastwood, as they both return to continue and conclude "The Man with no name trilogy". The man with no name trilogy consists of three different films, "A fistful of dollars", "For a few dollars more", and of course, "the good the bad and the ugly". Clint Eastwood stars as "The man with no name", a mysterious figure whom we don't know about his past, his future, who he is or what his purpose is, but in the three films and especially the good the bad and the ugly, he is supremely bad-ass. Although many would concider "Good bad and ugly" the best of the trilogy, it is also the longest. Running at 2 hours and a half to three hours, you barley notice a minuet go by, compared with the beautiful cinematography, the surprises from left to right, and the awesome score delivered by the good friend of Leone, Ennio Morricone, it sets the mood and suspense just right.If your not a fan of westerns and you happen to come across "The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly", do not turn it away, you will immediately be craving more, as it did me. The Good The bad and the Ugly will live on in movie history.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The art of a western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trilogy of movies the Mr.Leone gave us, changed the way we will forever look at a western. Before his time John Wayne would ride on his horse and save the day and then ride off into the sunset, and once again it would just be our typical Cowboy hero movie with an occasion white man playing an Indian. But then one day Sergio Leone wanted us to get off our high horse and look at how corrupt the west real could be, give us the sense that our heroes in this world are by no means perfect in any way; in other words I honestly believe that until Leone's movies, we didn't get a real good artist in depth look at the WILD West. He made the hero of his three movies rough, tough, corrupt, deadly, and by no means innocent. The only thing that separated him from a bad guy was his heart. He basically didn't like anyone that was worse of a man than him, which you must admire. The sad thing is that until these movies, all of our heroes were clean cut, nice, do-gooders, always around to save the day and get the girls. Client Eastwood was the first western good guy to even have a beard, and thats just crazy... These three movies are to me are the most realistic interpretation of the Wild West the we have ever gotten. From the directors realistic views, to the realistic acting. These movies have even given artistic inspiration to the great directors of today, like Robert Rodriguez and Quinten Tarantino, so there is much to be thankful to there. Bottom line is that this trilogy has revolutionized directing, acting, and the way we will forever look at the Wild West.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sergio Leone's Evocative Spaghetti Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone's 1966 sprawling western epic The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is, to me, undeniably epic. People define epic in all sorts of ways: it can mean it's ambitious, it can mean its running length is long, it can mean it's a visual spectacle, it can mean its anticlimactic, etc. And although I think The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly are all those things, that's not why it's epic to me. For a movie to be epic to me, it has to not only be ambitious, but pay off greatly; so great that after the film, I wish I could've been in the mind of that filmmaker when they thought up that film. And imperfect as it can be, The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly is certainly that.The Good is Clint Eastwood, a nameless drifter who goes by the name Blondie. I like him because he's certainly cool, but no to the point of ridiculousness. The Good is pursued by The Ugly (Eli Wallach), a greedy bandit who seeks revenge on Blondie for leaving him out to hang dry. However, his motives eventually change when Blondie tells him he has been told by a man the graveyard that holds enough gold to last someone for the rest of their lives. Eli Wallach does a superlative job in disgusting us with his character, only letting his human side spill out in a confrontation with his priest brother. The Bad (Lee Van Cleef) is also aware of the money, but only Blondie supposedly knows where the gold is hiding. Lee Van Cleef doesn't get much time to be more than the "bad guy", but he's ably menacing."The Man with No Name" trilogy to which The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly belongs is considered the seeds of the spaghetti western genre, and it also marks a beginning of less admirable Western heroes. While the Good is still likable and we root for him, his motive, like the Bad and the Ugly, is the gold. He isn't the old western hero who stands up for the woman and throws material possessions away. Clint Eastwood will not go to the lengths of greed the Bad and Ugly sink to, but it's not like he doesn't want the gold.Sergio Leone often takes the western out of its conventional definition over the nearly three-hour length of the film by often going in new places. Although the first half-hour or so is slow (the biggest flaw of the film), it quickly picks up after that, with The Ugly dragging Blondie across the desert, visits to a church and a Civil War prison camp, and on the front lines of a Civil War battle. It all leads up to the final three-way shootout, which manages to still stay tense by some well-handled editing that cuts rapidly to suspicious eyes and hands nearing pistols. It's a great ending, and certainly one of the coolest of all time.Also worth noting is Ennio Morricone's score. The opening theme is still classic even after thirty-eight years have gone by, and "Ecstasy of Gold" (the song playing as The Ugly runs across the cemetery searching frantically for the grave) is nothing short of swelling. The whole score plays like a tumbleweed rolling across a sandy town.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sergio Leone is obviously a talented director and he has produced many memorable films in his career. His westerns include the 'spaghetti' trilogy and the very impressive 'Once upon a time in the West'. He also orchestrated a fascinating and enjoyable film later on in the 80's with 'Once upon a time in America'. These are a few of his films and all were very entertaining with their complex and intricate story lines. The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is no exception, as we venture into the dry and sandy landscape (filmed in Spain), the characters each find themselves caught in the firing line of the Civil War. Leone has focused on this as he clearly opposed and disliked the war (he felt it was wrong and unjust)and he makes an effort to portray the Civil War as meaningless and conflicting with what should be progression for America. Aside from the political aspect of the film we find a superb story that tells a tale of how three rogue individuals cross paths while searching for a prize more than any 'Wanted' poster could bore. The sum of $200,000 requires all three to form some kind of co - operation and, despite the tense conflict, we are led along their paths to the breathtaking finale where we see the last dance of death between the three gunslingers. Hugely entertaining with its slick dialogue and vast yet intriguing surroundings, we find ourselves in the mist of ferocious gun fights between enemies and old foes. The marvellous score composed by Ennio Morricone is one of the most recognised in film history and it certainly delivers a special added bonus to an already superb film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leone proves his superiority in this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Good, the Bad, &amp; the Ugly" is the best Western ever. The only one comparable is "Once Upon a Time in the West" which is also directed by Leone. If you don't like traditional Westerns, that doesn't mean you will dislike either one of these classics. Leone's style is definitely superior to the tired cowboy and Indian movies starring the likes of the slovenly John Wayne.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recently I watched an extended English language version, remastered for a time of 179 minutes, which I was particularly impressed. The whole team of artists from the author of the story, writer, director of photography, composer, great E. Morricone, to a great director S. Leone with excellent actors made this movie possible. It is, in my opinion, the best film of all time, not only westerns. We should not forget that the producers have also greatly contributed to film such a movie, a true masterpiece. It is unlikely that will ever to gather team of artists to shoot something! This film can be the younger film makers serve as an example on how the film should be. Leone me in all these movies, among other things, most impress the wide shots and close-ups of characters by which he would like a director be remembered as an innovator successful in conjuring up the space in which the action of the film occurs as very credible presentation of feelings through which characters go during action.The film faithfully shows what happened in the whirlwind of the Civil War, the three main characters whose main goal is to avoid being directly involved in the war to each of them got hold of the hidden treasures of 200,000 US dollars. Many events on reaching the finish line as the creators of this extraordinary film great advantage that through a combination of violence, humor, skillfully weave with excellent dialogues into a unique the filmic story.I recommend to viewers to watch this an extended English language version, remastered for a time of 179 minutes! The vast majority will enjoy it, I do not think a smaller number of skeptics who always finds it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leone's epic 1967 Western conjures up opera, horse opera, the bullfight arena, and the blackest of black humor via riveting story-telling in the picaresque tradition.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the last and the best installment of his so-called "Dollars" trilogy of Sergio Leone-directed "spaghetti westerns," Clint Eastwood repriced the role of a taciturn, enigmatic loner. Here he searches for a cache of stolen gold against rivals the Bad (Lee Van Cleef), a ruthless bounty hunter, and the Ugly (Eli Wallach), a Mexican bandit. Though dubbed "the Good," Eastwood's character is not much better than his opponents -- he is just smarter and shoots faster. The film's title reveals its ironic attitude toward the canonized heroes of the classical western. "The real West was the world of violence, fear, and brutal instincts," claimed Leone. "In pursuit of profit there is no such thing as good and evil, generosity or deviousness; everything depends on chance, and not the best wins but the luckiest." Immensely entertaining and beautifully shot in Techniscope by Tonino Delli Colli, the movie is a virtually definitive "spaghetti western," rivaled only by Leone's own Once Upon a Time in the West (1968). The main musical theme by Ennio Morricone hit #1 on the British pop charts. Originally released in Italy at 177 minutes, the movie was later cut for its international release. ~ Yuri German, Rovi</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The rebirth of the Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good, The Bad and The Ugly produced in Italy and Spain in 1966, is to western fans and cinephiles, as Harry styles is to teenage girls; as soon as we hear one note of the sensational score and catch one glimpse of our heroes squint of an eye. Instantly our pulses quicken, heart races and we must try our hardest to suppress a squeal of joy. Following on from two film predecessors; A Fist full of Dollars and For a few Dollars more, in a inherently Sergio Leon way, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly opens up with a series of intercutting close ups of sun beaten faces looking out towards the horizon, and wide shot of the setting, which appears to be an old rundown little town. But just as you would expect from the spaghetti western master, we are given very little information from the start. We don't know who these men are at first or what their intentions are, but from the looks of them, they don't seem all that two friendly. But what the opening shots do reveal, in particular Leon predilection for wide and close up paring, is that Leon was avid art collector; the close ups where reminiscent of Goya, while the vast unyielding landscapes where an allusion to surrealist painting style Leon was a fan off. As the men make their way down into what appears to be a salon, we don't follow them in instead we hear a shoot out occurring, then all of a sudden the camera pans to focus on a window in which 'The Ugly' leaps out with wine in one hand and a half eaten pigs leg in the other, this is Tuco (Eli Wallach), and those two items some him up best, he is a bear drinking, untrustworthy swine. But on the other hand he does phenomenally inject a whole lot of humour and wild edge to the film. Next we find ourselves with a little boy riding a donkey; he looks to the distance where he sees a lone man riding a horse towards him, we then passes him with little regard. Little does that boy know that man will go on to mercilessly shoot and kill both his brother and father, for that man is 'The Bad' also known as Angel eyes (Lee Van Cleef from John Ford's High-noon). Then last but not least, we return again to The Ugly we find himself in a tricky situation, involving three gun slingers. But cue the introduction of the man with no name (Technically he does have a name, its Blondie in the film and Clint Eastwood in real life) who saves Tuco only to return him to a nearby town to cash in on his bounty, justifying his title 'The Good' . But not everything is what it seems, it soon turns out the both men are in collusion and turning Tuco in is merely a trick to get the bounty, save Tuco from getting hanged and then gets the heck out of there. The plan is so genius that they could continue getting away with the same trick, oh wait they completely hate each other and can trust each other as far as they can throw. The relationship between the leads make for a great stand up duo; Tuco the loud mouth and Blondie the silent brooding one, similar to famous magicians Pen and Teller. Eventually for the rest of the film The Good, The Bad and The Ugly must unite in search for $200,000 loot stashed inside a person's grave, but only The Ugly knows where the grave site is, while The Good only knows which name it is buried under, but of course they can't trust each other with that information. While other western director like to cut to the chase and draw out the scenes violence such as Howard Hawks and Sam Penkinpah, instead on the other hand , something I particularly love most about Leon is how he always extends all precursors before a shot out or a act of violence which eventually end rather quickly . It's better that why, because we invest ourselves deeper into the characters, whilst also allowing the tension in the scene to build up to almost excruciating levels even before the first bullet is fire. What I also love about The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, is the moral ambiguity that runs thick throughout the film, never are the lines between good and bad really competently drawn through. I guess that it down to the decision to keep back stories and exposition rather low. But what it does offer you is the freedom to choose what side you cheer for because there isn't any real distinct good guy in the film, which makes it all the more exciting. At a lengthy 2hrs and 50 minutes, GBU is almost David Lean and Lawrence Arabia-esk in terms if scope and grandeur, and you can also drew comparisons between the two films in the deployment of the incessant use of panoramic shoots of the vast scenery and man insignificant compared to it. As long as GBU is, not once to I find the film meandering or tedious, despite its length it was able to move a furious pace, so it felt that we the audience were ourselves almost sucked into the action by an almighty whirl wind. But in a largely dead genre, we can look back to The Good, The Bad and The Ugly with great nostalgia and affection, for it a shinnying beckon of what great film making is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say about this magnificent epic film that hasn't already been written or spoken? Saw this first as a teenager in the 1970s and was glued to the TV along with my two brothers. Great story, acting, scenery, and the score is fantastic. Clint Eastwood plays the Man with No Name who along with Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach hunt for a stolen cash box filled with gold coins buried in a cemetery during the American Civil War. They each know only one part of where the gold is buried so they have to keep each other alive despite the fact they want to kill each other. This 3 hour movie moves along gracefully and never gets boring. The final cemetery scene and standoff between the three main characters is riveting. Once again the score is unforgettable. Yes I have seen this film countless times and love every minute of it. Not only a great western but one of the best films ever made!! Bravo Sergio Leone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything about this film is brilliant. The directing, characters, acting, story and the theme score is excellent. The best western i have ever seen. A three hour journey of excitement that leads you to the long awaited and explosive climax. I can honestly say that the last twenty minutes or so of this film is the best twenty minutes of film i have ever seen. Absolutely phenomenal. Sergio Leone's directing with the three leading actors makes this one of the best films i have ever seen... Perhaps the best. Actually yes, this is my favorite movie of all time and i don't see that ever changing.What makes 'The Good, The Bad and the Ugly' iconic ranges from many things such as Ennio Morricone's memorable score not only defining this movie, but spaghetti westerns, to its unforgettable scenes, depicting beauty and grit in the world created by Sergio Leone. Watching the movie feels like listening to a long musical composition, watching it build and build into a heart pounding crescendo, at the same time basking in the scenes where time feels like it slows down so we could soak in the beauty that this ugly, fragile world has to offer.What I love about this film, is how it can be light-hearted and fun, yet still feel deep, heavy and contemplative at times. We don't get to know the characters at all (except a bit about Tuco), but we get to know them through their actions, and we truly find out the nature of why these three characters have these titles of 'the good,' 'the bad,' and 'the ugly.' To see these characters interact is a treat to watch, but what captivated me about the film was the great Clint Eastwood and his performance at 'The Man with no Name' or 'Blondie' as Tuco would address him as. He is the definitive embodiment of the stoic, anti-hero with an air of mystery as to where he comes from and his motives, which is what kept me in suspense through out the movie. From his strategic thinking in outsmarting Tuco, he is basically floating through a world of chaos, adapting to any unexpected messy situation these characters get thrown into. Then, when we finally get to the ending, we don't know what will become of the characters and that unpredictability is what makes this one moment in the movie one of the most intense scenes in cinema. Without spoiling anything, all I could say is that I felt the ending was clever in a way I didn't see coming at all.With a great setting, a great score, great performances and a simple, but very great story, this is a western film I highly recommend you should watch, if you have never watched any westerns before. On that note, this is not only a great western film, but a wonderful piece of art from Sergio Leone. From the films I've watched by him, everyone of those films possess that layer of depth to them that feels like that feeling of bliss in life that comes once in a blue moon. Even with a film as dark as 'Once Upon a Time in the West' or 'Once Upon a Time in America,' Leone still manages to emit a feeling of warmth through his stories, and with all its guns and grit, 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly' is pure beauty on film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unless you hate spaghetti Westerns, this film needs to be in your collection. It's a classic tale of greed, backstabbing, strategy, and dumb luck. If you ever want to really understand a director like Quentin Tarantino, you need to watch at least one Leone film. Leone was a visionary! This is my favorite of the "Dollars Trilogy" thematic series. Eastwood and Van Cleef are completely badass in this one, but Wallach steals the show as Tuco! The cinematography is awesome, Ennio Morricone's score enhances the action and tension, and this film starts and ends epicly.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out: www.livemancave.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen a lot of movies, but nothing compares to three hours of non-stop action. It starts off by introducing all the characters, and what their generic personalities are. After that,it intertwines their paths, and finally all three of them come together, which ends in a shootout. The directors slowly piecing everything together while still keeping the audience interested. There was also a bit of comedy for the viewers. Of course, it doesn't have the special effects of new movies, but I didn't find that too annoying. What I did find annoying though was that over half the peoples mouths weren't moving in the English language. But, overall I was able to still rate this movie 10/10.</fullReview>

Not like today where gimmicks/effects do the work and scripts are weak and illogical...The beauty of this movie is the excitement it generates and gets you closer to feel like a cowboy/ westerner.1) An simple story but an amazing script. It all depends on how a story is being told... 2) Absolutely sophisticated acting by each actor. 3)The characterization is so superb in this movie. You don't feel that actors are acting.. rather it appears that real characters have been incorporated into the movie.. 4) The direction - Sergio has turned this into an epic and classic movie. The direction was different from other western classics - close shots of the faces, desert and the chase/fights... 5) Ennio Moricone soundtrack is magic...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Trilogy: 1st-The AMAZING; 2st-The Epic-Badass; 3st-The BEST Western ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leone after the underrated failure that was "The Colossus of Rhodes", Leone decided to put his career in order doing the remake of the Japanese classic "Yojimbo" turning it into a American-Western filmed in Europe. "A Fistful of Dollars" not only launched his career, but started a new era of Western films. And then came the superb sequel that was "For a few dollars more". And as if that was not enough, Leone made the 3rd chapter of the story of the man with no name. And not only surpassed its predecessors but ended up being (maybe) the best westerns ever made."The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" starts when Tuco (Eli Wallach), an Mexican outlaw, finds in the desert a Confederate convoy with all soldiers killed inside a wagon. But one of the soldiers was alive and tells Tuco about a certain treasure he hid in a coffin in a cemetery. Tuco goes to fetch water on his horse, to give to the soldier so that he could speak better, but when he is back the soldier died, and the only one who heard the name of the coffin was Blondie (Clint Eastwood) Tuco's former business partner which was being tortured by Tuco crossing the desert without drinking water because Blondie had betrayed him. Blondie knows the name of the coffin but it doesn't know the location of the cemetery, which Tuco does. Now both bastards have to work together to find and maybe split the treasure. But the mission becomes difficult when both meet Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) a lieutenant of the union army that knew longer about the treasure but it didn't know the name of the coffin. Now the three men who hate each other will have to join and across an America at war to find the mysterious treasure.And why this movie is (in my opinion) the best Western ever made? Again, it was the fault of Leone and the exuberant cast. What Leone made in this film, was bring was what was excellent in the first two films and put it all together in this masterpiece. From the 1st movie is the superb narrative that flows in history always perfectly highlighting their characters in the story with chilling and (believe it or not) reflective dialogs.And of course, Leone also destroys (in a good way) in his amazing direction. Giving not only spectacular and epic duels (which here contains the best ones of the trilogy), but also with breathtaking Italian landscapes serving as the Old West. Thanks to the success of the previous films Leone manages to give the film a huge magnitude, with gigantic landscapes and moments with beautiful scenery. Not only landscapes but presents us with one of the greatest cinematic battles, the Battle of Langston Bridge.But as I mentioned before, Leone uses his genius in both script and direction, giving reflective moments to the story. Not only humanizes his characters, but gives the film a huge critic to America using a Western cliché. This cliché is the civil war, if you look at most Western movies (especially John Wayne's ones) they always had as stage the civil war. And through it Leone makes his criticism. It comes in moments like when Blondie and Tuco met Angel Eyes, they had been imprisoned by Union soldiers. In this open-air prison, the Confederates soldiers are forced to play and sing songs against their will, while the guards torture other prisoners. Clearly a metaphor comparing the Union soldiers to the Nazis, but this is based on facts. In many prison camps during the war, there was heavy torture and even rumors of cannibalism. And even a time when Tuco unwittingly confuses Union soldiers to Confederates ones, because they were covered in dust. Another metaphor trying to say that no matter what side you are, everyone is equal.In performances the movie definitely surpasses its predecessors: Clint Eastwood once again the badass as he ever was in the trilogy. In this film we can see more of his human side and clear, despite his schemes and greed, it has clearly a "good" side; Eli Wallach excellent. Maybe his performance certainly reach the performance of Eastwood, as this character that even with "ugly" attitudes have a pure side; Lee Van Cleef again superb now as the villain. But maybe he's the only "bad" thing in the movie. Not his performance, but his character doesn't has moments of exploration that Tuco and Blondie had, but Leone does an excellent job showing why he is the devil in the movie.In conclusion, Leone did absolutely in his masterpiece the best Western ever made. Thanks to an ambitious narrative that not only gives unforgettable characters but makes a big social criticism. Thanks to a huge and beautiful direction with incredible views that captures tense and epic moments; thanks to a creepy and classic soundtrack by Ennio Morricone; thanks to superb performances; thanks to Sergio Leone with his genius that brought us a masterpiece trilogy that redefined the Western forever, concluding it here perfectly making it legendary.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless and Fresh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is the final film of Sergio Leone's The Man With No Name Trilogy. This film is recognized by most as the best film from the trilogy, some argue that it's Leone's best film overall. I, on the other hand, found this film great but it did have it's flaws. I also cannot say this film is the filmmaker's best as I found this film to be equally as good as For A Few Dollars More.This film was mainly written by Leone and Luciano Vincenzoni. Both also collaborated in writing the previous film. I'll start by saying the great things about the film's screenplay. The film is huge in comparison to the previous film and even more when you compare to the A Fistful of Dollars. The best part of the film in my opinion are the characters as Leone and Vincenzoni have created people that are very focused on their goal, but at the same time keeping them interesting by adding personality with these characters which clearly defines them. Though I do wish that Lee Van Cleef's character was written more screen time to allow us to understand more about the character, which Leone did incredibly well for Gian Maria Volonte in For A Few Dollars More. The film's title is ironic because each one of the main characters are just as ugly as the other one, being driven by greed and will do whatever they can to get the gold, even if breaks the partnership between characters. The bad part, nothing ugly, about the film's story is the middle part of the film which at times can become a bit too draggy and doesn't keep me on my toes as it does on Leone's previous films. That is just a minor nitpick as it's still tolerable and it only affects me a few times during my many viewings of the film.Leone's direction and vision for this film is much bigger and concrete. The man knew what he wanted to do for this film and since his other two films he has gained a major boost on his confidence. This made the film feel very patient, showing shots that take it's time in moving on to the next shot or scene. The scope of the film has drastically expanded, showing huge location shots with actors looking very miniature on screen, which at times juxtaposes with the extreme close ups that are also abundant of this film. I think Leone was influenced by David Lean, as moments feel like something that came off from Lawrence of Arabia or at least similarly. Leone is known for creating a memorable climax, and this one may be the most memorable one.The film's director of photography is Tonino Delli Colli who would then work with Leone later on his future films. I wished that Massimo Dallamano came back for this film, the previous film's cinematographer, as he has created a particular style that suited Leone's direction and vision, but Colli didn't do a bad job for this film as he still kept it like a western and increased the scope of Leone's previous films. His work here has definitely become iconic but personally I felt that his best work was Once Upon A Time In America. Leone and Colli's photography shines specifically on moments like the scene with the open desert and the graveyard climax.Ennio Morricone comes back for this film and is definitely his best work. Morricone's score here is much bigger in comparison to his previous work. Morricone's score for this film is much more complex and diverse than his first film with Leone. Leone has created a particular melody and created three styles of delivering it, relating each to a character. Morricone's score stood out the most during the climax as it felt like a throwback to his previous score but interlacing it with his current score. A moment in the POW camp where the prisoners are playing music to drown out torture noises was a moment that showed so much emotion; this was achieved with great acting, beautiful photography, but mostly due to the music. This was the first time I felt that Leone can create something emotional and dramatic, which was not really present on his previous films.The acting spotlight here is equally shared by Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach. Eastwood plays it darker in this film, due to his character being very driven to obtain that gold and will do whatever he can to ensure that he'll get it. At the same time, Eastwood is given moments in this film that showcases a humanitarian point of view, which I thought was a nice touch. Van Cleef's character was a little underused in this film as Wallach and Eastwood had a wider screen time, but when he comes on screen (like the introduction of the character) he plays it cool and at times a bit dark. Van Cleef definitely surprised me because I never really saw him as a villain due to his fantastic performance from his previous film. Eli Wallach was like breath of fresh air, his humor and style of acting really drove the film forward and kept the tone light. Leone has brought back familiar faces from his previous films, kind of like a cameo and a treat for people who are fans of his work.The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is a very well made film but it's minor flaws prevent it from being perfect. It currently ties with For A Few Dollars More but this is just my opinion of the film at the time of writing. I may end up loving this film a lot more as I grow older and with repeated watching. The film has definitely stood the test of time and remain feeling like a fresh and unique in comparison to the many Western films of that era.</fullReview>

Three guys go after $200,000 in gold with the Civil War happening all around them. They even get caught up in it. The cinematography, the acting, storytelling, and direction is superb.But the best thing about this movie is the music. Greatest score of all time.I've heard it said that music is the highest form of all art. Well if that's true, then isn't a great piece of cinema with a great story and executed at the top of its craft the highest form of art when it's combined with beautiful music? It's so perfect, It's a religious experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest achievements in film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is easily the best western I've seen so far. I must say I haven't explored many films from this genre, but I had the opportunity to check a few classics such as Unforgiven and Once Upon A Time in America in theaters a year ago. There is so much to like here I don't even know where to begin. We have plenty of humorous moments that work remarkably well thanks to a great comedic timing by the actors and how they provide their lines just effortlessly. The shootout scenes are always thrilling and very stylish to see, making the journey thoroughly entertaining. The iconic score by Ennio Morricone is simply amazing and I liked how there were variations of the main theme, being the soul of the film. Also, the cinematography here was magnificent, with some breathtaking landscapes in the background, terrific battle scenes (the whole bridge segment was brilliantly executed) as well as interesting close up shots which really enhanced the intensity in a lot of instances. Finally, how could I forget about that last standoff. Everything in that scene was mesmerizing! Just as I was recovering from such an intense moment, Sergio Leone presents us another striking situation between the leads, ending on a very high note. Now let's talk about the main characters here. I loved how each one of them are so distinguished and memorable in their own way. Tuco is a greedy bounty hunter who doesn't really care about anyone other than himself and is described as The Ugly. Eli Wallach was truly great as Tuco and I liked how he's always energetic and has a dark sense of humor. Blondie, The Good, is portrayed by Clint Eastwood and he would be my favorite character in the film. He is a complete bad ass, being very relaxed and cool no matter what situation he's in. Not only Blondie has masterful skills as a gunslinger, but is also a very compassionate fellow, making you respect the guy. The ambivalent partnership between these two worked really well. Then, we have Angel Eyes, The Bad, interpreted by Lee Van Cleef. His performance was also outstanding as this ruthless and senseless hit man who always gets the job done. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly absolutely deserves its high praise as one of the best films of all time, combining a beautiful score, gorgeous cinematography and well developed characters.</fullReview>

It's really easy to get a hold of because its free on amazon prime so you can watch it. Een though it is incredibly long it is definitely worth watching. You should watch it. Its amazing. Nuff said</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never seen better Cinema since i saw this movie in the early 80s. I was blowing away as a teener. The story, the music, the actors, the camera-work, the landscapes, movie graphics. Did i forgot something? Its cinema at his best. A lot of camera shots and music have been copied over and over again in other various movies, even if film-directors didn't know it. Cinema has been strongly influenced by Leone. Many reviews are very well written about the good the bad a the ugly here and elsewhere. Even people who don't like westerns should, no must see this movie because of the complete cinema picture. Once upon and Leones Dollar movies underscored his great talent as one of the greatest directors of cinema. There a 2 kind of movies.....bad and good.....the good is really really bad ;o)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Western ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been watching Westerns since I was a kid. Many of them weren't that good. I had only really watched John Wayne and Roy Rodger westerns. Clint Eastwood films I sadly hadn't really seen as a kid, but of course I had heard of this film. When I saw this film, I was blown away. The Storyline is fantastic. I'm not going to spoil anything, but it truly deserves all the ten star ratings that it has been getting on IMDb. What makes this western different from every other one out there? Well simply put, it doesn't have any of the clichés of the western genre. Sergio Leone (the director of The Good, the bad and the Ugly) made the stakes extremely high and fleshed out the characters in a way that made it interesting and accessible to all audiences. There are some westerns where I can understand why some people don't like them (Jonah Hex, Hang em High, Rio Lobo, etc) but this isn't one of those westerns. Please check out this movie if you haven't already. I would highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Good,the Bad and the Ugly is a fantastic movie with a very well developed and smart storyline and a brilliant cast that know where well how to play in a western.I definitely feel this movie is overrated,number 5 on the IMDb Top 250 is way too high,it is good,but not that good.I think that the plot stretches out a bit too much,and there is a lot of detail that is not needed that could have brought this movie from two hours and forty minutes to just two hours.Another problem I had was Tuco,he was a great character,but he got way too much screen time,probably more than Clint Eastwood,he is the star of this movie and he's what makes the Dollars trilogy so brilliant and he needs the most screen time,also Angel Eyes needed more screen time,he is 'the bad' in the title and if he's one of the title characters and should have been in this much more.There is a lot of violence and action and magnificent performances all around in this movie,I don't think its as great as critics make it out to be,but it's definitely a must see for all fans of western's.Two men work together in a scam in order to lead their way to the whereabouts of a cemetery with gold buried underneath worth over $200,000,but their not the only people that no know about this gold.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Don't know that you are a fan of Western movies or Movies with deep meanings such as meanings in Life or you like black comedy movies. Truth is this movie has No Genre, it has everything in it, Action, Comedy, Drama and . . . For Example it has a Black Comedy scene when Blondie (Good) is going for money with Tuco (Ugly) and their caught by north army because they were saying bad things about them, and all of it because the color of North Army uniforms was hidden because of dirt. Sergio Leone, put a lot of word in his great masterpiece, he show a part of history the way it actually was, not the way in suppose to look. The title maybe says "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" and maybe in the movie characters has nicknames like that, But the ugly truth behind this words is that all of those three people are ugly, they kill, they cheat, they murder and they only care about money. The nicknames mostly are about their personality not what they actually do, for example, good is fair, and he is smart and he care about other people either (if you watched the movie with "A Fistful of Dollars" and know that Clint Eastwood is the same person). So, if there is a movie that you want to watch and Learn, this is your movie, but, if you want to just see a western movie, you can easily go and watch "Wild Wild West"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good The Bad And The Ugly = The Masterpiece of The Western Movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The brilliancy of The photography and direction by Sergio Leone mix with the great taste of music by Ennio Morricone's in this movie making it an experience you will not forget. Not only the main theme, but any piece of music played is a symphony of its own for example "The Ecstacy of Gold", "La Storia di un Soldato" and "Il Triello", Not forget the great acting by Lee Van Cleef, Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is my all-time favorite Western. Any other movie in the genre will always be measured by its standards.This movie is just so great on so many different levels. It should be in the top of your list regardless of what kinds of movies you are into. Even if you hate western. I'm sure you are going to enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just an epic Western, but an artful one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not just an epic Western, it is high art. Every shot seems to be precisely-framed, every table and tableware set positioned to the inch, the light glinting perfectly off every dusty, sweaty surface. In this way it is an achievement in staging and cinematography not unlike Kubrick's "Barry Lyndon."The camera lingers on Tuco, "The Ugly" (Eli Wallach, channeling a young Toshiro Mifune in a manic, wild-eyed performance), as he shifts his gaze restlessly and drains a bottle of red liquor in front of a crucifix. It sounds too obvious written out, but it the moment and in the setting it is startling in its painterly beauty. Sergio Leone told Wallach that he wanted every shot to look like a Vermeer. Mission accomplished.A few moments later Tuco untruthfully explains his relationship with his brother before just as untruthfully claiming a side in the fratricidal American Civil War. There's a precise and intentional balance and symbolism to these moments, and to the film as a whole, but they are so slyly integrated that the tricks can pass unnoticed. For example, two wounded Union officers, both figures of sympathy, echo each other, but they also balance out two sadistic men in blue uniforms: the "bad" Angel-Eyes and his brutish enforcer.The script has such a wealth of one-liners that it tosses them off just for kicks. One of Tuco's old enemies, who's missing his right arm, tells him "I've had a lot of time to learn to shoot with my left." In most action movies that line would be saved for the end, and would feature in the trailers and maybe on the posters. In this movie it's there almost to be made fun of, because it sets up Tuco's retort, one of moviedom's greatest and most widely-applicable soundbytes: "If you have to shoot, shoot, don't talk."More on Tuco, because he's really the star of the show. He and Eastwood's nameless "good" guy trade wry observations about the "two kinds of people in this world." All people can be divided into two categories, they seem to believe. But Tuco, as the title of the film reminds us, belongs to a third category. He and Eastwood are neither friends nor enemies, and the film's knack for exquisite balance reappears when first one and then the other drags his partner through the parching desert.Ennio Morricone's score lifts certain scenes, especially the final act in the cemetery, to a dreamlike plane. That scene seems to exist in an eternal moment that builds and builds as Tuco runs through the graves. Then it slams on the brakes, only to start again from nothing and build and build, rhapsodically and seemingly unendingly, to another sudden breaking point. No final shootout in the annals of Westerns, even the much-anticipated culmination of "High Noon," feels more momentous, and this is thanks in great part to the music of Morricone.As good as the first two movies of Leone's trilogy are, this is by far the richest and the most artful, and it continues to reward with each viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood (the Man with No Name) is good, Lee Van Cleef (Angel Eyes Sentenza) is bad, and Eli Wallach (Tuco Benedito Pacifico Juan Maria Ramirez) is ugly in the final chapter of Sergio Leone's trilogy of spaghetti westerns (the first two were A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More). In this sweeping film, the characters form treacherous alliances in a ruthless quest for Confederate gold. Leone is sometimes underrated as a director, but the excellent resolution on this digital video disc should enhance appreciation of his considerable photographic talent and gorgeous widescreen compositions. Ennio Morricone's jokey score is justifiably famous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'The Good, The Bad and the Ugly' with an emphasis on the 'good'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes 'The Good, The Bad and the Ugly' iconic ranges from many things such as Ennio Morricone's memorable score not only defining this movie, but spaghetti westerns, to its unforgettable scenes, depicting beauty and grit in the world created by Sergio Leone. Watching the movie feels like listening to a long musical composition, watching it build and build into a heart pounding crescendo, at the same time basking in the scenes where time feels like it slows down so we could soak in the beauty that this ugly, fragile world has to offer.What I love about this film, is how it can be light-hearted and fun, yet still feel deep, heavy and contemplative at times. We don't get to know the characters at all (except a bit about Tuco), but we get to know them through their actions, and we truly find out the nature of why these three characters have these titles of 'the good,' 'the bad,' and 'the ugly.' To see these characters interact is a treat to watch, but what captivated me about the film was the great Clint Eastwood and his performance at 'The Man with no Name' or 'Blondie' as Tuco would address him as. He is the definitive embodiment of the stoic, anti-hero with an air of mystery as to where he comes from and his motives, which is what kept me in suspense through out the movie. From his strategic thinking in outsmarting Tuco, he is basically floating through a world of chaos, adapting to any unexpected messy situation these characters get thrown into. Then, when we finally get to the ending, we don't know what will become of the characters and that unpredictability is what makes this one moment in the movie one of the most intense scenes in cinema. Without spoiling anything, all I could say is that I felt the ending was clever in a way I didn't see coming at all.With a great setting, a great score, great performances and a simple, but very great story, this is a western film I highly recommend you should watch, if you have never watched any westerns before. On that note, this is not only a great western film, but a wonderful piece of art from Sergio Leone. From the films I've watched by him, everyone of those films possess that layer of depth to them that feels like that feeling of bliss in life that comes once in a blue moon. Even with a film as dark as 'Once Upon a Time in the West' or 'Once Upon a Time in America,' Leone still manages to emit a feeling of warmth through his stories, and with all its guns and grit, 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly' is pure beauty on film.</fullReview>

What really sets it off is that Clint Eastwood is the good guy. the characters playing the bad and the ugly fit right into what they are suppose to be like. They couldn't of picked a better actor for that part. I like how the movie starts off and easily progress up to the end. towards the end when they find all that money and its a stand off, it made the main character look good in winning. But in all in 1966, i would say this is the number one movie of its time starring with Clint Eastwood. This is also one of the best movie Clint Eastwood played in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Exellend piece of art. Sergio Leone made a really great job, and I really enjoyed the movie. It's probably the best movie with Mr. Clint Eastwood aka Blonde. Sergio Leone's magnificent and ingenious direction in synergy with Ennio Morricone's surreal music, Tonino Delli Colli's breathtaking cinematography and Joe D'Augustine's punctilious editing makes the movie, a treat to watch and ineffably unforgettable. Initially aimed to be a tongue-in-cheek satire on run-of-the-mill westerns, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, continues to stand the test of time in its endeavor to attain apotheosis (if it hasn't attained it yet). It will always be remembered as European cinema's greatest lagniappe, not only to the Western genre, but to the world of cinema.It's a must watch for any movie lover. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is the kind of movie that when it is over, you walk away from the screen, pump your fist into the air and shout "It was awesome!" I haven't seen a movie that I walk away from with my blood racing in quite a while. This movie has an awesome level on par with Inception and The Matrix.Awesomeness aside, this movie was incredibly well done. The directing was magnificent. Sergio Leone builds suspense and excitement through gradually faster cuts and by showing characters' faces and hands closer and closer. The casting and acting is excellent also. Eli Wallach was excellent as Tuco and Clint Eastwood was calm and in control as always. The score, also, is impeccable. It really sets the tone of the movie, contributing to whatever the mood at the moment is, whether that be sadness or excitement. You will be humming the score for days! This movie also has additional music to the standard western sounding scores that are in this series of movies, showing the talent and versatility of the makers of this film.Another thing that impressed me about this film was its accuracy about the Civil War. Never before have I seen a movie that accurately portrayed the North for who they were during the war. This movie is the first and so far the only movie that I have seen that is accurate in this respect. I just can't seem to find anything wrong with this movie. It was that good!</fullReview>

Props to this director for the excellent story line and spectacular character development. Like I said, I HIGHLY recommend this to any person of any genre professions.

		<shortDescription>An Excellent And Unforgettable Masterpiece From Sergio Leone. The Greatest Film and Western Ever Made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good,The Bad and The Ugly is simply a masterpiece of cinema and is not only my favorite movie of all time but,in my opinion the greatest Western ever made and the greatest film ever made. From it's great direction,acting and score The Good,The Bad and The Ugly is a flawless masterpiece that you'll watch again and again.TG,TB&amp;TU tells the story of three gunslingers named Blondie(The Good,Clint Eastwood),Angel Eyes(The Bad,Lee Van Cleef)and Tuco(The Ugly,Eli Wallach)who are on the search for 300,000$ in gold coins. With Blondie and Tuco teaming up and Angel Eyes not far behind,the three gunslingers will stop at nothing to get the gold even if it means going through the civil war or traveling through sunny,dirty grind of the west. It's an unforgettable journey that the three men and viewers wont forget.TG,TB&amp;TU is a film I love for many reasons and one of the reasons is that it's a brilliant finale to the amazing Dollars or Man with no name Trilogy. With A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More,Sergio Leone brought brilliant direction,tension filled standoffs and gunfights and changed the Western forever. But With TG,TB&amp;TU,Leone created an epic film something bigger and larger than the first two films. The gunfights and standoffs are given a much bigger scale and filled with more tension and excellence. TG,TB&amp;TU also succeeds at being a great third film because where in most trilogies the third film is always the weakest,TG,TB&amp;TU is one of the rare occasions in film history where the last film of a trilogy is the best one and tells a great story. Leone obviously wanted to top the first two films and he tops them both in a flawless way and with the greatest of ease. Also, TG,TB&amp;TU is a different film from the first two where A Fistful Of Dollars was about fighting families and For A Few Dollars More was about two gunslingers trying to get an outlaw for gold dollars,TG,TB&amp;TU is about a journey through the West and a Adventure about trying to find gold coins and traveling through Hell and high water to get it. This is the greatest third film ever made and in my opinion when filmmakers want to complete a trilogy TG,TB&amp;TU is a film that should be the template on how to complete a trilogy. Another thing I love about this film and the other two films is the way Leone paints the west the way it was:dirty,dusty and ugly. When you watch the film as a viewer you'll feel like you're in the dust and dirt with the characters giving the film a realistic feel and making you feel like you're in the west. With this film,gone was the white hat/black hat good guy/bad guy characters of the American western films. The characters like Blondie and Tuco aren't painted in black and white,there is a gray area with both of them unlike Angel Eyes who is a clear cut bad guy with no gray area and is vicious from beginning to end. With these characterizations in Leone's trilogy the western film was forever changed and the Western genre after this film became much more gritty and dirty and whether Leone mean't it or not reinvented the Western. The Civil War scenes are breathtaking and gives the film a sense of realism where you feel like you're in the civil war with the soldiers. I also love the fact that Leone shows the Horrors of the Civil War,showing the viewer how dark,brutal and bloody the Civil War or War in general can be. TG,TB&amp;TU despite it's epic running time of 163 amazing minutes moves at a great pace and there is not a wasted scene in the film. This is an epic that feels like it's shorter. The Action and violence in the film is excellent and done in a fast and stylish fashion and will truly blow your mind when the Action happens. The last 20-30 minutes are some of the best moments in film history. Remember when I talked about the great standoffs and shootouts in the first two films? Leone takes the standoffs of the first two films gives us a final,excellent standoff that fits with the films epic tone and is so masterful and truly unforgettable and will stay with forever. This film and the first two films are the reasons Sergio Leone is not only one of my favorite directors of all time but also one of the greatest directors of all time. Clint Eastwood is excellent as Blondie(The Good),bringing an intensity with his eyes,snarl and image,but also bringing a level of depth to the character. Next to Dirty Harry Callahan,The Man With No Name is his most iconic character. Lee Van Cleef is amazing as Angel Eyes(The Bad),a ruthless killer who will kill anyone or do anything to get wants. Eli Wallach gives a brilliant and masterful performance as Tuco(The Ugly),with Wallach bringing humor,intensity and depth to the performance. A great performance. Sergio Leone's direction is excellent and masterful,giving the film an epic scope and landscape. Leone's gunfights and action scenes are excellent and have great suspense and timing. I love Leone's close-ups in the film and you can see the expressions in the actors eyes and what they are thinking. Great job,Leone.Ennio Morricone's score is brilliant,amazing and one of the greatest film scores in movie history. From it's masterful opening theme,the score is intense,memorable and iconic and Morricone's best score although Once upon a time in the West's score comes close. A flawless and unforgettable score from Morricone.In final word,The Good,The Bad and The Ugly is a flawless masterpiece from beginning to end that will live on forever and stand the test of time. If you love Cinema and Westerns I highly suggest you buy this film and see it now. Highly Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sergio's Masterpiece Still Influences Films and Filmmakers Today.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watch films and TV shows to this day and you'll see how deeply influential that "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly" has been. Sergio Leone's masterpiece, to be sure. Just as influential, is the musical score by Ennio Morricone. Yet it's so interesting to note how Leone's style was greatly influenced by the work of John Ford. GBU is an essential film, and anyone reading this understands it. How many people, who don't like westerns, recognize that high-pitched wail that plays at the beginning and very end of the film? It's amazing that the film is 161 minutes long in its original theatrical release, but so many people are so satisfied with it from beginning to end. Most people generally root for that scoundrel, Tuco Benedicto Pacifico Juan Maria Ramirez - known as the rat! What I enjoyed was that Blondie was never *too* Good, while Angel Eyes was so good at being oh, so bad. Tuco, being the Ugly? You understand why he resorted to his ways as his character developed, and you tend to actually root for him. But you still never want to turn your back on him. One of my favorite intimate scenes was Blondie, taking a pause from a pursuit, crossing paths with the soldier. Not one word is said, but the moment between them is truly touching. The only person we truly don't get too close to, is Angel Eyes, but you simply don't feel cheated by that. The cinematography is exquisite. Whether it was the DP, Tonino Delli Colli, or the vision of Sergio's direction, you find a depth to the film like never seen before. The deep focus, using wide angle lenses to maintain focus from, say, a shoe in the foreground to people yards away, to the truly extreme closeups of only shifting eyes, is cinematic genius. There is not one actor that's off in this film. And the writing - three men pursuing a hidden treasure, through the back yard of the Civil War - is outstanding work, with just enough comic relief to give you a chance to relax from the countless number of climaxes throughout."The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly," is the benchmark of not only westerns, but of filmmaking in general. This film, released in 1966, stands at #5 of the top 250 films, which says volumes, especially with over a quarter million votes. And GBU only won one award?</fullReview>

A trilogy that began with the remake of Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo has culminated with one of the best Western films, in the league of The Searchers, Stagecoach and High Noon.Sergio Leone's writing, direction combined with Ennio Morricone's hair-rising background score, the rough facial movements of Blondie and Taco's never-quenching thirst for money makes this movie a masterpiece that is longer and arduous than any other Western film.No one can complain about the nearly 180-minute running time of the movie for this movie keeps you wondering what might happen next. The final half an hour of the movie is one of the best denouements in the history of movies.Lets doff our hats for the one who created this motion picture masterpiece, Sergio Leone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A+ The undeniable pinnacle of Spaghetti Westerns, and one of the greatest films of ALL TIME. This movie slouches nowhere and every aspect of it is masterful. Clint Eastwood is back as "The Good", this time known as "Blondie", and is as great as ever. Lee Van Cleef returns as well, but not as Mortimer. He plays "the Bad", Angel Eyes; a completely different character. Angel Eyes is cunning, obsessively brutal and if you look closely maybe a psychopath. You've got to admire Cleef's capabilities as an impersonation actor. He's a whole another character than he was a year ago in "For a Few Dollars More". And Eli Wallach "the Ugly" a.k.a. Tuco, a truly great character. One might presume him as the comedic relief, and while definitely hilarious, that's hardly his role. The writing gives him depth, even a peek into his younger years which is why the writing is so great. And before I delve elsewhere, let me be clear this installment is indeed a prequel.Many other great characters appear in the film, like the sadistic Corporal Wallace played by Italian actor Mario Brega , the left-handed gun-slinger out for revenge (Al Mulock, R.I.P.), who serves as the basis for one of the greatest lines of all time, courtesy of Tuco:"When you have to shoot, shoot! Don't talk." Aside all these, my favorite would have to be the Union Captain, played by Aldo Giuffr? . The character is not a reflection of only great acting, but also serves as the symbol of what the whole movie is about.The focal point of the movie would definitely be the devastation that war brings, and the many live sit tends to waste on useless efforts. All three of the titular characters, though motivated by greed no less, can't look away from the mutilation before their eyes. This tragic theme is brought out to its fullest by Ennio Morricone, our composer. This has got to be one of his best scores ever, the rawness of it. He captures the fighting spirit beautifully. One of my favorite scene sin film history would have to be when Angel Eyes finds the battered Confederate regiment, and the glorious cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli actually shows the villain step out of the darkness, even if only for a moment, to observe the plight of the soldiers. The music really adds to it, but enough. After all there is a limit to how you can write on IMDb.Anyways, this film sports truly awesome characters, clever writing, beautiful cinematography, and a timeless score. And oh yes the greatest gun-slinger duel of all cinematic history. It truly is director Sergio Leone's finest hour.</fullReview>

All the characters are so simple, the audience make them complex by adding their own backgrounds/concepts to Angel Eyes, Tuco and Blondie. Eli Whallac steals the movie! In reality the movie is about Tuco, not about the villain or the good guy, this makes the movie feel fresh and unpredictable which adds to the amazing nerve wrecking climax.This movie has been an inspiration to me. Sergio Leone is amazing! He directs with his soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good, The Great and The Fantastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of what comes to mind when I hear the words "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" has already been addressed in prior reviews below. There are few words that describe the brilliance of such a movie, but considering as how this film remains (to this day) to be one of my all-time favorites, I thought I should compose a few to express my fond opinion about it for anyone who has not yet experienced the pleasure of seeing it.To put it simply, this movie is utter perfection; the endless landscapes, the classic gun skirmishes, the solid performances, the incredible soundtrack... No western has even caught GLIMPSE of the heights to which this film soars, let alone reached them. This is not just the greatest western, it is one of the best films ever made, with almost no notable exceptions.The music is utter brilliance. The theme song will be playing through your mind for weeks, if it has not already. Ennio Morricone is at his all-time best here, delivering one of the most poetic and outstanding soundtracks for any western (or, arguably, any film), period. And yes, Metallica fans, THIS is the true way that "The Esctasy of Gold" is meant to be heard: in its original version.The camera-work is also of high notability. From the huge wide-angle shots of the walloping scenery to the close-and-tight views of the characters' narrowed eyes, the contrast in camera shots will turn even the slower scenes into sheer excitement.Storywise, this film is without equal. The beautiful simplicity of a bounty hunter-turned-treasure hunter, his unlikely bandit partner and their evil rival racing to find $200,000 in Confederate gold is truly spectacular; but what makes it even more memorable is the broadness and scope on the jarring reality of the Civil War. In truth, this story isn't just about three men, but rather three men and their journey amidst the brawling past of a struggling nation, which is depicted fantastically. And the finale of the Trio Duel has got to be one of the most cinematically and musically excellent sequences ever captured on camera. Some may cringe when they learn that the film lasts a good 2.5 hours, but nowhere has a film of this length felt more fitting.To describe the cast is nearly impossible. Lee Van Cleef puts up one of his greatest performances here--he seems BORN to play "Angel Eyes". His presence on-screen is truly what drives the story and conflict. Eli Wallach delivers an outstanding role as Tuco; his hilarious dialog and occasional brawls with Blondie make him by far one of the most memorable characters to graze any form of theater. Clint Eastwood is truly something to behold. Although Clint is definitely one of my favorite all-time actors, this is not quite my absolute favorite performance of his (admitedly because he's not quite as bad-ass as in, say, A Fistful of Dollars); however, this point is hardly worth mentioning, because his role as Blondie adds the perfect contrast to the others' personalities. While Angel Eyes and Tuco are considerably violent-natured, Blondie is much more passive; he rarely partakes in conflict except when he absolutely has to, but when he does he delivers the ultimate punishment to anyone dumb enough to stand in his way. In some ways, I think the movie wouldn't have been nearly as effective if Clint's character had stolen the show. Either way, every character is simply rounded and chiseled to perfection; there is no room for improvement here.To sum it all up, this movie is simply breathtaking. It's absolutely fantastic; it's utterly brilliant. The music, the plot, the characters, and the incredible direction of Sergio Leone make this "Spaghetti-Western" hardly JUST a spaghetti-western and hardly worth any point of criticism. I have rated this movie a 10 because, unfortunately, there is no higher number available to select (believe me, I would rate this film a 200 if I had the chance). If you have yet to see this film, you must make it an objective to watch it--regardless of whether you like the genre or not. If you've been searching for a film that you could finally term "THE BEST MOVIE EVER," then look no further. It is right here, and it's called: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The legendary "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly." It was a long time coming - "A Fistful of Dollars" (1964) was good, "For a Few Dollars More" (1965) was better but the best of Sergio Leone's "spaghetti western" "Dollars trilogy" was/is "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly," released in 1967. The last film in Leone's "Dollars" trilogy is best remembered for two things: for truly being the best film Leone was capable of directing at that time, and for making star Clint Eastwood a household name (he'd been rising overseas due to his starring roles in the two previous "Dollars" films). (Eastwood, of course, wouldn't become a big-league Hollywood star until "Dirty Harry" in 1971.) The legendary "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" is set during the Civil War, and concerns three men's quest for a fortune in Confederate gold buried somewhere in a cemetery. The three men are: The Man With No Name/Blondie/"The Good" (Eastwood), Angel Eyes/"The Bad" (Lee Van Cleef), and Tuco/"The Ugly" (Eli Wallach). All three have itchy trigger fingers but therein lies the problem: they all know the secret to the location of the buried Confederate gold (one knows the cemetery, but not the grave; another knows the name of the grave but not the cemetery). This film, in its full-length unedited 179-minute running time, may very well be the first epic (spaghetti) western, or at least, the first epic western that I've seen. It's one of the most thoroughly engaging, action-packed, and provocative films I've ever had the pleasure of watching. At center stage is star Clint Eastwood, playing the "Man With No Name" for the third and probably last time, and he's at the top of his game here as a truly bad-a** anti-hero. Sure, he speaks softly, but he carries a big six-shooter and he knows how to use it! But don't overlook the contributions of co-stars Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach. It's been a while since I've been so thoroughly captivated by someone as truly evil and sadistic as Van Cleef's steely-eyed killer Angel Eyes; there is also something to be said about Eli Wallach's portrayal of the unkempt, desperate con man Tuco, who also serves as this film's comic relief. Leone was at the peak of his skill in "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly," clearly the best film of his "Dollars trilogy." His love of wide-angle shots to capture the oppressive desert landscape, and intense close-ups of the actor's faces were unmatched here. It's also the best film of his to make truly excellent use of the extensive talents of the brilliant Italian composer Ennio Morricone (I'm listening to his score for this film right now as I type this up).It only seems fitting that as the western film genre's most iconic star, Clint Eastwood would go on to make his dark, violent anti-western "Unforgiven" in 25 years later in 1992.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's All Good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolutely irresistible, The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly is both the quintessential spaghetti western and the ultimate film from director Sergio Leone (not to mention one of the most popular westerns of all time), though For A Few Dollars More and Once Upon A Time In The West are pretty hard to beat. Needless to say, it's hard to talk about this without repeating the same praise others have heaped on this film.Strangely enough, for something that's become known as one of the definitive Clint Eastwood vehicles, the real main character (as far as the script is concerned) is Eli Wallach's Tuco Ramirez. It's through the eyes of Tuco that most of the action is witnessed and all of the character development takes place. As flashy as their roles are, Eastwood's "man with no name" and Lee Van Cleef's Angel Eyes seen almost cardboard by comparison.When it comes to deleted and extended scenes, I find myself (surprisingly) in agreement with United Artists' studio hucksters from way back when. Added scenes are either unnecessary and awkward, like the introduction of Tuco's gang, or they interrupt the flow of the story, like Angel Eyes' trip to the pitiful rebel camp. It's much more effective to watch Van Cleef disappear after his encounter with Bill Carson's woman and become almost forgotten, only to reappear at the Confederate prisoner-of-war camp, in time to get in on the action.One surprise that awaits those who've seen the movie multiple times and then listened to Ennio Morricone's soundtrack album, is that the climactic showdown theme Il Triello (the trio) differs substantially on the album from the take used in the final film, with the movie version featuring a callback to the musical pocket watch in For A Few Dollars More and the album version containing an extended horn solo at the end, lasting longer than in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The long, the unsynchronised and the improbable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Has 'The Good, The Bad And The Ugly' acquired too much of a halo over the years, putting it beyond criticism? To me it was a rehearsal by Leone for the vastly superior 'Once Upon A Time In The West', my all-time favourite.When I last watched Blondie, Tuco and Angel Eyes I missed the start. The Man With No Name (except the endlessly repeated 'Blondie') was stumbling across the desert. Tuco was carrying on in a sadistically clownish manner that was simultaneously tedious and repellent. It was only sloth that held me in my seat.Most film directors are forever pulling the legs of their audiences. Leone is no exception. Using all sorts of tricks, he allows the story to creak along in the most improbable manner, either hoping that viewers won't notice or don't care. One of Sergio's little jokes is that if something isn't seen by the camera, neither will it be visible to the characters, even though they're looking in different directions. The best gag of this kind is when Tuco and Blondie are captured as they stumble into a huge army camp they somehow fail to spot.In like fashion, useful props materialise out of nowhere. While Tuco scrambles in the cemetery to dig up the stolen gold, Blondie manages to construct a makeshift gibbet from a convenient tree and a length of rope long and strong enough to tie up the 'Titanic'. And where did the the shovels come from in the treasure-hunting scenes? Almost every new twist was improbable.You have to admire the mixture of frailty and resilience of participants in Leone's films. Baddies are dispatched with a single shot. Tucos and Blondies are beaten or baked to within an inch of their lives but bounce back as readily as cartoon characters flattened by steamrollers.Some people don't mind poor lip-synchronisation, including Signor Leone, but I do. The distraction of mouths often moving independently of the words they purport to speak is aggravated by the laboured dialogue. Thank goodness Leone stepped up several gears for 'Once Upon A Time In The West' by using a brilliant writer and employing a much better cast (Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson, Jason Robards, etc) than the irritating Eli Wallach and the dull-as-ditchwater Clint Eastwood.Despite these grumbles, there's a lot to be said in favour of 'The Good, The Bad And The Ugly'. It's stylish, idiosyncratic and spectacular with a wonderful score by Ennio Morricone. But rather than be considered the greatest western ever, as judged by many enthusiastic IMDb reviewers, the film is better regarded as a highly creditable rehearsal for the undoubted masterpiece which followed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of all time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't really believe in lists that much or calling one song, movie or whatever the best since there is a lot to be said about different good things. But Tarantino put this movie at the nr.1 spot of greatest movies of all time and he may just be right. Sure, there's a lot that can be said about what's not right about it like the much debated behind the camera scenes not getting noticed till the characters are supposed to and about a dozen other things, but I think that's unimportant compared to what IS right about it. As someone else already mentioned, the last 20 minutes or so, from when Tuco does his running to the shoot-out climax is like an emotion. It's Opera, it's every comic book, every great song, every fairytale, it's what every movie is supposed to do, it's well....everything. Call me a woos but it can still almost make me cry every time I see it, it's that beautiful. Blondie, Tuco and Angel eyes, should a alien civilization ever try and contact us send a clip of these 3 guys. We send this movie with a song of Otis Redding, the work of Michelangelo, a copy of 1984, a picture of the Sagrada Família, a V8 engine and a few other things and they will know what we're pretty much about and what art we can create. But that's just my humble opinion of course.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so this is the story of three men, Blondie (The Good), Angel Eyes (The Bad), and Tuco (The Ugly). They are each after treasure that is buried in a cemetery. They know which cemetery but only Blondie knows the name of the grave. So basically, everyone is after Blondie.It's very hard to choose who's the bad guy in this film. It could be the Ugly, but he always seems to be friends with Blondie (who's obviously the good guy). There's also the Bad, who's obviously the bad guy, but he's nice to Blondie. ?. That doesn't matter, though. This movie is amazing! It's very uncommon to find a movie that's 2hrs and 41mins of awesome action that held my attention throughout.Clint Eastwood's awesome and is THE action hero of the sixties! Character development is great and you get to know how much of a d**k The Ugly can be.I am seeing the other spaghetti western Once Upon a Time in the West soon and I am excited to do so. After this movie, all westerns are great in my book. My original favorite western was the 2010 True Grit. Now its this. It's not just my favorite western, my favorite movie of all time!*** out of ***, ***** out of *****, ********** out of **********.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Reminder of Why Westerns Are Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is, without a doubt, my favorite Western of all time, and quite possible my favorite movie overall.This movie is about three men: Blondie(The Good), Angel Eyes(The Bad), and Tuco(The Ugly). These three men are searching for a stash of Gold hidden in a Civil War cemetery. Blondie knows the name of the grave, and Tuco knows the name of the cemetery. The three men are constantly allying with and backstabbing each other in order to find out the missing information. Along the way they are helped and hindered by the Civil War as well as each other.From beginning to end, the movie has witty dialogue, brilliant shooting, colorful characters and music that you've no doubt heard before. This is where "that one western tune" comes from.As Roger Ebert said, and I'm paraphrasing here, the camera shots were done in a way in which nothing that happens out of shot happens at all. You don't know people are around until they appear on camera. This causes several surprises.People complain about it's inaccuracies, like building a super-pistol, the bullets they use, using dynamite before it's been invented, and using guns that haven't been invented. I say it doesn't matter. This is a fun movie from start to finish, and any fan of movies should watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic standard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the great ones. It is a "dictionary movie" by which all subsequent films of its kind are measured or defined. The music, the scenes, the characterizations, the action sequences... they are what makes a classic western. The spaghetti western trilogy not only launched a modern icon, Clint Eastwood, into stardom but by doing so ushered in a whole new era of film making. Even with the dubbed dialog and dated effects, it manages to remain a favorite of so many fans. That defines classic. I remember when I first saw this film. I wanted to be the man with no name. I wanted to wear the cape, wear the hat and ride the horse. It has stuck in mind for over 40 yrs. Now legendary composer Ennio Morricone demonstrated why he became what he is today. The international theme has been used countless times in countless forms of art. The film has staying power. It's classic good verses evil. Themes of greed, lust, power all reflect the human condition. And it is every bit as relevant today as it was set during the civil war times the movie is set in. The faces of the supporting cast are indelible. Where did Sergio find these guys?! All in all I would recommend this film to anyone who is a film lover. It is a bit violent at times but it's not gratuitous. Parental guidance is definitely suggested.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting, music, story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Story: The third and best of the "dollar" trilogy. As the in the second part this film has three heroes. The Bad is Senteza or Angel Eyes, ruthless, cruel, sadistic but very intelligent gunman. He stops at nothing, but even he has some principles, cruel ones admitably. The Ugly is Tuco violent, aggressive and primitive who resembles an animal. But despite his failings he is not a cold hearted bastard as Senteza. The Good, again man with no name. Here called Blondie. He is very intelligent, calculating and quite ruthless. Despite he is supposed to be good he is not, perhaps only in comparison with the other two which does not say much. All of them set on the way to recover money stolen from confederate army.Acting: Eastwood, van Cleef and Wallach are all great in their roles. This is really acting concert. Especially Wallach as Tuco is irresistible.Direction and camera: Movie is beautifully shot and direction is overall very good.Music: Music composed by Ennio Morrcione as in the rest of "Name with name series" is again just great, very atmospheric.Conclusion: Best of the series, this is Leones masterpiece. I strongly recommend this film to everybody who likes western movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Western Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone captures the essential western by turning it into a basic gold hunt story instead of falling back to the stereotypical evil characters who want some railroad scheme or abuse the townspeople, the basics of 3 characters battling it out for pure greed is genius. The scope of the film coupled with Ennio Morricone's magnificent score is epic to say the least especially with the Ecstasy of Gold playing over Tuco looking for the grave which is easily the best scene of the film. The final shoot down is one of the best if not the best climax of any film with the music thundering over each character with awesome close ups being more and more intense as it proceeds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My first impression was 9/10, but just let the movie sit with you for awhile and it's scope, atmosphere, pacing, machismo, and sheer "coolness" practically force a perfect 10 rating. Unique and memorable!I've seen it twice now and it has grown on me. The three main actors (Eastwood, Wallach and Cleef) are full of intensity, mystery, edginess. The plot twists and meanders and takes it's time, and I'm saying that's good! We go on this epic journey as the lives of our three stars criss and cross and we really experience the crazy fortunes (and misfortunes) life can throw at you.Although I have not watched enough westerns to be any kind of expert, I think you can just feel "cinema masterpiece" when you watch this film. There are so many unique touches, quotable lines and atmospheric moments you'll come away from it caterwauling "Ah-a-ah-a-aaahhhh..... wha, wha wha...."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>when the western was born again in Europe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing again the last film in the 'spaghetti westerns' trilogy was a true revelation. It already happened to me to see classical movies, live again the feelings I had at the previews viewing and discover new perspectives brought up by the years. With 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' something different seems to have happened. It's my third viewing if I remember well. I scarcely remember the first one, I was a teenage and I must have seen the movie at the same time I was seeing other classic westerns like these starring John Wayne. Then I saw it again in the 90s and what struck me was the fabulous acting especially Eli Wallach's. This latest experience is different as I dare now discharge all the labels and enjoy what is best in this film - the camera art, the dynamic of the characters, the superb acting of the three lead actors, Ennio Morricone's music which entered the best soundtracks gallery, the color and diversity of the extras and the fresh perspective brought to a moment of history often present in the American film. By the mid 60s when Sergio Lepne had the chutzpah of undertaking the trilogy project western was a genre in stagnation. The period of the big films of John Ford was passed over, actors like John Wayne or Richard Widmark were beyond their pick, and westerns were not considered a source of blockbusters by the big studios.It was kind of natural to expect renewal to come from out of America, as in Europe the Far West space was keeping its fascination and the potential of staging eternally human dramas. After the success of the first two films in the trilogy Leone wanted the third one to be a quality upgrade, more ambitious and more stylish. Although he could not hire the actors he wished, he was lucky to receive as replacement Eli Wallach who gives here one of the best performances of his career, a combination wicked shrewdness and surviving skills, a dangerous creep with a sense of humor. The viewing is a fest from start to end. That was the period of Technicolor and big screens, and Leone masters the technology and the format, which fit the endless desert where most of the action happens. While filmed in Spain, one can say that never had Andalucia looked so Texan. The local extras faces carved by wind and sun fit perfectly the cinematographic landscape. Morricone's music fills in the vision in a synthesis that was played and quoted in endless movies that followed (to mention 'Kill Bill''s theme as the last I remember). Especially visible and special is the reconstruction of the Civil War background. From 'Gone with the Wind' to 'Cold Mountain' this is one of the most filmed episodes of American history, allowing for numerous mass and battle scenes. Amazingly the vision of the Italian Leone fits perfectly in the gallery. Moreover the juxtaposition of the situations of fortune seekers and of the soldiers caught in the absurd of the was allows for a comparison with anti-militaristic nuances. Soldiers and adventurers play death games with little chances of survival. And yet, for at least one moment the the game of the fortune seekers seems more rational and even more human than the organized game of destruction called war.The actor that dominates the film is without any doubt Clint Eastwood. Closing up the trilogy that launched his career, 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' brings the last touches to the portrait of the Man with No Name from the previous movies, the soldier of fortune and killer who never draws first his gone and never kills without a reason. The script places him here in different situations than in the previous movies, but the scene of the duel in three close to the final brings him back the poncho as the sign that the cycle draws to its end. In the permanent game of trickery and death Blondie is the only of the three characters that allows to himself manifestations of humanity and acts of compassion that endanger him. Howevwe he knows and we know that he aims and shoots faster and better and he will eventually prevail. The final scene with Eastwood's character melting in the infinite desert landscape closes up in the best possible way Leone's trilogy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just this one movie could make Sergio Leone one of greatest directors in the history but he was capable of even more. This is just breathtaking from the very first ten fully speechless minutes where not a word is being said till the very end where's Mexican showdown with a strongest emotional tension is shown and developed through its tiniest details.I couldn't say what I love most about this film. Whether it is a truly epic approach that combines U.S. Civil War showcase from its both sides with a treasure seeking story and coincidences their pathways all the time. Or it is ultimately charismatic heroes Blondie, Angel Eyes and Tuco who're saying short but sharp phrases and joking all the time. Or it is one of greatest Ennio Morricone achievements where his music is put more than perfectly behind the action. Or it is an ultimately beautiful cinematography that shows you both close shots and great panoramas. I just can't decide but the movie just sucks you in and never lets you out of it's simply but astonishingly well told story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fourth Place All Time For Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched the 2003 DVD that contains the fully restored three hour version of this classic western. For those of you not familiar with the storyline, it revolves around the attempts of three rouges to find a missing fortune in Confederate gold in New Mexico during the Civil War. The 2003 DVD has an excellent audio commentary by film critic Richard Schickel, who also collaborated with Eastwood on a definitive Eastwood biography. I gave this film a 10 out of 10 star ranking in IMDb. It scored 20 points in my ranking system, placing it in fourth place all time. Here's the Good: - Eli Wallach and Leone created one of the great villains in the history of cinema. Tuco is equal parts amoral scourge, paisan sympatico and stand up comic. The only characters in the history of Westerns that compare are Little Bill in "Unforgiven", Judge Roy Bean in "The Westerner" and Joe Erin in "Vera Cruz". Gene Hackman and Walter Brennan both won Best Supporting Actor Oscars for those performances. If the Academy ever decides to start handing out retroactive awards, this would be a good place to start. - The movie is notable for launching Clint Eastwood to life long international superstardom. Eastwood went on to direct and star in two Westerns that occupy the second and third places in my all time list, "Unforgiven" and "The Outlaw Josie Wales." If not for the success of TGTBTU, those films might not exist. - The best soundtrack in the history of Westerns.....the signature laughing hyena, the eerie whistling, the soaring mariachi trumpets, and most importantly, the twangy guitar solo and macho male chorus constantly driving the plot forward. Other than the theme from "The Magnificent Seven", this is only Western soundtrack to become a part of the general popular culture. Hugo Montenegro's cover version reached number two on the Billboard charts in 1968. - I call Leone's counterpoint between the long, flowing episodes of deep sentimentality and short bursts of graphic violence "John Ford on steroids". Coppola would copy this technique several years later in an even more gruesome scene in "The Godfather". - Fantastic 10 minute opening sequence with no dialog, a homage to "Rio Bravo" and "Comanche Station". This is bookended at the film's climax by another spellbinding five minutes with no dialog. - I admire Leone's bold decision not to sandwich in a gratuitous female romantic interest. Last "all guy" Western until "Brokeback Mountain" (just kidding). - This may be the first "Vietnam" Western. This is impressive, since in 1965 when the story was conceived and written, opposition to the war was not yet fashionable. - This was a watershed film for Westerns in terms of realism. It wasn't the first one to completely break with production code restraints, but it was the first popular and successful Western to do so. There would be no going back to the world where justice always prevails in the end, everyone's wardrobe is perfectly pressed, bullet wounds are bloodless and there are no gratuitous graphic rapes. - Brilliant casting of Lee Van Cleef, a minor actor in many Westerns from the golden age of the '50's, including "High Noon", "The Bravados", "The Gunfight at the O.K. Corral" and "Ride Lonesome". His presence is one of many Leone homages in the movie to classic Westerns (including a number of references to 1948's "Yellow Sky"). The presentation of Van Cleef's facial features as sculpture reminds me of Boetticher's use of Randolph Scott in the Ranown cycle of films. - The best use of the Civil War ever in a Western. The only competitors I'm aware of are "Dances With Wolves", "Major Dundee" and "Escape From Fort Bravo". - It's impressive that the portrayal of the Civil War battle is realistically based on the Battle of Glorieta Pass, which took place in New Mexico in 1862. It is often falsely thought that this movie is set in Texas, where there were no major Civil War battles. This misinformation, spread by Leone himself apparently, has deceived some critics into thinking the basic setting of the movie is implausible. - Finally, of the five Leone Westerns, this is the perfect blend of Leone's distinctive style with a clever, fast moving and entertaining plot. The other four movies are all fine films, but the first two "Dollar" movies were very low budget and Leone's style was still evolving. Meanwhile, in "Duck, You Sucker" and "Once Upon A Time in the West", Leone disconnected himself from the needs of his commercial audience. Leone was quoted by his biographer, Richard Frayling, as saying that he made OUTITW "for cineastes only". TGTBTU is satisfying for both scholars and popular audiences. The Bad and the Ugly: - I don't have much negative to say about this film. I've read critics who feel it is too long, that the story's not interesting enough, that the Tuco character is irritating. that Wallach's acting is hammy and that the premise of three criminals riding around loose during the Civil War is implausible. I don't think any of these arguments hold water. When it was released in the U.S. in 1968, it was roundly panned for its excessive violence. These complaints seem laughably quaint today in light of the orgy of graphic cinematic gore and sadism that has engulfed filmdom since the late '60's.</fullReview>

Actually the film is started from Some where, When Tuco said "There are two kinds of people in the world, my friend: Those with a rope around the neck, and the people who have the job of doing the cutting". The ending fight scene with its 3-way showdown is one of the most greatest pieces of film may be ever watched. Leone did his finest job with the camera direction in this movie and the acting is impressive. Eastwood, Van Cleef, and Wallach are absolutely fantastic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Today, the film is regarded by many critics as a classic. The plot revolves around three gunslingers competing to find a fortune in buried Confederate gold amid the violent chaos of gunfights, hangings, Civil War battles and prison camps.The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is the last and most assured of director Sergio Leone's 'Spaghetti Western' trilogy starring Clint Eastwood, this introduces a routine plot ? mercenaries hunting money ? and sets it against the murderous slaughter of the Civil War. Leone had been ratcheting up the emotional impact of his narratives as his trilogy progressed, and this one concludes with a sensational, widely admired three-way shoot-out in a cemetery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Good,The Bad and The Ugly is the best western movie that i have seen ever.No doubt,Once upon a time in the west stands on the same fame but it just towers a bit higher.This is a masterpiece from Sergio Leonne.Lets talk about the three characters in the film.The Good: Clint Eastwood raised to stardom only due to this movie.The good man may have done some fabulous roles but this one from his past is one of his best.Great acting and those cigar scenes,just everything fits. The Bad: Angel eyes or the bad or Lee Van Cleef rises to the occasion.Its just his presence that gives a dark effect to the film.He shows how to make a serious bad role into a contemporary easygoing kind of.He has the least role in the movie but still for me he was a stand out performer. The Ugly: Tuco.......Fabulous.Who is this guy?What an act?So captivating and just his greed for money that you wish you always see his acting again and again.Perfect casting for a perfect role.Here i add a fourth character.The master of Westerners.The emphatic Sergio Leonne. Sergio Leonne: Words are hard to say how i feel about him right now.He is class.Along with Ennio Marricone he has a pairing that is the best in cinema.Beautiful directed scenes and soundtrack constantly echoing in your ears.The epic scene or the penultimate climax in the end is a rare art of cinema.Such scenes just make the movie or break it.The linking up of war,blowing up of bridge,fight for money,all add different emotionality to the movie.Specially the war scenes,the death of the general particularly,a scene i can never forget.A scene with such amazing music.Words are not enough for this film.This is grand.This is magnanimous.This is far more than just a western....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The good: There is a lot about this film which is absolutely 10/10. The film is very enjoyable. From what I remember of the last time I saw it, which was in French with English subs, I enjoyed it a hell of a lot more. One of the key parts of what made the film entertaining was the score. 99 times out of 100 it fitted the scene in question perfectly, and added to the feeling of the moment perfectly. The camera work was actually surprisingly good too, the use of cameras created tension and build up with out the use of massivley expensive special effects. The one particular scene which I feel sums up the film is the amazing showdown scene in the cemetry. The use of music, cameras and the brilliant acting of our three leads. The scene is awesome, it keeps your eyes stuck to the screen and makes you feel a part of what's taking place. Even if you've seen the picture before and know what's going to happen, you still think it could turn out differently... That is the brilliance of the film.The bad: Whilst there is a lot of good in the film there are a number of things which dampen the film for me. One of which is the lack of details or explanation to a lot of situations which occour. Like one minute the leads are in one place, and the scene changes and they are in a completely different situation several months later with no intervening details. The Ugly; Again there is little which is awful about the film. I would moan about the length, but I feel this is a touch hypocritical, considering I have moaned about lack of details. What I will say though is, some of the film could be used to better effect in advancing the plot. It does feel at times as if were stuck in a permanent rut which the film struggles to pull ou of.Overall the film is very good, and its positives far outweigh any negativity in the film. It's fun, a bit silly, and different from the majority of westerns in existence. So I'm unsure where this film lies in terms of score, somewhere between a 7 or an 8. I believe i'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt, having read what I have just written 8 seems the fairer score.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the my first western movie I have ever seen. This is also my first Clint Eastwood movie. It created such an impact on me that I started comparing every western movie with it. I did not watch any John Wayne movie. But for me Clint is the best Western actor for ever. After this movie I collected remaining of his Westerns and watched. I have watched nine of his Westerns. Every one of them is good. Then I could not stop of watching his other genres. skills. He just acts what the character needs in particular frame, not more than that nor less than that. I think this is the reason he did not get the Oscar even he nominated. Now he is proving his directions kills. The background music in this is a trademark. Many of our Indian directors still use this music as reference or directly into movies. I think Sergio Leone is one of the top directors from Italy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is simply put, the best movie of all time. Everything about this movie was perfect. The direction, the score, the setting, the acting, everything. The characters are developed and are definitely memorable. This movie has it all, humor, action, adventure, drama, and definitely the greatest ending to a movie in the history of film. The plot of the story is definitely more than a simple hunt for treasure, morals are spread through out the film symbolically and explicitly.Sergio Leone's visionary, direction style is shown once again, and I can go on and on and on about it, but then i'd be writing for days upon days.Tuco, blondie, and Sentenza/Angel Eyes. Three of the most iconic, and memorable characters ever. Tuco displays the "ugly" side of people. Tuco is selfish, apathetic, a liar, a cheater, often two faced and down right dirty. Sentenza/Angel eyes is a cold hearted, sociopathic, bounty hunter, who does whatever it takes to get his job done. Blondie is not the typical good guy. He is amoral, greedy, and holds many of the characteristics as Tuco and Angel eyes. He is not the same type of good guy that John Wayne portrays, Blondie portrays a more realistic form of what a "good guy" would be in the west. Greed, dishonesty, and selfishness are traits we all have. Blondie however is the epitome of masculinity, with his poncho wearing, cigar smoking, quick with the pistol ways, and I cant help but admire him. What especially stands out about these characters is how they are able to accurately display human nature. Critics deem these characters as amoral, but everyone who exists on the planet is amoral in a certain sense. Sergio leone, and his great cast capture this reality in this epic adventure."$200,000 is a lot of money, we're gonna have to earn it." That line is definitely one of the greatest lines in the movie, as well as one of the most masculine. The final scenes from Tuco's ecstasy of the treasure to the Mexican standoff (which is one of the most creative and unexpected end to an epic western)left me in awe, along with ennio morricones ultimate score. People argue that this movie is just about a greedy treasure hunt, and can't live up to something as captivating as a revenge story, like once upon a time in the west. First of all it is not just a greedy treasure hunt, as i said before it is a trip into human nature, adventure and masculinity. Secondly, what it comes down to is your taste in movies. If you're a more masculine, adventurous person, you'll admire the good the bad and the ugly, but if your into revenge, and honor then once upon a time in the west is your movie. You can learn a lot about people by the movies they enjoy.Its just a shame that people today cannot enjoy this fantastic movie. Im 16 years old and every time i try to show my friends they always shoot it down, or end up not understanding it. It is a terrible shame how movie making has turned from an art to just a quick get rich scheme.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Epic of Westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In The Good, The Bad and the Ugly Sergio Leone perfected his epic western. It's key is the trio of main characters who all bring something different to the table and all serve as integral ingredients to a film that might appear a mere adventure film on the surface, but which is both a comedy and character drama as well as a great war movie at the same time.Clint Eastwood's the Man with No Name, this time called Blondie, continues somewhat on the more ruthless note he took on from the previous film (For a Few Dollars More). However, he's not a truly malicious character but more of jerk-friend who is also extremely observant and at the end of the day doesn't stab anyone in the back so hard that they wouldn't get up again. This creates his rather odd relationship with Tuco.Lee Van Cleef's Angel Eyes is the very embodiment of evil as far as characters go. He wipes anyone who's in his way, is entirely devoid of any morals and generally manages to create a menacing mood with his presence. This is a stark contrast to the character he played in the previous film and made all the more unsettling by the fact that his appearance is almost identical to this character from the previous film, right down to the pipe.Eli Wallach as Tuco the Rat is easily the most memorable character from the film. Appearing at first filthy, amoral and without any redeeming qualities he is suddenly thrust into a wavering partnership and later, one could even say, a type of friendship with Blondie. We find out that there is more to Tuco than meets the eye though he never stops being the seemingly greedy scum that he is at the start, by the end of the film the viewer is even able to sympathise with him to a degree.What truly sets this film apart from other westerns and as well as the rest of the Dollars trilogy is that even in its close-to-three-hour length, the film doesn't feel excessively long. The length is justified. You 'want' to spend the 170 minutes with the main cast of characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"In this world there are two kinds of people my friend.Those with loaded guns, and those who dig..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me, movies from "Dollars Trilogy" and after them, final movie "Once upon a time in the West" are the best westerns ever made. The question is, will anything exceed them ever if we are talking about westerns. Unlike mainstream Hollywood westerns from 1950s and 1960s that were showing us idealistic picture of wild west of 19th century, with lots of patriotism and propaganda,these sometimes called "spaghetti westerns" are something completely different. Somebody said-"John Wayne would never shoot to a guys back. Clint Eastwood would never have a problem with that." This main difference between typical representatives of these two different kinds of westerns is what sets them apart. It began with "A fistful of dollars" and continued with "For a few dollars more". With each next movie they were getting better and better. "Good,bad,ugly" is crown of all of them. Story about three men searching for 200.000 dollars in gold and without choosing ways to get them. This is a real story about wild west, story about real people without make up. People without almost any moral barrier, instead of idealistic characters shown in Hollywood westerns of that time who were unrealistic. In "Dollars trilogy" everything is based on interest- association,rivalry and fighting for money. Allies and enemies change over night depending on current interests. Characters of Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef were allies in "For a few dollars more" but enemies in "Good,bad,ugly". That was all based on interest. Man without name or Good (Clint Eastwood) is typical anti-hero,but you somehow feel that he is a good one. We know nothing about his past (that gets revealed in "Once upon a time in the West" with Charles Bronson) but there is something in him that makes us wish to be the way he is. He is ready to take the punch,but when he strikes back no one stays alive. And he always manages to outflank them. Like the rest he does everything from interest, but he is iconic figure because of what he is. Bad (Lee Van Cleef) is real bad guy who chooses no way to find out where the money is. He is calculated and ready to do everything necessary to satisfy his greed.Man without any moral brakes. And Ugly (Eli Wallach) known as Tuco Benedicto Pacifico Juan Maria Ramirez also known as Rat is comical in his greed and lack of any moral barriers. Slave of his own ego and instincts. His life credo is-"When you want to shoot,don t talk,just shoot". If he wants something, he wants it now. Man of revenge ("If someone double crosses me and leaves me alive,he understands nothing about Tuco.Nothing"). But he forgets about revenge if it comes to interest. In the end he is left with half of the money but stiff,scarred and angry which perfectly represents his personality.All three characters are allies and enemies depending on current situation and their interests as we see throughout the movie. The question remains until the end-who is going to outsmart who? And when they found a money there comes that final scene of gunfight between all three of them. Camera shows us their faces and eyes-we see what they feel and their personality. Good-Cold blooded and self-confident knowing that he controls the situation and with advantage because he knows that Ugly has no bullets in his gun (because he put them of from his gun when they were sleeping) and he can concentrate on Bad, but Bad and Ugly know nothing about that so they have to concentrate on each other and Good, which puts them in difficult situation in favor of Good. Bad-Calculated and moving around thinking who is he going to shoot first-Good or Ugly? Ready to fire in any moment. And Ugly-Scarred and also thinking who to shoot first. He is in most difficult situation. Such a dramatic psychological scene. And everything is over in seconds,Good fires first and kills Bad,Ugly has nothing to fire with as he discovered in that moment with feel of anger about Good. What a perfection in filming. Good leaves with half of the money and leaves Ugly with another half to continue to hate him for the rest of his life. Film has excellent soundtrack-opening melody, melody when Ugly runs on graveyard searching for money and the best melody-scene of final gunfight. There are also other good melodies in movie. In my opinion "Good,bad,ugly" is second best western ever made after "Once upon a time in the West" which is first. Jim Carrey once said about Man without a name played by Clint Eastwood in "Dollars trilogy" and Charles Bronson in "Once upon a time in the West" that he is someone who we all want to be-"He has no name,so that everyone can put his own."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one those films that most people could watch today and it wouldn't matter that it was made over forty years ago. For me it is almost three hours of excellent entertainment. I watch it every now and then but not obsessively. It is like an old reliable friend who comes round and is completely welcome. You know how pleasurable it is going to be while the friend is around and you enjoy the company immensely. You can watch this film twenty times and still notice something which you had missed previously. I enjoy this film for how it is I am not concerned or irritated by the historical errors or any other errors which may have been made. It is just so atmospheric you can almost feel the emotions on screen. In order to appreciate it more maybe you should watch the other two films first 'a fistful of dollars' and 'a few dollars more' but only because they were made in that order. There is violence in the film but the mere fact that the action is set during the American Civil War period is enough of a guide as to the content. In conclusion it is visual treat and is one of the best films ever made. Please watch it and enjoy the experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest movie ever made. Period.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where do I start? Good Bad and Ugly was such an awesome, awesome film. From the second it began, I was glued to the screen, continuously wondering exactly what would happen next. Having watched it for the 2nd time last night, I am still unable to get this amazing piece of art out of my mind. There is no way possible that Sergio Leone is not the greatest director of all time. But enough of me rambling, let me give a reason for my madness.....This film has some of the best acting you will ever find from an allstar cast. Clint Eastwood returns in his role as The Man With No Name, or as he is referred to in this particular film, Blondie, and he plays the role flawlessly, supplying lots of memorable quotes in the process. And then there is Eli Wallach playing the comical bandit called Tuco. Tuco is one of the most hilarious characters ever in movie-making, and there are plenty of scenes where he makes an absolute fool of himself, as well as making others look like idiots in a very funny manner. Finally, there's Lee Van Cleef playing the role of ruthless hit-man Angel Eyes. Van Cleef does superbly in getting the audience to really despise the character he plays because he obviously puts so much emotion into playing the merciless Angel Eyes, who doesn't hesitate to kill ANYONE.....for the right price, that is.But it has been proved numerous times that good acting alone will not make a movie a classic. And fortunately, Leone's masterpiece features one of the most clever plots ever. The story revolves around gunslingers Blondie, Tuco, and Angel Eyes looking for a treasure of gold buried by Confederate troops in a remote cemetery. But here's the interesting part- none of them are able to find the gold without one of the two others. See, each of the three men know a vital fact about the location of the gold that the others need in order to find it. Tuco knows the name of the cemetery, Blondie knows the name of the grave the gold is buried under, and Angel Eyes, like Tuco, knows the name of the cemetery. With an innovative story like that, a director like Sergio Leone, and a stellar cast of actors like Eastwood, Wallach, and Van Cleef, you know ahead of time you are going to see something special. Everything unfolds at such a smooth pace throughout the film, and there are lots of interesting twists that keep you guessing.But there are two things about this film that stand out to me, even above the acting and story. And those two things are the musical score done by Ennio Morricone and the ending climax of this film. I won't say anything other than they are two things that need to be heard/seen by everyone. Awe-inspiring stuff.So going back to my original statement, Sergio Leone's The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly is without a doubt the greatest film ever made.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think there's any better western movie than this. The epic, magnificent ending for the Dollars trilogy by Sergio Leone is also the best film. You can find everything you can expect from a western movie: gun challenges, tricks, frauds, deserts, the hunt for treasure, bandits, all brilliantly directed by Leone. Action, irony, thrilling. Clint Eastwood is, as always, perfect as the "man with no name": mysterious, no past, no emotions, the only thing we know is that he wants money. Lee van Cleef is also great for his "bad guy" role, it fits him so very well that now I can't imagine him in a different role than Angel Eyes. But the best of the three is maybe Eli Wallach: his acting performance is simply impressive. This film gave us so many famous phrases that we keep using them even now. The scenes have a perfect synchronicity. And the music is a masterpiece by Ennio Morricone. If you want to make a culture about western movies, be sure to watch "The good, the bad, the ugly" for last, or else it would spoil the fun for the other movies.</fullReview>

The other elements make this film one of the greatest movie of all times and definitely must watch before you die.I can't believe that some people rated this film with only one star since this film deserves at least 7 (only if you hated the movie) but in the end it is all a matter of subjectivity.They don't make films like this anymore..</fullReview>

Blondie and Tuco have an uneasy relationship, in which they often try to kill each other. Angel Eyes is off looking for a man at all costs. You soon find out about tons of gold and the characters are off looking, teaming up one moment, then killing each other the next.The most interesting character was Tuco, who truly filled the role of the 'ugly.' He was a twisted man, and extremely enjoyable to walk. There's some great action and it's amazingly shot, with extreme close ups, most noticeably in the standoff in the finally, as the camera switches between the eyes of the duelers and there hands about to grab there guns. As it gets tighter and tighter and tension rises the guns go off in an extremely great scene. A last note the score is awesome.You must see this movie. Truly amazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cant believe that this film was made in the 60s!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a true master piece from the legendary director Sergio Leone. one interesting thing about this film is that, its like wine, getting better and better after each year. personally i cant believe that film was made in the 60s. technique's used are brilliant. the characters shows a realism in their behavior, the good is not exactly good, explained by cheating ugly, or may be because he knows ugly too well. the characters are dressed like they just came out of a fashion magazine. the music is ever memorable. all the credits goes to Leone. i think he is the father of modern commercial film making, admired and followed by the great directors of today. his directorial style made spaghetti western to a genre from its meaning. we can see that in westerns made after this film. i have often wondered why this didn't get any Oscar or other major awards. after 40 years, its considered to be one of the best films ever made. its obvious from its rating in IMDb. the film that won Oscar in 66 was a man of all seasons. now where GBU is and that film is (am not trying to disparage 'man of all seasons'). GBU is been the inspiration of film makers all around the world and still lives in the heart of film makers. after seeing this film i became a fan of Leone and collected all his films, but still i believe this is his best work. some movies fade away from our memories but some would live in our memories for ever, this is the best of them...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>like Lawrence of Arabia, I saw this in infomercial free late nite TV. Sometimes in French, sometimes in English. At times, the lip synch is distracting, but so is the drama - or melowesterndrama. part of that is the civil war sub theme and the swelling orchestral music (not to compare with the mother of them all - Once upon a time in the West), but to a teenage boy, the opening score can instill a myth.And what a meandering, and nicely drag out story too - stole away entirely by Eli Wallach's sinister laugh and squinty eyes, imitating Clint's ? It's more like siesta western in my opinion, long lazy, hot and dirty (the dusty feel) that is.All culminating in a tense 3 way stand-off and a humorous ending. Man, that is an gutsy ending. this is movie made for pre-teenage boys - fluffy, heroic, funny and a bit of smarts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many here have already said what can you say that hasn't been said over the years about this film.Made in 1966 (67) it has weathered the years and still today holds any top ten slot for spaghetti westerns of any decade the world over. Very few films can hold a candle to the Good the Bad and the Ugly. Few indeed can say after 50 years we made a brilliant film that is still loved by millions. This is truly a great film. One of my favorite westerns that sits proudly in my collection right beside "Once upon a time in the West", "My name is Nobody." and well "Two mules for sister Sara", and a hand full of others with Clint staring as the Bad bleep gun fighter he is.Absolutely beautiful in all regards. My two cents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the uninitiated, "spaghetti western" is the nickname given to a series of films by emergent directors who originated from Italy after World War II. Also, they were westerns. But there's nothing distinctly Italian about spaghetti westerns... except maybe the flair for spectacular overacting.As a genre, it reached its peak in the mid-60s, even though it was still relatively young at the time. Today it's misunderstood, made fun of, or loved. Which is okay: that makes it like just about every other genre of film, thus validating its cultural significance.None of the spaghetti westerns are more significant, though, than Sergio Leone's. His Man with No Name Trilogy is much beleaguered and loved today, as is the underwhelming Once Upon a Time in the West, a film most memorable for featuring Henry Fonda as a villain. But of the Trilogy, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly -- the third installment that is actually the most basic of the three -- is something miraculous. The movie's tagline was "For three men, the Civil War wasn't Hell -- it was practice!" While that may seem like a silly tagline, the movie is not: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, Dr. Strangelove, and Pulp Fiction each go down in my book as the greatest cool movies of all time.But you may be asking: how does a western, shot in Spain with an entire cast speaking only Spanish except for the principle three stars, directed by an Italian with a fetish for the Civil War, with hardly any dialogue and a plot with more holes in it than the fishnet your local deli makes its employees wear -- well, how does that work? Quite simply... I don't know. I just know that The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is one of the best times I've ever had watching a movie. The plot revolves around $200,000 in gold coins. Blondie (Clint Eastwood, and "the Good" in the title) is after it, as are Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef, "the Bad") and Tuco (Eli Wallach, "the Ugly"). That's the plot. Yeah, really.Sergio Leone is famous for his camera direction, his quick cut close-ups with alternating wide shots. Here is no different. In fact, it's remarkable to note how few regular shots are used -- or, if they are more common than I perceived, how well the close-ups and wide shots are executed so as to draw attention to themselves.Equally famous is the way in which Leone could drag out a showdown. While nothing in this film quite matches the incredible 15-minute standoff from Once Upon a Time in the West, it is still fun to watch the final sequence, as the three square off to see who would live long enough to find the gold coins.But more than these trademarks -- how about that score? Ennio Morricone, whose work is vastly under-appreciated and is pigeonholed too easily, created a theme here that is simultaneously catchy, memorable, and chilling.So maybe that's it. What makes The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly work is the expressive combination of the genius of each individual, wildly-varying ingredient of this pasta gumbo. It looks awful on paper, but, heh, so did The White Album, and we all know how that turned out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good, The Bad And The Ugly: One of the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once every few years, a movie pops up that thousands or maybe even millions consider to be one of the best films ever made. The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is definitely one of those few. Blondie (Clint Eastwood), Tuco (Eli Wallach) and Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) are three men who are in search of gold coins that are buried in a cemetery. However, each man only knows a certain amount of information as to where the gold is and are therefore dependent on each other.The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is an incredibly suspenseful movie and will have you on the edge of your seat throughout. The action scenes are top-notch and really kick in the tension. The famous showdown at the cemetery seriously had me guessing as to what the hell was going to happen to the point of being wide-eyed and I'm sure that it's the most suspenseful scene in cinema history.Although Clint Eastwood gives an excellent performance as Blondie, it's Eli Wallach who shines as Tuco. The audience has a strange, ever-changing relationship with his character. At some points (mainly early on) we hate his guts and at other points we love him and can't get enough of him. He actually had me laughing quite a few times such as when he takes a desperate but brilliant measure to break free from his handcuffs. I won't ruin it for you, but it involves a train.Even if you haven't seen the movie, you WILL recognise its theme tune. Ennio Morricone's music is one of the best things about The Good, The Bad And The Ugly and its theme tune is certainly among the greatest of all time.The thing that amazed me about the film is that it keeps you entertained and interested throughout its three hour length. Films this long tend to get boring after a while and you eventually just lose interest, but TGTBATU will make you ask for more. Anyway, more to love.I haven't seen the movie's predecessors A Fistful Of Dollars and For A Few Dollars More. I've heard good things about them, but I have to say that it would take A LOT for them to be better than this cinematic masterpiece.The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is one of the best movies ever made and is also one of my favourite films. I give it 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion this is one of the best movies ever made. this movie helped to define westerns to the new culture. Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach, and Lee Van Cleef all provide outstanding performances and this is a movie that will always remain a legend and was before its time. The score to this movie, which was composed by ennio Morricone, is excellently done and fits seamlessly into the film. I highly recommend seeing this movie at least once. The scene near the end of the film when Tuco runs through the grave yard is a masterpiece as well as during the final shootout, when all you see are there eyes yet that is all you need to see to get the perfect mood for the film. If you enjoyed this movie i recommend you watch the other two of the dollars trilogy and "Duck You Sucker" and "Once Upon a Time in The West". Sergio Leone has made many great westerns and has helped to shape the western genre we know and love today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Good, The Bad and the Ugly is a triumph of film-making for director Sergio Leone.Visually the sets, costumes, cinematography are all top notch creating some stunning scenes. The highlight being a fully realized civil war battle and dusty representations of frontier towns.Performance wise Clint Eastwood plays the part he was born for. Lee Van Cleef relishes his part as the bad Angel Eyes. Finally, there is Eli Wallach as Tuco the ugly who is cunning and opportunistic. Eli is very amusing in his reactions and is focused on getting the hidden treasure.The Showdown is the classic Mexican shootout. Three gunfighters face off, the music kicks in, close ups, and then the deadly finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Il Buono! Il Brutto! Il Cattivo! Indeed, there isn't a lot of bad to be talked about. And ugly certainly isn't the word. But good, now you're on to something. If there was any doubt that a western could be regarded as a truly great film, 'The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly' solves that problem. And though it is without question one of the greatest westerns ever made, Sergio Leone's masterpiece is also one of the greatest crime dramas to be told. An epic rendering where the landscapes and score play as much of a role as do the actors, this spaghetti western is still today a suspenseful and glorious work of extreme art.A haunting story about three men brought together in unlikely ways in their search for a dead man's golden treasure, there's a brutal and gritty feel about the film as it drops us in the middle of a barren and dry landscape. Raw, but also indescribably beautiful. Sergio Leone paints his canvas both with grand shots that appreciate the vastness of nature, and devastating close-ups for a first-hand point of view. Leone simultaneously puts both styles to practice, and with electrifying results. Yes it's long, but there's a passion within this story that deserves to be told. And like all great filmmakers, Leone doesn't simply tell us. He shows us.Long before his Oscar-winning days, Clint Eastwood ('The Good') reminded us what a simple facial expression can do. With Leone's personal close-ups that allow us to see every bit of his sun-blistered face, Eastwood skillfully leads 'The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly' with that piercing gaze that's both menacing and pure. Eli Wallach's ('The Ugly') performance is just as good, if not better. Bringing a fierce two-headedness to his character, you're never quite sure what direction he's going to run with. It ups the suspense, adds to the fascination. The characters here aren't merely cardboard cut-outs, but complex and unpredictable people with different motives and different intentions. And when they're all together, expect fireworks.But above the actors, more powerful than the scenery, there is one who reigns supreme. Ennio Morricone's haunting score is one of the single-most recognizable products in cinematic history, and it gives 'The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly' a bite that would be sorely missing otherwise. Absolutely brilliant, it makes Leone's picture an unforgettable experience that captivates us, 3-hour running time and all. A sprawling Civil War era epic that takes its ideas about money and greed and power and betrayal and friendship and intertwines them all together in a cool, collected piece of work. An improbable masterpiece of sorts, but a profoundly rich one that deserves to be seen in all its intended beauty.More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&amp;view=public</fullReview>

Sergeo Leone did a wonderful job on this film,, the music done by Ennino Marconi,, is timeless also... Lee Van Cleef is excellent as "Angel Eyes",, Tuco,, played by Eli Wallach is very funny and wonderful to watch,, Clint, well he's just Clint playing it up as "the man with no name",, you gotta love it,, the story is about 3 guys who try to get to a box full of money,, in a cemetery and all they have to go through to get it.. Clint saves "Tuco numerous times throughout the movie,, and Tuco,, never fully appreciates it,, as he almost kills of Clint,, but no fear that don't happen cause then there wouldn't be a movie right,,, This movie is so great, the length is long though,, but the ending is well worth it,, and i think that's what makes the movie a perfect 10 for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sergio Leones "The good, the bad, and the ugly" is one of the greatest films ever made. It's funny, sad, brutal, intelligent and everything that a movie could ever want, or hope, to be.The directing: Every camera angle seems perfect. The camera catches emotions in extreme closeups, and shows the startling beauty of the landscape in huge panning shots. It's the perfect mix of Closeups, and landscape shots. The camera never seems to be in the wrong place, and ever movement is exciting and stylish.The plot: This movie isn't very plot based, and Sergio seems to be more interested in how the characters react to situations, instead of being interested in those actual situations. Yet this doesn't hurt the movie one bit. In fact, it frees up the plot, and allows the viewer to fully enjoy the movie's style without being hampered with the plot. Occationally, Sergio indulges himself in a few side plots that maybe break the pace a tiny bit, but generally work with everything. To take those out would seriously diminish with the beauty of the film. The plot is atypical for western movies, but you don't really worry about it being cheese or not because the movie doesn't dwell on plot points.The characters and acting: The good (clint Eastwood) is a flawed bounty hunter. There is a certain irony in his performance, as even "the good" is imperfect. Eastwood's Man with No Name performance is incredible, and he manages to be cool and slick in any situation. The bad (lee van chleef) is brilliant character because he makes the other two seem like little floating angels. Angel eyes is heartless, and the epitome of pure evil. The ugly (eli wallach) is immoral and disgusting, but strangely likable. Eli Wallach gives a brilliant performance, that sometimes threatens to outshine the other actors (this never happens though).The music: There are not enough good words in the world to describe the music. It is beautiful, heartbreaking, heroic, and magical. The use of yodeling and electric guitar combine perfectly to make probably the most unforgettable theme song yet.Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to see a good spaghetti movie, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is probably the move you're thinking of.3 sides, 3 people, 1 excellent film.The Good: Clint Eastwood plays Blondie, who is quite possibly the most interesting person to ever grace a Western movie. Blondie is so mysterious, laid back, quiet, sly, sneaky, and tricky. But at the same time, he does what he knows is right, and will not rip anyone off unless they had it coming.The Bad: Lee Van Cleef plays Angel Eyes, who is quick to show that he is the bad guy. Angel Eyes is very educated, well-connected, sly, and very determined. Angel Eyes pulls a lot of strings to get what he wants, and will stay on task until it is done.The Ugly: Eli Wallach plays Tuco, a sleazy, sniveling, thief. Tuco is very sneaky, and usually will steal from almost anyone, including his own partners. However, as evil as Tuco is, he also has a good side. He does occasionally do what is right. Although it is sometimes still in his own benefit, he will still go out of his way to do it. And this cross between good and bad is what makes Tuco such an interesting and well-liked character.The story is very winding, but in a good way. Some parts make you wonder if you are still watching a spaghetti movie or not.With a long (but still very interesting) plot, great characters, and many excellent scenes, The Good, the Bad and The Ugly is sure to please western fans of all kinds. The movie deserves its place at #4 on IMDb's top 250 (as of 5/9/08).10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood is truly the man. This takes place in 1862, out west where men would carry guns everywhere and no one screwed around. This is back when men were men, bitches were bitches, and the fags were eliminated. Today if you were out there, half the population would be killed for not being manly enough HAHA. But anyway, this film depicts life back in those days and it is very exciting to watch. What could be more entertaining than seeing a real man like Clint Eastwood shoot up some dirty Mexicans?? Lee Van Cleef is also in this movie - great actor. This movie to this day still astounds me. The only flaw I have with this movie is that it is longer than it should be, and does tend to get boring. I remember back when I saw it in the movies when I was a little kid, my dad came in drunk stood up and yelled "THERE Ain't ENOUGH GODDAMN KILLIN IN THIS MOVIE!" But I look back now at this movie, and I still enjoy just as much as I did when I was a kid. Clint Eastwood was and always will be a true American hero.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Philosophy and art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With more than 40 pages of reviews, what can I add? Let me focus on a few sides I haven't read about. The first one is philosophy. Movies, which aspire to be philosophical usually are boring and pompous. Probably Leone did not have such ambitions. Still philosophy - together with myth and religion, as pointed out by others - plays an important role. Since the antique times of the Greeks and Romans philosophers ask themselves the question: how can one lead a virtuous life in difficult circumstances? The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is Leone's answer. There is no doubt about the Bad (Lee van Cleef). His name Angel Eyes must refer to the Fallen Angel, as he represents Evil. I don't know Italian, but I would not be surprised if the correct translation of Il Brutto should have been the Hypocrite. Tuco's (Eli Wallach) ways are ugly, only doing good when it is in his own interest. But what about the Good (Clint Eastwood)? His name, Blondie, refers to medieval characters like the Lady in the Tower with the Golden Hair, or Siegfried from the Nibelungen saga. Blondie certainly does not represent good the way all religions would like to see it. He is cynical, mean, ruthless, violent. He only shows compassion when he can afford it. I think the final scene of the movie gives the answer: in a lawless world being virtuous means being in a position of power and then apply a rudimentary kind of justice. Can anyone assume, that Tuco will have nice memories of Blondie? We can turn this argument around. If Blondie is good, what kind of world is he living in? I guess, we all must be grateful to live in an orderly society and not in a free for all.Wagner developed the concept of Gesamtkunst, something like Total Art, for opera. He meant, that every element of the project should cooperate in harmony to achieve the final result. Leone has realised this concept with his GBU. Read the other reviews: every single detail contributes to the movie. The close ups already have been mentioned many times. They demand superb underacting, as we must read the emotions of the characters by small changes in their facial expressions.Luigi Pistilli as the monk and Tuco's brother deserves to be mentioned especially. He is the voice of religious morals and gives us a ray of hope in a very dark world. Pistilli is excellent, like in For a few dollars more and Death rides a horse.Still GBU is not the best movie ever imo. I'd like to mention Seven Samurai (Kurosawa), Le clan des Siciliens (Verneuil), Le samourai (Melville), A clockwork orange (Kubrick), Monsieur Klein (Losey), Autumn Sonata (Bergmann) and La dentilliere (Goretta). Note that three of these see Alain Delon; I think there are several similarities with Clint Eastwood. You will probably ask: how can you compare? You are right, it's just my personal taste. GBU still falls in the categorie extra-ordinaire, with the aforementioned movies and titles like Lola (Fassbinder), Vertigo (Hitchcock), Smiles of a Summer night (Bergmann)and For a few dollars more (Leone). As Leone has directed another few very good ones, he is one of the directors, who have proved that a movie can be a piece of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Ageless Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watching it right now for the first time, i'd honestly would have a hard time believing this was made back in 1966. This is probably for the simple fact of the matter that Sergio Leone and his crew were thinking way ahead of their time, a method of thinking and shooting that critics couldn't even comprehend at the time.Fortunately, the audience did. And the audience has grown stronger as the decades rolled by.While I can't say the climax was as great as I thought it was going to be, everything else is rock solid. My favorite parts were in the beginning, the shots and scenery chosen by Leone were nothing short of perfect. The trademark extreme closeups look as stylish today as they did four decades ago, a trademark that Quentin Tarantino later used in his breakthrough hit "Pulp Fiction".The story itself is simple, but simplicity is always a good thing. Three bandits (Angel Eyes - Bad, Blondie - Good, and Tuco - Ugly) cross paths and double cross each other all in search of a common goal: hidden treasure. And that's pretty much it, everything else in between is very good filler and bits of character development (most notably for Tuco). Though I wished the Civil War bits were more interesting and the climax was better, it all doesn't ruin the rest of the film (which is nothing but greatness).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ted Turner's favorite film, and mine (and a whole lotta others').</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(NOTE added, April '07: Since writing a review on this film, I've been paying close attention to references and allusions to it in other films; I will now make a tentative assertion: this film is the single most influential commercial film in cinema history. Literally hundreds of films make allusion to it or attempt to imitate it - films made in Hollywood, Japan, China, the Phillipines, India, Mexico, Argentina, Germany, France; both commercial films and offbeat independents; comedies, "B" sci-fi movies, and "A" suspense dramas; films by hacks and films by recognized masters. On top of that, the film really redefined how actors are photographed, how dialog is written, how scenes are shot and edited, the whole narrative structuring of a motion picture, and the composition of soundtracks. Not bad for a "spaghetti western", huh?)(First review, June '06:) Some readers may remember that, in the year before he at last surrendered control of the Turner Broadcasting Network, Turner had this film played once a week, with hardly any commercial breaks. Now that's love for you.This is definitely a "guy" film, which means that it doesn't do justice to 51% of its potential audience. However, it is as close to perfection as any guy film could possibly get.I would add most of the original Italian release additional footage available on the DVD. But this is one of the films not a frame of which can be cut without serious damage.How did Leone accomplish this? It is largely due to his close cooperation with Ennio Morricone, the finest Western composer after WWII. Although they were not to perfect their working relationship until Once Upon a Time in the West, the opening sequence of this film - where the yelp of a coyote is heard in the same tones as the whistle of the title music - announces that we are here to enjoy as many of our senses as film can reach, and in a manner just coordinated enough that we can allow ourselves to be swept along without concern for time.I will also say this: Until recently (for reasons I shan't get into), I have been a pacifist most of my life. It happens to have been this film that convinced me that war is a "waste of good men", as Eastwood's character remarks.Which reminds me to remind my reader - this is not a Western - it's a war movie; an anti-war movie. And far more powerful, as such, than all the crappy "anti-war" movies Hollywood churned out to please the hippies in the '60s.The "hippies" ended up voting for Bush's fiasco in Iraq. Clint Eastwood, despite his conservative politics, has (as a filmmaker) become obsessed with the horror of violence, and the hope that somehow we can rise above it. Me too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinematic masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' (TGBU) is quite a unique film. On paper it sounds like it could be a boring, arduous task to sit and watch this film: a 3-hour long story of a few bandits chasing the same treasure. But there's so much more to it than just that. TGBU is the final part of Sergio Leone's 'Dollar Trilogy' and if you've seen the previous two films, TGBU seems a lot more polished. Similar elements seen and heard in the first two films are used in TGBU, but to greater effect, producing a truly unforgettable experience. I remember watching this film many times when I was about 8 or 9 years old and loving it back then, and I hadn't really seen it since then, until I was 23. Seeing this film again was such a joyful experience for several reasons: the soundtrack - often the part of a film that's overlooked, not so here (Ennio Morricone - bravo. Multo bravo); the fantastically-executed telling of the story (gets better on repeated viewing); the ending - still can bring a tear to my eyes (rare for me) just because of the tense drama produced here; the dialogue; the cinematography - still very unique, even though some directors have tried to use similar techniques, none have really produced a film of similar overall quality.The only downside here is the sexual politics of the film, and of all the 'Dollars' films it has to be said: there aren't many women in this film at all. On t'other hand though, for the purposes of the story, it wouldn't've made much sense to put more women in just for the sake of having more women in the film. The ideas behind the story cater for a mainly male cast: the time it was set in, the shenanigans of the main characters. Watch TGBU and you'll understand what I mean, I hope.Go on. I dare you not to be enraptured by the story, visual effects and soundtrack of this film. A masterpiece in cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You see, in this world there's two kinds of people, my friend:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those who loved Il Buono, il brutto, il cattivo and those who haven't seen it yet. I loved it...I believe I'm quite a movie fan and I've always been told it was a shame I didn't see this movie. It's only when I saw it a year ago that I understood why. The broadcast was poor, it was late, dubbed and cut several times by commercials (in France, this is hopefully seldom) but oh my God did I enjoy the film.Everything in this movie is exciting. As soon as the opening credits begin, you know you're gonna watch a great flick; the acting is marvelous to me: Clint Eastwood represents exactly the cow-boy you always picture in your head when you're a kid but that's precisely because this character has set a landmark in the movie-making history. Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef are just as good.The script is quite different from other westerns too: it's not just about revenge or save a city from bad guys, the story leans over deeper human feelings: greed, friendship, national pride. The characters are far more intricate than in other westerns I've seen, you never know what really motivates them and, which is to me the best: the Good guy isn't always good, the Bad guy isn't as bad as you could imagine, and the Ugly guy might be the most attaching gangster I've known. The dialogs will always be remembered: in this movie, the three guys shoot more with words than with guns and you cannot believe the amount of lines about which you will think "Gosh, I wish I could tell one of these." The movie might seem a little long but to me, it was worth traveling through the Wild West in the middle of the Civil War considering the last but one scene. The final shooting is so intense, the stake is so high and most of all, for the first time since the beginning of the movie you can really listen to (and not just hear) the incredible score by Ennio Morricone. Besides, I recognized the music from the Kill Bill 2 trailer but it took me a long time to recollect where I heard it before. Anyway, the last half hour of movie is magic and I could watch it in any language, in any conditions and still enjoy it.If you've not seen this movie yet, watch it as soon as possible, I promise you will love it (or at least you could shine on every one on "how much you didn't like Il Buono, il brutto, il cattivo"). As far as I am concerned, I still wonder how I could live without it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leone's Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no doubt in my mind that this is the best film ever made. And probably the best that ever will be made. Sergio Leone's absolute masterpiece.It is often said that "Fistful of Dollars" was Clint Eastwood's show, "For a Few Dollars More" stolen by Lee Van Cleef, with Eli Wallach the main man in "The Good the Bad and the Ugly" . Well Clint and Cleef are, as always, really cool in this movie. But yes, Wallach outclasses them both, as small time bandit - "the Ugly" Tuco. That said, the interplay between Clint's "Blondie", Cleef's "Angel Eyes" and Wallach is great, and one of the highlights of the film.The Almeria landscape has never looked better. As rugged and barren as the face of Al Mulock that sidesteps into the frame at the beginning of the film. And never has a soundtrack been more suited to a movie than Morricone's now famous score. Ayeeayeeeahhh! Particularly superb during Tuco's dash through the graves at Sad Hill near the climax of the film, and the pulsating music that builds and builds for the final confrontation.But what I love most is the way that the character's paths' cross by such a small chance of fate. And progressing from one double cross, to another double cross, to the gunfight of all gunfights! And there are so many touching moments in this movie too. Tuco's conversation with his brother, Father Ramirez; Blondie passing his cigar to the dying soldier; the look on the dying Captain's face as the bridge is blown up.The film has been further enhanced with the inclusion of extra scenes, with Eastwood and Wallach adding their voices, and Cleef's provided by a character actor. Although the voices have obviously aged, the inclusion of these restored scenes benefits the film ever further.If a better movie is ever made (not a chance) it will have to be one helluva flick! Ayeeayeeeahhh!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest westerns of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly elevates the "western" to a level of art that I don't think John Ford could have even predicted. Not to take anything away from John Ford, but Leone brought a style to audiences in his "spaghetti westerns" that no one else could have thought possible. He stays true to the rugged, gritty feel of American westerns, but his obvious inspiration from Kurosawa's samurai films, and Leone's own personal style come together in a fascinating way that I feel is too individualistic for anyone else to have created. The characters in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly seem so alive, so rich and developed. It all seems so real that watching this can make you feel like you have stumbled upon another world, and certainly, another way of life, that has been going on forever, and will continue on long after you have left. Clint Eastwood's iconic performance as Blondie is brilliant. His unflinching confidence in every move he makes tells you right away that this is not a man to be trifled with. He never cracks under pressure, and he seems to have such a tight grasp of every situation that one would be a fool NOT to side with him. Blondie is every bit as cool, calm, and collected as Humphrey Bogart's Sam Spade in the Maltese Falcon, and also every bit as rewarding to watch! Lee Van Cleef is menacing as Angel Eyes, a bounty hunter who gives the impression that he never met a man who could come close to making him feel threatened. Then, there is Tuco, played by Eli Wallach. Tuco, as dastardly as he is, serves as the comic relief, which is important in a film like this that is filled with tension (the montage in the cemetery is classic!). This movie has action, suspense, drama, and humor, all of which are flavored with Ennio Morricone's famous score and the brilliant cinematography of Tonino Delli Colli. I have not seen enough of Leone's films to say that this is his best, but I can say that this is an excellent film, worthy of all of the praise it has received since its release!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best, Bold And The Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best movies that I've ever seen. Before seeing the movie I was sceptical whether it would turn out to be one of the typical Western movies of the 60's. The type on which the bad guys get the heroine and the hero goes and does some cool bit of shooting to save the day for his love, and the movie. But this was totally different from the other movies.Clint Eastwood does his bit of the Western star. He steals away the show from Tuco (The Ugly). The movie is set in a background of the civil war plaguing America. The villain "Angel Eyes" (The Bad) is looking for a loot, which is hidden by a certain Jackson whose alibi is Bill Carson. Incidentally Carson dies whilst fighting in the war and he tells the secret of the hiding place to partly Tuco and partly to "Blondie" (The Good). The two go across the country facing the soldiers, and braving the fiery desert and fighting their mutual distrust to the hiding place. The movie has plenty of funny comments and plenty of action. It must be mentioned of the excellent camera work and the superb shooting locations bringing out the scenes and creating a permanent image in the viewer's mind. Lastly Ennio Morricone deserves an applause for his mind blowing music. His theme for the movie and the instrumental played during the graveyard sequence (aptly titled "Ecstasy Of Gold") is mind blowing.Overall this movie is damn worth Ten Stars. Watch it Now!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic That is The Greatest Spaghetti Western of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" not only is a classic, the greatest spaghetti Western of all time (edging out Sergio Leone's own "For a Few Dollars More" (1965), but is remains a remarkable cultural artifact, one of the watershed films of the 1960s. The combination of violence, amorality and black humor set the tone for a generation of films to come, a pedigree shared with the Sean Connery James Bond films.Eli Wallach is outstanding "in the role of Tuco." In fact, it could be argued that this is really his film, as he is on screen longer than Clint Eastwood. Wallach's Tuco is one of the great screen performances, in all its vital, overblown vulgarity (and as we can see with the best performances of Laurence Olivier and Marlon Brando, genius in acting often skirts the boundaries of vulgarity). A brilliant performance in a brilliant film. Aside from Leone's outstanding direction, Wallach is the engine that drives this masterpiece down the rails into cinematic immortality!Eastwood is Eastwood The Icon, the great star of the post-John Wayne era. Clint's interactions with Wallach's Tuco are wonderful. Lee Van Cleef makes an outstanding villain as Angel Eyes.Not to be missed by any student of the cinema! Tonino Delli Colli's cinematography is a text book example of how to shoot a widescreen film, equal to the great Academy Award-winning work of Jack Hildyard and Freddie Young in David Lean's "The Bridge on the River Kwai" (1957) and "Lawrence of Arabia (1962), respectively.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My single favorite movie of all time (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As such, it's impossible for me to be objective about it: I've seen it (in it's entirety or bits and pieces of it) about 30 times, and every time I see it I notice something new. I saw it recently at a local revival house. This was the first time I ever saw it in a theater and the movie, I'm convinced, really needs to be seen on the big screen to be properly appreciated: Leone sets up some really masterful compositions, but you need a big screen to appreciate them (I'm thinking of the stand-off in the cemetery and the final ride in particular, although there are many such moments).This time through I was particularly struck by Wallach's performance as Tuco, "The Ugly". Easily the best thing Wallach ever did, he lifts the movie, and it's usually in the little things: robbing a store owner but at the last minute giving him back his bottle of whiskey, the pink parasol he's carrying as he goes through the desert with Blondie, brushing his teeth with bathwater. Through such small little gestures Wallach gives you a character who's sort of the Id principle gone wrong: he's all Life, but a spoiled sort of Life. I saw the restored version. Personally, as a long-time fan of the movie, while I was glad to have the scenes added it didn't alter my opinion of the movie at all: the new scenes are very small, and mostly add small amounts of plot information.There's always a few people who haven't seen anything. If you've missed this, by all means catch it: it's on the relatively short list of absolute must-see movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tarantino was right!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I had wanted to see Sergio Leone's Dollars trilogy for a long time, it was the "cinematically perfect" quote from Quentin Tarantino on the front of the box that got me to shell out for the new Special Edition DVD (in the UK) of The Good, The Bad And The Ugly. And I can tell you now-Tarantino wasn't wrong! A Fistful Of Dollars and For A Few Dollars More are excellent films in their own right, but The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is more than just an excellent film-it is a major artistic achievement. The reasons for this permeate every aspect of the film.Starting with the obvious, the acting is wonderful, both on the parts of the actors themselves and also the voice artists. Clint Eastwood has come under some criticism for his supposedly "wooden" portrayal of the Man With No Name, but the character description is of a laconic, taciturn mystery man and there's only so much you can do with that. Lee Van Cleef is one of the coolest and scariest villains of all time, while Eli Wallach's "lovable rogue" portrayal of the Mexican bandit Tuco makes a welcome change from the "psychopathic killer" that Gian Maria Volonte had played in the two prequels. Special mention at this point goes to the voice artist used to dub the scenes starring Lee Van Cleef that weren't dubbed while he was still alive, having been added for the Special Edition. He gets the voice absolutely spot on. Also of note is the alcoholic Union Captain who strikes the perfect balance between wry humour and despair.The cinematography is breathtaking. Leone's trademark style was to mix extreme close ups with extreme long shots, which is taken to a spectacular extreme here and gives the film a huge sense of scale. The very first shot of the film, in fact, is both a close up and a long shot at the same time. The faces Leone chooses to zoom in on are, shall we say, interesting to look at, as well. While the build up to scenes of violence is long and intense, the violence itself is for the most part short and sharp. The film is therefore extremely tense. The one extended scene of violence, Tuco's torture, is transformed by the juxtaposition of the orchestra playing a slow lament outside-the sight of the young musician crying in the knowledge of what is happening behind closed doors is a haunting moment. The rather flashy cinematography comes to a head at the film's climax in the graveyard, culminating in the single most perfect shot in cinema history. I won't reveal it as I loathe spoilers, but it's there.Good scenes are made better by a wonderful score by the ever-dependable Ennio Morricone. The rousing 'Ecstasy Of Gold' transforms Tuco's sprint through the graveyard into a scene so beautiful it hurts, and 'The Trio' does the same for the climax. As for the title theme...well, everyone's heard it so I won't waste time talking about it, except to say that even if you thought you hated it you'll end up loving it. Ennio Morricone stated that he tried to reflect the film's "larger-than-life" quality. Indeed, there are some moments that are somewhat surreal. These range from the obvious ("the good", "the bad" and "the ugly" appearing in brightly coloured letters next to the characters' faces) to the subtle (the insane fight over the bridge and the state of the soldiers). The film is at the same time unreal and grittily realistic, to great effect.Several questions have been asked about the film. Firstly, there is the question of whether or not Clint Eastwood plays the same character throughout all three films. I say no: looking at it like that causes continuity problems. Plus, if Eastwood is the same character in all three films, then what about the other actors who appeared in the other films like Lee Van Cleef, Luigi Pistilli and especially Mario Brega, who dies in all three films? "The Man With No Name" is a marketing exercise, post-modernism before the term was invented. One thing I do agree with is the softening of Eastwood's character-although you have to do more than play with a kitten to come across as a goodie in my book, the tending to a dying soldier and the famous quotation "never seen so many men wasted so badly" make Blondie much more human than either Joe or Monco. Also, some have said that the film is a Christian allegory. There are scenes to support this, such as the prisoner being made to carry his coffin to his place of execution, but these scenes are unconnected both to each other and to the main plot and thus this claim is a somewhat dubious one. The film has entered my top ten at number two, not quite dislodging Pulp Fiction. Nevertheless, it is a beautiful piece of work and anyone who worked on it should feel justly proud. If you don't believe me, believe Quentin Tarantino.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Italian Opera You Won't Nod Off To</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are few films that have gained in stature over the decades as this one has. It's looking more and more like the latter 20th century's answer to "Citizen Kane," a film that influenced young directors with its style and technique while managing to be popular with the public. More so, in some respects, because "Citizen Kane" was not the same sort of successful popular entertainment as was "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly."If you haven't seen the movie, you may think you know the story, but you don't. There's this fellow named Tuco (Eli Wallach) who always finds himself on the wrong side of the law. He gets himself a partner, a silent type named Blondie (Clint Eastwood), and they go into business collecting bounties for Tuco and skipping town until Blondie leaves Tuco in the desert, vowing revenge. Meanwhile, weasel-eyed nasty Angeleyes (Lee Van Cleef) is hot on the trail of a fellow going by the name of Carson, part of the Confederate Army of the West, who knows something about $200,000 in gold coin. Meanwhile, all around, the American Civil War rages on.Rest assured this all comes together, in a way that feels as natural as sunshine on a dog's bottom. The arresting thing about this film is how fresh and clever the journey is in getting there. It's not just cinema, but mega-cinema, the way every scene flows effortlessly into the next, while not one frame feels tired or overused. One worries a little about the new DVD that adds 20 minutes of footage. You can't improve on perfection. But the fact that this movie was ruthlessly edited after its Italian premiere for U.S. distribution suggests that this might be the one time a classic is actually improved on by such additions.It's the ultimate guy's movie. There's not even a trace of a romance, unless you count Carson's whore. But it's a very philosophical film, too, even sensitive in a cleverly perverse way. The title, really one of the best movie titles ever, sets up an interesting premise that we see delivered in corkscrew fashion in the movie. Sure, Angeleyes is bad, and Tuco ugly in his morally conflicted manner, shooting people in cold blood and then making the sign of the cross as if to appease divine judgment. But Blondie as good? When we first see him, he's murdering three bounty hunters who just captured an outlaw and were preparing to bring him to justice. His treatment of Tuco, however enjoyable in its sadistically jolly way, is not good in any sense of the word.But we do see growth in this man of few words, a sense of appreciation for the moral stands life allows us to take. He is concerned enough to ask about Tuco's fate in his first encounter with Angeleyes, and by the end of the movie, we've seen him show real concern for the senseless victims of war. The film works by throwing up a hard-edged tone of cruelty it never lets go of, but there's an undertone that posits something better, which leads to a conclusion that is one of filmdom's best.What else is great? What isn't? Every line is a classic, especially Tuco's, like "There are two kinds of spurs, my friend..." and "If you're going to shoot, shoot, don't talk." There are some welcome faces from other parts of the Dollars trilogy, especially the indefatigable heavy Mario Brega as Corporal Wallace, who has one of the nastiest moments (beating Tuco) and then one of its funniest (when Tuco complains "I can't while you're watching" while trying to relieve himself in the boxcar).It's impossible to overstate how good a movie this is. The only negative is that it's too long, but that very same quality is what makes it so enjoyable to watch over again. It's not even my favorite Sergio Leone film (that would be "For A Few Dollars More"), but it's not only his best film, it's one of the best films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So good, it killed the genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Minor spoiler at the end of this review)Americans love Westerns.At least, we used to. The film era began just as the American frontier was closing, and it's only natural that the cinema took its place. Without a frontier to explore, a certain part of the American identity vanished. So we turned to film.So why is it that until "Unforgiven" won the Oscar in '92, the American Western had all but disappeared from mainstream film? Some might tell you that sci-fi took its place ("Space, the final frontier"). Others might say that we simply lost interest in the subject. The truth is that Leone (not even an American!) created such a masterpiece here that he practically killed the genre. He didn't just raise the bar. He lifted it into the stratosphere. Is it any wonder that other filmmakers were afraid to follow in his footsteps?What makes this film so good, you ask? What DOESN'T??? The locales and landscapes are amazing. The set design is incredible. The score (like anything from Ennicione) is a work of art. The writing is superb. The directing: masterful. The acting? Out of this world. Wallach, Van Cleef, and Eastwood couldn't have been more perfect for their parts. Eastwood especially. It's ironic that his character ("The man with no name", otherwise known as "Blondie") is referred to as "The Good" considering that all three of them seem to lack any true morals or ethics. But that's part of what makes his performance so impressive. Just like Pacino did in "The Godfather", Eastwood gives us a man that brings out our sympathy and empathy without truly being a "protagonist" in the classic sense of the word. Logically, there's no reason why we should root for him over the other guys, but we can't stop ourselves. Leone knows this, and seems to intentionally drive the point home with the climax when he breaks The Cardinal Rule of Westerns: The "good guy" NEVER shoots first.Every movie fan needs to see this, ESPECIALLY those that "don't like" westerns.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie first time when I was may be 15. I enjoyed it that time. And I really don't know how many times I have seen this movie again and again. A perfect movie. Each shot is without any mistake. I love each shot of this movie. Sergio has taken 200% of all the characters in movie. Unforgettable close-ups, sets, music, acting and direction is nothing but the core of this movie. Try to recall demolition of bridge! My all time favorite character is Tuco, what a greedy character, I haven't seen such a character in any movie. Tuco gargles his mouth with water in desert, spitts in his hand and then puts his wet hand on his face, just to protect himself from sun, I have never seen such acting or imagination in any movie. The way he says "Blondie dont die blondie" when he realized that blondie knows the name of grave. The way he eats with Angle eye when he gets caught. He doesn't eat until Angel eye eats from his plate, just to make sure that nothing is mixed (poison may be) in his food. And his expression " I know I know (food is clean) when Angel eye eats from his plate. The way he tries to convince Blondie in his priest brother's place. "Blondie we both are alone, you have me and I have you...... the way Tuco tries to get name of grave, it is unforgettable. And the way he joins Blondie again and kills Angel Eye's five men, he doesnt care about his own death when it comes to $200,000 gold coins. And finally he runs runs and runs in circle in semetary, that kind of scene is never seen before, again what an imagination of sergio and what an acting of Tuco. And in last shot 3 men with guns and gold coins, unbelievable. And finally Tuco with half gold, or half gold with Tuco. I have never seen characters like Blondie( a real hero) and Angel Eye( the greatest villain of all the time). Just recall your memory and see the way Angel eye looks at everybody, sharp look with sharp direction. This movie is a real tribute to cinema. You can learn so many things from it.God bless your soul Sergio</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Doesn't Get Any Better Than This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The greatest Western of all time, and most enjoyable movie I've ever seen. Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach are such a great duo. Eastwood is aloof and laid back while Wallach is emotional and over-the-top. This led to so many classic scenes and one-liners. For example, in the graveyard Tuco is frantically digging with his hands to get to the gold. Then Eastwood appears, tosses a shovel at Tuco, and calmly says "It'll be a lot easier with that."Lee Van Cleef plays the villian as well as it can be played. His introduction with the three murders and his "When I'm paid, I always see the job through" line was classic.The use of the civil war was brilliant. The Civil War was by far the most disastrous and devastating time in American history, but to Tuco, Blondie, and Angel Eyes it's just something to exploit and use to their advantage in pursuit of gold. The movie also made a nice anti-war statement without going overboard.The soundtrack is the best in cinema history. The opening theme immediately established that the movie was going to be something special. The theme and variations of it greatly added to the movie. Ecstasy of Gold is an absolute masterpiece, perfectly capturing Tuco's manic exhilaration at finally getting to the graveyard. The sad and laidback music during the war perfectly fit the scenes. The climatic gunfight could have never been pulled off without it's dramatic and perfected arranged music.There were hardly any women and no romance in the movie. That greatly added to the toughness and grittiness of the film. Blondie, Tuco, and Angel Eyes had no emotional dependacy on anyone, which is one of the main reasons why all three characters were so fantastic. 10/10</fullReview>

Eli Wallach is a dustball bandit, but no less evil than the other two.Visually this film works. The score is great, and eventhough it's repeated ad-nauseum, it still doesn't get annoying because of it's purpose, which is to punctuate the tremendous characters and their actions.The best is the way that Leone tells the story almost completely through visuals. The dialogue is fresh and badass. All these seedy characters need each other, yet they don't realize it until the end.Unnecessary Civil War subplot that drags this one out way past what it should be. Personal opinion. Well worth the hype however. A must see for anyone who takes films seriously and still likes to have fun watching them</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest Western every made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The good the bad and the ugly is in my opinion the greatest Western ever made and is the third part of the greatest trilogy ever made. That being "The Man with No Name" trilogy.Here we have three strong characters surviving for themselves and for survival sakes. They go through a common search for confederate gold. While they are doing this, all around them the world is going insane in one of the most brutal and bloodiest wars every. We are talking about the Civil War of course. Who are the Characters. They are the characters of the title of course;The Good - Clint Eastwood. A hired mercenary, who is tired of playing by the rules, because there are none. He kills other mercenaries, for the express intent of stealing their human bounty. He, like the other two goes through the film trying to get his hands on stolen confederate gold for the express purpose of personnel wealth. Yet he is good, because, like in the previous two films of the trilogy he has a conscience, and at times cares about his victims and at times makes decisions to have mercy. To me he represents God. He is silent and gives out vengeance like god. He is also merciful.The Bad - Lee Van Cleef. In a role completely cut off from his role in #2 of the series (For a few dollars more). He has the same purpose as the Good, but he has no morals at all. He has no pity, and enjoys his acts of giving pain to others. He represents the Devil. He is even called angel eyes. Remember the Satan is a fallen angel? The ugly - Eli Wallach. In his greatest role. Also goes through the film with the same purpose as the others. He is a thief and cold blooded killer. He has little pity and even less conscience. But he does not play out his actions out of joy, but rather for plain survival. Killing and stealing is all he knows, and he is played with and used in turn by both The Good (god) and the Bad (Satan). He represents the common man. This is also the reason that he is the most compelling character in the film.It is true that what I have said up to know sounds allegoric and surreal. But the beauty and greatness of this film, is that it is all done in the telling of a wonderful adventure full of action, humor and music. The great Marcone has composed his greatest score. Leone has directed a masterpiece. There are so many great and wonderful scenes here. The arrival of the white chariot like angels from heaven in the desert, which come to save our hero. The singing of the hymn while the ugly gets tortured. (Here there is a parable to the Holocaust. The moving through the bombed out town in a gunfight duel of hidden beauty. The blowing of the bridge while the army captain dies in bliss. The giving of the Cigar (symbol of friendship and god), to the dying soldier child. The running through the cemetery in blurred frenzy that gives the feelings of the sadness of all the young deaths of war (The Vietnam war was going on at the time and greatly influenced Leone).This movie is serious art film disguised as an action adventure.It is pure delight and one of the very greatest films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest western ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a reason this movie is rated the number one Western on imdb and that's because it is. Movie reviewers often misuse the word epic when describing films, but this movie defines epic. Three distinctly diverse characters (as the title implies), all amazing gunfighters, trek across the West with the Civil War in the backdrop heading for a huge stash of gold. Angel Eyes keeps us rooting for the good guys. Tuco keeps us entertained throughout the movie. And Clint Eastwood...well...it's Clint Eastwood (What else is there to say?).I'm not a huge fan of Westerns at all, but this movie is still one of the grandest stories ever told.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Couldn't be cooler if you stuck it in the snow in Alaska</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the coolest and most fun movies I've ever seen. From Lee Van Cleef's definition of evil, to Eli Wallach's brilliant and intense passion to Eastwood's ambivalent cool, this movie delivers all the way. Van Cleef is the picture of menace. His evil isn't explained, he's just 'bad' with no questions asked. Tuco is the epitome of the frustrated and resilient loner. He really fights because he's kicked , not because he's 'evil.' However, his swarthiness and overall record gets him labelled as the 'ugly.' The sequence with his brother is unnecessary as Tuco didn't really need sympathy. We understand him fairly easily and don't need a scene detailing any of his fine points. That the rest of the film left him vague, like Van Cleef, was a strong point. Eastwood is cooler than cool as the unrealistic 'man with no name.' He's the fantasy character here amidst a sea of flesh and blood. The scenes are memorable, often brutal, and pull no punches. From Van Cleef's murders in the opener, when he steps over the dead body of a murdered son, to the comedic interplay of Eastwood's and Tuco's partnership, to Tuco's passionate and obsessive revenge, to Tuco's beating in the Civil War camp while the band plays on, etc, etc. The movie also shows the war in a realistic fashion with 'good' guys and 'bad' guys on both sides, as well as young kids in over their heads. Van Cleef isn't really in the movie much after the opening moments and Clint's character is scripted to be aloof. That leaves Wallach to carry the movie and he delivers. Tuco is one of the best characters I've seen in film. The end sequence is mesmorizing, although the death of Angel Eyes is a little anti-climactic. Tuco's sprint through the head stones while he searches for Arch Stanton's grave is dazzling. The music is considered legendary and rightly so. The plot is also spectacular, with humor, brutality, realism and man's greatest motivation, self-interest. The movie is really an ode to self-interest as the men involved fight for what's best for them and usually for no one else. There are a few negatives and they're mostly related. One is the massive length. So many things happen that you almost lose track and it's hard to concentrate throughout. The action also is an acquired taste and may seem dull to others. The scene where Eastwood and Tuco run into the soldiers and destroy the bridge adds to the length and is really unnecessary. Everything seems to fall flat during it, especially the drunk Union captain who's just a poor character to begin with. The sequence is seen as a moral lesson to war in some ways but doesn't tell us anything we don't already know. Plus it's really just padding. Clint and Tuco could have just encountered no one at the bridge and crossed it without having to blow up it up to chase away soldiers. The scene is needless and seemed expensive to boot. The other criticism is where Tuco and Eastwood are in the desert and encounter the amazing coincidence of Bill Carson's wagon coming along at just that moment. Too much of a reach. That's it for criticism. Fantastic film.8.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The GoodI just saw this film yesterday on DVD. Bought it from a store while looking for Django. I wasn't disappointed. From the promising begining, to Ennio Morriconne's powrerful score, to the brilliant climax, this film will always be one of my favorites.The BadThere are some things in the plot I don't quite understand. Have Blondie, Tuco and Angel Eyes met before? In the scene just before where Tuco was about to be hanged, Angel Eyes sort of knew about Tuco's guardian angel. That point was made clear in the prisoner camp where Tuco and Blondie recognize Angel Eyes in the Blue. Of course in the interrogation scene, one could surmise that Tuco and Angel eyes went way back. If they've met before, how? And how did angel eyes get to be a Union sergeant all of a sudden? Is it possible that the 161 min version that I saw wasn't complete?The UglyThat being said, all of you must know by now that this movie is not for everybody. There are two kinds of people in this world: those that love "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, and those who hate it. I love it for what it is. But not for what it was trying to be. It's obvious that Sergio Leonne wanted to make a statement by turning the last part of his trilogy into a civil war epic. I can't help but find that a little forced.BTW,I recognized the one-armed-gunfighter as the guy we see at the VERY BEGINNING of the movie. It seems he lost his arm in his encounter with Tuco. At the bathtub scene, one-arm says he's been looking for Tuco for 8 MONTHS! Now I get it! I've heard that the original version went longer than 161 mins.....now if we can only figure out what happened to the remaining 345,439 mins left at the cutting room floor, we would finally figure out how angel eyes became a Union sergeant!</fullReview>

The master @ work. The direction - close-ups, pan-backs, no talking for first 10 mins, the vistas, the scope, the grandeur...no, I could go on &amp; on... The cast - all were perfectly cast - in fact I read in the biog by Patrick Agan that this was written to be the vehicle for Clint to true stardom. It is a pity that Eli did not have that boost as much. And as for Lee Van Cleef - never have I seen death so close up!For me there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with this film save perhaps that it ends (in true &amp; fitting style - off into the sunset - or at least the distance).</fullReview>

Nothing he has done before or since comes close to this.Why no Oscar nominations?!? Possibly because Italy had refreshed and re-juvenated the Western, which was looking old and jaded in Hollywood? That can't have gone down too well in the big American studios.Some people have said that this film is too long. Poop to them! Every time I watch it, I see something new.

		<shortDescription>Best Western ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third, and best, part of Sergio Leone´s spaghetti Western series is set during the American Civil War and circles around three scoundrels who are after a cache of gold hidden in a graveyard far, far away. We have the extremely skilled revolver man The Good (Clint Eastwood), the ice-cold bounty hunter The Bad (Lee Van Cleef) and the noisy and talkative thief The Ugly (Eli Wallach). In their search they sometimes have to help each other, but just as often they try to kill each other, in pursue of the gold.Sergio Leone´s successful trilogy is certainly one of a kind. "Good, the Bad and the Ugly" and its precursors "A fistful of dollars" and "For a few dollars more" are all top class, but this is the best one. It includes several funny and smart lines, and many memorable scenes. The cast that portrays the trio of gold searchers are all perfect. One of the best actors ever, Clint Eastwood, makes his best performance ever, it actually tops the one he made in Dirty Harry. Eastwood is well fit as the lone gunman who doesn´t talk unless it is really necessary. Lee Van Cleef is just as cool as the bad guy and Eli Wallach is funny and likeable. Great performances by all three. The only minus is probably the length, especially the part when Eastwood and Wallach help a dying officer to blow up a bridge towards the end. This could easily have been ditched since it makes the movie unnecessary long and doesn´t move the plot forward. But all the other essential bits are topnotch. The best western ever, it´s funny and exciting at the same time. Many twists and the score by Ennio Morricone is definitely one of the best ever written. The final scene is a real thriller and gives me goose bumps every time I see it. Everyone should see this. It´s an important piece of movie history.* * * * ? out of * * * * *</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly the greatest western ever made. This film captures the reality of the west not like those John Wayne films. This film show cased what people would do for money. If you haven`t seen this film I strongly recommand this film because it`s by far the most ambitious, unflinchingly graphic and stylistically influential western ever mounted. The film is an engrossing actioner shot through with a volatile mix of myth and realism. Clint Eastwood returns as the invincible "Man with No Name," this time teaming with two gunslingers (Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef) to pursue a cache of $200,000 and letting no one, not even warring factions in a civil war, stand in their way. From sun-drenched panoramas to bold, hard closeups, exceptional camera work captures the beauty and cruelty of the barren landscape and the hardened characters who stride unwaveringly through it. Forging a vibrant and yet detached style of action that had not been seen before, and has never been matched since, "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly" shatters the western mold in true Clint Eastwood style. Now with the plot being said all I have yet to say is that Clint Eastwood surpasses John Wayne in each film. If you like a John Wayne film you will love this film more than any of his films put together. This film is a true masterpiece which features an unforgettable score by Ennio Morricone and is directed off course by Sergio Leone.10/10"A TRUE MASTERPIECE"-Pimpin` Critic 69DID YOU KNOW...? The director (Sergio Leone) undertook a Huge risk in filming the bridge detonation sequence. Investing six weeks' time for 500 laborers to erect the structure and 300-foot dam to create the river underneath, he knew the action could be shot only once. He strategically positioned eight cameras to ensure that every angle was captured - and in a few literally explosive moments, produced one of the most jarring and spectacular action shots ever filmed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY is the premier western, right next to THE SEARCHERS. With dusty trails, bloody gunfights, executions by hanging, and the Civil War, these elements are greatly equal to theterrific performances of the leads. Clint Eastwood is at his squinting, menacing self as the Man with No Name, or otherwise known as Blondie, the silent gunman. He is on the hunt for treasure hidden in aConfederate cemetary, but not without some competition. Lee Van Cleef plays Angel Eyes, the sadistic soldier who is also after the treasure, and Eli Wallach also shines as the greedy Mexican bandito Tuco.THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY is a surefire winner for fans of the Spaghetti Western, despite being a little overlong and a bit violent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Angel Eyes, the cruel assassin, hears of a fortune in Army money, lying hidden in a graveyard. Blondie is the benevolent free spirit, Western Man in his perfect incarnation. His partner and nemesis is Tuco, the irresistible rogue who combines charm, courage and total amorality in equal measure. Only Tuco knows where the graveyard is, but only Blondie knows where to dig, so each must keep the other alive if they are to collect the money."The Good, The Bad And The Ugly" is the keystone of the 'Dollars' trilogy, and the pinnacle of the Spaghetti Western genre. Neither before nor after did the format achieve this sweeping majesty, this clarity of characterisation or this narrative power. Leone's curious hybrid of American art-form, Japanese look and European sensibility worked beautifully - and hit its zenith in this picture.Ennio Morricone's revolutionary musical score is universally acclaimed. The conservatoire-educated composer came up with material for this film which is more than merely innovative and arresting - it sets a new benchmark by which to measure cinematic composition. The central motif was an instant worldwide hit and has never lost popularity, but the score has much more to offer than one engaging melody. Insistently-picked guitar enhances moments of tension, and the lasciviously latin trumpet passage at the film's climax expands the meaning of the photographic images. Music melds with visuals like paint bonding with plaster to form fresco. Without that music, this film is almost unimaginable.A picaresque story in the great European tradition, the film recalls (and extends) the line of inheritance which runs from "Lazarillo de Tormes" through Voltaire and Dickens. Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows, and Blondie and Tuco find themselves meandering in tandem through an evilly-disposed universe, lurching from one scrape to another (the desert episode, the prisoners-of-war episode, etc.) This western Quixote and Sancho double act draws on the selfsame comic proposition, that two very different men, yoked together by fate's whimsy, can forge an understanding that comes close to love.Though Blondie is the 'doer' and the presiding intelligence, the heart of the film is occupied by the unforgettable Tuco. What a character! Comical charlatan, savvy killer, conscienceless swindler and lovable monster, Tuco remains fascinating for every second that he is on the screen. Fine writing delineated the character but it took Eli Wallach's inspirational performance to breathe life into one of cinema's immortal rogues. With the natural courage of a wild animal and the vulnerability of a born loser, Tuco is suffused with a vital humanity which leaps off the screen. His introductory vignette is a masterpiece of exposition, told entirely in images. Our anti-hero escapes a gunning-down (not for the last time!) and makes off gnawing a chicken leg, wiliness, vigour and sensuality mingling in one great affirmation of life itself. Tuco is the other, the dispossessed, the one who must rely on his wits to survive. He is the most frenetic character in the film, and the one who constantly wears a noose around his neck. He has developed his 'otherness' and transmuted it into a life force. Tuco is, par excellence, one of "those that come in by the window".If you think of the world's great novels, it is surprising how many of them are comic - "Ulysses", "A La Recherche", "Oliver Twist", etc. And so it is with this cinematic novel. Virtually every scene is casseroled in a piquant comic sauce. The lists of Tuco's outrageous crimes, read aloud at his various hangings, the wild fluctuations in the relative fortunes of Blondie and Tuco, the transparent attempts of Tuco to save his own skin in every tight corner - all combine to make this a richly comic work, though the humour is usually dry and always understated.This is a film of immense visual power. Each of the three protagonists is given an opening vignette: extreme close-up forces the viewer to take note of the vulpine quality of Lee Van Cleef's extraordinary eyes, fixing him in the mind as a merciless predator. Blondie is seen, not as a man whole and complete, but fragmented by his defining symbols - hat, cigar and gun-holster. The desert sequence contains an image of Blondie staggering on foot, with Tuco's mounted shadow pursuing him over the sand, an object lesson in conveying mood and information without words. Tuco sets an empty bottle rolling down a dune, and in the next shot it hits Blondie in the face. Tuco's ascendancy and Blondie's fading hope are communicated in a single gesture. Blondie's compassion for the whipped mongrel Tuco is enshrined in the little act of sharing a cigar. In the gunshop scene, Tuco hardly utters a word, but his purpose, his knowledge of guns (and the lethal beauty of the weapons themselves) is conveyed powerfully. Tabernas, the Spanish location, is a place of parched hills and scrubby desert, and the film makes superb use of wide panoramas to capture the quality of the terrain. The American Civil War happened on the green pastures of Virginia, not in this barbaric Nowhere, but it doesn't matter. Rock and sand provide a mythical context for these exotic characters who never existed, and never could exist.The finale, with its three-way draw, is epic in scale. Tuco's crazed run through the tombstones is brilliantly shot, with the short field of focus rendering the graves a single unbroken blur as Tuco's greed blinds him to reality. Rapid cuts between the eyes of the participants in the draw heighten the tension dramatically, and then after the explosive release, the closing conceit is a comic gem worthy of a Moliere or a Goldoni.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The third greatest Western ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is Leone's most sustained attack on the American values psychically embodied in the Western, and contemporaneously being globally disseminated culturally, corporately, militaristically (the Cold War, Vietnam). for instance, the Civil War (and this is THE great Civil War movie, shorn of heroics and ideals) is deliberately decontextualised, so that we have no simplistic dichotomy between noble abolitionists and evil racists, or arrogant Yankees and honourable Southerners. Robbed of context, war is seen for what it is, a mass slaughter, a gigantic mirror firing squad searing the land, the logical outcome of progress.The Civil War is often seen as the defining moment of the American 'idea', the victory of certain ideals about liberty and fraternity. Here prized Amercian liberty is a sprawl of corpses and limbs. The 'good' Yankees, the ones who might be seen as carriers of the official myth, are lame, dying, ineffectual, drunk, neurotic, in both cases prone, helpless to stop the victory of evil. The truth about America, embodied in Angel Eyes, the one effective, powerful Union leader we see, is one of torture, robbery and murder. Many have compared the prisoner-of-war camp sequences to World War II - Angel Eyes' Gestapo-like interrogations; the prisoners' orchestra like those in many concentration camps; the equation of the compound with these camps; the wholesale fleecing of prisoners; the trains jammed with prisoners going to their deaths. What is shocking is that the men equated with Nazis are the bringers of liberty to slaves, and the creators of a space for the American dream, free from European abuses and corruption. Leone shows that American history - the genocide of natives; the history of slavery (and Civil Rights was a traumatic issue is the US at the time); the obscene culturalisation of capitalism and its concomitant military Imperialism are not all that different from the Nazi project (never mind that it was the spillover of the Civil War that offset the Wild West).What is most bitter of all is that in the midst of this holocaust, the mythic machinations of capitalism, as adumbrated in the opening DOLLARS films, continues unabated. Indeed, so powerful is the drive of Blondie, Tuco and Angel Eyes, that is can actually remove the obstacle of a full-blown war, clear history and human idiocy out of their ritualistic games (the bridge sequence). History tries to catch them; they are swept up by it on occasion, but constantly elude it, looking on at the spectacle just as we do, hitting the remote control when they're sated. It could be said that they are finally marginalised by the reality of America and history, that the grotesque, extreme close-ups are replaced by sweeping long shots full of anonymous distracted mass, but it's really the other way around, America and history have no way of stopping the mythic drive, indeed it depends on it. GOOD makes all 'traditional' Westerns look thin. Like 'Ulysses', every scene is a classic in itself, rich in detail, character, incident, critique, meaning and form. Who'd have thought in the 1960s that the greatest, most celebrated and influential Italian director would not be Antonioni, Fellini or Visconti, but a hack of sensationalist oaters. But Leone's overwhelming mastery of form is near its peak here, as he brings together all the thematic concerns of the first two films. The opening vignettes adumbrate the terms of reference - ugly is defined by gluttony and constant quick-witted flight; bad is a frightening display of murderous, yet humorous efficiency, pinned down by a curious code of conduct; good embodies a systematic defiance and humiliation of the law, inhuman greed, betrayal and attempted sadistic murder. The geometry of circle and triangle are repeatedly invoked to underpin the fabled linearity of the west, endless combinations from the boy at the well and the climactic shootout, to the opening triangle of Angel Eyes and Tuco linked to food, Blondie not. The themes of the family (Angel Eyes' opening slaughter; Tuco and his brother), religion (the monastary hospital; Blondie as Tuco's guardian angel, with the power to give and take life; his Jesus-like ordeal in the desert, taunted by the devil), the place of the body in a mythical landscape (and Blondie suffers a horrible lashing in the desert), and the contrasting of these mythic archetypes with gross, concupicent humanity, a humanity that opens and closes the film, because this is Wallach's film, a man whose crimes have understandable motivation (women, food, money for comfort etc.), who must live in while the abstractions haunt the Western landscape. The score, though frequently parodic and comic as ever, is one of Morricone's most beautiful, though always ironic; its elegiac, ethereal adagios scoring scenes of intolerable barbarity. In a film bursting with comedy and action, with scenes of great formal beauty (watch Angel Eyes' exit after his first slaughter), of unforgettable set-pieces, the hallucinatory finale in the field of death, where the quest of the movie (and all American quests?) is equated with the grave, where the hilariously sexualised rite is rudely interrupted, has got top them all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Any truly successful film should convincingly create it's own world, and, from the very beginning, draw the viewer into that world. It should be a world with it's own point of view. It's own morality and rules. It should then stick by those rules and force the audience to see the world through the eyes of it's director. Sergio Leone's "The Good, The Bad, &amp; The Ugly" fits all of those qualifications as well as any movie I have ever seen. Ennio Morricione's score, coupled with leone's melodramatic, exaggerated, off-beat visual style create a world like no other. This movie has got to have one of the best endings i've ever seen for a western or an action picture. it's got to be seen to be comprehended. It's the best payoff imaginable after nearly three hours of build up. Is this film over-the-top? Hell Yes. Is it realistic? Of course not. Is it a great film? Your damn right it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be the greatest western ever made. The director Sergio Leone created such a piece of art it should be hung in a museum right beside the painting of the Last Supper. Clint Eastwood is more memorable in this role than John Wayne is in all of his roles put together. Cleef is dynamic (for once) and is more evil than the snake from the Garden of Eden. Eli Wallach simply steals the entire movie with his performance. He could have taken out "the Magnificent Seven" all at once. There are quite a few westerns that have come close to perfection (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Outlaw Josey Wales, Dances With Wolves) but none closer than this one. Just the fact that the Civil War is considered a sub plot goes to show you how entertaining this film is. I still believe the soundtrack is the best of all time. Every country should have it as a national anthem. There has never been a more original soundtrack ever produced by anyone. As for the ending, where should I begin. It is a tremendously satisfying ending (the only ending I can think of that is better is Shawshank Redemption). When those three guys got into the circle and the music started playing, WOW. 3 guys in a showdown? unreal entertainment. Better than any western John Ford could produce that's for sure. I think its safe to say you already know what my rating is for this movie. P.S. email me for any comments, questions, Eastwood movies, they don't call me the "tree of knowledge" for nothing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't remember when I first saw this film but I knew right away that it would take a lot to top it. I nearly have it memorized, I've seen it so many times. I was equally enthralled with the score. The Montenegro version of the title song was a favorite of mine long before I was old enough to see the movie.I think it is what drew me to see the movie in the first place, though it was at a tough time. I wasn't old enough to see the movie, then it wasn't showing anymore when I "matured" to Jr. High age AND vcr's were yet to be household items. When the music &amp; opening credits first rolled for me I remember thinking, "What is THIS music?", being only exposed to the 'refined' Hugo version. As the film ran I soon found myself totally absorbed, so much so, that I as aware of how unusual it felt. When I found myself wiping my chin, cheeks &amp; eyes during 'Story of a Soldier' I knew this score and movie were something exceptional. I've never heard a soundtrack since that works so well with a film! The music during Tuco's search for Arch Stanton's grave and the 3-way gunfight are perfect!! My mine was racing...do you shoot the guy who's gonna shoot you? you DON'T want to shoot the guy who's gonna shoot the guy who's gonna shoot you BEFORE he shoots....Whew!! I've adopted "There's two kinds of people" as my own...seems to fit nearly any occasion. Ya see, there's two kinds of people in this world; those who love this film, and those that haven't seen it. Be sure to buy the soundtrack when you buy the movie...saves a trip later.</fullReview>

No other film has that attraction. I don't know much about camera angles, etc., but I always admire the end scenes from where Tuco rolls over and hits the headstone to where Blondie rides off with the music playing, (especially the dramatic scene where Tuco runs desparately around in circles trying to find Arch Stanton's grave; the music is perfect). All of the characters play their parts and really do convince as the Good, the Bad and the Ugly. One hell of a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It amazes me that the 'Italians,' or, anyone else, can make a better kick-ass American western than us Americans!?!? Sure! There are a lot of great American-made westerns, but, there were also restrictions in the US as to what can and cannot be filmed. This movie, being European, had none of that crap.Clint Eastwood, apparently, wasn't being hired at American studios, so, he went to Italy and made "A Fistful of Dollars" (1964) for $15,000. Then, he made, in Italy, again, "For A Few Dollars More" (1965) for $50,000. CLASSIC SPAGHETTI WESTERNS! :) Then came this work of art! This CLASSIC COWBOY, ASSASSIN, WESTERN that bettered the last two SPAGHETTI WESTERN CLASSIC COWBOY, ASSASSIN WESTERNS - "The Good, The Bad, and, The Ugly" (1966)! In TWO(2) years, Clint went from making $15,000 a movie to $250.000 a movie...F'N WOW! If you're a movie buff, you're life isn't complete until you've seen this trilogy, all three Sergio Leone movies, and, especially, "THIS" movie.Not only is this movie fantastic, the Spanish dry-lands are very much like that of Mexico and Texas. (Yes, this "AMERICAN WESTERN CLASSIC" was filmed (mostly) in Spain...and, by Italians!?!?) Rumor has it that Sergio Leone (Director - Genius!) was a real creep to work for. I read somewhere that Clint Eastwood was told this early on by Ennio Morricone (movie music composer - Genius)(and, a great lifelong friend of Clint Eastwood ever since they met); but, he also said not to let it get to him. Rumor also has it that Sergio Leone once said something to one of his actors for ruining a costume, and, the actor committed suicide by jumping from a window.Either and/or anyway - this movie is a masterpiece! Sergio Leone, Ennio Morricone...and, Clint Eastwood (The Good), Lee Van Cleef (The Bad), and, last but NEVER least, Eli Wallach (The Ugly)...are a magical movie-making team! I wish they all made more movies together! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Running over death on the way to enlightenment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:This film's climactic scene has such depth to it for it is quintessential Leone. Tuco consumed with greed runs like a maniac amongst the dead frantically searching for Arch Stanton's name. With Morricone in the background transforms what could be boring into a one of a kind depiction of the utter insanity of capitalism; this is leone's vision lunatics running and scurrying about in the mindless obsession with possessing riches. The music build into a crescendo as Tuco gets more and more frantic increasing speed to breakneck suicidal fury. The same message as Duck You Sucker Steiger has the same trance by the bank of Mesa Verde. Leone wants us to see the essence of these three characters but blondie is different and this difference is shown in such a small beautiful scene. Tuco sees the rebel dying smirks at blondie for caring. He walks in offers a cigar to the dying man; the man looks up in astonished comprehension within the cruelty of the civil war a small quiet deed of compassion. He pulls his coat over him and he passes as the smoke comes through his mouth beautiful metaphor only Leone can do this. This was done earlier when Tuco tries lying about Pablo his brother the priest telling blondie how Pablo loves him when we just witnessed the estrangement which turned violent. Blondie gives him a quiet look of pensive understanding proffers him a cigar; this is what makes him the good a moral center while the ugly and the bad are only greed. The nobility of the good is presented in his freedom from greed his compassion for the suffering. He toys with the ugly but never harms him. He intends to teach him good in a rather violent way. Watch the first 5 minutes the same opening as Once Upon a Time in the West. No dialogue pure LEONE visual narrative with camera on eyes revealing bounty hunters apprehensively cornering the ugly. The blowing wind the empty desolation the slow death walk of desperate men trying to make money the hard way. Compare to the group at the train station in ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST; almost parallel but in West they fight the natural world Elam fighting a fly and Woody Strode the dropping water. Leone always depicts existence as the war that Hemingway held it to be. War against the natural world; war against other human beings. How is evil presented by Leone? Zombies decapitations gore all over the screen flying limbs? No Van Cleef is quiet sneering at just the right moments like that your family? The scene where he majestically rides up to Morricone's dark theme is a classic western moment. His evil is all pervasive but subtly sketched out the wicked laugh as he kills and when he methodically tortures Tuco. How is your digestion now? Leone's depiction of evil is almost all visual with music touches of sneers and cruel pithy hints of angel eyes utter hatred of everyone and his love of money the only love he ever possessed. Evil does not require its depiction to be gory violent debauchery it works so much better here LEONE shows filmmakers the soul of the evil is truly the most fear producing his indifference to killing children or abusing women whatever it takes he would destroy the whole world if he had the power if it stood in his way.

		<fullReview>I've watched this movie over 15 years ago and I just watched it again today Feb. 14, 2014. If there was ever a film in which sounds defined it, this would be that film. I watched the Bluray 5.1 surround version and every single sound was just ideal. A lick of the lips. A dropping rock. Suspenseful music score. Hard shoe soles against harder wood. Gun shots. Massive explosions. A little fly landing on a face. Every single thing seemed to have had a little microphone attached it. This added to my appreciation of the story line.The story line was very "story-like". A good man, a bad man, and an ugly man all wanted the same thing. But, they couldn't all get it. It reads like a story book you would read to your kids before tucking them in. I wont go into further details of the story, but just know that it is a classic that will last forever. Every character has well defined traits that make them unique. If I happen to watch this film again in 15 years, I may not remember the story line. But, I do know that I will never forget the characters and the music.</fullReview>

They join an alliance to find a fortune in gold told to both of them by the dying words of a Confederate soldier. The corporal tells Tuco the Graveyard name and Blondie the grave name. Neither one is telling but they are both working against Angel Eyes(Van Cleef) who also wants the money. It end in a fantastic showdown which is by far the best part of the film.

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood and westerns go together like peanut butter and jelly. Throw in one of the ultimate bad guys in Lee Van Cleef and the great Eli Wallach and you have a masterpiece. The third and final installment of the "Dollars" trilogy, the Man with No Name (Eastwood) gives us one more epic performance supported brilliantly by the calculating hit-man, Angel Eyes (Van Cleef), and the wanted outlaw, Tuco (Wallach).The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is probably the most recognizable western of all time as well the greatest, in my opinion. The world-renowned theme music also makes it one of the most famous and beloved films ever, with it's more than impressive #6 rating on the IMDb Top 100 being proof. With all due respect to other legendary westerns such as High Noon, Once Upon a Time in the West, and The Searchers as well as legendary stars of westerns like John Wayne, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly as well as the legend that is Clint Eastwood take the cake as the best of the genre. It is also a film that anyone with appreciation for great films should watch at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolute classic which is rightly hailed as being one of the greatest films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been hugely impressed with Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in America and having enjoyed previous Clint Eastwood westerns, I finally decided to sit down and watch the Good, the Bad and the Ugly. My expectations were high as this film currently has an IMDb rating of 9.0 and is ranked as the 5th best film of all time (according to IMDb). Needless to say, my expectations for this film weren't just met, but they were exceeded.The film basically follows Angel Eyes (Van Cleef) Blondie (Eastwood) and Tuco (Wallach) who are all trying to find some missing coins which are worth $200,000. Initially, it is only Angel Eyes that is aware of the hidden loot, but after Tuco has a chance encounter with an injured and rather thirsty Bill Bryson (who happens to be the man that Angel Eyes is looking for) Bill Bryson informs Tuco that he will tell him where the coins are hidden as long as he gives him water - he tells him which graveyard it is hidden in, but not the name of the gravestone. Desperate to find out which gravestone the coins are hidden in, Tuco obliges and runs to get water. However, in the few minutes that he is gone Bryson dies and tells a worn out Blondie the name of the gravestone where the loot is hidden. Reluctantly, Tuco decides to nurse Blondie back to health so that he can take him to the gravestone where the loot is hidden. Tuco had been punishing Blondie due to the fact that Blondie double crossed him earlier.There are so may things to praise this film about; firstly we have that fantastic Ennio Morricone score - I loved his music in Once Upon a Time in America and was equally impressed with the score in this film. Who can also forget the iconic signature tune which is played in the opening credits and several times throughout this film? Just brilliant.Then we come to the acting, Van Cleef, Eastwood and Wallach were all fantastic - check out the scene between Van Cleef and the guy that he intimidates at the start of the film. There is no dialogue between the men for a number of minutes as the 2 men just fix each other with icy stares- sometimes the best way to create atmosphere and tension is to use the 'less is more' approach and that perfectly sums up the first 10-15 minutes of this film. Eastwood was also fantastic and I feel that he is at his best when he plays the 'tough gunslinger'. He's a great actor and I feel that nobody combines grit and coolness quite like Clint. Wallach was also fantastic in the role of a fairly dumb outlaw. I thought he was convincing in this role and thought he was a really funny character.For me, the biggest strength of this film lies with Eastwood and Wallach and for the most part it is them that this film belongs to. The continual point scoring and 'one oneupmanship' between the 2 men was hilarious to watch. They both share great on screen chemistry and that for me is one of the main reasons that TGTBATU works so well. Another strength is in the story telling. You are constantly left guessing throughout the film and as a viewer you are never quite sure what is going to happen next which certainly made sure the film held my interest throughout. Although this film is quite long it never felt drawn out and pretty much every scene was relevant in advancing the plot. The film culminates in a rather tense finale which proved to be a great ending to a great film.TGTBATU is an absolute classic and is a film that I would recommend to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, if you are not a Clint Eastwood fan, then why are you still breathing? Second, if you are really a true fan, then what is a Smith &amp; Wesson Model 29? Now that I got all that out of the way, I thoroughly enjoyed, "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly." Was this the consummate 'spaghetti western?' Hell ? I don't know, and I really don't give a rat's rear. There were so many of these flicks made and they all had some sort of redeeming quality (usually lots of gun-play.) This movie is the last of the "Dollars Trilogy", directed by Sergio Leone (at least that is what "Wikipedia" is telling me). I really can't remember what the movie was about - I just know I enjoyed it. Oh I guess I should try and remember what the plot of this film actually was. Hmmmm, let me see, I think the story was about bad guys shooting at the good guys, good guys shooting at the bad guys?BUT no one ever shot at Clint. If you did, he would chew on his cigar a little, and then blow you away. Mr. Eastwood could hit anything with his six-gun. Six-gun? What a misnomer ? he never had to reload. He always shot the straightest and fastest. No one stood a chance. And that is about it. That is pretty much the plot and the story of, "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly." You know what - I actually spoiled it for every spaghetti western starring Clint. They were all very similar. They are all fun to watch and well worth a second and third look as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie ever (In my humble opinion)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's start by mentioning that if Sergio Leone hadn't made the "Dollars Trilogy" as this movie is part of, western movies would have died out, they were on the brink of extinction, so I say that we should pay our respects to the unfortunately passed away Mr. Leone.Now to the movie. This movie is in my opinion; *beep* amazing. Everything from the acting to the setting to the beautiful score by Ennio Morricone, it is all perfect. The cast does a superb job in this movie, I am especially fond of Clint Eastwood as "Blondie" or as he's more known as throughout the series, "The Man With No Name". And from what I heard, this movie is a prequel to the rest of the series. This is in my opinion, the best movie ever. It is not only because of every good thing in the movie but also because I have a soft spot for westerns, especially older spaghetti westerns. But my favorite thing about this work of art is probably the main theme song that was composed by the amazing Ennio Morricone, it is probably one of the most recognized theme songs ever, I even knew it when I was 10 and I had not even seen the slightest of this movie or even heard of it. This movie is a masterpiece that will be loved Western fans and Film- buffs alike.Hope this helped!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is what westerns are all about!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the good, the bad and the ugly last week, with high expectations, (considering this has been named the greatest western ever made) and they did not fail me. This is definitely one of my top 10 films of all time. The cinematography and filming locations + the great acting debuts (Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach) and directing (Sergio Leone) make this one of the best films of all time. The plot is very entertaining. Basically there are 3 Disparate Drifters, the good (Clint Eastwood, Blondie), the bad (Lee Van Cleef, Sentenza/Angel Eyes) and the Ugly (Eli Wallach, Tuco). They are in search of a gold loot of $200,000 hidden in one of the many graves in a cemetery. This is set during the American civil war. This leads to one of my favourite climaxes in cinema history, the scene where all 3 of them are in a face-off in the cemetery. I Won't spoil it for you, you have to watch this before you die.I watched the extended edition, by the way, which made it even better. You can rent the extended edition of ITunes for good quality instead of watching it off YouTube.The final thing I have to say about this is, the amazing score. The way Ennio Morricone captures the gripping suspense and thrill of a proper western just captivates me.I am definitely going to view a fistful of dollars and for a few dollars more. I would recommend this film to anyone. It is very long but worth checking out. Make you check out my other reviews as well, just look for the name KianHc and you can find plenty more reviews from me.</fullReview>

Cheating people out of their money in a very unique fashion . The plot thickens when a treasure comes into to play and all the contrast of each character come out in all their glory.

Some people says that this film is really boring but I really doubt if they watched the whole film. The last battle scene was totally mind blowing. The editing was so well pasted and the musics by Ennio Morricone was absolutely good. The ending? So good.

		<fullReview>The best western ever made period! In the last and the best installment of his so-called "Dollars" trilogy of Sergio Leone-directed "spaghetti westerns," Clint Eastwood reposed the role of a taciturn, enigmatic loner. Here he searches for a cache of stolen gold against rivals the Bad (Lee Van Cleef), a ruthless bounty hunter, and the Ugly (Eli Wallach), a Mexican bandit. Though dubbed "the Good," Eastwood's character is not much better than his opponents -- he is just smarter and shoots faster. The film's title reveals its ironic attitude toward the canonized heroes of the classical western. "The real West was the world of violence, fear, and brutal instincts," claimed Leone. "In pursuit of profit there is no such thing as good and evil, generosity or deviousness; everything depends on chance, and not the best wins but the luckiest." Immensely entertaining and beautifully shot in Techniscope by Tonino Delli Colli, the movie is a virtually definitive "spaghetti western," rivaled only by Leone's own Once Upon a Time in the West (1968).</fullReview>

But as i started watching the movie no feeling like 'movie of my dad's time' came into my mind.i watched the whole movie 3 hour long without any other ounce of thought but only thinking about the 3 characters which were shown by the director so effectively that the 3 of them will never leave your mind even after completion of the movie. Inspite of the variation of the characters we equally love 3 of them .and the cool music act like catalyst to the visually stunning cinematography. Clint Eastwood is so cool that he may remain as an idol for so many generations for that kind of roles. I previously had a feeling that Tarantino is best for the cool movies but after seeing this i felt he is so far away from this so called 'best'.I finally understood why my dad is so crazy about his movie .and i also insist all others to see this first who admire Tarantino as legend.</fullReview>

It had great adventures and wrapped up beautifully but it may have been a bit too long. Regardless, it was very good to watch this movie and I am glad I did, Clint Eastwood was amazing in his prime!I loved Tuco, played by Eli Wallah, who was just one of those loud mouthed idiots that always talks himself into trouble. You can assume that he was the 'UGLY' in the movie. Tuco was just great for the humor side of the film and that's why I loved him. He was also quite unpredictable, you never know what was going to happen with him.I would recommend it to movie buffs who have a love for movies like I do. People who enjoy browsing the history of movies and how they were made back then, especially as it is an iconic one for its time and considered a classic now!It was a unique movie, Clint Eastwood was like WOW! I now understand why he is such a legend in Hollywood. It is definitely one that will last through the ages as it is a classic due to the storyline, the actors and the camera techniques. One thing that put me off was the music! But that was the usual back in those times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leone's Civil War Epic with Clint Eastwood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Italian-born film director Sergio Leone completed his western trilogy with Clint Eastwood in what constituted a prequel to the "Dollars" movies. "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" qualifies as a sprawling tale of greed about three men and their tenacious search for a Confederate strong box containing $200-thousand dollars in gold coins. This memorable United Artists continued a trend in Leone's filmmaking. He kept making films that were bigger and bigger. Eventually, he would make an even bigger western than "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" entitled "Once Upon a Time in the West." Previously, Leone's first oater "Fistful of Dollars" had been produced on a shoestring budget and shared sets with another Continental western lensed in Spain. When Leone produced "For Few Dollars More," he imported a second American actor, veteran heavy Lee Van Cleef, and commissioned art director Carlo Simi to construct an entire western town in Almeria, Spain. Reportedly, the El Paso town set cost more than the budget for "Fistful of Dollars." Meanwhile, Van Cleef reunited with Leone and Eastwood for "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly," and Leone imported yet another American actor. Eli Wallach, who had played the bandit chieftain in John Sturges' classic "The Magnificent Seven," signed on as the third American actor. Essentially, Leone cast Eastwood again as a bounty hunter designated as "The Good" and called him 'Blondie," while Van Cleef played "the Bad," and Wallach appeared as "the Ugly." "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" became Leone's most expensive western to date and he set the action against the American Civil War. Naturally, all three eponymous characters are a little larger than life themselves. The relationship between the Eastwood as well as the Van Cleef character changed drastically because Van Cleef was not playing Colonel Douglas Mortimer. Ironically, Van Cleef's character was named 'Angel Eyes,' and he made his living as a man who hunts down other men and kills them for a price. No, "the Bad" isn't a bounty hunter. Meantime, "the Good" brings in a slimy, profane Mexican bandit named Tuco. He collects the reward on Tuco's head, and later shoots the noose from around Tuco's neck, so the slippery Mexican can escape. Later, Blondie and Tuco split the money. This relationship comes to an end because Blondie doesn't think that Tuco will be worth more than $3-thousand. Clocking in at 180 minutes, "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" bristles with shoot-outs. Live is cheap in the world of the Italian western and the horses outnumber the corpses. Money means everything. The three protagonists refuse to let a national catastrophe like the Civil War interfere with their plans to find the cashbox. Eventually, they do and confront each other in a massive graveyard to shoot it out. Anybody who considers himself or herself a connoisseur of Spaghetti westerns must watch "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly." This savage western made quite an impression on audiences when it was released and Grammy Award-winning composer Ennio Morricone's orchestral soundtrack emerged as a hit on American music charts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In my opinion the best Western ever made, and also among the best films ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm glad I finally got down to seeing this film, I think everyone have heard about it, and everyone have definitely heard it's iconic theme music. The movie is three hour long (each move seem to increase with one hour) but that just makes it a movie with three hours of pure genius Western entertainment. Clint Eastwood as Blondie or "the man with no name" is as brilliant and bad-ass as ever, and even earn the title as "the good". lee Van Cleef returns with a new role (not the same role as in "for a few dollars more" as the well named "the bad" or "angel eyes". And Eli Wallach as Tuco "the ugly" a more humorous addition to the series, but also earn the title as he is neither good, nor bad. Greedy and a coward is a better description.Once again it's all about money, this time 200 000 dollars, a lot of money back then. I won't spoil much, the money is buried in a grave, and only Tuco knows which cemetery, and only Blondie knows which grave. And "Angel eyes" are never far behind them.This movie is a masterpiece of it's time, the acting is great, Sergio Leone deserves a lot of credit for this film, and the theme music is unforgettable. Plus they finally improved the dubbing which was a little unsynced in the two previous films. Also it portrayed a very realistic image of the American Civil War without taking any particular side in the conflict. then again the main character doesn't exactly care much for the war, they're just after the gold. Then still it's nice to see Blondie show his sympathy for those who fought and died in the war.I really can't recommend this film enough, if you haven't seen any of the films in this trilogy, buy them immediately and watch all of them. If you have the films and have only seen the two first, well what are you waiting for! Don't do anything other than buy this film, it's a must see and must have film. I give this film (obviously) a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man's inhumanity to man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is undoubtedly powerful.It is also -- right from the beginning -- almost relentless in its dark fascination for ugliness, cruelty and violence; I spent most of the three-hour running time both metaphorically and physically tensed for the next atrocity, as the camera lingered lovingly across every scar, sweat-stain and ploughed bullet-wound. Not so much a case of pornography of violence as pornography of sadism: there is violence aplenty, both of the movie stereotype kind where every shot is an instant kill, and of brutal bloody beatings, but the real mark of this film lies in the long-drawn-out sequences of anticipation, as a man is told how he will die and then the process prolonged to attain the full pleasures of revenge. Having experienced at least three vicarious hangings and two deaths by thirst, not to mention a starvation diet and several stalkings-with-guns, with nerves jumping at every minute, I was as wrung out by the end of the picture as if it had been an explicit horror movie -- save that horror movies generally end in catharsis of some kind, the victory of good over evil, the exposure of sanity onto our darkest fears. Leone's film is not just 'morally ambiguous' but morally absent; in this world, everything is filthy, corrupt or brutalised, from the idealistic commandant dying of gangrene to the eager anticipation of the townsfolk at the hanging. It's pretty hard to watch. If asked to date this film offhand I'd have put it in the 1970s, for it shares much of the nihilism of the critical favourites of that decade.I've rated it as high as I have because it is both effective at what it does and memorable; it also has a strain of occasional mordant humour, skilfully deployed to relieve otherwise unrelenting degradation. But I've watched the film twice now and have no desire ever to see it again. (And I *cannot* help getting inappropriate flashes of Keaton's "The General" during the Civil-War-battle-at-bridge scene...)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Film of all Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first watched The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, I wasn't aware that it would turn out to be my favorite film of all time. I was never a huge fan of the Western genre until I watched this film and was perpetually astounded. This film sets the standard for so many other Westerns and other great films, in general. And some of the best scenes in film history are all in this wonderful film.The story depicts three men, portrayed as good, bad and ugly, and their constant interactions with one another, in their attempts to find a stash of gold somewhere in the desert. I won't spoil any of the story here, but the film develops these characters magnificently and introduces all sorts of conflicts for these three characters to tackle. The actors themselves who portray these characters do an outstanding job. Clint Eastwood as the Man with No Name or The Good does a brilliant job and shows that he was and continues to be at the very vanguard of the Western genre. Eli Wallach as the opportunistic and savage Tuco or The Ugly, does an excellent job inspiring disgust, sympathy and pity, sometimes all at once. And Lee Van Cleef plays his role marvelously giving us a true canon villain and a great ingredient to the already spicy mix of Eastwood and Wallach.The shots in this film are breathtaking as Leone shoots wide, panoramic shots of the Southwestern desert and gives the viewer a feeling of the openness and freedom. Shot during the Civil War, Leone captures the struggle and violence of the conflict in a multitude of scenes. I won't spoil one scene in any way, but Leone creates a devastating image when Eastwood and Wallach find themselves in a Union camp. Leone has shown that Westerns can be visually beautiful as well.The film really pushes the genre and gives all sorts of depth to the characters and the plot. Ultimately, Leone gives the viewer one of the most intense and satisfying climaxes in film history. I assure you that you won't be disappointed. The film contains so many archetypes of the old West but also new, fresh and shifting paradigms that we, now in the present day, consider standard. There is just so much to like about this film that I can't really present in words. One thing I'll say is that despite the large amount of stale and same Westerns, this one stands out as something unique and truly is something special. Like I said, this is my favorite film of all time on a hotly contested list and while I'm not sure if that'll change in the future, this film will continue to endure and is a beautiful Western and a beautiful film, in general.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess I find myself somewhat in the middle on this film, I enjoyed it to a point, but I don't get the sense that this is one of the greatest Westerns ever, and the Western is my favorite movie genre. I much prefer a good psychological Western between complex antagonists, Eastwood's own "Unforgiven" would be an example. This was more a straightforward tale of three desperadoes consumed by greed who attempt to outwit each other on the trail to an unknown grave containing two hundred thousand dollars in gold coin. Each though, earns their respective title credit in the story, even if Eastwood's Blondie might be the 'good' simply based on his classically rugged features.More on the plus side, it was really cool to hear the title theme music expressed in a handful of different ways throughout the story. The picture also captured the gritty realism of what the 1860's wild west was probably a lot like. You know, the more films I see of cowboys out in the desert days at a time with no access to soap and water, I start to wonder if they'll ever produce a picture that captures the fresh aroma of that experience. It's one thing to hear Tuco accused of smelling like a pig, but to actually get the full flavor of that would really be something. Then again, theater goers would never make it to the end of the picture - oh well for that idea.As for the film's length, I too side with those that feel it took a long time to get from Point A to Point B. I'm really wondering if it was necessary to bring in the Civil War battle for that bridge, but it did give rise to perhaps the most meaningful scene in the picture for me. Watching Blondie try to ease the soldier's death with his coat and a smoke was a masterful touch.You know, I could probably go so far as to put this film in the top twenty Westerns of all time, but it's position at #4 in the IMDb top rankings of ALL pictures is just too much of a stretch. That's probably the reason I find myself going to that page less and less, and watching movies of all types more and more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies. I have been familiar with this movie since my youth (ah, those were the days! Before everyone had become so sensitive to viewer age ratings...) and it's always a welcome sight. Sure it's long (my DVD has extra footage added into the regular film) but that means there's always something new to focus on. I could go on and on about this movie. Eli Wallach gives one of the greatest supporting performances ever in a movie; in truth, he's really the star of this film. The direction is top notch with a gritty, funny and tender script. It is also a tribute to a different school of film-making, that which used the dubbing technique. The audio is a separate entity by itself, enabled to its height by Ennio Morricone's legendary soundtrack. I sometimes run the movie just to listen to it. There is a lot to talk about when discussing this film. Clint's hero seems to emerge at the same time in the 60's that John Wayne's hero seems a little out of touch - coincidence? I think not. This picture is worth at least a thousand words, but I'll spare you for now. Welcome this sight to your television!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Good, The Bad and the Ugly" is the final movie of "The Dollars Trilogy," nd had "For a Few Dollars More" and "A Fistful of Dollars" coming before it.This one starts off very good. After the stylish credits and the famous music, we are introduced to every one of the characters. "The Ugly" (Tuco) gets his introduction with no dialog, and just action."The Bad" (Angel Eyes) really shows how "bad" he is, with one of the most "bad-ass" lines in Westerns. "When I'm paid, I always follow my job through." When you hear that line, wait for a couple seconds, and then you will know why he is called "The Bad." "The Good" (Man with no Name)gets introduced when he triumphs over "The Ugly." Of course, he's not really "good," but most Western heroes simply aren't. Take William Munny in "Unforgiven" or The Lady in "The Quick and the Dead." To quickly sum up the story, "The Good" finds out the location of a treasure from a man's dying breath. (No, his last words weren't "Rosebud.") They meet up with "The Bad" who also wants to get his hands on the treasure.The ending takes a lot of twists, and the quick-draw scene was very good. But, the film seemed to slow at parts that could have been easily cut down. For example, in the graveyard scene, Tuco runs around for at least three minutes, which means three minutes of boredom instead of story, dialog or action. Another flaw was the English dubs. Well, I'm not sure if they're dubs or not, but the voices don't match the mouth at times. Oh well. The ending was really good. Well, to be more precise, the last couple of minutes. Note: For all you Tarintino fans, this is his favorite movie.Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not just one of the greatest westerns of all time but one of the greatest films too (as I'm writing this it's at no 11 in the IMDb top 250). Its difficult to know where to start in going through this films greatest attributes so i'll list them in no particular order: Music - Enricco Morricone's score is the peak of his collaborations with Leone iconic and instantly recognisable from the main theme to the final showdown. One of my favourite moments in films as the score reaches a crescendo then slowly winds down as the trio head for the final stand off.Visuals - The sets, costumes, cinematography are all top draw creating some stunning moments. The highlights being a fully realised civil war battle and amazing representations of frontier towns.Performances - Clint in the part he was born for, Van Cleef relishes his part as the bad Angel Eyes only outdone by Henry Fonda in Leone's later Once Upon a Time in the West as most sinister villain in a western ever. On top of this add Eli Wallach as Tucos the ugly who nearly walks away with the movie despite being evil he's almost funny in his reactions and battle with Clints the good.The Showdown - The classic western scene, the ultimate face off three gunfighters face off the music kicks in, close ups and then the deadly, instant result.I can't recommend this film enough its one of only four films I have rated 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leone's moment of perfection!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, stars Clint Eastwood as Blondie, Eli Wallach as Tuco, and Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes.This movie is a masterpiece, and represents the qualities that good movies should exhibit. It's written with an interesting story, great character development, great character interaction, and great production values.This movie is about 3 gunslingers who at times work together, or against each other in search of a bountiful treasure hidden in a secluded cemetery. At different points of the movie, Blondie and Tuco work together, then betray each other, then come to work together again. At other points of the movie, Angel Eyes works together with Blondie, leaving Tuco as the out man.The story begins before Tuco and Blondie meet up. After meeting, they then work together to collect bounties on Tuco who is worth $1000s. The team can split the bounties as they move territory to territory scamming the law. With each new town, Blondie collects the bounty, then saves Tuco from actually being put to death, then they divide up the bounty.Problems begin as greed sets in. With in a short time, Blondie abandons Tuco after rescuing him, even after Tuco warned him to never betray him and leave him alive. Eventually, the roles are reversed, and it is Tuco who abuses Blondie and nearly causes his death.But this is where the story takes a major twist, as a run away wagon with a nearly dead passenger reveals secrets of a treasure, but each Tuco and the half dead Blondie only learn a vital part of the secret from. So now Tuco must save Blondie to get to the treasure.The story continues from there, and we get to learn quite a bit about the characters. Especially Tuco, in my opinion Leone purposely allowed us to see that indeed there were no defined roles as who was "the good", "the bad", and "the ugly". Greed is very powerful, especially when life is such a struggle to begin with.The final showdown is unbelievable. It is epic, and is absolutely worth anything to see. It's the pinnacle of movie making, the showdown, the movie, the characters, the drama building. Truly a masterpiece.This movie is great, it's a cinematic masterpiece. As of this writing, it's #16 in the top 250 movies on IMDb, and deserves to be. Any western fan must see this movie, no excuses. Any fan of movies in general must see this movie, no excuses.Thank you Sergio for making this movie.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Interesting and Entertaining Movie !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood has given a lifetime's performance to the character of Blondie in this all time MUST SEE western action and adventure thriller. The self-confidence and stoic fortitude of Blondie was adequately portrayed by Eastwood. In addition, Blondie is shown to be exceptionally fair as he justly and equally distributes the bounty between himself and the Ugly, at the end.The crooked and cunning portrayal of a sheriff by Lee Van Cleef, who is head over heels for the lost bounty is also worth applauding. Cleef's facial contours and rugged appearance was exactly, that was needed for a bad, wily and greedy appearance of a selfish and cruel country sheriff.Besides, the peculiar tune of music goes right to the heart with the flow of dramatic,stunning and at times, amusing events. The battle scene is magnificently pictured and even the cemetery chosen for the last duel is perfect leading to the climactic suspense culminating in the death of the Bad. Well done, for both Eastwood and Sergio !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great western, but drags a little too much, especially on repeated viewings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This, the third and final part of Sergio Leone's famous "Dollars" or "Man with no name" Trilogy was promised to be the epic chapter; that proves to be entirely true. However, despite Leone's talented direction, the film seems to drag in some scenes, and the length is almost unbearable on multiple viewings. The plot is very good, intricate, yet simple enough for the mainstream crowd; the way it keeps developing through twists and unexpected situations is also great. It keeps your interest, at least the first few times you see it. The pace is bad in some scenes, where the movie seems to drag on endlessly. I don't think I've been able to sit through the whole thing more than once(granted, technically that's enough, but a film should have some re-watch value, I think). The acting is very good; Clint Eastwood is the embodiment of the spaghetti-western spirit. Lee Van Cleef is excellent as well, as is Eli Wallach. The characters are well-written, interesting and credible. The direction is, as always when it comes to Leone's films, excellent. Apart from the few scenes where the plot drags, Leone keeps a great atmosphere and mood throughout the film. The action is about as good as it gets when it comes to spaghetti-western: excellent, intense and very, very cool. The dialog is excellent. The script is well-written. The soundtrack is among Ennio Morricone's best work. All in all, if you're into westerns at all, this is pretty much *the* western. It drags a little too much in a few scenes, though, and is probably best enjoyed if you only see it once. I recommend it to any fan of westerns, particularly spaghetti-westerns, as well as any of the three main actors, or Sergio Leone. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From the look of Eastwood, to the music, humour and moral ambiguity, this is amazing ground breaking cinema as art.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw this movie for the first time at an outdoor cinema on the big screen, and was absolutely blown away. I loved the way the story was developed slowly, the fact that hardly a word was said for the first 5-10 minutes. I don't think I've ever seen a movie where the music and the pace of the movie work so well together, almost as one, and it helps build the story and create an amazing atmosphere. Clint Eastwood look absolutely beautiful, he is a stunning man to look at on screen, his character has some real complexity and rough edges.I loved the sense of humour and the moral ambiguity. The way the movie was shot and especially the final scene at the graveyard with the close ups, genuinely pulled me into the tension of the story to a point where I totally forgot about all the followers that have used this technique and turned it into a cliche.The actually story itself, with the three characters, was complex and showed depth. So the storyline, cinematography, development of plot, combination of music and movie make for an absolutely riveting film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A grave full of dollars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The absolute best western ever made. My admiration and pure love for this film grows as the years pass. I've seen this at least 50 perhaps more times and never tire of it. I love Red River, The Searchers and the Wild Bunch but as great as they all are they're a distant second. To start with the score is mesmerizing haunting and beautiful. This film is funny, sentimental and very unique in its style and mood. Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef are the coolest antagonists ever matched in cinema however it is Eli Walach who steels the film in a very much underrated unforgettable performance. Like all of Sergio Leone films there is a very thin line that occasionally is crossed on both sides of good and evil. Tuco ` Walach ` is the center of three of the most greedy ruthless characters you will ever see yet you care about him and feel his pain when he is scorned by his brother for the path he has taken in his life. Only in the extended Italian version does Angel Eyes ` Cleef ` show any humanity as he enters a confederate hideout and displays compassion for badly wounded soldiers otherwise he is a bloodthirsty killer. If Blondie ` Eastwod ` is truly good were all going to heaven. It's not only a great western but it is my favorite Civil War film as well. Aside from the Spanish terrain the costumes, uniforms, buildings and weapons are the most historically accurate I've ever seen on film. Leone does a great job of creating the look and mood of the time even better than any American production. Its beyond my comprehension how this film was produced for only a million dollars of which 250k went to Clint.If there is anyone left out there in the world that has not had the pleasure of seeing it I envy you the thrill of seeing it for the first time. Below are SPOILDERS of my favorite scenes in the film. The order does not represent preference.Angel Eyes riding at the opening of the film &amp; Morricone's background score.The announcing of crimes as Tuco is about to be hung ( hysterical ) done twiceTuco robs a gun shop (hysterical)If you're going to shoot, shoot don't talk!

		<shortDescription>A Fantastic Cinematic Art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone's third installment in his spaghetti western "Dollars" trilogy is a full-blown epic about greed and the wasteful, destructive nature of warfare.In 1862 Texas, we meet Tuco (Eli Wallach), a thief with a price on his head. His friend Blondie (Clint Eastwood) runs a scam in which he turns Tuco in for bounty, and then as he about to be hanged shoots the rope and the two split the reward money. Meanwhile, Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) is hired by Baker (Enzo Petito), a bedridden Confederate soldier to find out from Stevens (Antonio Casas) what name a certain Jackson (Antonio Casale) is currently hiding under. Angel Eyes not only finds out the name, but also learns that Baker, Jackson and Stevens have stolen a case of $200,000 in gold from the Confederate Army and hidden it. Angel Eyes sets off in search of Jackson, and it's only a matter of time and coincidence until Tuco and Blondie become embroiled in this obsessive search, too.The three lead performances are the heart and soul of this film; not a scene passes in which Eastwood, Wallach or Van Cleef fail to grace the screen. Eastwood ("The Good") is a quiet, restrained presence who only speaks when he has to. When he does, everyone around him shuts up and listens. Wallach's Tuco ("The Ugly") is the exact opposite. When he should shut up, he elects to yak, shout and yell excitedly at everyone around him. And he comes up with some of the best insults, too. In one scene, Tuco and Blondie are disguised as Confederates, and Tuco calls out to fellow "Confederate" soldiers, only to realize that they are Union cavalrymen covered with dust. Rounding out the trio is Van Cleef's incredibly "bad" Angel Eyes character. Angel Eyes is the epitome of evil. Nothing motivates this man except pure, selfish greed. He's willing to kill anyone who gets in his way. His first two scenes revolve around brutal murders; he beats innocent women and, later, has Tuco beaten in one of the harshest torture sequences ever shot. Leone does give each of his leads a hint of humanity. For Blondie, it's a brief, silent encounter with a dying Confederate soldier near the film's conclusion. For Tuco, it's an encounter with his long-lost brother Pablo (Luigi Pistilli), who's become a priest; and for Angel Eyes, it's a look of disgust when he stumbles across a forgotten Confederate outpost.This film revolves around violent encounters. Leone likes to draw out his action sequences almost too far. Nobody can make this combination of long silences concluded with quick, explosive action work the way Leone does. In the first 15 minutes of the film, only one dialog exchange occurs, and six people have been murdered. The first scene consists of several mean-looking bounty hunters converging on Tuco, only to have him quickly kill all four of them and then escape through a window. The second is an exchange between Angel Eyes and Stevens. We know from the moment we're introduced to Angel Eyes how this scene will end, but it takes quite a long time to get to the expected conclusion. Scenes like these occur throughout, building up to the climactic gunfight, which consists of about five minutes of itchy eyes and twitching trigger fingers, building up to a single climactic gunshot.The theme of this movie is, undeniably, that war is a destructive waste of lives. I first saw "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" at an early age and didn't really understand Leone's theme, but subsequent viewings and a greater understanding of film as art have helped me to pick up on many of the underlying (and often blatantly stated) ideas which the central conflict revolves around. No significant military character is unaffected by the war. There's the legless soldier whom Van Cleef pays for information; Stevens has a bum leg; Baker is dying in bed; the drunken Captain (Aldo Giuffre) is addicted to alcohol, and later, is wounded; Captain Harper (Antonio Molino Rojo) has a gangrenous leg; and so on. Nobody who fights in a war is unaffected by the consequences. Even innocent people: the young blond boy from whom Eastwood received his famous poncho; Stevens' murdered son and there's Maria, the victim of rape by Confederate soldiers.Leone's directorial style comes out full-force in this film. He felt the best way to show a character's true emotion was to get in close ? and he does get in very close. At least 25% of the film is composed of intense close-ups. Another 25% is shot with extreme wide angles, framing a central character against expansive backgrounds. Most of the film occurs outdoors and was shot in Almeria, Spain by brilliant cinematographer Tonino delli Colli. These exteriors are simultaneously beautiful and haunting. There's something new and out-of-the ordinary about them. Tuco and Blondie's decent into a desert hell is especially memorable, and later on, the colossal battle between Union and Confederate brigades has got to be one of the biggest battle sequences ever filmed. It's amazing to see what Leone can accomplish in one shot without any dialog. Character motivation and scene establishment is done with a facial expression or eye movement as the camera pans without cutting. Then, in the rapid action scenes, Eugenio Alabiso's masterful editing combined with Ennio Morricone's most memorable score work hand-in-hand to deliver a suspenseful encounter."The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" is an unmissable screen gem about the nature of human greed and the waste of civil war. It's also one of the most entertaining movies ever produced, and anyone who has not seen this yet is missing out on a seriously good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"No one used the widescreen ratio more dynamically than director Sergio Leone..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The above quote is from Bill Hunt, one of America's best-known proponents of 16x9 Enhancement. Having seen this film very briefly on an old VHS tape, and then experiencing it on 16x9 Enhanced DVD, there is just no comparison. It's like looking at the interior of a mansion through a keyhole, then looking through the wide-open door. The scene in which Tuco discovers the graveyard where the pot of gold is buried is a classic example of a scene that loses all of its drama when chopped down just to fit some tiny little narrow screen.Of course, it's not just the cinematography that earns this film a place in the top 250 of all time. Clint Eastwood's non-existent acting style actually benefits the film, as the less his character says to anyone, the more enigmatic he becomes. Eli Wallach is annoying, but that was the whole idea all along as far as I can tell, and he does this job well. Lee Van Cleef is suitably devilish as "Angel Eyes" Setenza, the ultimate expression of the mercenary sensibility concept. They're the only three actors whose roles have any semblance of development, but the style they bring to each role is more than enough to carry the film by itself.It's also no accident that the main theme of this film, as well as "The Ecstasy Of Gold", the theme we hear during Tuco's hunt for Arch Stanton's grave, are among the most frequently replayed or outright ripped off pieces of film scoring in the history of cinema. The latter is especially powerful, as it takes what would otherwise be a meaningless sequence of a man dashing through a makeshift cemetary into one of the most powerful moments of the film. There's only one other composer I've heard who has performed an equally amazing feat through the use of music - John Williams.Of course, the best element of this film is that it shows the American Civil War the way it really happened. Slavery was just one element of the war, and a relatively minor one at that. Other elements such as British Loyalism, economic problems, taxation without representation, and general discrimination were the causes of the war. To the everyday man, represented in three different ways by the film's principal characters, the causes of the war were secondary to the opportunities for exploiting either side in order to make a fortune. It has been that way well before the Civil War, and it will always be that way long after the Civil War is long-forgotten. In that sense, this film is less a Western than it is a drama about three greedy men after a pot of gold.And if you want to see the reason why television screens are *finally* being made wider, get the 16x9 Enhanced DVD version of this film that is available in America (NTSC) or Europe/Australia (PAL). Cinematography just doesn't get any finer than this, and neither do dramas with Western motifs.</fullReview>

It doesn't help that Lee Van Cleef, and boy is he an evil one with a lot of attitude, is also out there looking. Film is quite long, but the non-stop action, Wallach's performance, and rich Civil War backdrop distinguish this one from Clint's earlier Spaghetti Westerns. In fact, this is just about the only one of that genre that I can stand at this point; I saw Once Upon a Tine in the West not too long ago and missed the point entirely.

		<shortDescription>Possibly the most influential western of our time!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is not a matter of something deep in the story. It's about style, the mood and it's about film-making technique that brought by Sergio Leone and the crews. Lavish idea and concept that make huge influence in future cinema. So splendid, phenomenal achievement in cinema history. Focusing on 3 characters, to survived the hard times. Entertained with each own conflict of interests. I know it's just a simple idea. What makes extraordinary is how Sergio Leone played with long shot, zoom control angle, sticky conversations, and the most important is amazing musical scores by Ennio Morricone. God I love that way. I think that the biggest influences that always be remembered and many copied by the other filmmaker, that makes us still feel the mood of Sergio Leone in every genre.Anyway, in essence, I know The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is pure entertainment only, not likes Once Upon a Time in The West, which probably has something melodic or dramatic fundamental elements that raised by Leone. I believed also that every entertainment things is beatable by times. But, you still can't replaced the originality, it's already changes the modern cinema forever. It's timeless classic!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece From The Best Director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead;I, like Sartre, believe you can see so much within a tiny sliver of human action. For people who have never watched Sergio Leone watch his visuals. He uses his camera not dialogue; even at the very beginning watch how he directs. The bounty killers arrive like in ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, the camera zooms in on their faces, one shows fear, another anger the last indifference. The physical environment is always hostile. Here, the wind blows everything around them all around. Very much like the author Steven Crane or other naturalists like Frank Norris. The environment is used as a mirror to you of the nature of human interaction within this universe: HOSTILE. They slowly walk, earning money the hard way, to confront the Ugly. If you want to see a one of a kind, completely different way of telling a story, with music and visuals, not prattling talking, watch Sergio Leone. See the difference between our over the top way of depicting evil and Leone's. Does Angel Eyes ride up and shoot everyone right away? No, he needs information, when he approaches the music changes to a sinister theme, his approach is visually majestic; there is something ominous about the approaching man. That wicked smile and laugh, oh nice family, you know, when I been paid I always see the job through. More is not better; the understated cold laugh, the joy of hurting others, his ruthlessness, that is evil my friends. How is you digestion now? Yet, look how terrifying he is. You never know what he is going to do next. If only today's filmmakers could learn that throwing gore about the screen is so boring. Evil is a coldness; an utter indifference to others you do not need to go beyond the core.Some critics say; what makes him the good? He kills just as much through the picture. Just two scenes establish him as the good. My favorite, they walk by a blown apart house, Tuco sees the dying man and scowls at Blondie for wasting time. Blondie covers him with his coat and gives him a cigar; just a tiny gesture, but the eyes look up at him with astonished gratefulness. So shines a good deed in a weary world. His soul escapes like the smoke from the cigar; another masterful scene. This is why he was the greatest director who ever lived. See how understated it all is with no dialogue. Yet, with the music and the visuals look at its power. Such a tiny thing, yet that is why he is good. The other scene where Tuco and Pablo came to blows and Tuco is bragging how his priest brother adores him after they came to blows, Blondie sees he is suffering and offers him a cigar. This was Sergio Leone.My favorite scene is not the duel which though well done was surpassed in ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, no Tuco running over the dead in a greed filled fury; this is the greatest scene of the film. What a depiction, by the socialist Leone, of the utter insanity of human greed and they truly do run over the dead, make no mistake about it. It starts so slow as he searches for the name Arch Stanton. It builds musically, in tempo, as the greed consumes him until he almost runs himself to death; what lust for money will do to human beings, Leone is showing us with the best simile for the total psychosis that is human greed. How all consuming; how oblivious to everyone and anything else. Watch the film for this scene. Yes, I like the duel; this scene has much more philosophical depth to it.In truth, everyone of his films is a real great piece of work, even the weakest FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE. His style is so unique; what a joy to be free of all that chatter; the beautiful music blended seamlessly with his visuals. Watch it and wish like me he had lived longer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the rare movies that bring joy to my heart when I re-watch it once every 2-3 years.At the basis it has a very straightforward adventure story about the treasure hunt. But it is the sophisticated embellishments that stand out - character development, brilliant acting, intelligent script and sharp dialogues, memorable score, fantastic photography, attention to historical detail, concealed humour, - the ingredients one may enjoy as a whole dish or give attention to and taste separately.Rather disparagingly called "spaghetti western" this movie stands well above most classical westerns, which seem simplistic, brutish, witless and lacking self-awareness in comparison - all up until Clint Eastwood' "Unforgiven".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the final installment of the splendid trilogy Leone that revolutionizes the concept of Western mid-sixties, and to which we owe the birth of superb trio professionals (actor, director, composer) that together first and each by his side later left an indelible mark on the history of filmmaking. Despite its long duration the film did not spare a single frame. All is sprinkled with black humor, (usually the magnificent Eli Wallach); and still have enough to portray the drama of a war of secession, where moral misery, equally distributed among the contenders time.&nbsp; The film is full of wide shots beautiful texture vintage aesthetic detail, and a photograph of first level; this immortal E. Morricone score correctly added inspiration, we understood why so differently western, next to the teacher as: Ford, Hawks, Mann, or Eastwood himself. Rarely has seen a soundtrack do grow so much a movie as in this film, the degree of complicity and knowledge between these two talents (Leone, Morricone) since they were classmates, is the trump card that's playing for that circumstance. The main theme of the soundtrack is synonymous with the Western par excellence. The originality of the final settlement, mixing classic chorus with the cawing of crows, (alluding to the character of the trio scavenger main characters), shows the level of nuance that is capable of reaching the Roman master Morricone.Although the film is billed western, the film transcends however that category; the projection Leone gives the script, make it one of those timeless classics to new creators significant influence. Just remember the sequence of mourning Mexican evident later Tarantino homage to one of the best final filmed in celluloid history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This masterpiece is the film which defines the Spaghetti Western.Clint Eastwood is good guy Blondie and the other two main characters, Tuco (Eli Wallach) and Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) veer between bad and ugly over the two and half hour duration of this film. The plot is long and winding, but is essentially fairly simple - three guys who don't trust each other trying to get their hands on a consigment of gold. We all know about the music - and Morricone's soundtrack is an undisputed masterpiece. If there is a better marriage of sound and vision in cinema than the last 15 minutes of this film, I have yet to see it. But it's more than just a music video - the direction from the legendary Sergio Leone is out of this world. This is an epic in every sense of the word - the battle against good and bad, a cast of hundreds in the Civil War scenes and camera work which makes no concessions to TV and uses the entire length of the screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, you heard me, the best Western ever. Everything about it is perfect, Acting, Filming, not to mention the genius director Sergio Leone. I watched "The Man with No Name Trilogy" in order, and i was very impressed with Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More. I had heard The Good, The Bad, And the Ugly was he best, but i had no idea how they could top the first 2 off. Trust me, they did. This film is darker than the first two, and also very funny. for Example when Blondie rescues Tuco from getting hung the second time and leaves him the desert for no reason what-so-ever. Than when Tuco finds a Town and goes to the gun shop, and the funniest part is when he is target practicing and shoots the first two in the head and shots em off. Than the 3rd won't budge and the store clerk smiles at him, than Tuco jumps on a board and the 3rd head falls off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach contribute excellent performances as they both end up going up against each other. In order to find where gold is buried in this timeless classic. The Good The Bad and The Ugly is simpily put excellent entertainment, the best western ever made and just plain fun. It's a movie that demands to be watched over and over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...to watch them again every other year with great delight. Alas, after a few frames you know you perfectly remember every single scene. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is such a feast people should be entitled to discover it more than once over a lifetime. Actually you can watch it again with friends, have your children enjoy it for the very first time and that's big time yet!I recently headed for the 175min version, showcased as the 'Original Italian release version', hoping to catch up with the pristine of the first sprightly running. And the winner is... not me for sure but the well devised marketing babble.First the original version makes no sense when you know the dubbed movie so well, plus Italian doesn't fit westerns when it's not your mother tongue. But most important, among the fistful of minutes more (14 exactly), you get only transitions scenes, which, at best, slows down the general pace. For example the first (and longest) patch only offers a square caveat of the gloomy war background Leone wanted to depict. So it heavily echoes the later scenes with wounded soldiers in the mission and dissolves the shock of the bridge battle scene where the horror and stupidity of war is much more striking. But the main flaw is it's only about Sentenza and Van Cleef displays the same experimented humane type he played in For a few dollars more while he is supposed to be The Bad in this movie.Shorthand: don't bother about the bloated 175min version. It's kind of a 'sneak preview' which Leone decided to trim after the initial release, so IT IS NOT a director's cut but only the last step before the final cut. A step that shouldn't appeal to you unless you're a cinema archaeologist with a sweet tooth for deleted species. And The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is now and again fresh and alive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Italian western hits almost all its marks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leone hits his stride -- it's beautiful, exciting, and very funny. The music is Morriconne's most famous and was worked out before the film was shot so effects could be coordinated with sound. The results are excellent. Eastwood is good, Van Cleef is as always campy fun, and Wallach is captivating as the best in the series of bandito/heroes in Leone's films. Good story introduces epic scope for the first time in a Leone film, marking a departure from the Boetticher/"psychological western" style of his first 2 westerns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's face it when ever western films are thought of this film is going to be bouncing around in your mind as well. Clint Eastwood continues as the man with no name in Sergio Leones third installment of the dollars trilogy and is without a doubt the best of the three (no offense to the other two which were still great westerns). This western is packed full with double crossing and stand offs and that is just the tip of the ice berg.For a western it has a really good set up story that all leads to its amazing, memorable, and iconic final scene. To put an outstanding cherry on top is Ennio Morricones epic score. If I had to hand out an award for all time greatest score I would be handing that award to Mr Morricone for his amazing work on this film.Overall this film is one of the best ways to use up almost 3 hours and is hardly ever dull if ever. If you love westerns and haven't seen this than I don't know what your waiting for you need to see this amazing film. This deserves its spot in the top 10 on imdbs top 250. Last thing to say is this is one of the all time greatest films. Thanks for reading my review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Western Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a legend. It changed the way we look at westerns. It's been endlessly imitated and parodied, but never equaled. It made Clint Eastwood a household name. And yet, as I watch The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I can't help but feel a little sad knowing that what is perhaps the greatest of all westerns was made in Italy. Yes, this is one of the much-maligned spaghetti westerns, but it's as far above the average entry in its genre as Star Wars is to Starship Troopers, or A Hard Day's Night to Spiceworld.Surely we're all familiar with the basics of the story. The mysterious gunman Blondie (Eastwood), the rough hewn bandit Tuco (Eli Wallach), and the heartless killer Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) search the west for a hidden cache of gold, as the Civil War rages around them. There are countless twists, turns and betrayals, as each man realizes he can't do this on his own. You can't be sure of anything, except that before the adventure is over, there's going to be one hell of a showdown.Sergio Leone has done an exceptional job of writing and directing. There's not one line of unnecessary dialog, in fact there's no dialog at all for many long stretches. And not since High Noon has a movie been as successful at slowly building tension. Of course in High Noon, the entire movie was buildup, until the final shootout. Here, Leone gradually builds tension in a scene, and then provides a stylistically violent payoff again and again.Nowhere does he do it better than in the final standoff, where each of the three leading characters have a gun trained on one of the others. They each know that whoever wins here will walk away one of the richest men in the west, but they're also aware that pulling the trigger has a very good chance of getting both them and their target killed. And yet, if two of them where to ally themselves against the third?. We in the audience are also fully aware of these facts, but the movie gives us no clue as to who will come out the loser. Leone has also produced something that is a true feast for the senses. Through use of long unbroken shots, he shows the vastness, solitude, and desolate beauty of the west. Mesas, canyon lands, endless sand dunes, and scrub forest are all lavishly photographed, as the wind whistles and dust flies on the breeze. His sunrises and sunsets are works of art. Looking at this movie, it's easy to forget that it was filmed in Europe. Leone has also added quirky touches, like the legless veteran who hangs out at the local saloon, quite literally dragging himself up to the counter, or the Union colonel obsessed with destroying the bridge he's supposed to guard, so there won't be anything fighting over and he can go home. Of course it's not just the director who's responsible a movie's success or failure. The actors matter as well, and much credit is due the leading men for their brilliant performances. Clint Eastwood has long been one of my favorite actors, and this is by far one of his best pieces of acting. As Blondie, he's as tough as nails, utterly cool under fire, and one of the most mysterious figures since Jeff Costello. There's little of his past; he's in a rather unique partnership with Tuco at the film's beginning, and there's a history with Angel Eyes, but we get no idea where he's from, or what life he led before becoming an outlaw. He doesn't talk much either, preferring to puff on his cigarette. But he clearly follows some form of personal code, and there's no doubt that he's one of- if not the- best gunmen in the west.Cleef's Angel Eyes is much more straightforward; he's the very embodiment of evil. This man has no qualms about killing. Indeed, he seems to relish causing death and suffering for its own sake, as when he smothers an elderly employer to death with a pillow, or carries out his iron-fisted rule of a Union prison camp. His every word drips with menace, and his smile is like gazing up death itself.But the most interesting character just might be Eli Wallach's Tuco. He's got a rap sheet a mile long, and he goes to great lengths to carry out his revenge on Blondie, but he doesn't have the same aura of menace as Angel Eyes. He lies, cheats, steals, and sometimes kills, but not so much because he's evil as because he has no concept of morality. He's also funniest guy on the screen. In one scene he's all sweet talk, your best pal; not that he's believable for a second. The next minute he's launching a hilarious obscenity-laced rant against you and your family. Tuco's reunion with his brother- a priest! - is one of the best comedy scenes in any western. There are other comedic touches as well, like the legless veteran who hangs around the saloons, walking on his arms, or the Union commander bent on destroying the bridge he's tasked with protecting so that the fighting will end.It's also refreshing how few clichés there are. There's no extraneous love interest, no Indian attacks or stampedes, and you never hear anyone shouting about "gathering up a posse." There is talking killer, but he's only a bit player, and Tuco lectures him on why you shouldn't talk when you can shoot- after shooting him, of courseBetween the acting, the action, the characters, the production values, and the originality, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is an achievement to rival the best of John Ford. Any fan of westerns, and anyone who enjoys good film should watch this one. It is truly one of the great movies.</fullReview>

This movie (yes, it's a plain, down to earth, good old-fashioned MOVIE), was histerically funny at times. It was sharp and witty at other times. And it was even sad at some points. But overall, it was fun to watch, which is a lot more than could be said for most of today's "entertainment". Whether it's historically accurate, I don't know. And I don't care.

		<shortDescription>Not good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was battling weather to give this movie a 4 Â? or 5, so I gave it the benefit of the doubt. Once you get that high in my books, itâ??s pretty much the same. The movie was amazing and was one of the best western movies I have seen. It runs three hours and although it did feel long, it wasnâ??t a bad thing. I kept on wanting to follow the characterâ??s journey to the end and find out what was going to happen, regardless of how long it took. The acting was great and the soundtrack was phenomenal. It added to the films mood immensely.This film obviously has inspired many modern filmmakers today (Rodriguez, Tarantino, among others) and I had to keep on reminding myself that this film was made in 1966. I either thought it was made with todayâ??s film techniques or some scenes were actually shot during the civil war time period. It really took me back and followed it up with a great story.The actors gave dialog in their native tongues and as a result there is a poor voice over synchronization throughout the movie. I found this slightly distracting at times, but it did not deter me from enjoying the film and Sergio Leoneâ??s great filmmaking brilliance shone through. The sweeping panoramic shots were incredible and appealing throughout the film as well.Although I loved the characters Blondie - The Good, played by Clint Eastwood and Angel Eyes - The Bad, played by Lee Van Cleef; Tuco - The Ugly, played by Eli Wallach had an absolutely great performance and pushed the film to a greater level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Western Movie With an Unforgettable Soundtrack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three bad guys ? the chaser of rewards Joe (Clint Eastwood), the outlaw Tuco (Eli Wallach) and the very bad assassin Angel Eyes ? become aware of a fortune of US$ 200,000.00 in golden coins, hidden in a cemetery. Only Joe knows the name of the grave, therefore there is a great dispute between the two gunmen, but always keeping Joe alive. This is a really classic western movie. This movie has never been released on VHS in Brazil, and only now the distributor Fox do Brasil' released on DVD format. I am a great fan of Sergio Leone, and the first DVD I bought for my collection was 'Once Upon the Time in America'. 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' is great in all aspects: the story is very funny, the actors have great performances, and the soundtrack from Enio Morricone is unforgettable: it is certainly one of the most beautiful and known in the cinema history. This movie is really a great entertainment. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Tr?s Homens em Conflito" ("Three Men in Conflict")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great Spaghetti Western film. I think this film has everything you would expect from Spaghetti Westerns. Clint Eastwood was great as the rugged, antisocial Blondie- the rogue anti-hero. The camera-work was also great as well from the sweeping long-shots of the desert to the close-up shots of the actor's faces. The soundtrack is iconic and did brilliantly in building tension. If I were to criticise this film for anything, I would say Sergio Leone did stretch out the film a little. He did overdo the tension building, particularly during the final standoff which could have been significantly shorter. Click here for my full review: http://goo.gl/UWWjLg</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So who's who?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bearing in mind that I think westerns are an American art form and I have an aversion to the European made ones, Sergio Leone's The Good The Bad And The Ugly has a lot to recommend it. Not the least of which the impact it had on Clint Eastwood's career making him an American icon.The Good The Bad And The Ugly follows an odyssey of three men, two of them a pair of lowlifes and the third no better than he ought to be in a search for buried gold. It's quite the odyssey that Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach, and Lee Van Cleef in those title roles have in search of the loot. A minor theater of the Civil War is operating in the west and all of them get caught up in it as well.Clint Eastwood developed and honed his laconic and cynical character who was in fact a good guy. Which gives you some idea of the bad guys he faced in his western films. Note that Clint Eastwood also never returned to the spaghetti western after this film.Van Cleef is his usual mean self, perhaps exponentially so. One thing about him is that he's a hired killer with a strong work ethic so I guess that counts for something. When he takes a contract he follows through. As for Wallach he dusts off his Mexican bandit characterization that served him so well in The Magnificent Seven is dusted off and embellished. At one point he's got Eastwood at his sadistic mercy, but when he learns of the loot, Wallach's greed gets the better of him.I don't consider this the great classic that many do, but The Good The Bad And The Ugly will satisfy most western fans.</fullReview>

It's a really interesting movie such as the plot and the storyline.I am thinking that at least one of the three protagonists of this movie (Eli Wallach, Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef) should have won an Oscar. I also think that maybe Sergio Leone should have won an Oscar for the direction and if not for this movie maybe for all the other good movies which has direct for example: For a few dollars more and A Fistful of Dollars.I like very much this movie because is a classic western movie with really good cast Clint Eastwood as The Good, Lee Van Cleef as The Bad and Eli Wallach as The Ugly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Spaghetti Western!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was the first of three masterpieces by the great Italian director Sergio Leone and the last of a trilogy of westerns which he made with Clint Eastwood, this marked a significant step-forward on the two previous films on which they had collaborated, ("A Fistfull of Dollars" and "For a Few Dollars More"). The 'Once upon a time ...' movies would see Leone's films take on a much darker turn but although there is quite a lot of violence and death on display here, this is an almost jovial epic, (the humour comes from Leone's subversion of traditional western clichés). Almost every sequence feels, and looks, like a classic, (the climatic gunfight has the choreographed precision of a ballet), Tonino Delli Colli's widescreen cinematography is magnificent, and although dubbed, (very effectively), the English translation of the Italian script is first-class.The plot is simplicity itself as Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef search for some buried gold but the plot is only the thread of a much richer tapestry centered round events in the American Civil War. Stylistically and thematically this film would later influence Eastwood as a director. At a time when, in America, the western seemed long past it's sell-by date, in Europe Leone's homages single-handedly revitalized the genre paving the way for a whole new breed of post-modernist classics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the Best Spaghetti Western Ever Filmed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Confederate cash box full of gold has been hidden and a notorious gunman nicknamed "Angel Eyes" (Lee Van Cleef) will kill anybody to get his hands on it. He represents "the Bad" in the title. Meanwhile, a murderous thief named "Tuco" (Eli Wallach) and a bounty hunter nicknamed "Blondie" (Clint Eastwood) have also found out about the hidden chest and forge an uneasy alliance between them in order to get their hands on it as well. These two represent "the Ugly" and "the Good" respectfully. That said, all three must overcome obstacles and treachery by each other to get what they are after. Anyway, having given a short synopsis of the movie I would just like to say that this is probably the best "Spaghetti Western" ever filmed. There is plenty of action, a good soundtrack and all three give excellent performances. And although it is a bit long (161 minutes) the story flows smoothly from one incredible scenario to another. Definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sergio Leone's story of three loners, loyal only to their quest for $200,000 in gold, set a new gold standard for the "western" genre. The famous score, trend setting direction and memorable amoral characters combine for a film touted as one of the greatest of all time. Yet, this Italian creation is plagued by horrible dubbing. making it hard to believe the film is set in Confederate country in the Civil War. No matter, as the other characters only serve to move the plot forward but do challenge your patience again and again in this long drama. Clint Eastwood cool and Eli Wallach shananigans carry the drama, while Lee Van Cleef adds a villain to root against. The final scene is enough to earn high praise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of Western movies, but I decided to watch this simply because it was in the Top 10 list from 250 on IMDb. And, I'll simply say...I was glad I saw this.There are not too many 3 hour films I can watch and not fall asleep; This is one, LOTR is another and that's pretty much it. Much like LOTR, to me 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' did not make me wanna put the film down, despite watching the 3 hour extended edition.****CHARACTERS****I loved the three main characters so much. Each were twisted, had their evil personality but at the same time each were so lovable. 'The Good' played by Clint Eastwood was actually my favorite, by a little margin. Despite being the good, he did dirty work like freeing Tuco, deserting him, killing people and so on, but he was such an interesting character. Tuco, the Ugly, was extremely lovable and made laugh on many occasions. His character had a lot of attention time and had great character development, just like the other two. I loved the character arcs. You really feel Tuco's need to get revenge on Blondie. It all made sense. The Bad, Angel Eye, was extremely awesome and stole the show much like Blondie whenever he was on screen. Angel Eye was simply evil, there wasn't anything else to him. I loved how at the scene where he interrogates the person, you understand what type of character he is. He is a ruthless, dangerous man who will not stop until each task is 100% complete. ****STORY****The second most important thing with a film is the story, and this film has a great, interesting story that makes you interested all the way until the very end. The story was moving, but it was the characters that moved the film along!****SOUNDTRACK***Normally, the soundtrack isn't a major aspect of a film but boy, this film had a memorable soundtrack. The best thing about it was that it was perfectly edited and the soundtrack itself gave you the excitement! It added further brilliance to the film.Overall, any who have not seen 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' must do so now, even if you are not a fan of Western movies. I myself haven't been a fan at all, nor did I like them at all, until I saw this masterpiece :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TGTBTU sets the standard of Westerns. The movie is fun to watch, has the classic bad guys, good guys, plenty of gun-slinging as well as an actual plot woven into it. The acting is very good by the primary actors; Eastwood, Wallach and Cleef. The directing is typical of Leone with lot's of close-ups to get the facial expressions, adding to the 'feel' of the moment. TGTBTU does contain some minor historical gaffs, but to the untrained eye, they are mostly subtle enough to not distract from the movie. TGTBTU never slows down enough to let a viewer become lost or distracted by other things; if viewing in-home, keep the 'pause button' handy. Another feature that I enjoyed is the loose connection between TGTBTU and the two previous films: Fist Full of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More.</fullReview>

While Blondie is too good, Tuco steals the show and pulls the movie to his credit. Script, photography are all good. Music, looks like came directly from heaven. Heynnas voice for Tuco just fits wonderfully well. I saw this movie some 10 times in last 5 years. Still I have not come out of its impact. God bless all those who have been associated with this epic. I recommend this film to everybody who loves art, stories, creativity, music. This is the finest creation from film world of any country, language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fourth Greatest Film of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is what a perfect film is, I admit it dose not have the best plot ever nevertheless that is made up for in every other aspect of the film. The camera shot when Angel Eyes is holding the candle holds amazing likeness to the shot that introduces Frank (Fonda) in Once Upon a Time in The West. Sergio Leone really takes his time to make the characters three dimensional, the amount of character he gives to Blondie, Angel Eyes and Tuco Ramirez is astounding. This film is about two things, the civil war and the three mens search for gold. The weird humour in it is absolutely brilliant. You can tell Leone put some real elbow grease into this movie. The charisma he gives Tuco is just perfect. And I can't believe I have not mentioned the music, it perfectly fits the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is Insane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a lot reviews out there - without summing up the obviousness of this movie's awesomeness I just felt compelled to add that i've seen hundreds of westerns let alone thousands of movies and yet I continue to watch this movie over and over - there is so much magic in this movie's score and its corresponding leitmotifs. At times the dialogue may seem funny and the movie seems slow but the weird thing about this movie vs. other movies (where this would be boring) this music plays a key element and the cinematography is so distinct that you can easily overlook it. As the film buffs/majors on this site will tell you, the frame of the camera shot is what dictates who can see who, which is amazing in that people suddenly pop into view with some badass line or two... Again, the score is not to be underestimated. Alongside the cinematography, you get lost in this quest for $200k of gold... The ridiculous scenes re: cinematography and music make this so different &amp; memorable from other westerns that are classics too (wild bunch, OK Corral, Winchester, etc) - the foreigness is apparent and adds to its allure. This is a great movie! I can't stop playing the parts i love in it!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was an interesting and exciting movie that tells an interesting story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I sat down with my family to watch this movie I thought oh no anther western. I was about ready to leave the room because of the annoying music, until the movie finely started. When it did it started with action which you don't see very often in movies. For a movie made in 1966 it was really good except for the sound was off a little and they would say something and there lips were talking before the sound of there voice came on, but after about a half hour in I didn't notice it. In the summary I said that it told a good story because the story filliped around a few times, I think that is why I liked the movie so much. This movie does not get boring if you watch it over a couple of times ether. Over all the movie was interesting and Clint Eastwood played his part really well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good The Bad and The Ugly:The Uncut Edition.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going downstairs the day after my birthday to check if any post had arrived,I was thrilled to discover that a very kind friend had sent me the uncut version of Sergio Leone's highly praised Spaghetti Western The Good The Bad And The Ugly on DVD as a surprise present!.With having found the last Leone film I had seen, (the extremely under rated A Fistful of Dynamite)to be amazing,I decided to get set right away and experience Leone's epic Spaghetti Western for the very first time?The plot:During the American Cival War,An outlaw called "Angel Eyes" interrogates a solider over the where abouts of a mysterious man called Jackson.Whilst Angel is busy interrogating,Tuco Ramirez narrowly gets away from being murdered by a gang who are desperate to collect the bounty on his head.Doing a pretty terrible job of staying undercover,Tuco is eventually gripped by a talented gunslinger called Blondie,who takes him to the local sheriffs office and collects the bounty on his head.Prepairing to take his last breath,Ramirez instead breaths a sigh of relief due to Blondie making a sudden appearance and running away with Tuco just before he is hanged.Getting away from the now crazy townsfolk,Blondie tells Ramirez that he has decided to make him a part of a sneaky con trick,which involves Blondie bringing Tuco "in" from town to town and collecting the wanted money for him from each of them.Although the plan does at first bring them both riches,Blondie eventually decides that Tuco is "worthless" and leaves him in the desert.As Blondie and Tuco play their dangerous games Angel Eyes starts to get closer to the truth when he finds out that Jackson has changed his name to Bill Carson and is now trying to keep a huge bundle of gold under wraps.Attempting to play the same conning game which he had performed so well in the past.Blondie is stopped dead in his tracks by an infuriated Ramirez,who gets hold of Blondie and begins to force him to go on a 100 mile walk across a burning hot desert.Starting to see Blondie's skin turn to dust,Ramirez begins to celebrate by waving the one bottle of water in front of Blondie's face.Suddenly Tuco's party in interrupted when a group of horses rush past with an ambulance stage coach behind them.Stopping the horses,Ramirez decides to take a look inside the deserted looking coach,and discovers that it is completely filled with dead bodies.Slowing emptying the dead bodies out,Tuco is left stunned when one of the dead bodies turns out to be a man called Bill Carson,who shortly before taking his final breath tells Ramirez about a box of gold that he has hidden in a graveyard on the other side of the US.View on the film:Seeing the opening credits going by with Ennio Morricone's stunning metallic score flowing over them,I began to wonder if the films screenplay would have quite a few jagged edges,due to the script being written not by one,but four people!.Impressivly the screenplay tremendously makes each of the three main characters distinct individuals and also unexpectedly keeps the films plot as one of the main centre pieces of the movie,with the initially three separate plot lines all joining up to create one wonderful thrilling Spaghetti Western as Angel Eyes,Tuco and Blondie's addiction in getting their hands on the gold starts to seep through their veins.Along with the makers of the of the film,I also feel that the makers of the 3 hour DVD deserve a big amount of praise for putting 18 minutes of "lost" footage smoothly back into the film,which really helps to widen Leones epic scope.Looking at the fantastic cast of the film,I first have to say that I feel Clint Eastwood did really well at not making "the man with no name" look like a mythical superhero cowboy but instead someone who whilst cunning,is also able to get caught by surprise and left to dry to death in the middle of nowhere.Despite being the one with the least amount of screen time out of the three main actors,Lee Van Cleef gives a menacing performance as Angel Eyes,who even when in the background of scenes gives the film a terrific chilling feeling of darkness descending on any area that he is closing in on.On the opposite side of the wicked Van Cleef and the smart,cunning Eastwood is the stunning Eli Wallach as Tuco.Although Eastwood is sadly the only star that features on the cover,Wallach proves that he more than deserves to be featured in the centre of the cover, as he creates an unforgettable love/hate friendship with Blondie as Tuco shows Blondie that he is far more intelligent than he may appear,and also creates a character that really helps the audience to enter "the world" of the film,due to Tuco having the perfect mix of a good comedic side and also having a charismatic go-with-the-flow attitude. Whilst the script,Morricone's music and the cast each bring something brilliant to the movie,director Sergio Leone has to be credited for bringing the films thrilling Wild West- Cival War setting to vivid life with his astonishing directing.One of the most interesting aspects that I found with this film,was that compared to his 1971 equally stunning (but much bleaker) A Fistful of Dynamite Leone has his characters act in a more observer role instead of getting pulled into the total bleakness of the Cival War that is taking place around them. By putting the main focus on the chase for the gold,Leone has made one of the fastest moving 3 hours that I have ever seen!.From the almost three dimensional,fantastic endless sets to the nail-biting gun battles where Leone uses his elegant wide shots to show the distant between each character and his beautiful extreme close-ups to build up a huge amount of tension,which when released makes this an unforgettable film which you will be desperate to watch again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good, the Bad &amp; The Ugly... and The Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ask any Nigerian movie fan his best Western movie(In Nigeria we call the genre the more unpretentious "cowboy movie") and nine out of ten will tell you without hesitation The Good, The Bad &amp; The Ugly. In a country where cowboy movies are at the bottom of ladder in the scale of movie genres, it is amazing that The Good remains an evergreen classic in Nigeria.But then, The Good, The Bad &amp; The Ugly is an amazing film and with each viewing, the film simply becomes better and better.The plot is a bit lacklustre and maybe a bit confusing, with countless other sub plots that may or may not drive the main narrative and is too long with paced out scenes. But despite all this-or maybe because of it-the film is a three hour spectacle of shameless thrills that will glue you to your seat.The film revolves around three crooks searching for $200,000 in stolen gold. It is not "good guys against the bad guys", but who will win among the bad guys. Don't expect morality tales like Dancing With Wolves, Shane or John Wayne movies. All the protagonists are mainly selfish opportunistic greedy killers wanting to steal the proceeds of a heist by another bunch of killers.Clint Eastwood is "The Good", an anti-hero, a crook who masquerades himself as a bounty hunter. He is The Man With No Name (Nicknamed Blondie by his Mexican ally) who has his own code of honour. He does not hesitate to kill without mercy when threatened but is not a sadist. In fact, he shows little acts of kindness like when he shares his cigar with a dying confederate soldier. He does not talk much, using his eyes and his gun to do the talking for him. In all of Eastwood's strong silent roles, I consider this his most riveting.Lee Van Cleef "The Bad", paradoxically named "Angeleyes" is the opposite of Clint. He is a gun for hire, a soldier of fortune(literally) and one ruthless bad ass. He relishes his killings and indulges in sadistic torture to get what he wants. In a brutahl scene, he kills two men who hired him to kill each other. One was a cripple with a family, the other a sick old man in his bed. Cleef played this bad ass role with an aplomb that will always make him a powerful screen presence in all his movies. His menacing evil and "don't mess with me" attitude is obvious even when he is motionless.Eli Wallach in the role of "Tuco The Ugly" is not much better than Angeleyes, except that Angeleyes is more refined in his crimes. He is a Mexican bandit whose list of crimes include robbery, murder, rape, and having sexual relations with a "female member of a white race". He is the most complex of the characters who oscillates between being Blondie's friend/ally, and his deadliest enemy. Eli Wallah was born for this role. Even though he has third billing, he is the most recognizable character and effortlessly stole every scene he was in with his garrulous comic antics. And that makes us perversely love him, even more than Blondie.Worthy of mention, is Ennio Morricone's score. Check out the incredibly haunting score during Tuco's mad dash in the cemetery or the mournful score in the prison camp. They were amazing but both pale to nothing in comparison to the film's incredible score in the credits. It will stick in your mind forever. It is easily the most recognizable film score in the world.Sergio Leone delivered a masterpiece and none of his films can hold water to it. In fact no Western can be compared to Leone's masterpiece. He captured the grit of that era like no mainstream Hollywood Western can achieve. The barren landscapes, the deserts, the bleak depressing environment, the hard characters with their lined faces and hard eyes. The gun duels are exaggerated but beautifully executed and the last triangle duel had a touch of spiritual poetry which is hypnotic.This film is stunning and remains one of my favourite film and definitely my favourite Western.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is without a doubt my all-time favorite western.The beginning of the film is so memorable, with the young, rough good-looks of Eastwood being labeled "The Good", the absolutely evil look of Lee Van Cleef being labeled "The Bad", and a dirty, unkempt, desperado Eli Wallach with booze and food flying being labeled "The Ugly". The ending fight scene with its 3-way showdown is one of the most memorable pieces of film I have ever watched.Leone did a great job with the camera direction in this movie and the acting is impressive. Eastwood, Van Cleef, and Wallach are absolutely fantastic.The only thing that might scare some viewers off is the length of the film. It is long, but you just don't seem to notice it when you are watching the film - you are just too damn busy watching the best classic western of all time.Do yourself a favor and rent this movie if you haven't seen it. If there was ever a perfect western, this is it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In this review, I discuss the film's music.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Effects of the Music in the Film The Good the Bad and the Ugly by Brian CoatneyThe Good the Bad and the Ugly made its indelible imprint in 1966 as the third of the Spaghetti Western trilogy, and it remains a piece of cultural lore even today for its inimitable synchronization of music and acting that produce dramatic tension neither the music or acting alone could generate. With a script that violently veers from traditional Western themes, Sergio Leone's artistic classic changed American culture as much as Woodstock did. Only a book could detail all the interesting aspects of the film, but here, I will comment on the music. Music is universal and sometimes music strikes us in a way we're not even conscious of, and it draws us with a power and mystique we can't yet identify and probably don't give that much thought to at first. Don't we often respond first by liking or disliking something before we know how to analyze why? So it was with the music in the Good the Bad and the Ugly. All I knew was that the music created an alluring mood in a mysterious and enticing way, giving the sense of what film critic Bill Warren calls an "astonishing score." The music is, in fact, exceedingly more than mere background or accompaniment to the film's action; its "lonely, mournful scores are inseparable from the film" (Ebert). Critic Vince Leo says that Morricone's score enabled the film to go from "good film to masterpiece." Not only that, "Unlike most films, where the composer would create the music based on what happens on the screen, it is said that Leone worked the opposite way, constructing scenes to fit the pieces of music" (Leo). One might say that with The Good the Bad and the Ugly, we enjoy a film made for its soundtrack rather than a soundtrack made for a film. If asked to describe the music of the film without reference to research, I would have described it like this: full of melody, a whistle pipe sound, rattle snake clicking at times, escalating tension on some kind of stringed instrument, slightly orchestral sounds, choral?like chanting voices, dramatic and paced buildup of tension?all of which was not overpowered with bass, rhythm, and vocals, meaning therefore not a band trying to create a full sound at high amperage. Somehow the music linked to the action, or shall I say non-action; for the music came into presence most it seemed when the characters stopped, spoke little, and hovered on the verge of a new twist in the drama: someone was about to draw, see an ominous presence, or experience an encounter of deep pathos and random violence?violence random to the victim but part of the consuming scheme of getting the gold buried in the graveyard somewhere. The famous signature score for the film came to signify in popular culture, a dramatic moment with peril in the air, a kind of pop icon score tied to antiheroes and subjugation of one person's dreams to those of another. A look at the critics fills in the detail that clarifies exactly what Morricone did. Max Garrone calls the film "balletic violence," with its "grand arias of whoops, whistles, Jew's-harps, gunshots and other errata." Also, we learn that the sound comes from a "blend of guitars, drums, and hyena-like cries from the singers" (Leo). Getting more precise, Warren points out that Morrricone, "blends elements of Mexican mariachi music with contemporary jazz, sweeping orchestral passages, choral voices, and an overall vividly distinctive approach." The music so much penetrates the film that it "incorporates the howl of a coyote?the first thing we hear in the movie itself?into the themes he creates for each title character, though the wail is orchestrated very differently each time" (Warren). Director, Serge Leone, then must mean for us to hear the coyote's pathos in each character, whether good, bad, or ugly?a wail that gives us the prime musical elixir that penetrates and binds together the film's tone of deep pathos.

		<shortDescription>If you never watched this film because you thought it looked boring...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Then, respectively, You Sir or Madam are a fool. Badly dubbed, sillily cast and horribly underloved, this is possibly the greatest caper of its time and ever since. In a time of Hollywood heroes, horrifying villains and not many people in between, Leone submits one of his many masterpieces to exhibition, at a time when America had given up on the western because it had nowhere else to go. This film offers no heroes, gives you a villain and places a slimy little dog like tuco into the midst of the most realistic portrayal of the west the way it was. Sad, lonely and most certainly devoid of John Ford colour. Ironic really that one of the most loved westerns of all time was made in Europe. Good job really, though. The Americans never could get their history right. Clint has never been so squinty, Wallach so perfectly cast and Leone so frankly plain. Film fans, this is a must see. But if you are a casual viewer you may want to steer clear, for only a tide of angry rebuttal awaits your confusion and refutation on the web.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It goes out with a bang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now this is what a great spaghetti western is all about and once again the third installment delivers. It just seems this trilogy gets better by each installment. This movie maybe the notorious out of the three films in this trilogy but I think I liked the second one the best. But overall I just have to give this movie a higher score by slightly because of the pacing of it all. The pacing to "For a Few Dollars More" was slow. This movie even has a trademark western theme that will be used in many parodies to come. Like the title there is three main characters in this movie and each one brings a lot to the table, I first thought The Ugly would be the one left in the shadow. But that character stands out a lot to this movie and brings life into it. Despite his devious and mischievous characteristics he is still sort of likable. The Bad is played by Lee Van Cleef and he does a good job of portraying the charismatic and yet ruthless villain in this movie. The good is more of a anti-hero of sort than actually a good guy, but he does still have that code of honor which he carried with him during the previous films. He is cool and calm gunslinger but just isn't the good guy in this story. Anyways the character Tuco aka The Ugly surprising stood out a lot in this, I mentioned it before but he is really good with his role and slightly reminded me of Jack Sparrow when it came to his characteristics and mannerisms. Not a lot but very slightly. Each and every character from the three stands out. And when it comes to the plot it boils down to the three gunfighters going after $200,000 in stolen gold. And it takes place during the civil war so there is many obstacles they must overcome, including each other. Compared to the previous two film in this trilogy this one is most definitely the most character driven one and has a lot of character development. This movie is the longest one out of this trilogy but is the fastest paced on as well and most of the running time of this movie isn't wasted. From the story direction, character development and music really gives off the feel of a classic western. Sergio Leone done it once again in creating a memorable western that goes out with a bang.8.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish, cynical, brutal, humorous and epic - this film has it all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly will always be near the pinnacle of the western genre. There are several reasons for this. For one thing, it has never really dated at all in all these years. The immorality of its central three characters is a factor of course. The black and white moral certainties of the traditional American western are nowhere to be found here. One of the reasons for this is the film's Italian origins. The movies of Italy had no qualms with projecting morally ambiguous heroes onto the screen. Nor did they see any issue with and filling their stories with plenty of violence. Add to this, the Italian tradition of operatic drama and you have the basic ingredients of the spaghetti western. The immorality, cynicism, violence and operatic sense of drama were the template where this most American of genres was filtered through, the result was a somewhat distinctive sub-genre.But what makes The Good, the Bad and the Ugly stand out from most spaghetti westerns is because of the personnel behind and in front of the camera. Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and, especially, Eli Wallach all shine in their respective roles of 'the good', 'the bad' and 'the ugly'. While behind the scenes were two monumental cinematic giants in the form of director Sergio Leone and composer Ennio Morricone. These latter two form one of the most outstanding director-composer partnerships in the history of the medium. Leone shoots the film with consummate brilliance, with extreme close-ups and widescreen vistas; he has an understanding of cinematic space like few others, while he paces events within that space in a highly individual way - he takes his time, is quite minimalistic yet is always dramatic and at times epic. Of course the film would not be anywhere near the masterpiece it is without the contribution of Morricone. The soundtrack in this film is quite honestly legendary. If you were to have looked at his ideas on paper without hearing the end result you would be forgiven for thinking that this music would be wildly inappropriate for a western - electric guitars, feedback, chanting, avant-garde elements - yet it hardly needs saying that the result is one of the greatest examples of film music ever composed. It will always remain so.The fact that the film is epic, yet simultaneously tough, muscular and cynical is a somewhat unusual combination. It's storyline of greed, betrayal and brutality is not one usually given the epic treatment. No doubt this is one of the aspects that confused critics back in the 60's who disparaged this film. It does seem extraordinary from a modern perspective that this movie was greeted with a lukewarm reception. But I suppose this may explain why it seems nowadays to not have dated at all - it was clearly ahead of its time. Its fair to say that this will always be a template example of the western genre, and one of the great films in general.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is a masterpiece. However way you put it, it boils down to this. It's by far the best of Leone's 'Man With No Name' trilogy, and in all likelihood the best western film ever made; and like The Godfather, it's one of those rare films that satisfy completely both as entertainment and as art.The artistic elements in the film come together fantastically well. It's perfectly shot, edited and scored. In fact, the final scene is one of the finest examples in cinema history of an inspired composition of sound and image.It's the best film of Clint Eastwood's career, and his most iconic performance, but it's not the best performance in the film - Eli Wallach spectacularly steals the show from right under his nose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe the greatest movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this a few weeks ago for the first time on an actual TV set (as opposed to a computer), and I will tell you: it STILL resonates with me. I am in awe at practically everything about this movie. The story is indelible -- a chase across the wild Civil War laden frontier for a supposed $200,000 of stolen Confederate gold buried in a cemetery somewhere. All sorts of gunshots fired, men fallen, twists and turns of faith within the plot -- you never know what to expect next. The relationship between Blondie (Clint Eastwood) and Tuco (Eli Wallach) is so ambivalent that it's entertaining. Each strands the other in the middle of a vast desert, each has opportunities to kill the other. But ultimately they team up with the common goal of acquiring great riches - - though you never know when someone may turn on the other.The acting is done perfectly. Eastwood plays Blondie to be the quintessential bad-ass, the man we all wish we could be, who's got no fear to kill but ultimately has good intentions. Then Wallach portrays Tuco as "The Ugly", which is convincingly done as Tuco is preoccupied with material objects rather than things like faith and friendship. He rushes Blondie to recovery only when Blondie's survival is mandatory to find Bill Carson's hidden gold. Tuco conceals his sins (which include greed, lust, wrath, drinking, etc.) with constant prayer and reference to the Lord. I find this to be especially intriguing. It echoes the real world phenomenon where the most religious people are often the ones who are most befallen by vice. Tuco wants to believe that he's as worthy as his brother (who is leading an actual Catholic mission), but is committed to doing whatever it takes to satisfy himself, at no matter what cost.On that note, I find it amusing analyzing the difference between "The Ugly" and "The Bad" (which was spectacularly portrayed by Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef)). At first thought, both titles seem negative, but that doesn't mean they are identical. In fact, it doesn't even mean that both are the exact opposite of "The Good". While Angel Eyes may be characterized by greed, and finds it acceptable to physically assault prisoners of war and anyone that stands in his way, he is markedly more intelligent and more self-respecting and resourceful than Tuco. At the Yankee prison, Angel Eyes doesn't even bother beating Blondie to get information on the location of the gold, figuring that he's "smart enough to know that talking won't save (him)", this just after he tortured Tuco, who succumbed. Angel Eyes clearly views Blondie as a more capable traveling companion. In other words The Bad has a sharp eye for detecting and appreciating the assets of The Good, whereas The Ugly doesn't have much keenness of any kind, only seeking to serve himself through sensual pleasures. Also at the end of the movie, just before the final showdown, Angel Eyes seems to understand the sporting nature of Blondie's wish to duel for the rock at the cemetery's center (which supposedly bears the name of the grave where the money is), while Tuco seems to merely be along for the ride, only accepting the challenge because of the possible reward. Note that The Bad's entertainment seems to normally arrive through mental means -- his battery of the prisoners allows him to assert dominance over them. He "always sees the job through", showing resoluteness and conviction. Perhaps this indicates that The Bad is more similar to The Good than The Ugly is. While The Bad may utilize his assets of intelligence, strength, and persistence corruptly, at least he HAS them, like The Good and unlike The Ugly. The Ugly seemingly has no hope to ever become a respectable figure, as he hypocritically worships a god yet displays insolence towards real people and ideas that are worthy of reverence. This complements the idea that being good isn't only about possessing favorable traits and abilities, but also about cultivating them through good habits.There are too many epic scenes in this film to list them all here. There are the escapes of Tuco from the gallows after Blondie shoots the rope that holds him aloft. There's Tuco's surreptitious entry through Blondie's window at the inn, the bathtub gun-pull scene, the bombing of Branston Bridge. The fact that the captain witnesses the explosion of that "damn bridge" that he wanted so badly to see annihilated, while he lays wounded and just as he dies quietly upon the neighboring hill.....still gives me chills when I think about it. A truly poetic and uplifting moment that was.But what truly ties all these great aspects of this film together is the musical score by Ennio Morricone. It is absolutely magnificent -- as good as any music you will ever hear. It penetrates the mind and brings the action and emotions of the set and the characters right to you, be it during the ethereal scene that features Tuco's epic frolic through the cemetery in pursuit of the grave, during the three-man shootout shortly following that (which is an incredible innovation by Sergio Leone that makes you wonder how it had never been attempted before), or during the poignant scenes at the Yankee camp when prisoners were forced to play that nostalgic sounding music against their own will. I have never heard a soundtrack so powerful as the one that guides The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, and perhaps that is fitting, since I can't say I have ever seen a film as undoubtedly splendid as The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Authentic in its Ugliness, Intense in its Badness and Operatic in its Goodness ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>INTRODUCTION :A nasty face full of scars and sunburns suddenly fills the screen, covering the extended vision of the Sierra landscape : a curious opening, creating two incongruous feelings of authentic yet comical ugliness. This sums up the very essence of the 'Western Spaghetti', a pivotal sub-genre that traced the singular evolution, hence the survival, of the Western genre in two polar opposite directions : the "anticonformity" and the "overconformity" or let's just simplify and say "demystification" and "amplification".DEMYSTIFACTION: Akira Kurosawa's innovative "Yojinbo" ended the classic 'good vs. bad' antagonism, which directly inspired Sergio Leone. Like "A Fistful of Dollars", the realism of "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" lies within the lack of morality of the three main characters, each of them has malicious motives. Leone's intuition over using Kurosawa's characterizations proved to be useful for the Western genre that was begging for a metamorphosis. John Ford's era was over, and with all due respect to John Wayne, everyone knew how the West was Won, and were tired of the pompous idealism displayed, despite the breath-taking imagery of Monument Valley. Even the mythic Civil War, the powerful symbol of the fraternal fight that ultimately consolidated the American spirit, is treated like a vulgar subplot, which somewhat betrays the foreign aspect of the film, and in the same way, sweeps off all the dust of semi-propaganda stuff disguised in entertainment. The myth was agonizing, and the 'Western Spaghetti' genre proceeded to a sort of creative destruction.Take the three main characters, the irony in the title, is that all their 'nicknames' are interchangeable, there is something ugly in the bad, and vice versa, and the good isn't 'boy-scout' good. Listen to the opening credits, flute for Blondie, Clint Eastwood as the Good, ocarina for Sentenza, Lee Van Cleef as the Bad and human voices for Eli Wallach as Tuco, the Ugly. Different instruments were used for each but they all play the same iconic melody, inspired from the howling of a coyote. Symbolically, each character is different, but the deadly greed inhabiting their hearts is the same, it's "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" rather than "The Good vs. the Bad vs. the Ugly". Their relationships are all tactical, cynical and hypocritical, with friendships based on a mutual need to reach a hidden gold. The Good and the Bad need each other, because they know half the secret about the gold's location, and Sentenza, need them alive to find it. They're all tied to each other until the strongest and cleverest wins; this was the humanistic reality during the dark ages of the last century.AMPLIFICATION: I guess the fact that I watched it for the first time when I was 10, built my personal affection to the film, because at that age, my expectations were not tarnished by the cynicism of the classic know-it-all film buff. For me, the three characters were not similar; the Good was the hero, the Bad, the villain, and the Ugly, the comic relief. They happen to be the only recognizable actors' faces in the film, but it hardly matters because we don't need them overshadowed by other supporting performances. Eli Wallach, in a career-defining role, is the fastest talking and provides the best moments of the film as the indisputable scene stealer. His humor also relies on the exciting duo he formed with Blondie whose cool sense of humor, and cynical detachment proved at many occasions to be the yin to Tuco's yang. And Lee Van Cleef is the senseless, cold-blooded killer who makes the Ugly look Good. He represents the dark side of the film, a man who always finishes his job, and from the first scene involving him, I took him as the bad guy of the story. The characterization is why I loved the film both as a kid and as a movie buff.The line between amplification and parody is very thin, but there's a difference. When parody takes all the conventions into derision, amplification insists on them, providing the typical Leonesque shots. Time is dilated, locations are magnified, like belonging to a unique dimension, and the whole film oscillates between extreme close-ups and extended shots from very far away. All the effects are amplified with cinematic hyperbolas exceeding the limit of believability. In his 'Great Movies' review, Ebert stated that Leone invented a rule which consisted on the characters' point of view limited by the screen. I never understood until I re-watched the film and got it, and I respect Leone even more for having pushed the limits of creativity to this point since most of the greatest effects from the film depend on that rule, and are transcended by the iconic score of the musical genius, Ennio Morricone. "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" has all the tragic, comic, epic and musical elements that makes it a kind of operatic masterpiece.CONCLUSION :Film-making is far from being an exact science, and you can make a masterpiece out of the least complex plot elements, the lowest budget, and the cleverest directorial tricks. Not to diminish the quality of Leone's "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" but the point is that the movie works as if it was self-aware of its own restrictions and transcended it with a magic that another director, wouldn't have judged necessary. Some apparent weaknesses are sometimes the necessary drivers to push the creation to the limit of genius while confidence can work as a tricky obstacle, maybe that explains why "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" is the highest ranked Western on IMDb Top 250 and undoubtedly the most iconic.So, to conclude, I would simply say that there's two kinds of people in this world, those who love the film, and those who don't get it ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When all westerns are forgotten... There will be The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Top 250: 4In the final chapter of the Dollars trilogy, 3 men search for a stash of Confederate gold. The road there, and how it all plays out, is pure movie magic.Right from the start, you know this is going to be an essential. The three men, slowly walking towards each other, then opening the door, BANG BANG BANG... then the Ugly, with his twisted expression and meat in hand, mid jump. Then an epic plot begins to unfurl, and yes, GBU is very epic in every sense of the word, and exceeds its predecessors in every way.The plot of this film is less straightforward than in the previous installments. There are now three characters that demand your attention, and they're all after the same thing. It's like the best treasure hunt ever. While in the other Dollars movies the first 25 or so minutes are cloudy and require lots of thinking to comprehend what's happening, GBU lays it all out to see the whole way through. Filled with great fights, battles and a very tense conclusion, the Good the Bad and the Ugly's story will grab your attention for its 3 hour runtime.I didn't like that Clint had to share the spotlight in A Few Dollars More. But here, it's not only acceptable, but exceptional because of who and what he shares it with. Lee Van Cleef expertly handles the ruthless Angel Eyes, who will do whatever the job as long as he is paid. Eli Wallach becomes Tuco, the crazy bandit whose only allegiance is to himself and his money, and Clint plays Blondie, the 'good guy' , who fights for himself, cash, and whatever else he feels like. 3 standout, differentiated characters, each with names other than their respective actors. It may not be a big deal to you, but I like each character's nicknames.Each character is deep and layered, with moral haze that leads to some very intense scenarios. Who will betray who, and when, is asked by the viewer several times during the run of the film. The characters stand out, and a very well acted.As usual, the music is perfect, drawing from the earlier Dollars movies and creating a new score. It perfectly sets the tone. The Confederate soldiers sadly singing to drown out torture is an incredibly sorrowful tune.The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is brilliant cinema from start to finish. In fact, it is the closest thing I've seen since the Godfather to be considered by me as a perfect film: the plot, characters, music, camera-work and ending are sublime. It's a subtle, stylish masterpiece that shouldn't just be seen by fans of the genre, it should be seen by anyone who likes movies. 9.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, this is my first review, so I thought it might as well be for my favorite film. I just love everything about this film, the writing, the cinematography, the cast, Ennio Morricone's score, everything. Even the title gives the film more depth as the film has to prove to you that Blondie is the good, Tuco is the ugly and Angel Eyes is the bad. Each is proved in a different way. With Blondie, we have serious doubts when we first see the title "The Good" under his picture right after he leaves Tuco in the desert. As the movie goes on we slowly come to realize that though he may not be a saint, he is certainly better than his two counterparts, this is proved at the very end when he allows Tuco to keep his share of the gold, even though he could have easily taken it all for himself. This is something we cannot imagine Angel Eyes or Tuco doing. With Tuco, it's different, we first see "The Ugly" title when we first see him and we are not even sure what it means, the best conclusion we can come to perhaps is that he certainly doesn't look very attractive in the scene. But we later see that 'ugly' is meant to mean pitiful in this situation, because although Tuco is a vile character, we pity him because we find out about his past. Finally there's Angel Eyes, with him we have no doubts about the text "The Bad" which appears after he murders his employer, this certitude of his evil nature is reaffirmed throughout the film. So the character development in this film seems not so much to be with the characters but with our own perception of them.Opinions vary about what the film really is. Is it a satire of westerns? Is it a an antiwar film? Is it camp? Is it art? Is it all of these things maybe? I think perhaps Leone left the film to the viewers own interpretation, and that, I suppose, is the way art is.This films does have a few small flaws: 1.The Ecstasy of Gold scene is a little unbelievable, could a person like Tuco, who seems to struggle with reading, find the name on a grave while running through a graveyard in circles? This scene is also a little hard to watch because the camera follows Tuco very fast, causing the screen to blur. This does work artistically however as it seems to have present a "blinded with greed" metaphor. 2. There are a few other unrealistic scenes, such as the one where Tuco and Blondie walk through an abandoned town and kill Angel eyes men , conveniently placed cannon shots aid them and they kill men shooting from the hip, while the Angel Eyes men carefully aim and miss. The flaws in this film are easily outweighed by it's strengths however: 1. The characters are very well written and portrayed. 2. The pacing is superb (it seemed no longer then A Fistful of Dollars really). 3. The story, while not one of the films stronger aspects, is still very good. 4. The dialog is brilliant. 5. It has one of the greatest scores of all time. 6. The cinematography is stunning. Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo is truly a great piece of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Notably the best spaghetti western ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It's not a joke, it's a rope, Tuco. Now I want you to get up there and put you head in that noose".-'Blondie' Clint EastwoodSpaghetti westerns aren't easy films to make. The cinematography, acting, direction, and lines ALL have to be perfected. There has to be some kind of a 'spark' towards this kind of western. People either hate it or love it. I love this film!'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' was a forging masterpiece, that bought me to the conclusion that Sergio Leone was one of the great directors of the decade. His other works were great and highly praise, but this film was him at his very best. It's too bad we don't get these kind of films anymore.This unforgettable masterpiece is a piece of delusional art. Its weighed by masterful performances, outstanding direction, and the best soundtrack of all-time (in my opinion). The exaggerated storyline may be heavy, but again, its weighed.Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach, and Lee Van Cleef give adorable performances in this film, but Wallach is the 'show-stealer'. He demonstrates a great understanding towards his character and is full of heart. He also carries the film very well, because of this. Eastwood is slick, causing unbelievable chemistry between his and Wallach's character. Lee Van Cleef is amazing in his brief, yet undeniable role.Sergio Leone's direction is sophisticated and full of depth. The kind of camera angles used are beautiful. Cinematography is staggering, just at the right speed.I haven't a heard a better soundtrack from any film. The laughable and hilarious skills used to put them in this film are shady. The main theme is one of my most favorite parts of this film.Storyline is at time silly, but its so hilarious that its hard not to see this film. There also isn't much dialogue in this, but there are so many memorable quotes, that you almost forget that.Overall, nobody should miss this film. If you like Western Movies, you will be stupid not to have seen this. No surprised to hear that this is 4th on the 'IMDB 250'. It's third on my top favorites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic masterpiece for the ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exactly one year ago, I wrote my first reviews on this web site and this one is my review number one hundred. To underline and celebrate this kind of anniversary, I decided to pick one of my favourite movies of all times.Everything about this movie just seems perfect to me.Let's start with the director's work. Sergio Leone is one of the most gifted directors of all times and he had a feeling for monumental and impressing landscapes. His images are as epic as the scripts and stories. I also adore the way he captures the emotions of its actors. The devil is in the detail as he concentrates on seemingly instinctual nervous movements and actions, the impressions of the actor's faces and especially the looks of their eyes. Even almost fifty years after the release of this monumental milestone of the western genre, his way of filming remains unbeaten and unreached. It is emotional, well crafted and perfectly organized.The filming goes hand in hand with the majestic score of the movie. Ennio Morricone is maybe the greatest composer for cinema alive. The instruments are diversified, the melodies epic and still catchy and filled with emotions of pressure, anger, despair, hope and joy that fusion perfectly with the chosen images. Without the music, often only chosen randomly to underline a conceptual background by many others, the movie wouldn't be the same. Sergio Leone really knew what he wanted and I music has never had such an important role in a movie since the end of the age of silent films. Without the works of Morricone, there would have been no place for many grand composers such as John Williams or Hans Zimmer that create stunning soundtracks nowadays.Another amazing thing is the acting around the three key personalities. Lee van Cleef as Angel Eyes does the best work of his career as a cold hearted, pitiless and cool villain with an eerie look. He is not the usual bad guy but a rather silent, patient and intellectual villain and this what makes him appear so cruel and dangerous. Eli Wallach as Tuco, one of my favourite actors of all times, does also the best job of his long career in this movie. He plays an ugly little bandit that seems to be naive, superficial and rude at first sight but turns out to be much more diversified and is finally a crafty, darkly humorous and brutal villain that is nevertheless very sympathetic because of his high degree of charisma and the high amount of bad coincidences that he lives throughout the whole movie. Finally, Clint Eastwood as Blondie does also an amazing job and has developed since the first two movies he had done with Sergio Leone before. In this movie, he is extremely smart, calm and thoughtful but nevertheless a mean villain that plans and organizes everything at his advantage and that never stops to surprise. Those three memorable actors at the peak of their early careers have an amazing chemistry and I have never ever seen a movie with three outstanding actors. Normally, there are one or rarely two actors that give good movies a certain kind of soul and creativity, but this movie is graced by the works of three great actors. If that was not already enough, the supporting actors such as Aldo Giuffr? as a drunk and desperate Union Captain that befriends with the characters of Wallach and Eastwood.One must also underline the story itself. It takes the time to slowly introduce each of the characters in their own special ways. The viewer gets the time to get used and connect with them before the main plot kicks off which is an unusual and great idea. The further development reveals more and more about the characters and their past. Lee van Cleef is shown as he fulfils his dirty works and contracts, Eli Wallach meets his brother, a catholic friar that confronts him with old family problems and Clint Eastwood remains the tough vagabond and mysterious man without a name. The story is filled with many memorable and diversified situations, connecting a the elements of a treasure chase with a tale of revenge and scenes of the American Civil War. The movie is not just a western, it's has some slight social touches that look behind the brutal characters and gore or desperate war or prison scenes. The movie has some touches of a drama, an anti war movie, a satire of the usual westerns and an epic adventure flick. There is much to discover and analyze beyond the main plot that is a breathtaking treasure chase filled with cliffhangers.Finally, this movie has also had an important influence on an entire genre. The Italian spaghetti western genre got finally accepted and boomed as well as the whole western genre. The movie made an incredible gross with a very low budget. Many critics regard this movie as a classic nowadays and even people which use to hate westerns happen to like this flick, especially women. That's why this movie is way more than just a western, it is an epic masterpiece for the ages and everybody that disagrees on that has a very subjective point of view because the artistic factor of this flick is very elevated and the acting memorable. Everybody that hasn't seen this movie yet should do this right now, it is one of those movies one should have seen at least once in a lifetime. Personally, I watch this flick at least once a year and I'm always looking forward to it and never get bored. I happen to invite friends that don't know this movie yet to open their minds and until now, I never got less than enthusiastic comments.I would say that this movie is probably my favourite one of all times until now and will surely stay in my eternal top five.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good, The Bad, and the Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no problem with saying that The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly is the most overrated western of all time. I'm not trying to say the movie is bad but it ultimately fails in comparison to Fistfull of Dollars. First of all this movie is way too long. About 3 hours long which is way too long for a movie such as this. The story is basically about three guys who are seeking confederate gold hidden in a cemetery. The story is simple but also effective. But for such a simple story why would the movie be so long and drawn out? Scenes seem to take forever to progress forward. Another thing is that Lee Van Cleef is scarcely shown on screen which just leaves Eli and Eastwood on screen most of the time. The music is spectacular. Ennio Morricone has some of the greatest western scores ever composed on the silver screen. Honestly the themes are too epic for the movie to handle. The final duel in the cemetery is nothing short of amazing but the battle ends poorly. I was waiting for Leone to pull a trick out of his sleeve for this final duel like in Fistfull of Dollars but instead he just decided to make it standard. If you have three hours to blow then definitely check it out or just skip to the end of the movie because the build up in the duel is so effin' epic!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well i have to say that the people of IMDb got one right for a change, although i doubt the 4th greatest film of all time is the correct place for this film. This is far better than 'a fistful' and outstrips 'for a few' by a considerable amount in two aspects, the music and the direction. The music, let me say, is AWESOME! Probably the best theme for any film, it really sets the mood for a shoot em up western. Boo to the AFI for not including this in the Top 10 westerns list. Clint is at his best, Lee Van Cliff is not given enough screen time so he is considerably less impressive than in For A Few Dollars More, which is not his fault. Eli Wallach is brilliant as the bumbling ugly bandit and uses his screen time very well (he has the most screen time). Clint is as pulled back as ever and through him the audience something more in a western that is absent in its prequels. Clint is shown passing through the terrain of war torn America and mourns for the loss of hundreds of Americans. He laments, 'I've never seen so many men wasted so badly.' We see him emerge as the Good also because he doesn't take sides and is happy to give a dying rebel soldier his last cigarette. He isn't against anyone, he is on nobody's side but he opposes war. This is the greatest example of morals in a western. As a western 10/10 and as a motion picture 8/10.</fullReview>

I'd put it up there with True Grit, The Searchers and Man Without a Star. Directed by Leone starring the king of cool Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and the highly underrated Eli Wallach(who steals every scene he his is in) I won't go into the plot as just about every review here will tell you that. Running at about 3 hrs depending on which cut you see this movie is never boring. It's exciting and funny full of pathos and a great anti war message. You don't have to like this genre to like this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare jewel from Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a lot of things to judge in a movie, however there are few that really indicates if it is really good or not. I used to evaluate the plot, the cast, the direction, the sound (music and effects) and the image (not quality, but realistic). This masterpiece gets 5 stars in each of these points. But there is a very peculiar thing that this movie brings: It is even enjoyable to the people that does not appreciate western genre.The main plot shows us the ecstasy of gold and how 3 very different and peculiar man can be affected by it. The background is the American civil war, which makes the movie much more exciting. The soundtrack is one of the best in cinema history and not just because it has a lot of quality, but also because it fits 100% on each moment when it is played. Seogio Leone built an epic, giving us a lesson in how to mix a set of good ideas with a great story and how to transform it in a cinematographic jewel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly is one of the most famous and well known movie titles ever, and for good reason: The movie that it titles could just be perfect. When i say perfect i mean to say that it's narrative and plot, the way it develops and unfolds, and the way it concludes itself is probably the ideal way any movie should be shaped. For half of the film we don't even know what the plot is; things simply happen and build up, and then in the second half the goal of the characters comes into being. The filmmakers do this in such a way that the film, plot less at first, could go any direction, and we are taken happily along for the ride. And when it does go into a direction, we are ready to set out on it. It isn't plot less in a bad way, actually the best way possible, because we are entertained and engrossed, and at the same time have a sense of possibility. The famous score is incredible and actually sounds pretty modern, so there isn't that feeling of dated music. The acting is excellent, Clint is as always very cool, and there is even a good anti-war message that materializes in the last act, one that is very touching. If you want to see a perfectly made movie, then you should see this. and soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish I could give 11 stars because this truly is the ultimate movie. A lot has been written about it already, so I'll just make it very short: Leone wanted to make a cool, gritty, badass drama, so he casted Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach as The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, respectively. Brilliant choices, brilliant concept, brilliant finale. Greed has led three men into a deadly scramble for a chest of gold. The standoff takes place at Sad Hill Cemetery, and it is the most memorable standoff in movie history, with 'The Ecstasy of Gold' the icing on this cake of perfection. Gives me goosebumps every time just thinking about Tuco running over that cemetery. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood is the best actor of all time. Sergio Leone is one of the greatest directors of all time. Ennio Morricone is one of the great composers of all time. So, the three of them combined, making a film in the genre that happens to be my favorite genre, that film would have to certainly be a good one... and it is. From Clint Eastwood's under-playing and eye-squinting, to Sergio Leone's breath-taking story-telling and photography of vast Spanish deserts, to Ennio Morricone's pulsating music, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is certainly one of the best films ever made. The best scene has to be the iconic showdown to end all western showdowns in Sad Hill Cemetery between Blondie, Tuco, &amp; Setenza. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is the #2 movie ever made.</fullReview>

I liked a relationships between characters and that they always were trying to trick each other. There wasn't much dialogs, only Tuco was the chatty one (he also was my favorite character). Clint Eastwood's character was tough as always and I liked him more as Blodie than Harry Callahan because this time he was not completely a good guy.

Tuco is the ugliest of The Ugly, 100% immoral, a true criminal.. you just don't see many characters like that nowadays. Clint Eastwood hardly says a word, but still his best role ever, I think.

		<shortDescription>Can justifiably be called the best Western ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone's epic tale of three men all on a different point of the morality scale is a thoroughly entertaining film that is certainly one of the best in its genre, if not one of the best films overall.Clint Eastwood completes his "trilogy" of roles with Leone as Blondie, the quiet drifter who has few friends and plenty of bullets. In every scene, Eastwood's quiet yet brutally tough nature shows that he is one of the brightest stars of the last fifty years, and even though he has gone on to become a better director than actor, he still deserves to be considered a great actor.All the acting is terrific, with Lee Van Cleef perfectly intimidating as the hit man Angel Eyes, and Eli Wallach stealing the show as the comically-violent bandit Tuco. They carry the story along and Leone paces it so well that even though it is quite long, it is well worth it to see the final sequence of the showdown between all three characters.And of course, we cannot forget to honor the man who made this series possible. All throughout, Sergio Leone shows his enormous talent as a director and filmmaker. He certainly changed the genre forever with this film, and that is just one reason of why this may be the best Western ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Believe the hype, this movie is all that it's cracked up to be. Fortunately, that's not much! For the genre that it represents, it is excellent. As a movie, it is very, very good.The soundtrack, often imitated, never duplicated or surpassed; provides exaggerated suspense and unintentional comic relief through out the movie. It also creates an atmosphere and texture for the movie, that many other movies might benefit from.The camera work is good. There is lots of great scenery, rapid change ups from landscapes to close ups of the actor's faces; and other interesting use of the camera, at times. At other times, there is a lazy quality to the shot choice that highlights the movement or plot at the moment.The characters are archetypes, and as such, don't stray too much from their respective modes. There are moments when I wished for a bit more, but there was plenty of true to form moments from the major characters that made up for a lack of further development or dimensionality. Stark, interesting, comic, tragic (if you will) and intense. Good acting all around, with Eastwood giving a trademark performance, later to be more fully developed as Dirty Harry, as a comic and merciless but just defender of his own ethic.The film has some funny scenes, and also, it has some places where it starts to drags. It's 2 hours and 45 minutes long, so it does take a certain suspension of time to sit through it all. Worth it though! Especially, if you happen to like rough and rugged westerns. I think that Sergio Leone's brilliance is overlooked in the direction and screenplay of this movie. There is something so classically cheesy and yet at the same time universally comic and tragic about the unfolding of events.As an example, I was particularly struck by the scene in the graveyard where the three men are about to dual over the sum of $200,000 in gold coins. Truly a king's ransom. The interesting counter point being that it is a soldier's graveyard, and that most, if not all of those buried there died in the pursuit of much less then that.The ideas of greed, confusion and ignorance were also interestingly intermixed throughout the movie. While at the end of the movie money is given a gold star (so to speak) all the tragedy and malice throughout the rest of the movie can be tied directly to it.There is a fair amount of violence in this film, which counts against it. Over all, I have a very positive response after viewing this one. Thumbs up, and with the right people, those who might laugh along with me, I'd be happy to see this one again.Plot synopsis.At the beginning of the film we are introduced to the three major characters who are defined as: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. The might as well have been introduced as The not so bad compared to a wolf; definitely Mean and the completely evil one. However, this would have robbed the movie of its pretensions to be a moral tale of some kind, or perhaps just obscured it's spiritual (?) message a bit deeper. Anyway.The three characters compete with one another to see how many people the can kill, or lives that they can ruin. The good guy starts out by killing three people, so he has a good start! As the movie progresses, we see them each killing various other people, and threatening to kill one another. Except for the good guy; his utterances are generally followed through with actions. Anyway.They each become aware of the existence of the some of gold earlier mentioned. Actually, the bad knows about the gold at the beginning of the film.Well, suffice it to say that there is a lot of shenanigans, and then at the end of the movie, there is a showdown. Lots of thematic mood music, and then each of the three gets their just desserts: The Bad dies, The Ugly get stranded in a graveyard with his hands tied behind his back with more gold then he can carry at his feet; and the Good rides out of the graveyard with the other half of the gold. All the other stuff in the middle, is just plot devices, and chances for the characters to show their archetypes in action: not worth repeating, save to say that it was easy to follow, entertaining, and epic in scope as it involved the United States civil war as a backdrop. Entertaining, engrossing and in the final analysis a bit over worked and long. But very, very good nonetheless.May you reading this be well and happy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film but too long. Sound quality problems.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well-done shootout Western that stays on plot almost the whole way through. I did find it to be an endurance test to sit through all of it in one sitting. The entire section with the army at the river could be removed completely and that would make the film better. Only a tiny bit of dialog would have to be replaced somewhere else. Other than the excessive length, this was a good film, with plenty of action and terrific acting. Eli Wallach is the true star of this film, not Clint Eastwood. Wallach is in almost every scene and is brilliant all the way through. The music is good, but for some reason there were major sound problems on the DVD I rented. It was not the Collector's edition that came out in 2005 - it was a single disc that had the movie only, from MGM-UA Home Video. Some of the music had a tinny, low-fidelity, transistor-radio quality. There was also a lack of sync between the soundtrack and the video for the entire movie. The actors' lips were not in sync with the words on the soundtrack. Better rent the Collector's edition instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is two movies in one. No, not a movie I can't make up my mind about, but two different and separate entities. It's the damnedest thing! The first movie is a visually fascinating, heavily plotted Euro-Western with elements that Americans can easily identify with and enjoy. It's a bloody, emotional, and almost mystical horse opera that can't help but get under your skin and keep you enthralled for three hours. It's cinematic art and commercial dynamite. I've love it and been riveted by GBU for thirty-some years.And yet . . .It's also an embarrassing, sweaty, badly-dubbed, cartoonish bowl of sticky pasta and blood red sauce. It's so over-the-top that at almost any moment, you expect Clint, Lee, and Eli to stop working and break into a you-gotta-be-kidding-with-this-crap fit of hysterics.I think the movie is like one of those double image toys you had as a kid, the ones that would change their image if you angled them this way or that. Both images were there, it just depended on your angle.Or in the movie's case, your mood.Over my years, I've seen the movie probably a dozen times. In bits and pieces, maybe another dozen. I've found that the really good movies are the ones I'll switch to even if I know it's already been on for awhile or hold on to it when I'm just spinning the dial (how's that for a phrase that's both obsolete and understandable?). There's an old Judith Crist saying, "Even bad Hitchcock is pretty good." Well, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is great and awful and visually mesmerizing. To paraphrase Crist, even a few minutes of GBU (which she hated) is a better use of time than most of the kludge you'll find on the tube or in the "New" section of the video store.And you can't go wrong with a movie that has the line, "If you're gonna shoot, shoot. Don't talk!"Considering the quality of my writing, I should commence firing right away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was only a great Clint Eastwood movie with the best music when I first watched it on TV. At that time you are watching a 3 hr movie only waiting for Clint's appearances....and the good tune. Now it is a movie about Eli Wallach's character and Clint is more like great background. I also appreciate the entire score more than only the title score. Anybody would have to wonder why is Clint the Good? He leaves Eli in the desert and he is working the law and profiting.Bad Eli has to work so hard to get what falls so easily into Good Clint's hands.But does one really deserve the gold more than the other?For me the hero has become Eli Wallach.One fantastic moment for me is Eli running through the cemetery looking for the grave with the gold.The music is excellent and the editing captures the moment when Eli is gold crazy...I feel sympathy and hope and a lot of things for Eli at that moment.This is so important to him it is tragic.Anyways a happy ending follows and all is well. Always felt this movie lended itself to a prequil in that a history was alluded to in the film between The Good The Bad and The Ugly.</fullReview>

Eli Wallach plays a great role and often had me laughing. Lee Van Cleef is perfect for the part as the ugly, making you dislike him from the start. Three bounty hunters in search of the same treasure. The tension builds as the movie continues. I can actually feel the heat and the thirst in the desert scene. The close up photography is second to none. The movie is interesting from the beginning. It is a Civil War movie and a western all rolled into one. There is plenty of action. The music for the final gun battle keeps you on the edge of your seat. The ending catches you by surprise. I did not want this movie to end. The movie theme song is hard to top. You will find yourself whistling the first five notes over and over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WOW! I saw this movie for the first time a couple of months back, and since then i have seen it 4 times. I remember as a kid my father used to quote this film a lot, i finally i understood why. It made a huge impact on, films like this is not being produced anymore. Of course my favourite is Tuco Benedicto Pacifico Ramirez ("known as the rat"), he is my hero - a real "drifter" and as we say in danish "a luck-seeker"... Eli's performance is impressive and the way he and Blondie's "friendship" develop through the film is very memorable. The only thing that irritates me, i am sorry to say, is in the beginning when Blondie shoots peoples hats of.... thats seem a little foolish...Love it BIG TIME!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the all time best Westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best movies are those movies which you can watch over again and enjoy even more than the first time. The Good The Bad The Ugly is one of these films. When I first saw it I thought it was rather slow but still memorable. The second time I watched it it didn't feel slow at all, and I found myself more impressed with it.The movie revolves around three gunmen looking for a fortune of gold hidden in a cemetery during the Civil War. Clint Eastwood plays Blondie (The Good)a guy who though not really good, has probably the most morals of the three and a sense of honor. Eli Wallach plays Toco, (The Ugly). He is a man looking out for himself and nobody else, but I never got the sense that he was totally evil. Selfish and distrustful but not outright bad. That's probably why Toco is the most beloved of the three. He also gives the best performance in the movie. Then we have Lee Van Cleef who stars as Angel Eyes (The Bad). His character name is totally misleading because he is the most outright evil of all three.Each of these characters knows a bit of information about the gold, and so they have to rely on each other to find the location. Of course neither one is inclined to share. So this all leads to an ending which boasts one the best showdowns in any cowboy western.Though the story is mainly about these three characters, director Sergio Leone never lets us forget about the horrors involved with war. Even though these three men are hunting for treasure, the war surrounding them as they make their way is shown in good detail to remind us what it might have been like back in those times. It is definitely a great movie.On top of all this, Sergio Leone is an expert with the camera. He uses close up shots of character's facial features where we see every tick and expression, but he is also able to expand out and give us panoramic views of the land surrounding these people. The opening scenes were excellent, as were so many more that followed. Great characters, great pacing, and incredible gun fights with sweeping views of the country make this western one of the best ever. And let's not forget the fantastic score which is one of the most memorable ever. Sort of a signature for the entire movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is my all time favorite. It has every element that a movie requires. There are amazing scenes and fantastic character development. Sergio Leone has done it again. Clint Eastwood has portrayed an incredible character who stands for honor, trust and respect. The movie tells the story of and incredible journey for gold between three enemies. The use of the civil war in this movie really adds a lot to the plot. The scene where Tuco and Blondie destroy the bridge with dynamite is fantastic. It truly is amazing how Tuco and Blondie become partners and enemies at the same time and figure out a way to work together and defeat Angel Eyes for the gold. I recommend this movie to anyone who has an open mind and be patient enough to actually watch the movie and not getting bored when dialog is absent from some scenes. Clint Eastwood definitely plays one of the top 10 movie heroes of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Quintessential Spaghetti Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Between 1964 and 1975, it is said that there were no fewer than three hundred Italian-made (though shot in Spain) so-called "spaghetti westerns" made. Most of them were done on the kinds of budgets that wouldn't even cover the catering costs of most big budget Hollywood extravaganzas of today. And, truth be told, most of them weren't very good, with badly dubbed voices, and sadistic violence. But Sergio Leone, though he loathed the term "spaghetti western", was different. In his famous "Dollars" trilogy, he not only became a director of international renown, but he also elevated his star Clint Eastwood from the Rowdy Yates years of "Rawhide" to immortality as The Man With No Name. The first two films of that trilogy were 1964's A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and 1965's FOR A FEW DOLLARS more, both of which were released in America in 1967. The final, and best, film of that trilogy was the mercurial THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY, made in 1966 and released here in America at the end of 1967. In the nearly forty years since, it has come to be seen quite rightly as the quintessential film of the much misunderstood spaghetti western genre.Eastwood reprises his Man With No Name role, having come across information from a dying casualty of the Civil War regarding a $200,000 treasure buried in a massive cemetery. The problem is, of course, this dying soldier has only told Eastwood part of the information; the other part of it is with a Mexican bandido named Tuco (Wallach, in an extension of his role in the 1960 western classic THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN). They form an uneasy alliance as they travel across the hellish landscape of the Civil War-era Southwest, along with the sadistic Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef, extending his role from FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE). Everything, of course, comes to a climax in that massive cemetery, and a traditional Leone-choreographed showdown of tremendous intensity.In contrast to A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS (which was indeed made with a fistful of dollars--$100,000) and FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE (made, of course, for a few dollars more--$400,000), Leone lavished $1.2 million on THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY; and every red cent (or lira) shows up on the screen. Leone and his cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli never miss a trick, as the film juxtaposes wide-open, albeit sun-scorched, landscapes with extreme close-ups of the characters' faces. That last aspect is most in evidence during the climactic showdown. There are also plenty of good lines to be had as well, many of them variations on "There are two kinds of people in this world." The extremes in the performances of Eastwood, Wallach, and Van Cleef may make it seem like Leone doesn't have any control over the film, but he does indeed, and those extreme performances are absolutely right for this outrageously successful film.But the thing that really seals the deal in THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY, of course, is Ennio Morricone's intense music score, one of the finest composed for any kind of film ever, western or otherwise. The main theme is known to just about anyone who has ever seen even part of this movie; and the cues for the "Ecstasy Of Gold" and "Trio" scenes at the end burn with fiery intensity and sweating suspense. This successful collaboration of Leone and Morricone, begun in the two earlier films, would reach its apex in the 1969 epic that is generally agreed to be Leone's true masterpiece, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST.Very lengthy, often blackly comic, flamboyant, and unquestionably violent, THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY is the definitive film in this much-maligned genre, and a film that, aside from the typically bad dubbing of the Italian actors, keeps having an impact to this very day.</fullReview>

I often make references to this great movie in my movies. Those of you who haven't seen this movie rent it as soon as possible. The classic Mexican Standoff scene at the climax is absolutely amazing. The twitch of fingers next to the six-shooters of the three men, the glint in the eyes of Clint Eastwood, the fear in the eyes of Eli Wallach, Tuco. The ironic ending where "Blondie" splits the money between him and Tuco and puts a noose around his neck, only to shoot it when at a distance. Reliving their thieving ways at the beginning of the film. An absolute classic, no doubt about it. Eleven out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Finest of the Western Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone's masterpiece, the finest of his Westerns that were far superior in artistic merit than the term "spaghetti western" implies. Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach make a splendid trio of rivals endeavoring to outsmart (or put a bullet in) each other, and grab a lot more than a fistful of dollars.Rampant symbolism, which over the years has become more and more prevalent in westerns, is in abundance here. This movie shirks the old, clearly defined, white hat/black hat rivals that have a predictable shoot-out in the street at the end. Now you have a backdrop of the Civil War and its tragic consequences. Also, there's a third gunfighter, "The Ugly" (Wallach) equal with a gun as the other two, and just as cold-blooded in using it as "The Bad" (Van Cleef). For good measure, there's a lot of greasy-and sweaty-faced would-be gunfighters who have the misfortune of messing with these guys. Even "The Good" (Eastwood) is less than perfect (but his tarnished halo gleams when he's compared to his two rivals).Lots of "running" dialog is here, and it's tantalizingly tempting to use a "there's two kinds of people, my friend" joke in the review. Each of the three men has information about where a cache of gold is hidden, but none of them has all the clues, so they have to form uneasy alliances. There's good character development, as you learn about the relationship of the three gunfighters, their backgrounds, and why they act as they do (particularly Wallach's character).Also, there's ongoing and poignant Civil War episodes that move parallel with the gunfighters' story. The scene of a character running madly through a cemetery is stunning in its double-meaning eloquence.This story inexorably approaches the ultimate western movie signature event, as they gamble their lives against their 1-in-3 chance to survive and claim the golden prize. However, the classic duel in the sun is here built to with exhilarating tension, as the combatants assume a unique positioning for the fight; all the while, the famous music score rises in intensity to complement this climactic moment of truth.Don't dismiss this epic masterpiece as a "horse-opera" or a "spaghetti western." There's a lot more going on here than good guys and bad guys riding horses and shooting it out. It's a brilliantly executed story, a classic of its genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest westerns ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of three masterpieces by the great Italian director Sergio Leone and the last of a trilogy of westerns which he made with Clint Eastwood, this marked a significant step-forward on the two previous films on which they had collaborated, ("A Fistfull of Dollars" and "For a Few Dollars More"). The 'Once upon a time ...' movies would see Leone's films take on a much darker turn but although there is quite a lot of violence and death on display here, this is an almost jovial epic, (the humour comes from Leone's subversion of traditional western clichés). Almost every sequence feels, and looks, like a classic, (the climatic gunfight has the choreographed precision of a ballet), Tonino Delli Colli's widescreen cinematography is magnificent, and although dubbed, (very effectively), the English translation of the Italian script is first-class.The plot is simplicity itself as Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef search for some buried gold but the plot is only the thread of a much richer tapestry centered round events in the American Civil War. Stylistically and thematically this film would later influence Eastwood as a director. At a time when, in America, the western seemed long past it's sell-by date, in Europe Leone's homages single-handedly revitalized the genre paving the way for a whole new breed of post-modernist classics.</fullReview>

In the beginning of the film, where you can hear the coyotes howling, and next you can hear human's and orchestral voice of the same theme. The camera shootings are also great. The silence of dialogs at the first ten minutes was me unbelievable. As a spectator i have to concentrate very carefully what is happening next and why is nobody talking??! And next was history. Atmosphere of this film is huge and the actors co-operation are incredible. Even if the movie is quite long, the time still run fast. And i have this feeling that is it already ends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a movie that consists of only quotable quotes, Eli Wallach's character Tuco has the best lines. Clint Eastwood rarely talks and Lee Van Cleef is menacing but honorable at the same time.Why is this movie so good? Frankly, I have no clue. From a technical standpoint, the pacing is awful. The movie runs for 3 hours, which is much too long for what its plot is. Much of the screen time is dedicated to a staring contest between participants in a gunfight.My best guess as to why this movie resonates so deeply with all of us is because of the lack of a good guy. All three of the characters are not very nice. There is no sheriff to dull the action. But they all have a good side. Lee Van Cleef's is the hardest to see. In fact the only good one can even see in him is the fact that he doesn't kill certain characters when he has a chance to such as Bill Carson's whore or Blondie. But somehow Leone extends this (or maybe its just me)... I just don't see Angel Eyes as completely bad.Blondie and Tuco have a strange love/hate relationship. We can all relate to their friendship. They're only friends when it benefits them... or are they? Blondie's actions at the end suggest that maybe the Man with No Name actually cares.And the famous final gunfight. Its been emulated so many times, but never matched. God its perfect cinema. Never have I seen such a tense moment in the history of film. I will never forget the first time I saw the film and the gunfight. I was drawn in instantly.But my favorite parts of the film are the little touching side stories and add-ins that Leone gives. The legless desperado who receives money for the information he provides and then wastes his money on liquor; the scene in the monastery with Tuco and his brother; the drunken general; and the dying Confederate soldier at the end... these scenes are what give The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly the kind of beauty that lacks in so many other western copycats.Sure Blondie is one cool guy who pretends that he doesn't have a heart. But when he finally reaches his catharsis... when he finally admits how much the war is "a waste of men"... we realize that Blondie does have a heart -- he just hides it.Why? Maybe because it hurts too much to show it. A Fistful of Dollars suggests that (Although Leone never intended for the dollars movies to be connected). If you haven't seen this movie, you are missing out on a landmark Italian movie. After watching this, I was hooked on Italian film. I started watching all of Leone, Fellini, Argento... Italian films are full of life that American films lack-- there's some sort of strange mystical wonderful culture in them that I just love. Watch this.</fullReview>

I know it was filmed in Italy, but it still seems American to me. Does anyone else feel the same way about this movie? When will another movie of this caliber come to the big screen. I know that Clint Eastwood directed "Unforgiven," and did a good job, but it wasn't as believable as "Il Buono, il brutto, il cattivo" Maybe it was the age of the film itself, the dustiness, the yellowish hues, the darkness of camera. All the faces look real, dirty, leathery, and overall toughened by life. Where did Sergio Leon find Tuco? Did he use a time machine? All in all, if you haven't seen it, find some way to immerse yourself in the old West. You'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably the best of the Sergeo Leone films (although Once Upon A Time In The West is also a very good film, with solid performances), the director takes a sensible pace to plot out the search for gold bullion, during the American Civil War, by 3 gunmen acting for themselves. Clint Eastwood is as cool as ever, as the man with no name, Lee Van Cleef is sinister as the evil gunslinger, but it is Eli Wallach who steals the film with his portrayal of the street fighter, willing to try any ruse to get his hands on the gold. The action takes place amid the carnage being caused by the 2 sides in the American Civil War, with all 3 gunmen using the situation to best further their own goals. The final 3 way shoot out is probably the most famous in western films, with the music of Morricone at its best.</fullReview>

This film has so obviously influenced so many creations since, from "Star Wars" to "Cowboy Beebop." The main characters are such archetypes of the classic American male, but none of them is truly a stereotype; they all have crystal clear dimension and personality. They definitely do not make films like this any more! The only reason I give it a 9 rather than a 10 (sorry to be such a snob!) is that unfortunately, for my taste, as psychological as it is, it just is not as deep and revealing of human mysteries as I really prefer my films. Sorry!) Otherwise, friggin awesome!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I may have seen a few movies equal to The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly but i have never seen a movie that i would claim was better. Commenting first on the story. Intricate plot connections with character and human nature pushing the story along with a war playing a significant supporting character make this one of the greatest stories ever shown on film. Leone does an excellent job of not jumping right into the treasure hunt aspect of he film but instead lets the characters develop and interact and then fall upon the main story line. It is often said that Leone was special due to the fact that he realized the face as a landscape. This is ever evident in the opening shot of the film in which we see one of Tuco's many enemies, but only the very front of his face at first showing a worn, torn, mean side of the previously over glorified American West. The character appears mean and tough and as though anyone who crosses him is sure to meet a hasty end. This is not the case however when "the Ugly" Tuco Ramirez bests him and his comrades even when matched against he element of surprise. Here is evident part of the humor of the film, the unassuming Tuco, however flawed he may be, is never the less a master of armed combat. It is his character, made lovable with such contradictions, that pushes the plot along. Many people look to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid as the father of all buddy movies but this was released earlier and while Tuco and Eastwood's characters aren't exactly friends(it seems that Blondie just favorites Tuco as a partner due to the fact that he can easily be out witted) they have some very entertaining interaction and really start the whole unwanted partnership theme so oft copied by the movies that would follow. This them has developed to the point of being the almost exclusive relationship appearing in todays animated films such as Shrek and Ice Age. This film does so much with story yet doesn't compromise an ounce of style. The camera work is phenomenal and creates a mood so strong that even if you don't care for a specific character you can still be fearful for the situation he is in. The music is unforgettable and has remained in pop culture to this day. This movie has something for everyone, it is epic, has comedy, has action, drama, character driven plot, and just plain looks stunning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the genius of tonino delli colli.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>well now, GBU has reached the IMDb top 5. this is a genuine card carrying work of art. up there with the likes of davinci's mona lisa, beethoven's 5th, and michealangelo's David. it will reach number one here i'm sure of that. the saddest thing is most of the crew are now dead. and the living are very old. soon we will loose these as well. no matter what happen's in my life i've just got to remember Tuco and the way he would say "Blondie!?" to Eastwood's character, and a big smile comes to my old face. Wallach is a wonderful actor - he WAS/IS Tuco. i knew when i saw this on the big screen in 1969 it was something very special. very, very special indeed. for those who have seen this masterpiece as many times as i, any further praise would be redundant. but let's, now spotlight cinematographer delli colli for a moment. in terms of composition, this man must have just about the best eye in the business. color balance and perspective taken into account, here are some of my picks for the top shots in GBU. shot of the deserted town's main street as the gunmen ride up to kill tuco. shot of angel eyes in the doorway of ranch house where he kills the family. zoom shot of blondie shooting the rope and missing. shot as the trio move out into the circle for the final showdown. they are on the right third of the screen and at one point, form a triangle for a moment. flattened into 2D, this has almost perfect geometry.(a triangle in an ellipse). i could go on but, i'll leave to all you other fans to find your own classic shots. as i've said before, this is not a movie so much as a work of true art.

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Western Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>it's easy to see why Sergio Leone's Climax to his spaghetti western trilogy is his defining masterpiece. the quintessential western shot Eastwood to fame and gave Leone the critical success he deserved. many of Leone's trademarks are apparent in this film, long shots, Fantastic use of Ennio Morricones score and the brief strong violence that made it so controversial at the time of it's release. The use of Morricones score makes it feel much like an opera and Leones brilliant use of the camera makes everything seem very Comic Book. Leone can be criticised for his use of strong violence, but the build up to a gunfight lasts longer than the violence, the violence is very quick and brief and his films focus more on storyline and characterisation, than using violence to portray meaning. nevertheless this still stands as Leones defining masterpiece in cinema history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a wasted shot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't watched this film many times. Yet, I think I can safely say that there is not a wasted shot in the whole film. Leone is able to use each scene to perfection. He uses wide shots at the right time. He uses close-ups when he needs to. He puts in long shots for the perfect effect. This is such a well constructed movie. Many people might consider it sloppy and rough. I think it is amazing. There are many shots in which Leone isolates the characters. I don't remember many shots where more than one character are in the frame at the same time. When they are, there is almost always space between them. His characters are out for themselves, and for no one else. Their connection with other characters exist only in their desire and drive for gold. There are many shots in which a character stands surrounded by vast nothingness. Leone's characters are in control of their own wills, but they are not in control of their destinies. Consider the scene where Tuco is about to kill Blondie in the hotel. A canon hits the room before he can accomplish this. Blondie seems to be the only person who controls his fate, and he doesn't have ultimate control. The acting is superb. Eastwood doesn't little enough to give his character tremendous depth and mystery. He isn't merely stoic and squinting. He is a true character with many levels. Wallach is extreme and not other the top. It would be very easy for the character to be cartoonish. Yet Leone and Wallach are able to give him many different facets. Angel Eyes is truly evil. I like the hat that van Cleef wears. It makes his face seem very slim and his eyes very narrow, very snake-like. The music is good as well. This is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I personally am not a fan of westerns; they are cheesy, cheap, and usually aren't very original. This movie breaks all of those stereotypes. It supports a cast that couldn't be better suited for who they played. This movie has three important characters that everything else revolves around. It creates a unique situation where two of those characters are forced to ally. Tuco tries to hide his true feelings from Blondie so he can get the gold, but Blondie knows better and uses his knowledge to keep himself alive. The Ugly will stop at nothing to get the gold for himself, which leads up to one of the best movie scenes ever: the three man shoot out. The men guessing and second guessing in their minds who to shoot, because they know they get only one shot. When they decide to take out The Ugly, Blondie holds a gun up to Tuco and tells him to put his head in a noose, he leaves him half the gold, but rides off as if to let him die in the noose, but returns and shoots the rope, thus showing that they really did have a friendship. Besides the superior acting and intellectual plot, this movie has one of the most memorable scores. It also has great cinematography, from the scene by the bridge, to the mass grave at the end. This movie has withstood the test of time and proved itself to be one of the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>40 years later it still fascinates</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I may have seen this movie more times than any other, and it still holds it's power every single time. I first saw it in theaters as a kid and remember sitting mesmerized by this story on screen. I think i saw it at least 2 or 3 more times in theaters over time and countless TV viewings before the home video age made it possible to view any time i wanted. It was my first DVD purchase after getting a player a few years back. It is interesting how it has become a critical favorite over that time. On its initial release critics(those that paid attention) sloughed it off as just another spaghetti western albeit with a bigger budget. Clint was not taken seriously as an actor, now of course he is an icon. Leone's stock has risen in that time as well, to the point that he is now often named as one of the all-time great directors, amazing for a man with such a small directing portfolio.This movie had(has) everything. Wide vistas beautifully shot,Leone's amazing close-ups,wonderful black humour, artfully staged 'violence', pathos, all set to that memorable Morricone score. Eli Wallach chewed scenery better than anyone before or since. A truly memorable performance. And that long gunfight at the end must rank as one of the greatest scenes in ANY film ever made.Anyone who has the newly remastered DVD should watch the movie with film critic Richard Schickel's commentary turned on for some interesting insights and behind the scenes info. Highly recommended.On my all-time list, this sits at #1.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Western of all time maybe the Greatest of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies are legendary. In the arena of Westerns, Sergio Leone's works are unmatched in their strikingly visual approach, namely, the extensive use of dramatic widescreen shots interleaved with moments of extreme close-ups. Apart from creating a complete sub-genre of Westerns, lovingly called "Spaghetti Westerns" - mostly because of the Italian origins of the filmmaker and the fact that his movies were shot in Europe instead of Hollywood - Sergio Leone built the foundation of Clint Eastwood's super-stardom. "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" is one such ageless piece of work, beautiful to behold. After "A Fistful Of Dollars" and "For A Few Dollars More", it is the third part in a series of movies featuring Eastwood as "The Man With No Name".The basic story of "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" is actually a simple treasure hunt, but still Leone allows himself almost three hours to develop all its details. It is a plot with endless, unexpected twists and turns, making this movie a highly entertaining experience. Clint Eastwood became an Western icon through those movies and we still tend to remember him as "The Man With No Name", even though he left this role behind over thirty years ago. His charismatic, enigmatic, dry portrayal of the laid-back "Blondie" is stunning and it carries the movie. It is Eli Wallach, however, who makes the biggest impression as the somewhat dense Tuco. He puts so much character in this personality that, no matter how bad he is, we always care and sympathize for him. Crowning it with the right amount of humor, slyness, and humanity, Wallach puts in one of the most memorable performances in this movie Probably everyone has heard Ennio Morricone's brilliant musical score to "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" at some point or another. Its ferocious, war-cry-style main theme is as memorable as it is effective. Beside "Once Upon A Time In The West", this score is probably his best work ever and helped to stylize the unique image and appeal of Italian Westerns. It is a magnificent score that perfectly accompanies the movie's many twists, always finds the right note, and helps the audience experience every single scene more fully. The disc has a monaural Dolby Digital soundtrack, and comes fully dubbed in English, French, and Spanish. Subtitles are also supplied in English, French, and Spanish."The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" is an exceptional movie for its richness and the peculiarity of being a Western set against the violent background of the American Civil War. The picture are fantastic and its a real cinema art to the eyes. The way Leone timed the music and the pictures are perfection. It is a serious, infectiously humorous movie with striking images and a clever plot. The quality of the DVD is remarkable and makes this movie an all-time favorite of mine. You have to own this.

		<fullReview>This is the last in the "Man With No Name" trilogy, directed by Sergio Leone and starring Clint Eastwood, and is, without a doubt in my mind, the very best. This includes not only in the trilogy itself, but also every Western I've seen thus far. Both a commentary on war and an adventure story, The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly is about a hit-man called "Angel Eyes"(Lee Van Cleef), a bandit named Tuco(Eli Wallach), and the Man With No Name(Clint Eastwood), who go to find gold hidden by a soldier during the American Civil War. The movie has some of the best directing I've seen in a movie and has some great music to go along with it.Bottom line: If you are a fan of Westerns(or hey, even if you aren't), see this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is flawless. I mean if you ignore the unsynchronized audio because half the people are speaking Italian and the English was overdubbed. And if you listen to it in Italian it still sounds overdubbed. what can you do? Other than that, this is a brilliant piece of work. The technique used here is called DIRECTING. it is a lost art that has been replaced by EDITING. The difference can be seen by comparing the two minutes uncut scenes in this film with the three second splice-o-rama flicks seen today. Guess what, to be a good director you might have to think ahead thirty seconds. imagine that! I watched this today and it put to shame every movie I've seen in the last ten years. when you have a movie where no one speaks and the camera angle doesn't change for 90 seconds yet you are completely riveted to the screen, then you have made something worth watching. I'm glad they don't make movies like this anymore because that makes "the good the bad and the ugly" utterly priceless. the directing is perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film inspires me as a film-maker and actor. Ever since I first watched it, Mr. Wallach has made an impression on me. I absolutely love his acting and his character is oddly fun to watch. The three actors really make the movie. It is an honor still to see Wallach acting. His performance in an E.R. episode and his theatrical background show his true ability to be flexible and his talents are first rate. What an honor to be even able to talk to him once! His characters are always memorable. His expressions in this film go beyond what seems to be a minimum called for by that day's directors. With a score by the famous Ennio Morricone, supporting actors that have a real-life grittiness to them, really compliment one another. His best role is this one of "Tuco" as he really gets carried away. I HIGHLY recommend this must-see movie for it's raw performances and breathtaking landscape, epic shots. This, as well, compliments the pauses of thought as well as the never-ending feel to this one of a three part trilogy. Also recommend "Aces High." He seems to have done better in supporting roles, but it, as well, is better then Lee Van Cleefs brief stint in solo western acts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sergio Leone's "Il Buono, Il Brutto Il Cattivo" aka. "The Good, The Bad And The Ugly" of 1966 is, beyond doubt, one of the greatest movies ever brought to screen. Period. I lack the words to express my admiration for this film adequately, but i'll try to indicate how brilliant this film is. This film is pure cinematic perfection. The story, the brilliant directing, the impressive cinematography, the unique atmosphere, the ingenious score, the great characters, the unforgettable performances, the dialogue, the wit, the violence,... everything in this film is pure perfection! This is one of the few movies that actually deserve their high ranking in IMDb's Top 250 list, and if I was to make such a list, "The Good, The Bad And The Ugly" would rank even higher. Leone's brilliant directing and a superb cinematography come along with what is maybe the greatest of Ennio Morricone's unique soundtracks. Each one of the three leading actors fits perfectly in his role. As in the movie's two predecessors, "A Fistful Of Dollars" (1964) and "For A Few Dollars More" (1965), Clint Eastwood ('The Good')is the epitome of coolness in his role of the Man with No Name (who actually always has a name - He is credited as 'Joe' in "Fistful Of Dollars", his character is called 'Monco' in "For A Few Dollars More", and he is referred to as "Blondie" in "The Good The Bad And The Ugly"). Together with irascible MexicanTuco ('The Ugly' brilliantly played by Eli Wallach), he rips authorities off by collecting the reward, that is set on Tuco's head and then saving him a very second before his execution.Since I first saw this Dollar Trilogy as a kid, the word 'coolness' is linked with this character played by Clint Eastwood. No other character in any other film is embodies coolness the way The Man With No Name does in the Dollar trilogy, and no other ever will.Lee Van Cleef ('The Bad'), one of my personal favorite actors of all-time, and one of the true icons of the Italian Western, is brilliant in the role of Sentenza aka. Angel Eyes, a ruthless assassin who knows no mercy or scruples to achieve his goals. While all of the three men are selfish crooks, and all of them selfish and violent in getting what they want, Sentenza is truly evil, and Lee Van Cleef plays this role with absolute brilliance.The arguably greatest performance, however is delivered by Eli Wallach as 'The Ugly' Mexican bandit Tuco. Hot-tempered, irascible, savage and yet crafty, and sometimes sadistically vengeful, Tuco is a criminal with an immense crime record and an immense talent to survive hangings (with the help of 'The Good'). Eli Wallach's performance as Tuco is ingenious beyond comparison. Wallach plays 'The Ugly', his anger and rage, his quick, violent temper and brutality, his savagery but also his craftiness with a unique brilliance. Wallach's performance is not only THE single greatest performance ever in a Western, but, as far as I am considered, also one of the greatest performances ever in a movie. Set in one of the final years of the American Civil War, somewhere in the southwest of the US, "The Good, the Bad And the Ugly" tells the story of these three men, who are on the hunt for a case carrying 200,000 dollars in gold, buried somewhere in a graveyard.Each of the three men wants the gold for himself, of course, but since none of them has all the information they need, they have to work together in order to get it. Although all three of them are reckless and sneaky, Clint Eastwood (despite to being an antihero and crook that shoots a lot of people, the Man With No Name shows some mercy and charity in comparison to the foregoing movies "For a Fistful of Dollars" and "For a Few Dollars More") is rightly referred to as the Good, Eli Wallach, playing the angry thug Tuco, is the epitome of (the) Ugly, and Lee Van Cleef is wonderfully evil and ruthless as The Bad."The Good, the Bad And the Ugly", a Spaghetti Western at the genre's best, is a brilliant movie full of violence and dark humor, a film full of wit and pictures that will make a great visual impact on everybody with taste, a masterpiece going along with one of the most brilliant scores of all time. This is not only a film that every cineaste should see this is a film that EVERYBODY MUST SEE! If I was to name my favorite movies of all-time, "The Good, The Bad And The Ugly" would be one of the strongest contenders for Numero Uno! In one sentence: "The Good, The Bad And The Ugly" is one of the greatest films ever made! Absolutely essential and brilliant beyond comparison! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's More Like "The Great, the Awesome, and the Beautiful" To Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently I saw "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" (or "Il Buono, il Brutto, il cattivo" in Italian), a film directed by Sergio Leone and starring Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach. It is a western-and probably the greatest western I've seen-that takes place during the Civil War (1862).In the beginning of the movie, Eastwood's unnamed character dubbed by Wallach's character "Blondie" (usually credited as "Joe") meets and partner's up with the Mexican Tuco Ramirez (Wallach). Soon Blondie double crosses Tuco and Tuco swears revenge. While he is getting revenge by making Blondie walk through the desert with no water for miles, they stumble upon a dying man who in return for a promise of water tells them where $100,000 is buried. The only problem is that he tells Tuco what cemetery it's in, and tells Blondie the grave just before dying. They once again are partners and their future wealth depends on the other. Unfortunately, a notorious bounty hunter, who will do anything for money, Sentenza (Lee Van Cleef) nicknamed "Angel Eyes" knows of the money and tries to find it. Along the way the three run into the Civil War and our two heroes even get taken in as prisoners.The actors were well chosen. All three are/were amazing actors able to portray the characters perfectly. It's not often that a Jewish actor from Brooklyn is as convincing of a Mexican as Wallach. He was able to give amazing life and character to the greedy, dirty, yet humorous, and somewhat lovable Tuco that I don't think the best actor of today could top. Eastwood played the type of tough, gun slinging, cowboy that he was so good at and I think he was born for. It seemed as if it were him just being his natural self the way he played Blondie, he was kind and showed compassion just with the expression on his face with the slightly squinting eyes and his constant offer of the only thing he could give to comfort someone, a cigar; and smart and reasonable, yet he was ready to kill anyone who started trouble or was in his way. Finally, Lee Van Cleef plays the bad-ass Angel Eyes, showing complete greed, and evil. His character is as cruel as can be and doesn't care who he kills or what happens to others just as long as he gets it his way, as he always does. Even the small characters played their part well from the drunk Union Captain to the old storekeeper whom gave me a few laughs to Father Ramirez (Tuco's brother) to even the poor fellow whom Angel Eyes kills in the beginning. And all actors gave a realistic look to it by the way they acted. They were not like some others in Westerns that had completely clean and well shaven faces. They had visible sweat and dirt on their faces, their hair was not always well combed (especially Tuco) and they were ragged when needed, they were more truthful, you can't go across the desert without getting dirty and sweaty. You could look at their faces and say "wow, look at Tuco, he's dirty and unkempt" and "wow, Blondie's face is all messed up? not the condition you expect the main character to be in" or "Not only does Angel Eyes have a dirty, cruel personality, but he looks so too." Another phenomenal thing about this movie was the soundtrack made by the ingenious Ennio Morricone. To call it amazing would be an understatement. The opening credits alone which is where that great music first graces the ears of the audience with its beauty are amazing. Even without seeing or hearing of the movie, you know the music, weather you've seen the movie or not. It has been in so many places, imitated so many times? you could start playing it to someone who never saw a second of the movie and they'd whistle along to the familiar tune. In parts it is strong and in other parts it is soft as a kitten. In parts it bears the feeling of adventure and excitement, and in others through the air vibrates music more solemn and serious. In many parts, the movement of characters is done to the music. It is a famous and historic soundtrack and is most definitely the most famous of Morricone's work.Leone directed it fantastically too. Firstly, he uses the widescreen in a way unlike any other except Akira Kurisawa. Every inch of the screen is important to him, and he either fills it all with people and action, or makes it empty to create an emptier effect. He also does many great camera angles and shots. For example, a sequence of cannon fire looking straight at the mouth of the cannon or from the side or some slanted angle. He quickly cuts between the firing cannons to show pandemonium and to make it seem like heavier bombardment than it could if he simply showed the land being hit. He also deserves great credit (along with Luciano Vincenzoni) for writing such a great story and script. It is also worthy to mention how he went about the scene in which the characters blow up a bridge. He hired men to build a huge bridge and then rig it up with dynamite. Knowing that he only had one chance at this scene, he set up cameras all over the place to make a great moment in the movie and capture such a great image.I highly recommend seeing this movie and others with these actors and Leone. This movie alone has changed my life and influenced me with ideas. There is so much to enjoy, observe, and learn from this film. Anyone who sees this movie can see that the actors are amazing, that Leone is an auteur, and Morricone a musical genius. No one but these men could have created such a great classic western.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really, there's nothing more to say. The characters in this movie are the best I've ever seen, the music is some of the best I've ever heard, the acting is some of the best I've ever seen, everything is amazing.Historical inaccuracies really don't matter. This is a work of art. Its kind of a shame that technology wasn't as good in the 60's as it is now, because there are noticeable parts where the music recording suffers because of it.There is so much good about this movie. Characters that appear only briefly are genuinely human and realistic; you are immediately convinced that they are real people with histories. Not to mention, every character in this movie is likable. Tuco, Angeleyes, Blondie, the Union captains; anybody that shows up for any length of time is a great character. Memorable lines drop left and right because of the great dialog. Buy the DVD. Right now. Seriously. This is an incredible movie, and the picture quality on the DVD is simply amazing.</fullReview>

The camera-work, the direction and the descriptions of the three main characters is just remarkable.

A movie like this in that period is not an easy task at all. Kudos to Sergio Leone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arguably the Greatest Western Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is without a shred of doubt absolutely one of the greatest Westerns ever made and very, very few can even come close. In fact, it is among the greatest films ever made and I can only think of 2 other Westerns that can even compare.Brilliant in every respect, the film is original, tense, very gritty, and very atmospheric. Throughout the film there is an incredible energy and sense of tension that suddenly mounts tremendously to a breaking point in the finale. The film, outstanding the entire way through, is pure magic from the moment Tuco stumbles upon the cemetery until the very end. In a short period of time, this last portion of the movie crams in the incredible scene where Tuco looks around to see the immense number of graves before searching for the treasure, and the extremely tense, gripping, and unusual three-way stand-off in which the tension becomes almost unbearable before the sudden, unexpected, and powerfully anti-climactic (if that makes sense) shootout.The cinematography is creative and artistic. It powerfully helps convey the moods of the events and adds tremendously to the feeling of tension. As usual, Leone made the film with extreme care and artistry, combining his "trademark" tight close-ups and huge longshots, sometimes, with incredibly stunning visual results, in the exact same shot (as near the end when we see a close-up of Tuco's gun and his hand slowly inching down toward it, while the bulk of the view is a longshot of the cemetery with another of the gunmen in the distance).The characters are fresh, entertaining, and beautifully portrayed. Lee van Cleef, Eli Wallach, and Clint Eastwood are all perfect in their roles, imbuing their characters with immense realism and personality while emphasizing their differences and their similarities. Lee van Cleef emphatically shows how good and versatile an actor he could be, despite the fact that he far too rarely got such big roles. After compellingly portraying the utterly sympathetic colonel in For A Few Dollars More, he is entirely convincing as a terribly ruthless baddie. Clint is great as the taciturn Blondie and gets in some great, convincing gestures, etc. Eli is the most incredible of the lot here as the garrulous, untrustworthy, but likable and sympathetic Tuco, a man boiling with life and quirky humanity who contrasts the other taciturn, calm characters wonderfully.Another element of this film that I love is the great attention to detail, another Leone strong point that pays off in all of his films This is particularly true with respect to the three main characters. So much thought seems to have gone into even the smallest aspects of their personalities, such as how each one carries his gun in a totally different manner. My favorite is probably how Tuco carries his gun stuffed into a pocket and likes to have it simply hang from his lanyard when ready to fight.There is also a wonderful sense of humour and I love how this pops up to break the tension even at unexpected moments like the cemetery and the final shootout. I also want to comment on Leone's handling of violence. His films certainly are violent in the sheer number of deaths (compare The man Who Shot Liberty Valance, where I remember only 1 person being killed), adding a grittiness to the films and making them less idealized and romantic. At the same time, Leone's scenes of death are quick and sharp, with most of the time spent on building the tension beforehand. I actually think that this not only makes a much more interesting picture with greater tension and less gore than something done by, say, Sam Peckinpah, but the quickness of the deaths actually is more brutal in a way than a drawn-out death. It hits home the cheapness and fragility of life in a way that a long, bloody death never can. Finally, Ennio Morricone's music is utterly perfect. It's brilliant and perfectly helps convey all the drama, tension, and general atmosphere of the film in the right ways at the right times. I don't think there has ever been a better score for a Western.This is one film that I can watch over and over, every time enjoying every little detail. One of the most amazing things, and one which really hits home Leone's incredible ability as a filmmaker, is how Leone can take this genre, and what is really a very simple story, and produce a film that goes far beyond what might normally have been with the film, turning it into a real piece of art and something far grander and more powerful than it otherwise would have been in the hands of other filmmakers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely in the best western ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up watching westerns and war movies. In our book there are cowboy movies and there are westerns. In cowboy movies the star is always neat, well bathed, and every hair in place even after a bar room brawl. In comparison, the western characters are rugged, dirty, dusty, tattered hat, and generally reflect the rugged outdoor, saddle bound life that tough guys endured in those days (consider a Terrence Hill movie where he takes off his hat and one can see where the dirt stops and his real skin starts.) The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is definitely a western and has everything one would want in a movie: a solid and interesting story plot, excellent acting, a ground-breaking director with wide sweeping shots and interesting close-ups, and one of the best music scores one would hear in a movie by the master Enio Morricone. The only western coming anywhere close to GBU is Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven. And a race between these two would would still result with GBU ahead for best picture prize because of the fantastic Morricone music score. See the revised version now out on DVD which includes scenes previously cut from the cinema version in the Western World. Some complained this movie is too long. Even with the added scenes it's still too short for me. I wish this movie would be granted a belated Oscar for best western ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My opinion about this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As long this is my first comment about a movie here in IMDb website, why not doing it in big style? The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is on top of my very best film list, even knowing that "Terminator 2 : Judgement Day" was my favorite film for at least 4 years. The actors, the history, the last duel..... words for what? This movie is a must, even people whom aren't western fans, will love this movie for sure. After this movie, I started to collect old movies, specially Clint Eastwood's old movies, like "For a few dollars more" , "Fistfull of dollars" , "The Outlaw Josey Wales" .... and I may mention the '92 "Unforgiven" as well.My vote: 10 , because 100 is impossible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly is the movie that can justifiably be called the greatest western ever made, and with that is also one of the greatest movies ever made. I just recently saw it, because i saw Kill Bill vol. 1 and someone recommended this 1 to me since i LOOVED KBV1. This movie is outstanding and should never be a remake(i heard there would be, sigh) because it needs to be preserved like other rop movies that have had sequels that do not live up to it(The Manchurian Candidiate). But anyone could love this, i see no way on earth some1 would give this a 1/10, it just makes no sense, whereas some movies that are great like A CLOCKWORK ORANGE can get a 1 due to controversy, though i would give it a 10. The Good the Bad The Ugly is instantly one of my favorite films ever and it never gets old. Brilliant 10/10</fullReview>

But my uncle bought a set of western classics and it had this master piece,so thought of giving it another chance.This movie was made for one guy,TUCO a role of a life time and he did it to perfection. Nobody complains when Clint Eastwood is there in a movie.This movies shows why.Then Lee Van Cleef a legend in this genre proves why he needs to be in a western classic. The story is so complex with a civil war background, that it has to be seen to believed. DVD version promising the xtra scenes dint have anything new to offer but still its always a good purchase when you have a western with Eastwood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The definitive spaghetti western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best westerns ever made. Boasts an unforgettable Morricone score, a typically charismatic performance from Clint Eastwood and stately direction from the master of the genre, Sergio Leone With A Fistful of Dollars (1964), Italian filmmaker Sergio Leone gave birth to the spaghetti western. So it is appropriate that he should take the helm for the quintessential example of the genre with this, the best and last of the Dollars trilogy (after 1965's For A Few Dollars More).Anti-epic, brutal and displaying an often overlooked gallows humour, The Good, The Bad And The Ugly centres on the aptly described protagonists. Eastwood (The Man With No Name - other than 'Blondie', or the Good), Van Cleef (Angel Eyes, or the Bad) and Wallach (Tuco, or the Ugly) are the three degrees of moral ambiguity searching Civil War-torn America for a buried payroll.In truth, however, the plot is incidental to the film's appeal. The spectacularly bleak landscapes, Morricone's cheekily melodramatic score, and the physical interplay between the leading men all contribute to the film's (and Eastwood's) iconic status.The finale's showdown is an inspired set-piece of sweaty tension and invention that has been blatantly lifted by directors all over the world from Woo to Tarantino. As cool as a cheroot in a heatwave.Verdict Sergio Leone's masterpiece is as enduring as the scorched desert in which it is filmed. Also receives props for most effective use of whistling ever.</fullReview>

At the time, I commented that it should be technically fairly easy to "splice" these back in and have people to voice over the original Italian dialogue.But then hey, what happens, ! They've gone and done the best possible thing, hired Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach to voice over their own original dialogue (plus another to double on Lee Van Cleef)- Almost forty years later !.This totally revamped film with its replaced scenes makes it a whole new thrill to watch. If you haven't got it, then get it pronto!I have no doubt that with the passage of time, The Good, The Bad and the Ugly will become certainly the greatest western ever made and possibly one of the top films of all time.See you soon, idiots !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolute must see. A movie full of Ironic twists of fate that reaches the dimensions of an ancient drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a movie par excellence. Not only does Sergio Leone in close cooperation with Ennio Morricone and his groundbreaking score manage to create a masterpiece of modern movie history. He also revolutionizes the Western by shifting the clean and glorified image of the west that existed so far and changing it into a dirty, often ugly and very brutal face. Furthermore he underlines some of the motives that kept this era going as they do today. Greed, violence and the absolute fight for survival and sometimes the strongest one revenge (which is a dominant factor in his movie Once Upon a Time in the West). However his characters which carry this movie all along give it a much more human and realistic feel. Lee van Clef, Clint Eastwood and above all Eli Walach make their characters become very vivid and the viewers sometimes catch themselves identify with them although they probably would not have expected it earlier. The twists and turns that bring the characters into situations that no one would have expected moments earlier are truly what life is all about; you never know what will happen the next moment. With a little twist of fate (and it twists a lot in this movie) the character that is on top on the one moment is the one who looks into a barrel of a gun the very next moment. The allegories that Leone uses in his move seem almost endless. Let's mention just two examples. The truly inspired and masterful invention of the amphitheatric setting of the cemetery which has a center stage that is surrounded by crosses and almost looks lice an ancient theater. It is there where Tuco, the Ugly (who is notably the most "human" character in this movie) runs full of anticipation like a little child trying to find a familiar face. However he just searches for the grave that contains what everybody is hunting after in this movie, the treasure. It almost seems like the dead are watching these three characters as they aspire to become rich or ... just become another cross in this cemetery. Inside this "arena" the final shootout takes place with Leone producing an editing with his ultra close ups that are breathtaking. In this theatrical surrounding the high point of the story (that has elements of an ancient drama) is reached. Another really astonishing moment is the final scene with Tuco, his neck in a rope, balancing on a cross with 100.000 $ in gold dollars lying before him but he is not able to do anything with that money since he is on the verge between life and death and all the money on earth not being able to help him. A truly ironic picture and Leone manages to produce a lot of such irony in his movie. Before the liberating shoot from the Good (played by Clint Eastwood who almost acts as a character who is responsible for divine justice) that cuts the rope, the viewer is for a moment exposed to the paradox of life and death.This movie is an absolute must see! Although some might think it is just a spaghetti western its influence remains unparalleled even today!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When we think how to represent movie we are focusing usually on four things. the first is plot. the second acting and actors. third is operator work and fourth is music. when i saw Sergio's masterpiece i found everything in it. Interesting plot with a lot of twisted,as road in Poland, situations that were used not only in other movies but in some cult computer games too ( for example in Fallout ). Actors that do they best. I like each of them but for some reasons I like tuco most. maybe because he is more "human" than other two? The operator work... I love these moments when he is showing only eyes. Suspense is almost as big as in Hitchcock films... and music made by gorgeous Morricone. I remember the time when it was main position on parties,except girls of course... That why I gave it ten points. For memories and really fantastic work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My dad, an acclaimed John Wayne fan has been preaching to me for many years on the magic of John Wayne films. Personally I have never really gotten into the 'Westerns' finding them all a bit boring. However, upon watched the good the bad and the ugly, my opinions have been changed forever. While in the 21st century, some of the camera work and sound dubbing might be a bit dated, it cannot change the true magic of this film. The general gist of the film is 3 people, surprisingly the good (Eastwood) the bad (Van cleef) and the Ugly (Eli wallace) on the search for gold. All three go down a path of betrayal and greed, all trying to get one over on the other.A great aspect of this film is the Ennio Morricone score which accompanies the film. The score beautifully accompanies the film by producing some memorable scenes.I won't ruin the plot of the film for those who have yet to see it; but the final show down will have you on the edge of your seat.Even if you are not a fan of Westerns, I would personally say that even this film may appeal to you from its sheer amount to entertain audiences from 1966 to present.Rory Mckenna</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has style - in a very elemental way - so to speak. You get an idea of the deadly, dreary desert, the deadlier bounty hunters and the deadliest of 'em all - Clint Eastwood - the man with no name! The story is a simple one to follow and is brilliantly executed by Sergio Leone using just the right landscapes along with some pretty good sets too (like the one featuring the Civil War sequence). Some of the scenes were meant to be symbolic (especially the Civil War scenes) and they did their job well.Eli Wallach is simply superb with his "Blondieeee!!!" screams and curses. Lee Van Cleef seems as deadly as the great Eastwood himself as "The Bad" guy.Cinematography - not as continuous as one would like - but manages to convey the tension in the dueling scenes very effectively.Also, the music - Ennio Morricone at his best! He has dished out some very innovative and brilliant stuff for all the three "great" westerns and this along with "For a Few Dollars More" seems to be his best.Finally, the style! Sergio Leone can certainly teach a thing or two to Quentin Tarantino or The Wachowski Brothers - in fact Tarantino acknowledges Leone's great style. And then the epitome of style himself - Clint Eastwood - with a half-burnt cigar in his lips, unshaven face, tilted hat, ragged jeans, a worn out poncho and the sharpest scowl ever which can rub out any "Neo-with-million-dollar-goggles" off the face of the Earth.Not genre-defining, surely - it was invented by Hollywood. But somebody from Europe really showed the world how to make westerns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best westerns, with or without spaghetti</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TGTBTU is a work of art. It took an Italian director to get the Old West right, at least on screen, dumping the hokey musical scores and make believe good guy/bad guy cowboys and indians hokum that killed a lot of Hollywood westerns, while retaining the epic scope that the vast landscapes evoke (even if it was really Spain). This 3rd movie centering on the Man with No Name (not exactly true, but its catchy) was the 1st that Leone got the inimitable Ennio Morricone to score from the outset, and that score has such an impact there's no doubt it has a lot to do with TGTBTU's attraction through almost 40 years. It really sticks with you! This Ultimate Spaghetti Western was also elevated by a bigger budget and much stronger screen presence of its principal characters. Eastwood, Wallach and Van Cleef are true screen legends, competing any which way they can for the stolen bags of gold, culminating in the most famous gunfight in moviedom.I also rate Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West a 10. It is a less revered movie than TGTBTU but in some ways is Leone at his absolute peak.The 2 DVD pack is an absolute must for anyone with even a mild interest in film. The remaster is a wonder of restoration technology and looks glorious. It now has a 5.1 DD audio soundtrack that remains mostly at the front, with an occasional surround explosion or gunfire that surprises you. They've added 18 minutes to the film, essentially the initial release of the film seen in Rome, and if you're a Leone fan you can pick out at least some of the added footage. The additions were good overall; for the most part the story flowed better but there was some unnecessary fluff. The 2nd disc has some good featurettes that include some modern commentary by Eastwood and Wallach, a little documentary on the Civil War backdrop, trailers, and even a couple of deleted scenes! The DVD gets a 9.7/10, losing a bit because it is in a non standard case that has no reason to be higher and wider than usual.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotions without much words</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(May contain minor SPOILERs)The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is just about as good as a movie, that's meant to be pure entertainment can be. The movie also contains a deeper message, concerning the cruelty of war and the value of the human life. Although the small-budget film-making, like in the two previous movies of the dollars-trilogy, has its own attraction, director Sergio Leone really shows what he's made of this time. There are some epic war scenes, huge explosions and realistic sets, that Leone no doubt could have been able to make with the minimal budget of A Fistful of Dollars.The movie is set sometime in the American Civil War. As before, Clint Eastwood stars. He's the man with no name, which is this time named Blondie. He still doesn't talk very much and he'll still do anything for a fistful of dollars. Although he's namely the Good he's not really a hero you can look up to. In fact he's only the least bad of the three main characters, who are all greedy and ruthless men, who are prepared to kill anyone who stands in their way. The Ugly is Blondie's best friend, partner in crime and also the worst enemy. He's the Mexican bandit named Tuco. Eli Wallach is wonderful as Tuco, he almost steals the show from Clint, being a cruel, stupid, vengeful, greedy, two-faced, but somehow also a very lovable character. The same can't be said about the Bad, the assassin Angel Eyes, who is played by the greatest of western crooks, Lee van Cleef. He's a ruthless man, who'll not only kill a wanted man, but also his family and take their money when he only needed to get was one name. When he gets paid, he'll kill his employer, because he reckons, the previous body wanted to hire him to do so. Angel Eyes also works as a deputy leader of a southern POW camp. He's almost the complete opposite of Col. Mortimer from A Few Dollars More. They are on different sides of the war, but the southern colonel is a much more honorable man.The movie contains an anti-war message. Although the Civil War only seems to be the set-up for the gold hunt which covers the movie's plot, war is criticized all the time. The POW camp could as well be a concentration camp, as prisoners get beaten near death as the choir is forced to sing, so the voices of the beating couldn't be heard. You are put to the camp for simply rooting for the wrong side. Also watching a big fight at the river, the usually very little-talking Blondie notes that he's never seen men wasted so badly. Later he even gives his coat and cigar to a dying soldier. He seems to be the only character in the movie capable of some sort of empathy. Who would've thought!The modern action film directors should take a good look at the Good, the Bad and the Ugly (some do, but to no avail). At least many movie villains should remember Tuco's unforgettable line: "When you got to shoot, shoot, don't talk!"***** (10/10 The top ten movies I've seen #4)The best part (Major SPOILER): Many to choose from, but there's never been a dual scene quite like the one at the cemetery in the end. While Ennio Morricone's wonderful music plays, the camera goes around to show us the whole scenery and Tuco's and Angel Eyes's emotions (Blondie is so calm I can't really say the same about him). Tuco is very scared, almost in panic and waits for the tension to trigger off. Angel Eyes, however is bubbling with hatred and greed. Blondie is still squinting calmly as ever. Never has a movie showed emotions so good without words.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is terribly under rated. This movie seems to have almost everything. Leone makes it so that we feel such compassion for his characters. One of the best parts of the films may be when Tuco is talking to his brother and when he's talking to Blondie about the great relationship he has with his brother, the priest. This movie is set on an epic scale and Leone steps up to the challenge of directing what Tarantino calls the 'best movie ever directed.' The opening sequence of credits may be the best I've ever seen. Setting the characters' faces in a monochromatic style while playing Ennio's main theme song for the movie was great. Perhaps this movie is under rated because Westerns haven't enjoyed the same prestige as other genres. It is true that most Westerns are usually drawn out, but Leone is able to keep with that sluggish pace and long running time, while keeping the audience excited and anxious for more. This movie is more than the greatest Western of all time, it is THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!! 'If only I had time to tell you.'</fullReview>

When I first saw it, I was drawn in by the imaginative camrea angles, the massive battle scene, the quest for gold, and the character of Blondie himself, a man of mythical proportions. The music perfectly compliments this sprawling atmosphere with one of the most memorable tunes ever. To put it simply this movie has everything, a great plot, great characters, eerily beautiful landscapes, wonderful music, and fantastic scenes. Even though their is come geographical errors in this movie( Its set in the Western U.S., but there are battles between the Union and the Confederates?), they don't bring it down. In fact i think they fuel its mythological feel, like this is a legend that isn't bound to historical accuracy. A geat movie that i highly recommend to everyone</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first watched Leone's trilogy when i was 12 years old. For the past 10 years, i have remained faithful and watched them at least once a month. One word could sum up this director's work: masterpiece. The very simplicity of the sceneries and the scenario, the chasteness of the characters, the alternative view on the West, even the minor faults in the shootings represent the reasons why Leone's movies are still the benchmark of all westerns. In this last film of the trilogy, the masterpiece concludes by portraying an image of the Far West that American western directors could've never even dreamt of. The pursuit for gold, the atrocities of the Civil War, human vices, all brilliantly presented by Leone. And all the above come in a movie that has no room for fresh, clean, crispy shirts that characters in various other westerns wear; And no, the sheriff is not a brave hero that shoots the bad Indians but only a man trying to make a living, the cities in Far West are not full of posh-ladies and righteous people, and above all when people get shot at surprisingly they get hurt! The picture of the West althoug not a rosy, happy one still is as real as it gets. And by featuring one of the coolest picture characters (Eastwood), a bad character whose just the voice gives u the creeps (Cliff), and one of the funniest characters ever to appear on a western (Tuco), this movie resembles perfection in its kind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film for the first time just recently, and wished I had seen it earlier. I have seen other Clint Eastwood westerns, which are usually good entertainment, but I think this is the best Eastwood western that I've seen. The cinematography was great, and the soundtrack was well suited to the scenery. Clint was strong and silent in this movie. Also worth noting is Eli Wallach's performance as "the ugly", which I felt was very good. I suppose having a European director is what made it a different movie from most of the western. The Movie looked at times like a European movie that should have subtitles, of course that could be because I already knew that it was filmed by an Italian director in Spain. Mix that with the fact that the theme is American (cowboy western) theme, and it comes out superbly. Bottom line is, it's definitely a movie worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having watched this film originally in the early 70's it was easy to distinguish this as a serious attempt at a spaghetti Western unlike the comical Trinity movies with Henry Fonda. There are so many scenes that are interwoven masterfully with one of the best musical scores from legend Morricone. The cassette tape of the score made excellent driving music in its time. I did see this in Italy in the 80's where it has always been intermittently screened since its original release but was a tad disappointed at the condition of the print. The new double disc DVD finally does this film justice as it blows up well in a big screen HT. They added stereo to the mono soundtrack and even managed to tune up the picture quality a bit from the previous anamorphic DVD. (If only they would enhance the other 2 films in Sergio's trilogy).If you have never seen this but have seen Fistful of Dollars or For a Few Dollars More, you will realize that Eli Wallach is a key reason for the added enjoyment Leone's fans realize with this film. Tuco is what makes this movie. He is the semi-bad guy you grow a soft spot for, especially in repeat viewings. His acting and facial expressions throughout and especially through the tense final moments of the film are almost without equal. I applaud Wallach who to this day is an active actor working in films (Mystic River) as he enters into his 90's. For some of today's youth who may be used to fast pace plots filled with endless stunts in a 100 min movie, all I can say is be patient sit back and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not having seen this until very recently, I'm going to try and give an objective review for this film with tentative criticism. I'm not all too educated in the Western genre, but supposedly this is the best, so I figured it to be a good place to start. Absolutely stunning cinematography technique, excellent characters and actors, and one of the most memorable musical scores ever help define TGTBATU's spot in film history. It's no wonder it's achieved the status it has. Having never seen any of the old spaghetti westerns before, I really didn't know what to expect. I was surprised but also delighted. For some reason I thought this film was going to be extremely realistic, so I was a little surprised to see hats getting shot off and rope cut in half by a bullets. I suppose it is part of the genre's characteristics and probably takes a little getting used to. Also, at the same time the film is very realistic as it introduces the theme of the Civil War at different parts throughout the film giving us a small glimpse of it's effects back then.Easily my favorite component to the film, the cinematography is simply amazing. Panoramic backgrounds and extreme close-ups do their respective jobs quite nicely to give this film more character that it needs, which is not a bad thing. I'm sure it's played a huge part in the film's notoriety and support since it's release. The score and the well-cast actors obviously had a part in this also. Oh yeah, and one more thing, Clint Eastwood...born for these parts.Being new to the genre of Spaghetti Westerns, I offer up my criticism with much reluctance. For the record, I enjoyed the film quite a bit and was not disappointed. However, I was a little surprised to find the film rated so high, even if it is the genre-defining classic that it is. What's wrong with it? Well, it's a tad too long for one. Not that I can't stay interested, I just felt they could have cut a few of the scenes. Also, while the cinematography is beautiful, and complimented by long shots, I feel these longs shots are sometimes a little too long. The cemetery and stand-off scenes in the end come to mind. They're wonderful sequences, just too long. It's not that big of a deal, just sensing a little pretension leaking out here and there. And lastly, the sound quality is fairly terrible, even if the score is decent. The quality makes it sound like everyone was in a cave, including the impressive score. I do realize that the film was dubbed...some of which isn't all that great, which explains some of the off-key lip movements from some of the characters, some of them English speaking. Other than those three little gripes, that may not have been such forty years ago, this is a great film that I enjoyed immensely. I will definitely add it to my collection soon and continue my quest to see all of the great Westerns. Anyone interested in Westerns, great adventures, or simply film in general should not miss this hallmark.Highly recommended, but not for everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say? I've never been a fan of Westerns but this one hits the bullseye big time, one of my all time favourite and thats saying something. An engaging story wrapped with a memorable script, inspired first class directing, convincing acting and a classic soundtrack. Yes, soundtracks are underrated. The music in this film is timeless and it's the icing on a legendary cake. If you haven't seen The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, go rent it out right now. It's a masterpiece without question and a must watch no matter who you are. Eastwoods best ever film, he's been in plenty of gems but this film is the one he'll be remembered for. If you've never seen this film make it the next video you rent, and if you have seen it before you one of the lucky ones. Simply brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film in 1968 in Sydney, I was 18. I had seen many westerns before and I had seen the first two Leone's in New Zealand the year before. I had also been a fan of CE and LvC for a very long time. The version I saw was cut and many key scenes were truncated or left out completely(I had read the paperback in NZ-great paperback!!!!). Still, I was inspired enough to write a musical composition based on CE's character. This piece was recorded in 1970 and featured on a hit LP I had with my band Blackfeather - it was called Manco's Theme. I recommended the film to everybody I knew at the time. The point to all this, this movie, although wearing 'western' clothes, is the closest thing I've seen to real art in the cinema. Like all great art , it has a life of its own. A++++++ (highest rating I can give)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good spaghetti western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good, the Bad and The Ugly really was appealing. I watched the director's cut version and although it was quite long in time, it didn't feel like very long film. Shortly, I liked the film, because I liked the spaghetti western features in it: like long scenes where the camera just shows the faces of people. Spaghetti westerns really have something that westerns which are made, for example, in Hollywood lack.The movie had everything in order. The plot was interesting, scenery fit the atmosphere perfectly and of course the cast was great. The main characters, including Clint Eastwood as the good, were credible. Unfortunately I have not much experiment in other westerns, so I have no proper film to compare it to. But I think it was a really good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (1966/Sergio Leone) **** out of ****There I was, sitting in this filthy theater, looking at my watch, waiting.... Then the lights dim, and that familiar theme song started. Everyone knows it, and has hummed it at least once. I'm talking about the classic theme to "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly". You might not remember it off hand, but you'd know it if you heard it. The screen lights up, and the movie has started. To me, this was the chance of a life time to see such a classic film on the big screen. "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" is about three men searching for gold during the final days of the Civil War. The three men are of course the Good (Clint Eastwood as 'Blondie'), the Bad (Lee Van Cleef as 'Angel Eyes'), and the Ugly (Eli Wallach as 'Tuco'). Blondie and Tuco are two criminals who work together. When they have a falling out, Tuco tries to take revenge on Blondie, but instead, both men accidently find out where $200,000 in gold is buried. At the same time, Angel Eyes is also looking for the gold. Eventually, their paths meet at a POW camp, and that is where the real fun begins. "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" is a prequel to a "A Fistfull of Dollars" and "For a Few Dollars More". I have seen neither of them, so I can not judge which is the best of the trilogy."The Good..." is probably one of the most entertaining films of all time. From beginning to end, I was glued to the screen, and it being on the big screen helped me enjoy it even more. Unlike Leone's later work, such as "Once Upon a Time in the West", this film isn't as slowly paced, and less poetic, but more enjoyable. Although, the Leone trademarks can be found throughout, such as the extreme close-ups, the amazing and famous score, and enough flies to feed a colony of frogs. The performances are amazing. Eastwood is ultra cool, Van Cleef makes a great bad guy, and Wallach is so funny, he steals the show! In fact, I was surprised by the sense of humor the film had. The funniest scene, in my opinion, was when Tuco is trying to read a letter left by Angel Eyes, and he reads it saying, " 'See you soon, id..." "id..." "ids...' ", and Eastwood takes the letter and says, " 'Idiots.' It's for you." Maybe it's not as funny written down, but on the big screen, it is laugh-out-loud funny. Another thing about this film that makes it different from Leone's other westerns, is that it just as much a war film as it is a western. It shows the hardships of war from both point of views, which is hard to find in a lot of conventional and mainstream war films.The music is probably my favorite thing about the movie. It plays a powerful role in it. Take for instance the scene in which Tuco finds the graveyard that they have been looking for the whole time. He runs through it, looking for that certain grave containing the gold. If it weren't for the music, and Leone's amazing style, then this scene would be pretty standard. But the music sets the pacing of the film like a train that is slowly accelerating. As the music speeds up, Tuco speeds up. As the music becomes for powerful, Tuco becomes more eager and greedy. This is one of the great scenes of this great movie.In the end, "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" isn't as artful or as operatic as Leone's later "Once Upon a Time..." films. Instead, it is much more enjoyable and humorous. -30-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After "Unforgiven" I think this film is Clint Eastwood's next best film. Most people know that two of the best westerns ever made are this film and "Once Upon a Time in the West" (check the Top 50 Westerns on this website!). My favorite part of the movie is of course, the showdown at the end. Everything about that scene is classic. The camera angles, the music, and so on.

		<fullReview>I remember the first time I saw The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Sitting down in my room turning on my little TV and switching channels when I saw that AMC was showing this film. I sat down and watched this masterpiece of a movie and was floored at how wonderful it was. I had always thought of westerns as movies that were just about outlaws running around robbing banks and riding horses. I was floored at the amazing storyline this movie had. I'm not going to go into the storyline because you can find that anywhere. This movie was very well made and deserves to be in the #1 spot in the IMDb Top 50 Westerns. I feel a chill whenever I see the final gun battle with Blondie, Tuco, and Sentenza. The relationship between Blondie and Tuco is one full of betrayal. The shot where the camera pulls up to the Tuco looking at the noose is one of the most powerful in the film. This is the movie that introduced me to westerns. Since then I have seen The Wild Bunch, For A Few Dollars More, Once Upon A Time In The West, and many others. I highly recommend seeing this film at least once, whether you like westerns or not.DAVE'S RATING: ****/**** Rent it today!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Checking up on the reviews of this film, I was horrified to see the sample review criticize the film for being too long! This film is just as long as it should be. There are no dragging points. Every moment in this film serves its purpose beautifully. As for someone else's assertion that they saw 25 films superior to this in one year, I won't say it is impossible, but they must have really crowded in the masterpieces over this period of time. This is the quintessential western. It reaches beyond its genre to any audience. I have never met anyone who felt that the film was less than a work of genius. And you just can't say that about most films. 11 out of 10. Proof of the existence of a Divine Creator.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have long been a fan of this movie and although I think the compelling nature of the story might suffer after multiple viewings, I think the artistic aspect endures. Leone "paints" his scenes in some sense. And that amazing scenery - the desert and the clear blue sky. And Leone must have been such a civil war buff to be talking about Andersonville and all that. But I have one question for this movie's fans with which they might be able to help me - that tune the confederate orchestra is playing while Tuco is having the stuffing beaten out of him by the big thug working for Angel Eyes - is that a creation of Morricone or is it an adaptation of some civil war ballad that dates from the historical time of the action? I find it a very haunting melody. In some ways the music, plus the cinematography makes this film. And before I go, what about Eli Wallach? Clint has always been Clint at some level but Eli's versatility is evident if one compares his role as Tuco to the many other things he has done over the years. So there are two kinds of people in this world - those who dig the best elements of Leone and those who just say "It's another Western." - Yours Truly, Blondie Ramirez.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply put, the Best Western ever filmed...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Growing up, there are certain things that you identify with, perhaps sounds, images, or smells; things that make you smile. For me, the one thing that does it all the time, is the musical score for "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly". Every time I hear it, all I can think about is Eli Wallach's great grin, Clint Eastwood's stoic gaze, and Lee Van Cleef's evil eyes. All in great fun, Director Sergio Leone's western epic marked the high point for this genre, and showed that you could do a classy movie in which the leading characters do awful things such as: 1) Double-cross each other constantly; 2) Kill more than their share of men; 3) Condone greed at its fullest form.The movie has the three main characters, Eastwood, a.k.a. "Blondie", as The Good (if you can consider him the good guy in this role), Wallach, a.k.a. "Tuco", as The Ugly, and Van Cleef, a.k.a. "Angel Eyes", as The Bad. All three of them are going after the gold, as Blondie and Tuco, while they were settling some scores between them, happened to have a casual meeting with a moribund soldier, who told them about it, and head in one of the most entertaining journeys in cinematic history. The fact that Leone chose the Civil War as the backdrop for his story, only created a sort of "irony", as there they were, young American men dying for something that they believed in, and here we have our three main characters weaseling their way through one of the battles, in order to get the gold. Truly classic!!!!The score by Ennio Morricone is in itself a main character of the movie, and it really creates that familiarity that every movie needs to have, in order to make a connection with its audience. The showdown at the end of the movie, has got to be one of the best climax moments ever shot, and ever seen on film (I only wonder how it never makes it into any of Clint Eastwood's highlight reels, during the ceremonies where they salute him). And the ending of the movie, only glorifies it more for its fans.I have to say, having watched more movies than I count in my lifestyle, that "The Good, The Bad &amp; The Ugly" is one of the Top 5 films that I have ever seen. The movie runs over two and a half hours, and I have seen it over 20 times, yet, it never gets old. This is a true gem, and one movie that is worth watching, if only because it carries the tag of "THE BEST WESTERN EVER FILMED". I know that it is somewhat contradictory to admit that an Italian director produced the best film of this very American genre, but you gotta give Leone his due, because he managed to create a true masterpiece. I LOVE THIS FILM.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific western!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Are you looking for a suspenseful, epic and exciting adventure? If so, "Il Buono, il brutto, il cattivo" is the movie for you! Starring Clint Eastwood as the Good, Lee Van Cleef as the Bad and Eli Wallach as the Ugly, three fast gunnin' cowboys on the trail of two hundred thousand dollars, hidden in a grave somewhere.The Good is a quiet but obviously deadly blond, the Bad is a sinister and corrupt Civil War Officer, and the Ugly is an ungrateful and greedy Spaniard. Together they make one of the most interesting movie trios. There's Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli from "The Two Towers", and there's Han, Luke and Chewie from "Star Wars", but none beet this unlawful bunch.I think one of the reasons for this being IMDb's number one western is the authentic background music. Growing up I heard it many times in different parodies, but I never had a clue where it came from. That's why I smiled when I started "Il Buono, il brutto, il cattivo". The opening credits blast out this great music like there's no tomorrow, and I loved it.One last thing I feel I must address: my favorite scene. Around the middle, the Good and the Ugly walk through a broken down ghost town as the Bad's thugs shoot at them. This is one of the best filmed shootouts I've ever scene. The partnership of Good and Ugly and their protecting each other was both entertaining and exciting to watch."Il Buono, il brutto, il cattivo" = Great Western Fun, 8.5/10.</fullReview>

When i made the list of my top ten favorite movies of all time i found this classic western Sergio Leone fame movie on third position, the other two movies (1 "Gone with wind" ) and (2 "Lawrence of Arabia"). I first saw this movie in 1989 when i was just 15 years old and recommended this to my favorites. So why this movie so impressed me, because of the direction, extra ordinary camera work, accurate sets and the magnificent music of the movie. The story is about the three different types of characters. Only one thing which is the common between these three character is seeking to find the buried treasure. Other then these main characters the other co actors also Performed wary well Specially the Storekeeper "Enzo Petito" is in so Laughable seen when tuco "Eli Wallach" demand him to open the mouth and then put the close sign in to his mid open mouth. this movie is the last epic of the Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood combination and its our bad luck that they never made another movie together.Please ignore my english mistakes.regardsVitalprince</fullReview>

If cheek bones were any indication of meanness Lee Van Cleef,probably the meanest looking character ever. The haunting, resonating music of the master Ennio Morricone that hugs the landscape and made this movie a Classic. When you are fed up with oil dripping fast food like "Beutiful Mind". "Lord of the Rings", this is an Italian gourmet. The ace is Sergio leon a Lawyer turned Film Maker and marvellous at it. Eli Wallah, from Spagetti Western's to "God Father", one versatile actor.

		<shortDescription>The third motion picture of it's kind, OR the first if you think about it. (May Contain Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****Excellent***Good**Fair*PoorTHE GOODWhen `For a few Dollars More' (which is superior to Fistful of Dollars) was released it was the turning point in the trilogy. Clint Eastwood and director Sergio Leone had turned this Man with no Name into there creation. Giving him new characteristics and setting. After the success of that film they needed a back story to there creation. A prequel was made, possibly the first ever or the first successful prequel ever made. It is rare for a sequel to surpass the original and it is even rarer that the third one surpasses them all. This is how the notion that Leone gets better with time started. I am one who strongly disagrees. Not only is this Leone's best picture but possibly the greatest film ever made! Here the character of The Man with no Name ( or Blondie as he is nicknamed by Tuco) has an interesting origin. He is not the hero we met in the first two installments, he is conceivably a criminal. He journeys the hills as a bounty hunter, captures bandits and helps them escape so he could get more money in another town. One day he has the misfortune (or fortune) to capture the wrong bandit, Tuco.`Such ingratitude after all the times I saved your life.'THE BAD'I'll ask the questions!'Lee Van Cleef made a career of playing villains. In 1965 he had the opportunity to play an hero in For a Few Dollars More, most likely his finest performance. Here he proves why he made a career of playing a villain. He is a menacing, ruthless paid assassin who always seeks his job through. He is after Bill Carson who hid $200, 000 in gold coins somewhere and Angel Eyes is determined to find it.`But you know the pity is that when I'm paid I always follow the job through.' THE UGLY`I'll give you a good idea where you can put it.'The character of Tuco, played perfectly by Eli Wallach is the man who steals the show. He is a bandit with 115 counties of crimes. He like Blondie has the misfortune (or fortune) of meeting one another. His character is unique, not in a Paul Newman and Robert Redford type of unique but unique in the sense that he's a religious man. There is a fabulous scene in the film where Tuco confronts his brother, who's a priest and they have an argument on how one had the choice of a being a priest or a bandit. That is one of the best scenes in the film because Leone is showing us the portrait of life in those times. How being a poor immigrant left you with little or no opportunity.`If you're gonna shoot, shoot don't talk!'THE BLUEThe Yankees portrayed in this film are not like any other captured on film before. They symbolize America in the `60s. They are reluctant to fight yet they have no choice but because of it they are depressed and want this whole war to end and live in peace. The drunk General is such a great character because it shows how drinking is the only thing that has kept him alive, for a while that is. THE GREYSince this film takes place in the West it is obvious that the Confederates are the ones mostly depicted. They are shown as a weak and dying race. Leone actually makes you feel sorry for them. Like in the scene where Wallace is beating up Tuco and the young confederates soldiers are playing the Story of the Soldier. Beautiful scene. `More feeling!' THE CIVIL WARTo understand the Civil War in this film you must understand Leone's past. He grew up during Mussolini's empire and World War II. He is familiar with the tortures of war and you can see it here. The war is brutal, sad, and chaotic, something the generation of the `60s could relate with. In addition most of the soldiers are young and perhaps poor. Another reality of war.The Questions, The Answers, and the ShowdownAs the film progress Clint Eastwood slowly acquires his trademark outfit. The irony in it is that during the whole picture Tuco is the star of the picture and then in that scene in the cemetery when Eastwood first appears in his poncho he shows who's the real star of the movie. There for the first time we see The Man with no Name we fell in love with in the first two films. But how did he turn that way? The war, the war had a lasting impression on the man. At first he didn't seem very concerned but after witnessing the event for his own two eyes it has an impact on his life and he decides to use his talent for good instead of his selfish needs.The title, The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly has become a cliché but there is meaning. The Good and the bad are simple but the Ugly has more meaning then meets the eye. We have a man who's good at heart and had the opportunity to be good in life but because of society and the way non-Anglos were treated in those days he was forced into a life of crime. That's one of the reasons why Blondie doesn't kill him at the end of the film. The partnership between Blondie and Tuco is humorous in the sense that we love there partnership and it is obvious that they enjoy one another but they still at the end screw each other up.Film Critic Roger Ebert once said that a real movie lover's favorite film was a film that reflected there own life. While I myself still haven't found that film this is the closest there is. Hence why this is my favorite film of all-time and such an influential film in my life. It is a real shame that the Hollywood community have underrated this film. Just like Leone's other projects. This deserved every Oscar there is. The picture is outstanding, equally outstanding is the direction, writing, music, cinematography, costume, sound effects, editing, special effects, and above all the acting. Especially from Mr. Wallach. It is great that moviegoers have discovered this masterpiece and have given it the respect it deserves. RATING: 4 STARS (****) "You stinking son of a Aaaahhhh!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It describes itself - it's good, bad &amp; ugly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the American Civil War, three bandits search for $200,000 worth of gold buried in a graveyard. Tuco works with and against Blondie (`The Man with No Name'); Angel Eyes works alone. They ruthlessly exploit the misfortune created by the war for their personal gain.The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, despite its simple story, is a complex, rambling movie with three character studies at its centre. The characters' adventures seem endless as their paths intertwine. The selfish Angel Eyes is despicable. His disregard for human life diminishes whatever sense of dignity or honour he seems to possess. He beats women, destroys families and tortures soldiers to pursue his own ambitions. Lee van Cleef, with his menacing eyes, impresses in this role.Eli Wallach tends to overact as Tuco, the clown of the trio. Blondie fools him easily. His nasty character is one of the few western bandits whose families are shown. His brother is a priest, a situation he turns to his advantage. He uses his brother's mission to help Blondie recuperate so he can learn in which grave the gold is buried.`The Man with the No Name', a ruthless figure in A Fistful of Dollars and For A Few Dollars More, makes his final appearance in this film. This time, Eastwood plays a character that appears more human. He is genuinely compassionate to the war's victims, notably when he shares a cigar with a dying soldier. His past remains unexplored in his search for the buried gold. His motivations are unclear. He earns much money as a bandit but we do not discover how he uses it. Eastwood's portrayal of this mysterious man is quiet, thoughtful and effective.Sergio Leone's masterful direction tells the story with minimal dialogue. He relies on the outstanding photography of Tonino delli Colli to create informing visuals. The use of close-ups and quick cutting established Leone as one of the finest action directors the cinema has produced. The climatic graveyard sequence, where the principal characters come to a tense showdown, best exemplify his artistry. Leone's unique approach contrasts vast landscapes with intimate details of the plot and characters. He uses music, editing and photography to create an operatic effect, a style he perfected in Once Upon a Time in the West.Ennio Morricone's striking music uses chanting, whistling and unusual orchestrations to create one of the most effectual film scores. The main theme is regarded as a classic. The music pulsates during Blondie's struggle across the desert and the haunting theme for the soldiers and the battle scenes is both mournful and trenchant.For many, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is the archetypal `spaghetti' western. Its flaws - cheap sets, poor sound recording and dubbing - are overwhelmed by the general excellence of direction, music and editing and its charismatic performances. The film marked a significant step in cinema permissiveness with its strong language and explicit violence paving the way for Peckinpah's brutal The Wild Bunch, the seventies' bloody crime movies and Clint Eastwood's popular tough guy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good, the Better and the Best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have, like most film buffs, my own top ten favourite films. No comment is necessary here on the story of the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly--we all know it and admire it by now. Occasionally, a film comes along which makes it into the 'top ten', e.g Saving Private Ryan, Dave, Schindler's List, Life is Beautiful etc. However The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is, was and I reckon always will be my numero uno. I enjoy the film as much today as when I first saw it in 1967. In 1968 I WALKED eleven miles to a local town to see it and walked home again! Some thirty five years ago! No Videos, or DVD's in those days! I also, when I got my first car, drove to whichever local cinema the GBU was showing on the night. When I eventually got a video version I thought all my birthdays had arrived at once. What's more, I was lucky enough to get the version which I had never seen before and is seldom seen since on TV, where the captions to each character appear in English, i.e "THE GOOD", "THE BAD", and "THE UGLY", instead of "IL BUONO", "IL BRUTTO," "IL CATTIVO", and a version which contain extra unseen (at that time)footage, eg. when Angel eyes gives Maria (Bill Carson's girl)a bigger hiding than we usually saw on the cinema version and when Wallace gives Tuco the severe beating in the POW camp, it goes on much longer than I had seen in other versions. Only recently I obtained the DVD, showing some scenes which were shot in Italian, but never in English and never incorporated in the final English spoken version. (They were in a "Director's Cut" version on a German channel some time back, but I suppose it was easy to incorporate them in a German version, which was dubbed anyway into German). I look forward to some method of "digitally" adding them to the English speaking version. These scenes were and would be still important to the continuity and understanding of the scenes. One is were Lee van Cleef, during his quest for Bill Carson, visits a military hospital. He sees the absolute horror of war and this is the only time that his character becomes almost human. He shakes his head in disbelief at the futility of the war. (Eastwood echos this belief in the futility of the war in a later scene at the bridge.) Another scene shows more of the torture that Tuco put's Eastwood's character through in the desert. A quite funny scene too! and two scenes, one before the arrival at the monastry and one after leaving, which helps the viewer to understand the whole "Pablo Ramirez and Monastry" scenes better. However the DVD did not show one scene which I saw on the German version. One typical Eastwood scene, where he outdraws and shoots three of van Cleef's henchmen. It is also my all time favourite soundtrack. Favourite scene- Blondie and Tuco carrying the stretcher through the wounded and dead soldiers, two soldiers pass by, Blondie and Tuco lift an arm and a leg of a body, the two soldiers pass on, Blondie and Tuco drop the limbs like two lumps of meat. Favourite script - Tuco-(while reading paper message) "It's for you, iidd, idii, ii--" Blondie- (reaching for paper) "idiot !" Tuco- (Glancing up) "Huh?" Blondie-(handing him the paper) "It's for you !". Priceless !</fullReview>

Clint, Eli, and Lee all give Oscar level performances; the added scenes glue the movie together and make it the movie it was meant to be.

		<fullReview>The Good The Bad and the Ugly is comes across like the scorching sun in the middle of a desert. Its high octane action together with breathtaking cinematography and powerful characterization are a treat to watch.The film is about three outlaws: each peculiar in himself. Blundy is the good. Although he is an outlaw, at heart he nurtures a good spirit. (consider the scene where he lets a dying soldier smoke a puff off his cherhoot.). This role catapulted Clint Eastwood to the height of stardom. Eastwood's flat intensity, the terse emotions and that faintest smile ever imagined suited the requirements of this role perfectly. 'Angel Eyes' is the bad, crooked guy. I couldn't have imagined any other actor than Lee Van Cleef essaying this role to the hilt.Perhaps the most happening and interesting character is of Tuco, the ugly. Eli Wallach provides the much needed comical interludes through this character in this gunslinging action packed potboiler.On the whole, the film is a landmark in the western genre and is liked by fans even today, 35 years after it was made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>......those who enjoy, as they would aging wine, this battle of good vs, evil ( with a little ugly thrown in for some outrageously funny tounge in cheek), and those who just don't have 169m to spare. in order to reach a climax we witness at sadhill cemetary we must remember leone is capping off two prior tales. and he must in the 3rd. of the trilogy, outdo the 1st. two to the hilt. he pulls out all stops using bits and peices of tricks learned from numbers first two. the musical pocket watch theme from a few dollars more can be heard once again during that incredible score as tention mounts at sadhill cemetary.ENNIO MORRICONE the legendary italian westerns vol. two, a section of the liner notes reads: their first meeting yeilded more than it's share of surprises: "when he open the door, morricone looked at me and exclaimed "don't you know me ? we went to school together!" riminised leone "at first,i thought he was joking, but he proceeded to go into another room and returned with an old picture. sure enough: there we were, the two of us, seated next to each other in grammer school. i had forgoten all about it but he was right..."(the cosmic joker ?)in american movies the score is always put in after the shoot. leone wouldn't dream of any shooting of a scene untill he first heard what morocone had composed first, which gave the director the vision needed to produce what should happen in the next scene. so it's this ultra-violent western captured by a dreamer(leone). the stuff revolutions are made of. meanwhile during fist full of dollars eastwood has whittled his dialogue to as few words as possible, thus helping create the man with no name image. the talking is done by tuco, benidicto, pacifico, ....juan, remerez/walach. every trick. cenimatic &amp; musically, of first 2 pictures comes together. the musical pocket watch theme from for a "few dollars more" is inserted once more to increase the tension @ sadhill sequence. everytime i know this movie will be shown on t.v. MY hands are tied. w that noose is around MY neck, standing on that rickety grave marker. i ain't goin' nowhere for the next 161 mins. and so, in this world, my freind, there are two diffenent kinds of people. those who dig it. and those who plow through it. i dug. 38 years latter i'm still digging. no other movie with ending such as this, is even in the same building as bruno,ilbrutto, il cattio.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The late Italian director Sergoi Leone shot through this film a mix of myth and realism which truly adds a new dimension to the style of classic western. All three actors played the role in a perfect way showing a professional and beautiful acting of western action unbeatable till now. The unholy pursuit of these three desperados of the $200'000 in the time of the great civil war makes the story more interesting and not like any other western where all they do is shoot each other. The movie may seem long (2 hours and 42 min) but is worth every minute of it. The music on the other hand is found on a higher level and is worth the Oscar it got. The suspense with the music was integrated together perfectly. A good example of the suspension is at the end when all three players stand facing each other in a trio showdown. I say that if somebody likes westerns then this is the best movie to start with. There are similar movies such as 'A Fistful of Dollars' and 'For a few Dollars more'.</fullReview>

The final scene in the graveyard was perfect, the score was excellent, Clint was as always great. The whole idea of the film was fantastic. I selected the graveyard scene as one of my favourite scenes in any film, ever. I've even stole the theme tune for the final credits of my film. The problem is there is so many take-offs and spoofs of this that when watched today it seems like a charicature of itself. However you have to remind yourself before you start to watch, that it's the original, not a rip-off or anything. Just pure Leone, Eastwood, Van Cleef, Wallach.

The scene with his brother at thechurch also shows he's more than a two dimensional character.I've made it a goal of mine to see every movie on the imdb's top250 list (I'm halfway done) and I can honestly say that so far this isone of the best.

		<fullReview>The best western film that I have ever seen. Only 1 film comes very close and that is Once Upon A Time In The West. Sergio Leone is showing everyone that he made the best western films ever. His way of making it is unforgettable, a simple plot, low ranking actors, a slow-motion film and the best soundtrack ever. That is his thing in this film. Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef never got the same high status as Clint Eastwood did, and that is a big shame because they are both fantastic, especially Eli Wallach. He got the main role in this film and he is doing it so great, that your starting to like him a lot, although he is a villain, but in the end all the three man are villains. Everyone knows the soundtrack of this movie, some people never saw the movie but they know the music. And it fits perfectly in every scene. The shootout in the end of the movie is a classic scene, and the music makes it even higher then that.I will not say that you must look this movie and all that kind of things. But let me warn you for one thing: "Once you have seen this movie, it will never leave you alone" A masterpiece made by a master: Sergio Leone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that defined the spaghetti western, well-told and full of juice.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last of the three `spaghetti westerns' - and the movie that defined the genre - `The Good, The Bad and The Ugly' is a genius blend of five items: a visionary director Sergio Leone, heart-stopping music by Ennio Morricone, and three marvelous actors: Clint Eastwood (the `Good'), Lee van Cleef (the `Bad') and Eli Wallach (the `Ugly'). I have seen it again and again over the years.Set against the backdrop of the American Civil War, circumstance throws the title characters onto the canvas as competitors in a race to find a dead man's gold, where each of the three exhibits the traits of his character suggested by the title. To be sure, the plot is a good story, and (egad!) many viewers will dwell on the obvious allegory on human nature suggested by the title. However, while mildly interesting, these are only useful as a yarn with which to weave the story, for it is in its thoughtful telling that this movie rivets us, finds its greatness, and which raises it far beyond not only all other westerns, but also most movies of any kind.It has an extraordinary knack of moving its principal characters around in a little and self-centred stage while surrounding cataclysmic events - heralding the noisy and violent birth of no less than the most powerful nation on earth - are noticed more or less as a nuisance! At one point the audience and the characters are compellingly called to a momentary sense of the bigger picture in a gorgeous pull-back from a camera close-up to a wide-angle pan of an vast makeshift graveyard - a kind of `hey, you lot, look at what has been going on in the meantime'!You can virtually smell the dust, heat and sweat that permeates this movie, and the cunning use of wind effects and lighting are much combined with solo-subject, no-dialogue cinematography to intensify the mood, or to show the wild loneliness, the potential, and raw immensity of this new country! And when The Ugly is afraid, the movie forces you to feel the stink of his fear over his ever-present treachery!The movie has many moments that set it apart from the mundane, but, steeped in the film's extraordinary theme, the drawn-out ocular bi-play between our three protagonists near the end is surely a film masterpiece.Do not expect often to see the match of this wonderful movie, for I'm afraid the consummate skill required is not available in abundance!</fullReview>

And of course only these actors could make the film much perfect. Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach will remain in history. The best western movie ever!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>those that bury the gold, those that find it, and those that steal it. Wow, what a great film this is. This, in my opinion is got to be the best westerner ever. It seems to incorporate the three aspects of every person:the good, the bad, and the ugly. The movie incorporated these three aspects into 3 different people.**POSSIBLE SPOILERS NEXT** And in the end not everyone survives to find the gold. If you like westerners, guns, or gold. YOU WILL LEARN ALOT FROM THIS MOVIE.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this film is certainly the best western ive seen, and is probably THE single greatest of its genre. Forget john wayne and his poncing about, and watch this instead. clint gives what would for him become a typical performance (brooding loner) with good support from lee van cleef (subtly evil) and a twisting performance from eli wallach as tuco (greed above all else, even his own morals, although the part where he visits his brother is interesting) excellent over all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a fine Spaghetti western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the American Civil War, three bandits search for $200,000 worth of gold buried in a graveyard. Tuco works with and against Blondie (`The Man with No Name'); Angel Eyes works alone. They ruthlessly exploit the misfortune created by the war for their personal gain.The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, despite its simple story, is a complex, rambling movie with three character studies at its centre. The characters' adventures seem endless as their paths intertwine. The selfish Angel Eyes is despicable. His disregard for human life diminishes whatever sense of dignity or honour he seems to possess. He beats women, destroys families and tortures soldiers to pursue his own ambitions. Lee van Cleef, with his menacing eyes, impresses in this role.Eli Wallach tends to overact as Tuco, the clown of the trio. Blondie fools him easily. His nasty character is one of the few western bandits whose families are shown. His brother is a priest, a situation he turns to his advantage. He uses his brother's mission to help Blondie recuperate so he can learn in which grave the gold is buried.`The Man with the No Name', a ruthless figure in A Fistful of Dollars and For A Few Dollars More, makes his final appearance in this film. This time, Eastwood plays a character that appears more human. He is genuinely compassionate to the war's victims, notably when he shares a cigar with a dying soldier. His past remains unexplored in his search for the buried gold. His motivations are unclear. He earns much money as a bandit but we do not discover how he uses it. Eastwood's portrayal of this mysterious man is quiet, thoughtful and effective.Sergio Leone's masterful direction tells the story with minimal dialogue. He relies on the outstanding photography of Tonino delli Colli to create informing visuals. The use of close-ups and quick cutting established Leone as one of the finest action directors the cinema has produced. The climatic graveyard sequence, where the principal characters come to a tense showdown, best exemplify his artistry. Leone's unique approach contrasts vast landscapes with intimate details of the plot and characters. He uses music, editing and photography to create an operatic effect, a style he perfected in Once Upon a Time in the West.Ennio Morricone's striking music uses chanting, whistling and unusual orchestrations to create one of the most effectual film scores. The main theme is regarded as a classic. The music pulsates during Blondie's struggle across the desert and the haunting theme for the soldiers and the battle scenes is both mournful and trenchant.For many, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is the archetypal `spaghetti' western. Its flaws - cheap sets, poor sound recording and dubbing - are overwhelmed by the general excellence of direction, music and editing and its charismatic performances. The film marked a significant step in cinema permissiveness with its strong language and explicit violence paving the way for Peckinpah's brutal The Wild Bunch, the seventies' bloody crime movies and Clint Eastwood's popular tough guy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was neither a western film fan nor a long films fan. But this film really changed my view. Casting was excellently done without any doubt.Clint Eastwood is brilliant as the man with no name(Good,Blondie) with right personality and appearance for the character. Lee Van cleef too with his sharp eyes and evil look really does the justice for his villain character here. I think it is his best performance ever. But none tops the work of Eli Wallach as Tuco. I really liked him in a character like this than his character in Magnificent Seven. Other factor that makes this film so bright is that the stylish slow approach of the film in developing the story. I think Sergio Leone is a master craftsman there. Considering his great directing skills shown here I would give 10 out of 10 without a second thought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visual and aural feast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The good, the bad and the ugly" was the third and final in the so called "dollar" trilogy, the others being "A fistful of dollars" and "For a few dollars more". Another Leone western "Once upon a time in the west" is often lumped together with these making up as fine a quartet of westerns as you'll ever see. Ironically, I saw the trilogy in reverse order and, as good as they are, the first two could simply not live up to the expectations created by this sprawling, over the top masterpiece. No amount of thesaurus abuse could quite do justice to it. It's the "Blood, sugar, sex, magik" of film westerns, a massive work of art shattering any preconceptions you may have had of what and what does not constitute a western. It takes the genre by the scruff of the neck, shakes out all the cliches, and then adds layers and textures of pure style.The storyline is not unfamiliar; three disparate characters, Blondie (this time Eastwood does have a nickname), Tuco and Angel Eyes are all after the same prize: $200,000 in gold. Tuco, played by Eli Wallach knows the place (a cemetery) while Blondie knows the name on the grave. Their epic search takes place during the American civil war. Leone takes the this simple story and creates a visual feast. There are many unforgettable scenes; my favourite being Wallach's frantic run through the cemetery. This ranks with the mimed tennis match in "Blow up" as amongst the most memorable I've seen. As stunning as they are this is not merely a succession of creatively photographed scenes. Leone has given his actors room for character development. Lee van Cleef is the personification of evil, a cold bloodied killer who briefly allies himself with Eastwood as a matter of expediency. Blondie is hardly your stereotypical hero. He is a fraudster, running a scam in which he pretends to capture wanted criminals, claims the bounty and then frees them. And yet he shows compassion; blowing up a bridge in order to grant a dying commander his final wish, offering a cigar to a dying soldier. And, finally there is Tuco, the ugly. As efficient a killer as any of the other protagonists he also injects a dose of humour into the film. Already responsible for the standout scene in the film, his confrontation with his brother, a priest, is a moment of sadness and power. In a way that is not explained this unholy trio are already inextricably linked before we first meet them and, as it turns out, are bound together in death as well. Finally, as if Leone's direction is not enough there is the music of Ennio Morricone. It is unlike anything you will have heard in a western and adds a deft and unique aural touch.A brilliant film which gets better with each viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my most favorite lines in the movie, this has got it all: action, humanity, the good and bad in people, and the greed. I saw this movie when I was only eight years old. Back then, it was purely for the cool gun battles and how funny Tuco acted at times. Now, I see it as a flawless piece of work and one of the best westerns I've ever seen.Lets' start off with Tuco, aka. The Ugly. Tuco is an outlaw. He steals, he manipulates, and he can be bloody stupid at times. Yet, he is not all bad. This character is the most interesting one in the movie, for his greed always gets the best of him instead of controlled decisions. He was my most favorite character in this movie.Angel Eyes, aka. The Bad, is one of the best villians ever in film. He rules others with an iron fist and shows no mercy to his victims. Just look at his eyes when you watch the movie. There's always this glint of evil just watching and waiting for innocent people to mess up with their lives so he can take advantage of them. I wish there was some more background on this character. I would have liked to see a movie about Angel Eyes's life.And then, The Man With No Name, aka Blondie, aka The Good. Yet he is not all good. He works with outlaws, turning them in, and then saving them so he can turn them in again for the reward money. Pure brilliance, because it shows that even heros have bad sides to them. This was his. Yet, Blondie's character also showed compassion. Watch the scene near the end of the movie with the soldier. That's an excellent example of Blondie's good side. I loved Clint Eastwood's character. He played it flawlessly.Each of these characters put together in a movie equal pure entertainment, and a look at the good, bad, and the ugly in everyone. Besides the characters, it gives great background into the American Civil War. This is my most favorite western in all time, and to pass it by is a serious mistake. Rent this movie today, and get ready to be amazed by the brilliance of this picture. Enjoy!MJR</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comical and Cynical at the Same Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Il Buono Il Brutto Il Cattivo/The Good The Bad &amp; The Ugly(1966) which portrayed as a sequel is actually a prequel. One indication that this is a prequel is the fact that Man with no Name begins to wear trademark outfit here. Also, story takes place right before events depicted in For a Few Dollars More(1965). Finally, film sets Blondie up as a mythical antihero in the making. Only film in Dollar trilogy where Clint Eastwood does not get beaten up. Surperbly crafted Western with hardly any flaws or boring moments.American Civil War and its grim aspects are important to plot of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly(1966). Portrays participates of Civil War as money hungry, glory seeking, absurdly idealized people. Examplified by a North and South army's fight for control of a bridge. The battle scene that follows shows Civil War in unromantic viewpoint. Cynical film about realities of American Civil War in same way that Giu La Testa/A Fistful of Dynamite(1972) was on Mexican Revolution. Civil War is shown in a harsh and realistic manner akin to that of an Ambrose Bierce Civil War short story.Blondie is an opportunistic bounty hunter with both heroic and villainous tendencies. His introduction to story is both suspenseful and tense. Clint Eastwood gives his most satisfying performance here among three films he did for Sergio Leone. Blondie is also a mythical person who has a good understanding of human nature. Although his main concern is money, Blondie still has some honorable qualities within him as expressed in his interaction with a dying soldier. A cool character who in story turns disadvantage into advantage.Angel Eyes as played by Lee Van Cleef is a purely evil and vicious gunslinger. Angel Eyes introduction is memorable as he takes out rivals who hired him to kill the other. Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes is second to Henry Fonda's performance in Once Upon a Time in the West(1968) as Leone's best villain. A pinnicle role in the career of Lee Van Cleef. Angel Eyes is the mirror image of Blondie with his skills with the gun and hunger for money. Makes Villains in contemporary Hollywood films look like wimps.Tuco is the most complex and sympathetic of the trio. Has an outlaw persona with traits of humanity that does not make him an entirely bad person. The Good The Bad &amp; The Ugly(1966) is Eli Wallach's film in same way For a Few Dollars More(1965) was Lee Van Cleef's film. Eli Wallach turns Tuco into a comical and daring character who is always trying to better himself. In a sense, Tuco is alike to Vasco of Sergio Corbucci's Companeros(1970). A well written and three dimensional character due to fine work by Eli Wallach and Sergio Leone.Sergio Leone shows Wild West life and scenery in stylistic realism. Sergio Leone by the time, The Good The Bad &amp; The Ugly(1966) came out had mastered his skills as a filmmaker which shows in direction and screenplay. Sergio Corbucci did his own take on this film a couple of years later with !Vamos a Matar, Companeros!(1970). In Companeros(1970) there is also an uneasy partnership as well as a good(Franco Nero), a bad(Jack Palance), and an ugly(Tomas Milian). Plot of The Good, the Bad, and the ugly is characterized by switching partnerships and double crosses. Each person teams up with one or the other to make it easiler to get the hidden treasure.Il Buono Il Brutto Il Cattivo is explicitly known for its flamboyant Ennio Morricone score. Its title song became a part of American popular culture. One of the ten best film scores by Ennio Morricone. What makes Morricone my favorite film composer is his ability to create music that is eccentric and grandeur. This film definitely has a big love for music which shows in the partnership of Ennio Morricone and Sergio Leone. Like in other Italian Westerns, each main person has his own theme song.Violent nature and sadistic behaviors contrasts it with romantic portrayal of American Frontier in Classic American Westerns. I think of it as a Western Noir because of the involvement of greed. Also, main characters are not clear cut good or bad guys but people with both characterizations. Humor is around the viciousness of story especially in the hanging sequences. The moment when Blondie shoots Tuco off the rope and hats off everyone else's head is the funniest sequence. Mario Brega is imposingly memorable as the sadistic henceman of Angel Eyes, Corporal Wallace.A dangerous moment was the blowing up of the bridge which is brilliantly set up with some excellent editing moments. Trip around the cemetery in search of hidden treasure contains fast paced editing, relentless cinematography, and tight framing. Sam Peckinpah was inspired by bridge explosion moment for his own bridge explosion scene in The Wild Bunch(1969). Cinemtography is flawless especially in composition, movement, and scenery. My favorite line is from Tuco who tells a bounty hunter he kills from a tub, "When you have to shoot, shoot, don't talk." Both Mario Bava and Sergio Leone had a love for the European arts, music, and painting.Highlight is three way duel between Blondie, Angel Eyes, and Tuco. Morricone composed a fabulous score which builds and builds until tension is big enough to explode. Excellent set up, crisp editing, and beautiful camera work makes scene an instant classic. Never lets down in sustaining a suspenseful mood. Coolest and most imaginative duel in a Sergio Leone western. One of many great moments from Il Buono Il Brutto Il Cattivo/The Good The Bad &amp; The Ugly(1966) which makes it unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate western!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a classic for the ages. It follows three men, Blondie, Tuco, and Angel Eyes, as they violently move through the U.S. during the Civil War. What motivates these men? $200,000 in stolen gold that is buried in a grave at a cemetery. This movie is a non-stop action ride with one of the greatest and most memorable soundtracks in movie history. This film was also years ahead of it's time, with much more swearing and violence than was acceptable in 1967. Made in Italy, it pretty much beats the crap out of many American westerns out there. There isn't one boring or lagging scene in this movie. If you like westerns, watch it. If you like action movies, watch it. Hell, if you just like movies, watch it. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly does not disappoint. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood--Blondie, Biondo, or the Man with No Name, The Good (sort of).Lee Van Cleef--Angel Eyes Sentenza, The Bad (definitely).Eli Wallach--Tuco, The Ugly (both in outward appearance and certainly inside).These three are rivals for treasure in this terrific Sergio Leone Spaghetti Western. All three actors are great. Clint Eastwood is icy, cool, quietly efficient. He turns in accused criminals for bounties and frees them before they are hung. Lee Van Cleef is also cool like Eastwood, but he is actually more slick and smooth, and dressed in black, is decidedly evil, and more dynamic than Eastwood in execution, if not better. But Eli Wallach, as Tuco, actually comes out best, in my book, perhaps because of the nature of his character. In Leone's Spaghetti Westerns, the idea is not John Wayne white hats versus the bad guys with black hats. Instead, our desire for entertainment is catered to through exposes of visuals and base instincts. Tuco embodies those base instincts. However, altho he is my favorite (including most humorous) character of the three, like I believe he is for many, he is certainly not one for my self-image. I hope not for yours, either. Anyway, at least Blondie has somewhat of a conscience. Angel Eyes and Tuco do not.Tuco personifies raw greed, and he will do anything to get the treasure and keep it all for himself. He is an archtypical Mexican bandit, who displays sincerity like a con man and proceeds to stab you in the back. He draws out the emotions, the tensions. His greed has great promise, but then his frustrations are greater, and his displays of both are sort of the life of the film. And he is funny. Well, actually, lots of the humor is because he is such a loser, so often outdone by the two other principals. Even tho they are not wonderful people either, we laugh at Tuco. That's part of the entertainment: Our emotions are not worked up to see the bad people beat the good people, since this distinction is not defined or even conceded to exist. Tuco is a greedy fat buffoon, Blondie and Angel Eyes are slick. Who do you want to see get it?This movie has lots of action, lots of violence. It might not be called outright graphic violence (in the strict sense of some Italian films), but it is certainly partially there, and it is well shot. The cinematography is superb, as the Italian Leone presents visual images that portray the American West very believably. The shots of the vast barren (some mostly, some all) landscape are excellent, with good colors and the camera bringing you around, in and out. Arouse us with all this, and the search for treasure, of course being stolen gold, keep arousing us. Then there is the score. It is western majestic, concise, catchy. The score's visual images are perfect for this film, which ventures into the wide open spaces.A great movie is not complete without a good ending. And it is great, beyond great, climaxing the themes of the film. As entertainment, "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" blows away traditional westerns by far. Treat yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the grand-daddy of all spagetti westerns. It is a journey epic of greed and mischief, made all the more strange because it is set during the Civil War but appears to take place in the far American West -- which is actually somewhere in Italy. All of this provides a surreal quality to the movie as it follows the three title characters on a quest for gold the likes of which hasn't been seen since John Huston's TREASURE OF SIERRA MADRE.There is an underlying sense of humor and satire in the film. Eli Wallach steals guns, money, watches, snuff boxes, gold -- and the whole movie -- with his wry comic performance. He is a nasty, nasty bandit to whom nothing is sacred, but he feels that it is necessary to bless himself ever time he sees a dead body.This is a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Third film in Sergio Leone's 'Dollars' trilogy is probably the most visually beautiful of the three. The actors play their parts to perfection, Van Cleef does a complete 180 from his 'For a Few Dollars More' role and even though he has the least developed part he plays it superbly, Wallach is amazing, and Eastwood is as coolly gruff as usual.I do feel that has a weaker plot than 'For a Few Dollars More'. There are also a few too many plotholes (how did Angel Eyes get a job as a Union Camp officer so quickly, and how does Tuco know him when they meet there?).The Ecstacy of Gold sequences near the end with Tuco is among the greatest moments in movie history. As usual Morricone and Leone make one the greatest tandems in film, ever.9/10 in my book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dismissed by Hollywood as 'spaghetti westerns', Sergio Leone's three Clint Eastwood-led features stand as tall as anything Hollywood has ever put out; well acted, beautifully photographed, superbly edited, and featuring the unforgettable music of Ennio M. And how often does the movie industry give us a combo like Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach? Lee smirks, Clint squints and Eli blusters, and we can't look away, from the opening six+ dialogue-free minutes (not counting the semi-comic credits) to the final shootout. Van Cleef is the epitomy of amoral viciousness--a different character than in the 2nd movie, 'For a Few Dollars More', and Wallach is unforgettable as the blustery, violent, frantic Tuco; but Eastwood, with sparse scratches of dialogue, is the soul of the movie. The (Civil) war scenes are big-budget, in contrast with the usual desert-and-small-towns in the other two parts of the trilogy. Turn everything else off and watch and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cinematic masterpiece, anyone?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I watched this film, I started to think about what all the fuss was about. But in time I soon realized that I was'nt just watching a good ol' regular western, but a treasure in cinematic art.After growing up seeing countless westerns like, HIGH NOON,THE WILD BUNCH,HOW THE WEST WAS WON, THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES,etc. It was clear that THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY had left more of an impact on me than the rest of the genre ever did. And now that I have watched it numerous times over the past few decades, (Theres the proof that I never get sick of watching it!) It's dawned on me that this flick will go down in history as one of the greatest masterpieces of film.So...Where to begin? First off, I knew I was in for something different when the first 15-or-so-minutes of the film opens with no dialouge. Plus the first appearance of "The man with no name" ,which occurs much later than everyone would be led to expect, gives new meaning to the phrase of "grand entrance". THERE'S MORE! Lee Van Cleef's "Angel Eyes" is the epitome of evil..Enough to qualify him as, The Bad. But Eli Wallach's performance as "Tuco" aka The Ugly, is the big scene stealer! Just about every line that comes out of his mouth brings a chuckle of laughter out of me.Sergio Leone's camerawork still amazes me. Never before have you seen such close-up emotion on the faces of the gunslingers and soldiers, combined with the backgrounds of Spain (Many shots strongly resemble different parts of my native California!) Of course I could'nt end this review without giving more praise to the musical score by Ennio Morricone.Easily the most definitive western music ever! The theme sounds glorious during the "Tuco on Blondie's trail" scene..Just ONE of my many favorite moments from this classic."When you have to shoot, Shoot! Don't talk"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint Eastwood's Signature Movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film deserves four stars. Not because it is the quintessential "guy" movie, with lots of action and shooting. Nor because it is the greatest western ever made. There have been better.The reason this film deserves the highest praise is because of the in- vention of a character that has defined Clint Eastwood's career. That character is The Man with No Name. In fact, it really isn't true to saythat this movie invented the character. The Man with No Name canbe found in every good western tale. His influence transcends eventhe western genre. There is something metaphysical about hispresence, as though he were God or the devil incarnate. This is thereason for the character's sublime power to command our attention. Clint Eastwood is perfect for this role and he has played it again and again.The Man with No Name is everything any man could want to be. In this liberated age, he is quite possibly everything any woman could wantto be, either. He is a flawless or virtually flawless character by virtueof the divine mission with which he's been entrusted. He is an agentof metaphysical justice. He has superhuman power: precise, pene- trating judgement, nerves of steel and an iron will. He is calm, cool and always in control under pressure. He is never frightened and hecan endure anything. If an ordinary man had these strengths, he would never be disappointed in life. Fans of the "Dirty Harry" movies as well as nearly all of Eastwood'sother work will recognize that those characters simply reprise The Man with No Name which made him famous. He has built his career on it!The musical score of this movie only adds to the metaphysical exact- ness of the characterization. To this day, I cannot hear the music from"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" without thinking of the carnage ofthe U.S. Civil War. Conversely, when I see still photographs of battles from that war, the music and cinematography from this movie come to mind. "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" is a superlative achievement. Like"Star Wars" and "The Day the Earth Stood Still," it has an atmosphereabout it which could not be equalled in a thousand meticulous sequels. It stands on its own as an enduring, defining mark in the history ofmotion pictures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The epitome of a gun-action packed, "shoot-em up", good(?)verses evil, western.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the top westerns of all time. Eastwood plays the tough, "semi"-good guy to perfection. His supporting cast does an excellent job of portraying his adversaries, "il brutto" (the bad) and "il cattivo" (the ugly). Set during the American Civil War, the plot takes you through the ugliness of death and nonsense of the battlefield, the atrocities committed against war prisoners and a memorable portrayal of a near-death, dehydrated soldier, played by Eastwood. As with any good western, there is a lot of action, the plot holds your attention throughout and the ending is worth many times the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably one the finest westerns ever made. From beginning to the end it is simply brilliant. The story of the man with no name continues in the third installment of Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns. Clint Eastwood is at his best Lee Van Cleef is always impressive but Eli Walach's portrayal of Tuco was the best. What I like most about the film is that it is 2 and half hours long and does not have a single wasted scene. It stays intense throughout the entire film right from the opening scene with to the very last. This is of cause partly to do with Ennio Morrocone's haunting musical score.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is my favorite western by far. i think it is a great western in the traditional sense. i think there are also great anti-westerns, such as eastwood's own unforgiven, and wayne's the shootist (which is my 2nd favorite movie about the west). GBU has amazing cinematography and acting and writing and directing. it is epic in its significance and plot. clint is at his best, with few words but subtle expressions that speak volumes. my favorite scenes are the interactions b/n duco and clint at the beginning, the civil war scene, and the scene where duco is running around the cemetary. sergio leone is amazing; however, i didn't think the other 2 "man with no name" titles were that spectacular. my 2nd favorite movie of his is once upon a time in america (the full-length version of course)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only one other western can challenge this film as the greatest representative of the genre, and that's Once Upon A Time In The West, another one of Sergio Leone's cinematic operas. Creating mythology right in front of our eyes, Leone chooses to put us in a world much the same as the one created by the German writer Karl May - among , mythic figures who just happen to live in the West, but they could easily exist in Rome or Ancient Greece. Unmatchable fun. The audience leaves the movie with the utmost sense of complete satisfaction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is one of my all-time favorite movies. I've seen all or part of it dozens of times since I was a kid, usually chopped up by commercials on TNT or a local independent station. Last night, in honor of Clint Eastwood's birthday, TCM showed GBU uninterrupted and in letterbox format. As good as this movie is, the letterbox version is even better. This movie can not be fully appreciated in standard TV format. Being able to see all three protagonists at once in the final shootout scene is a treat in itself. The picture and sound quality also seem improved in the TCM version versus the one shown on TNT. I very much look forward to someday soon seeing the DVD version with the edited scenes restored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sergio Leone Gives Us Another Classic Spaghetti Western!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone directs this spaghetti western with his usual talent and flair. It really showcases the acting talents of Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef as three me of dubious character, trying to find a buried treasure chest. Each man knows a small piece off the puzzle as to where the money is hidden which ultimately leads to someone getting hurt. A great story of greed and what it can eventually lead to. There is some debate as to whether this film comes up to Once Upon A Time In The West. Let's just say if you enjoyed one, you will certainly enjoy the other. Try to see this film on a large screen TV if at all possible. Add the great score by Ennio Morricone and you've got yourself a first class western!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could easily say that this is the best western of all the times, but I could be wrong. There's no clue between this kind of western and, for example, the one of John Wayne. However this is a masterpiece: Clint Eastwood is clever as usual, but the best is Eli Wallach; Lee Van Cliff was too much marginalized, especially in the American version. Morricone's music is at its highs and perfectly follow the images. The screenplay is complex but, as it interweaves humor and drama, it is not boring. The director is Sergio Leone, probably the best Italian director after Fellini. Naturally the overall score is 10/10.</fullReview>

Clint Eastwood may be terrific again as the Man with no name, but is Eli Wallach, as the fast-talking Mexican bandit Tuco, who steals the show. The portrayal of American Civil War is also extremely realistic, with awesome battle scenarios. If the western genre could be represented by one film, this is the one.

		<shortDescription>The Best Ever Western Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, there are two kinds of people; those who like this movie and those who did not see it. Firstly, I want to recommend this movie to everyone who seeks an EPIC movie, and also for those who are fond of Westerns. I will never understand those who do not like this movie, because it is not boring, the camera work is just fantastic. This movie opens a wide variety of new perspectives for viewing the cinema world. Sergio Leone gives a new insight to the use of camera. Leone builds a movie that is based on the action an camera use, which is amazing and I am quite sure few if none will be able to do such a thing again. Music is just on the top level, I really love the way that Leone uses Morricone's genius in this trilogy but specifically in this film. You can imagine this movie without words but without music it would not be the movie we love. Quotes or phrases that characters say are so impressing that one cannot help but remembering them. This is the true genius of Sergio Leone saying things in just few words and directly. You can find humor in this movie, a witty humor which is not meant only for adorning the movie but also adding new concepts to it. This is the best movie of Sergio Leone and no other Western movie be it by John Ford or some other director comes even close to this movie. Maybe "Once Upon a Time in the West" is the only other Western that can compete with "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly", but both are the epic results of Leone's boundless genius, that is why I cannot compare these movies, but I believe that "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" has something more to it than "Once Upon a Time in the West". For those who did not like this movie watch it once again if you do not like this Western even then, then Westerns are just not your genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Currently, I am trying to make my way through the IMDb Top 250 and the only one in the Top 10 I hadn't seen was this film. I was sceptical to watch this film at first mainly because it is a 'spaghetti western' which isn't my favourite genre. As soon as the film started, I was captivated and engrossed in this, quite simply, timeless classic. The acting from Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef is truly sublime for it's time. The way the actors used their characters to appeal to the viewer and to allow the viewer to explore the characteristics of each character is a very intelligent decision made by Sergio Leone in this third installment of these 'Spaghetti Westerns'. In truth, I was incredibly impressed and enamoured by the cinematography and the story-line and given that it was at least 30-45 minutes longer than it should have been, it did not bother me in the slightest. This is truly an epic film and unsurprising that it is considered the 8th best film of all time.</fullReview>

From the haunting score to the amazing scenery shots, this movie is incredible. Quentin Tarantino, an amazing director, has named this his personal favorite and called it "the greatest achievement in the history of cinema". This is easily Clint Eastwood best film and one of his most famous. The Man With no Name has gone on to become a cultural icon, from his poncho down to the stubby cigars he smokes.

		<fullReview>Truly the Best Western Movie I have Ever Seen; -The Theme Song was Awesome -a Wonderful Story -The actors in title roles have given such extraordinarily superb performances The three main characters make the film. Lee Van Cleef ('The Bad') is evil personified. Totally ruthless, he'll do whatever it takes to get what he wants. Clint Eastwood ('The Good') is the Man With No Name, not really 'good' in a traditional sense . . . but he has a certain sense of honor and tries to do the right thing. (Watch the scene when he gives a dying Confederate soldier a puff of his cigar - powerful, and it sums up everything that the Man With No Name is all about, without saying a single word.) Eli Wallach ('The Ugly') is Tuco, and he's easily the most complex - if not the best - character in the film. All impulse and rage, Tuco spins wildly throughout the movie, stealing, lying, pretending to be Clint Eastwood's best friend in one scene, trying to kill him in another - Tuco truly represents 'the ugly' side of people.Do yourself a favor and rent this movie if you haven't seen it. If there was ever a perfect western, this is it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An influential masterpiece from a once deemed "trash" genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can be said about a film that already has over 694 reviews (both professional and personal) on this site alone? Should I talk about the unbelievable set-pieces; the great cast; the criminally-ignored Oscar- worthy performances from all 3 leads (Eastwood, Wallach, and Lee Van Cleef); the 3-dimensional characterizations; the great performances from the supporting cast (those with and without dialog); the multi-layered storytelling; Leone's satire on paint-by-numbers Westerns; the breath- taking cinematography; the tight script; the brilliant direction; the classic music; the eternal thought-provoking themes of war, violence, compassion, and humanity; the intense action; the quiet atmospheric moments; the great action scenes; the violence; the timeless humor; the legendary climax; the behind-the-scenes moments? What can be said about a film now widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time? What about when it was first released?When Sergio Leone's "The Good, The Bad, &amp; The Ugly" first premiered to US audiences in 1967 (1966 in Italy) it was a time when many critics looked down on the Spaghetti Western genre as a whole. The Western genre itself was starting to wear off its appeal for many critics and said audience viewed the Spaghetti Western as an excuse to depict senseless violence which is exactly what they criticized about Leone's film. Critics at TIME, Variety, The New York Times, and the L.A. Times are a few examples of the major US publications that gave negative reviews to Leone's film. I write all this neither to mock the critics' opinions nor their reviews of the film at the time because from a historian's perspective these reviews provide insight into the US' critical movie culture towards a genre deemed then as violent trash. Yet history has shown a different opinion since its release.Upon the film's release it became a hit (both national and international) and more importantly was influential beyond film becoming iconic in countless forms of art. The film breathed new life into the Western; the main theme topped 1968 charts for a year and now is one of the most recognized movie themes ever; "A Fistful of Dollars" introduced Eastwood's "Man With No Name" character but this film cemented him as an icon in the public mind. Many filmmakers, musicians, writers, painters, designers (clothing, video games, etc) point this film out as influential in their careers. Again I will not spoil anything and anyone curious about the film should definitely check it out. Personally speaking I can't say enough about the film and I always notice something new every time I watch it whether in the background or a character's mannerisms. I have watched it countless times and have yet to tire of it. Not only is "The Good, The Bad, &amp; The Ugly" one of the all-time greatest films ever made it's my all-time favorite film. Shalom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leone's Masterpiece, and the Best of the "Dollars" Trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is Sergio Leone's masterpiece. It is beautifully shot, first of all, with creative cinematography and a certain style that many westerns have tried to copy but can never live up to. The musical score drives the movie forward and can be suspenseful or adventurous interchangeably. The acting is pretty good, and the story is intriguing. The character motivations are very sensible, and not predictable (most of the time). The dialogue crackles with wit and chutzpah that produces many a movie quote. The best part of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (besides the classic, tense, edge-of-your-seat final shootout scene), is the beginning. For the first five minutes there is no dialogue spoken, something only the best movies and best filmmakers can do. This is one of the best movies ever made, behind The Shawshank Redemption and The Godfather.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie from the opening credits on. The plot was captivating, the characters larger than life, and the music was stunning.I wasn't aware of the term "spaghetti western" when I first saw it, but I did notice certain things that stood out, such as the use of wine instead of liquor in a certain scene, and the not quite sync of the actors lips as they spoke. I was touched by the horror of war and the emotion displayed by the characters. I too, felt like shedding a tear at a certain point. It brought home the grittiness, bloodiness and tragedy of the Civil War, not to mention a wry sense of humor timed perfectly, yet maturely. I felt a sense of shifting gears between this style of western and the westerns my parents grew up on, such as the John Wayne, or Audie Murphy styles. This was a great film.</fullReview>

Another thing I didn't like about the good, the bad, and the ugly is it is too long. They should of removed the more boring parts. I also thought there was not enough action. What I did like about it was the story. It kept me interested. I also really liked the soundtrack. It is very memorable and cool.

		<shortDescription>Best Movie of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A vast empty Western landscape. The camera pans across it. Then the shot slides onto a sunburned, desperate face. The long shot has become a closeup without a cut, revealing that the landscape was not empty but occupied by a desperado very close to us.In these opening frames, Sergio Leone established a rule that he follows throughout "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly." The rule is that the ability to see is limited by the sides of the frame. At important moments in the film, what the camera cannot see, the characters cannot see, and that gives Leone the freedom to surprise us with entrances that cannot be explained by the practical geography of his shots.There is a moment, for example, when men do not notice a vast encampment of the Union Army until they stumble upon it. And a moment in a cemetery when a man materializes out of thin air even though he should have been visible for a mile. And the way men walk down a street in full view and nobody is able to shoot them, maybe because they are not in the same frame with them.Leone cares not at all about the practical or the plausible, and builds his great film on the rubbish of Western movie clichés, using style to elevate dreck into art. When the movie opened in America in late 1967, not long after its predecessors "A Fistful of Dollars" (1964) and "For a Few Dollars More" (1965), audiences knew they liked it, but did they know why?I saw it sitting in the front row of the balcony of the Oriental Theatre, whose vast wide screen was ideal for Leone's operatic compositions. I responded strongly, but had been a movie critic less than a year, and did not always have the wisdom to value instinct over prudence. Looking up my old review, I see I described a four-star movie but only gave it three stars, perhaps because it was a "spaghetti Western" and so could not be art.But art it is, summoned out of the imagination of Leone and painted on the wide screen so vividly that we forget what marginal productions these films were--that Clint Eastwood was a Hollywood reject, that budgetary restraints ($200,000 for "Fistful") caused gaping continuity errors, that there wasn't a lot of dialogue because it was easier to shoot silent and fill the soundtrack with music and effects. There was even a pathetic attempt to make the films seem more American; I learn from the critic Glenn Erickson that Leone was credited as "Bob Robertson" in the early prints of "Fistful," and composer Ennio Morricone, whose lonely, mournful scores are inseparable from the films, was "Dan Savio." Even Eastwood's character, the famous Man With No Name, was an invention of the publicists; he was called Joe in the first movie, Manco in the second, and Blondie in the third.HALF REVIEW BY ----- Roger Ebert</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, i rarely watch old, aesthetic movies like this. But one night me and my dad decided we'd watch a movie, and i am always the one who picks the movie. But that day i toughed maybe it was his turn. So we browsed what would be on the telly, and my dad saw an old spaghetti- western with Clint Eastwood as main character, and he had already decided. And only after the movie, i realized that this movie, even tough it was made in 1965, the same year as my dad was born, could be such nerve wracking and exciting! Considering all the special effects and explosions we get from Michael Bay today, this was just a masterpiece, a classic that you could watch any day of the year. because if you watch the same explosion over and over again, you'll get tired eventually, but not the scene where Blondie (Clint) is having "SPOILERS" a shoot-off with the other dudes in the graveyard at the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know what I'm about to write is nothing new but I figured I would write a review on one of my favorite movies.This movie kicks ass, Eastwood is the man, I dig Van Cleef but my favorite character has to be Tuco played by the still kicking at almost 100 Eli Wallach!Great cinematography, minimal dialogue, and kick ass violence is what this film is all about. Yes it is a bit overlong, but with repeated viewing I have learned to appreciate it.As an actor I only can wish that I was in this, preferably TUCo, but at least I get to appreciate this on Widescreen Blu-Ray! If you have never seen this flick, by all means check it out on Youtube or just go out and Buy It! I promise it's worth it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite films of all time.It starts with a close up of Lee Van Cleef's face, closer than any modern star would allow for fear of showing up their blemishes and poor skin. At one point he twitches his eye; slightly -- so cool. This builds up the atmosphere beautifully.The movie progresses, building up tension in a, now, well known cowboy movie format, which was basically invented by Sergio Leone, and copied by many contemporary directors including Tarentino.Near the end there is a huge battle culminating in a bridge blowing up -- really -- you can actually see bits of the bridge falling around the actors, it's a wonder none of them were hurt.The story is secondary to the atmosphere and the talent shown by the actors, camera crew and director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the third,and arguably the best, of the so-called "spaghetti western" trilogy. It is ironic that, at the time the three Sergio Leone westerns were released, they were largely panned by critics as being poor and even laughable imitations of American-made westerns. The fact that they were filmed in Italy and Spain resulted in them receiving their amusing nickname which was intended to degrade them at the time.Somehow, over the quarter century or so since their release, the critics have tended to change their opinions, and now these movies are generally regarded as classics. Perhaps this is because Clint Eastwood was principally known only as the second banana, Rowdy Yates, in the television series "Rawhide" when the films were produced but since then has achieved super stardom. But I also think it goes beyond that. I believe the critics decided to take another look at these films and realized that they had been premature in writing them off. Actually, I believe the three films were considerably better than most of what Hollywood produced. In fact, I think that TGTBATU ranks among the best westerns ever produced bringing to mind the magnificent films of John Ford, the undisputed master of that genre, and his protégé, the incomparable John Wayne.I have nothing but praise for this film. In fact, I rank it as one of my favorite films of all time. I could write volumes of what is good about this film. But since its qualities have been oft repeated in other viewer reviews, I will focus on what others didn't like about it. Most of the IMDb reviews had only one major complaint: the film is too long. I disagree. In fact, in spite of its nearly three hour length, I was disappointed that it ended. I was so absorbed in the film that I was disheartened to have to return to reality. The combination of story, cinematography, acting and musical score left nothing to be desired other than more of the same! The sequences that seemed to drag on in the opinion of other reviewers were necessary to fully create moods and to drive home important points. For example, the opening sequence might be regarded as needlessly long as Angel Eyes taunts a hapless man over a leisurely meal. But to me, scenes like that are what makes the movie great! The time allows the viewer to fully appreciate the amazing replication of the primitive home and the pitiful life of its dirt-poor inhabitants. I felt as though I was sitting there at the table; I was half tempted to reach for a bowl and spoon to partake of the meal. And all the while the suspense was building towards the inevitable climax. You know it's coming but not when and the length of the scene drives you crazy but makes it all the more satisfying when it does happen.Another example is when Tuco punishes Joe by forcing him to walk through the desert. This is possibly the only time that one might become bored with the film. But again, I think the time for the scene was justified in that we are able to receive the full impact of that experience and enjoy the haunting music at the same time. Joe's subsequent predicament might not have had much credibility had this sequence been abbreviated.In my opinion, one of the essential elements of a great film is creating moods that absorb our attention. This often takes time, lots of time. For example, many of the scenes in the magnificent film "Dr. Zhivago" were almost painfully long but they were necessary to create those startling surrealistic moods, and the film would not have been great without them. In many ways, TGTBATU has this same sort of greatness. It is a sweeping epic with very compelling characters and magnificent settings that draws the viewer in and doesn't release him until the closing credits begin to roll. When it's over, you feel that you've been on a long and exciting journey. Such a journey takes time.In summary, if you haven't seen this film, buy it right away. Don't rent it because you will not want to part with it once you've seen it.Then curl up with it on a cold, rainy Sunday afternoon when you are in no hurry to do anything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I ain't that great when it comes to Western films, but this one truly lives up to it's spaghetti western feel. Clint Eastwood is great as always, and this time as the man with no name, he pulls off a haunting character who, even though is tagged as "good," may not have a complete absence of bad. "The Good the Bad and the Ugly" essentially follows three men who will eventually meet on the same hunt for gold, which is buried in an unknown gravesite with an unknown gravestone. The film revolves around the answers leading up to the finding. While it is a tad long, this film had far too much going for it for that to be a fault. I absolutely loved this movie! Great direction, great cinematography, and the screenplay made the film extremely engaging!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" is Sergio Leone's epic masterpiece. While it is part of his Spaghetti Western Trilogy( all three films have different characters and plots), the film stands on its own and really shows you how good a movie can really be. This movie has it all. It has action, drama and even some comic relief in it. It is a timeless classic that is unforgettable. When I first saw it, I was a little kid and couldn't truly appreciate it as I can now at age 22.Blondie (The Man with No Name) isn't your typical good guy. He mainly does things that suits his own agenda. However, when compared to the murderous Angel Eyes and the greedy Tuco, Blondie is a saint. This tale involves bloodshed, shoot-outs, search for treasure, and double-crossing. And it all takes place while the Civil War is going on, which makes things a lot more "interesting" for the notorious three. The West has never been wilder or more unpredictable than it is now. With an incredible score, excellent acting, and superb story-telling, this is one memorable film that you will never forget.As I said in the beginning, the first time I saw this was when I was a little kid. When I just recently purchased this new edition of the movie, it truly was like I was watching it for the first time. Coming from a guy who isn't a big fan of Westerns (I don't mind them, but I don't watch too many of them), I absolutely LOVED this film. In fact, I wanted to give it a standing ovation when it was all said and done due to how moved I was by it. This really is filmmaking at its finest. I wasn't terribly impressed with Leone's "Once Upon a Time in America," but he is absolutely flawless with this amazing and timeless Western</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Good Blondie (Clint Eastwood), The Bad Sentenza (Lee Van Cleef), and The Ugly Tuco (Eli Wallach) are racing to find buried gold during the civil war.Blondie and Tuco had a scam where Blondie would bring in Tuco for the reward. Just when Tuco is about to be hanged, Blondie would shot Tuco down off the noose. Except the last time when Blondie double crossed Tuco and left him behind. So comrades in crime turn into enemies. Just as Blondie is about to be killed by Tuco, Blondie hears a name from a dead soldier. That name leading to the buried gold. So enemies become comrades in crime once again.The action is bigger than before. The scale of the movie is bigger. The number of people is bigger. The sets are bigger. The battle scene is gigantic.But it's Eli Wallach that steals the show. He is able to bring humor into this movie. He and Clint really have great chemistry together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot is snail-paced if you consider watching it in now (2013) mostly because, many sequences have huge potential to bore the hell out of you at a time of fast-paced action-thrillers.Now the discrepancies are mentioned, the epic western movie does strike multiple chords throughout its 3 hour time-line. The amazing climax, the gun-slinging shots, the surprise action moves &amp; of course, human nature theme are portrayed with such brilliance that you wonder how much effort went behind them. The soundtrack is one more melodious thing about it.Cast performance is fantastic &amp; Sergio Leone's direction works wonders with the genuine locations. The story is fresh &amp; entertains fine. A humble 7.5 out of 10 for the wonderful &amp; most probably the best western to come out of 20th century; that 21st century stands out.BOTTOM LINE: Recommended for people who love westerns. Others may get bored.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

Though long, it is never overlong, being an amazingly involving story of three ruthless yet disparate men. Performances are perfect, script filled with funny &amp; memorable lines, and climax in the cemetery, both the 'Ecstasy Of Gold' &amp; ' Final Showdown' the perfect cinematic experience, so memorably does it combine character, story, direction, and score.My favorite film of all time, which stands up to repeated viewings.

		<fullReview>Out of all the movies I have seen, this must be one of the few that I have seen over a dozen times already. And that's coming from a non western fan! You clearly don't have to be a western fan to have a love and appreciating for this movie. Every movie lover in general should be capable of appreciating the quality, art and talent that is all present in this movie.It's one of those rare movies in which everything comes together perfectly. The story, the directing, the acting, the settings, the music. Everything fits and works out perfectly. All elements strengthen each other as well. The music strengthens its images, the director its actors, etcetera. Would the movie had been just as good and unforgettable with a different cast? Or different music, or a different director? Probably not. It would be like replacing an instrument in a Mozart composition, or changing some of the colors in a Picasso painting. All of the elements need each other to become the great masterpiece that "Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo." is.One of the reasons why I have always loved this movie is because it's buildup as a real adventurous movie, in which the hunt for a treasure plays a very central role. It takes the main characters to all kinds of different places, where they meet all kinds of different people and each time run into different problems as well. Really, this movie is basically an adventure movie, disguised as a western. It also really makes this movie unique in its genre and so extremely likable and easy to watch, time after time, despite its long running time.Also the interaction between the three main character is just great. They often trade roles and alliances with each other and constantly try to be one step ahead of the other. They never thrust each other and for good reasons. None of the characters are truly good or bad, even though the title of the movie might suggest otherwise.And needless to say that the three main parts are also perfectly cast ones. Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef all rarely have been better. And they also make it real difficult to pick a favorite character. Each of them has their own qualities and certain amount of charm and likability level to them.There is also no big surprise in it that the movie is really skilfully directed and put together by Sergio Leone, who obviously was a master of the genre. He perfectly combines both visual and story elements, with an equal amount of eye for detail for both. He pretty much perfected the spaghetti western genre at the time pretty much on his own and his influences can still be seen back in modern movies now days.One of his finest moments of course comes during its final shootout. But I actually think it are the movie its last 30 minutes in general that are just great, the moment Tuco first enters the cemetery. It's really something that's among the greatest moments out of movie history.The shootout, or Mexican standoff, itself is really nothing short of brilliant. Its compositions, the editing, its close-ups, the Ennio Morricone music. Could had things been more perfect? It has such a great buildup, in which the characters are slowly moving and looking around at first. The music helps to buildup the tension, then it swells up and when you expect things to go down it goes suddenly entirely quiet. However then the music suddenly starts again and the buildup gets even more intense, with fast cuts and even more extreme closeups. Truly one of the best and most memorable movie moments out of movie history.The only shame about this movie is that there are actually still people out there who haven't seen it yet!10/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Western Film Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is an epic spaghetti western film directed by Sergio Leone.It stars Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach in the title roles. The screenplay was written by Age &amp; Scarpelli, Luciano Vincenzoni and Leone, based on a story by Vincenzoni and Leone.In the last and the best installment of his so-called "Dollars" trilogy of Sergio Leone-directed westerns,Eastwood reprised the role of a taciturn, enigmatic loner. Here he searches for a cache of stolen gold against rivals the Bad,a ruthless bounty hunter, and the Ugly, a Mexican bandit. "Blondie": The Good, a.k.a. the Man with No Name is a subdued, cocksure bounty hunter who teams with Tuco, and Angel Eyes temporarily, to find the buried gold. Blondie and Tuco have an ambivalent partnership. Tuco knows the name of the cemetery where the gold is hidden, but Blondie knows the name of the grave where it is buried, forcing them to work together to find the treasure. In spite of this greedy quest, Blondie's pity for the dying soldiers in the chaotic carnage of the War is evident. "I've never seen so many men wasted so badly," he laments.Van Cleef plays as Angel Eyes: The Bad, a ruthless, unfeeling, and sociopath mercenary named "Angel Eyes", who always finishes a job he's paid for which is usually finding and killing?people. When Blondie and Tuco are captured while posing as Confederate soldiers, Angel Eyes is the Union sergeant who interrogates and tortures Tuco, eventually learning the name of the cemetery where the gold is buried, but not the name on the tombstone. Angel Eyes forms a fleeting partnership with Blondie, but Tuco and Blondie turn on Angel Eyes when they get their chance.Wallach plays as Tuco: The Ugly, Tuco Benedicto Pacífico Juan María Ramírez, a comical, oafish though proved also very dangerous, fast talking bandit who is wanted by the authorities for a long list of crimes. Tuco manages to discover the name of the cemetery where the gold is buried, but he does not know the name of the grave?only Blondie does. This state of affairs forces Tuco to become reluctant partners with Blondie.I consider this the greatest of the westerns made by Leone for it features a compelling story, memorable performances, breathtaking landscapes,interesting characters and most of all,a haunting score by Ennio Morricone that remains a classic up to present.</fullReview>

The movie could really inspire anyone to be a cowboy. It has gun sequences every turn,you never know what the man with no name is gonna get into. It is a movie for anyone who likes action. This movie changed the era of modern John Wayne western style classics. It is breathtaking and i don't think anyone should miss it.

		<shortDescription>The Best Anti-War Film of the 60's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to repeat all the other reviews about this spectacular movie. Many of the reviews in IMDb are wonderfully written.Just wanted to emphasize how this Western (a great Western) made in Italy showed up all the Hollywood and New York types who put together so many trivial "protest" movies during the era of the late 60's-early 70's.The movie showed brutal criminals, thieves, and murderers....but their actions seemed reasonable, well-mannered and principled compared to the scenes of scores of young soldiers being slaughtered for no reason. Maybe I am too sentimental - but when they fulfill the dying captain's wish and blow up the bridge - the feeling is simply overwhelming.Further, the dramatic scenery emphasized the suffering of these soldiers in this desolate area - far from any news coverage, recognition or glory. The "Good, Bad and the Ugly" chose to live there and be part of that land. The soldiers were sent there by superiors who had no knowledge of the land or cared what took place. Certainly the equivalent of "All Quiet on the Western Front" in showing the horror and waste of war.------------------ How good is this movie? My 17 year old daughter started watching the film this weekend and asked me to sit and watch it with her. A 17 year old girl watching a three hour Western! Suffice it to say she was amazed at how great the film was and she could have easily watched for another three hours if it lasted that long. So could we all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No words can explain this film's brilliance and supremacy. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is one of the greatest films I have ever seen. The performances of the good, the bad, and the ugly characters. Clint Eastwood shines in this classic western as he and Sergio Leone have done it again! The most impressive Man with No Name western, without a doubt. There is plenty of action going on in this western, be it gunfights or Civil War battles. Three gunslingers go on a hunt for $200,000, and let me tell you: this expedition for money has been the most entertaining journey I've seen. Twists and turns everywhere, anybody would love this classic. Unfortunately, this is the conclusion of the adventures of Clint Eastwood's character, the Man with No Name. But the conclusion has been his greatest adventure of the trilogy. I give this film a score of 10/10. Classic western beauty as Eastwood travels through the western frontier in search of priceless cash. There is also a bit of humor in this film, for those who seek mirth in western films. This movie has been a very inspiring film to me and I'm positive that it will inspire many other audiences in the future. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is an immortal classic that will stay as a classic for generations to come. Bravo, once again, Eastwood and Leone. Bravo.</fullReview>

He is arguably the greatest director that has graced the big screen. The team of Leone and Morricone may not ever be topped. I can watch this movie for the score alone. The climactic showdown is perfectly scored and filmed. The Ecstacy Of Gold has become one of my favorite songs, now that I've finally seen it in its intended context. Of all the great things of this movie, I love its historic backdrop. The civil war battle that Blondie and Tuco get mixed up in has to be my favorite scene.

		<fullReview>What can one say about a masterpiece ?? PERFECTION!!! This movie is perfect. You have landscapes and locations that are amazing by themselves. There's the score by Ennio Morricone which has the spirit of the West all over it. There's the acting core of Eastwood, Wallach and Van Cleef. And there's Sergio. Out of all the Sergio Leone films that I've seen, this is the most complete (even more complete since I've seen the remastered DVD). It has a story that is more than revenge and has subtle humanistic and political messages (POW camp, references to Andersonville prison, the meaningless bridge war, the missionary hospital, the dying confederate soldier,etc). Of course the most refined was Fistful of Dynamite (a.k.a - Duck, You Sucker), but it didn't have Eastwood and has a different "feel" from the first three. Also in that same light as Once Upon in America (also politically charged and Eastwood-less). It is safely the most refined of the Eastwood-Leone trilogy. It has a protagonist that is not the classical hero type. He is more of an anti-hero. You have the villain that is ruthless beyond measure and in between there's the dangerous comic relief brute. This is a must see film for anyone that likes movies. The best scene is the duel scene at the end with all 3 of our protagonists dueling each other in a Mexican standoff/chess game.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without a doubt, this film is a masterpiece. In storytelling, in cinematography, in scope, all in all a great great work. Eastwood, Cleef and Wallach are absolutely superb in their respective roles, and each plays their character to the max. Sergio Leone is simply a genius at work here, and from the moment the film begins to the moment it ends, you will be mesmerized and captivated. This definitely ranks just above Eastwoods' "Unforgiven" in the all-time great western film category, as well as the character "Blondie" is definitely one of the great characters of all time. Once you've seen this film (hopefully on DVD), you will compare every western movie you've seen and every one you will see to it, and chances are they will fail the test. A must-have for serious DVD collectors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's not much that I can say about The Good, the Bad and the Ugly that hasn't already been said. It's simply one of the best films ever made.I caught this all-time classic in a real theater for the first time ever earlier tonight. Ironically, the previous movie I've seen was Costner's poor Open Range, which compared to GBU shrinks to total and absolute irrelevance.GBU has no weaknesses. It has everything: action, humor, a great (if simple) story, some very sharp social commentary, an absolutely fantastic musical score and brilliant acting. There are extremely few films that are better than this. It's a must see, not just for western fans, but for everyone who's serious about cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fascinating saga of greed and revenge. Eastwood's Blondie isn't exactly heroic, or even redeemable, but he's the closest thing we get to a hero in a saga populated by wicked characters. I found it interesting how fortune and advantage keeps interchanging between the three title characters, until that legendary show-down at the film's climax. Also interesting is just how many great films came to be influenced by this so-called "spaghetti" western. Tarantino's KILL BILL films are one of the most recent and obvious examples. I also love how this film serves as a sort of prequel to Eastwood's haunted, retired gunslinger character in UNFORGIVEN.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film making perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" was Sergio Leone's third film in the Dollar trilogy and is easily the best. Taking place around the Civil War, the film revolves around three men, The Good in Blondie (Clint Eastwood), The Bad in Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) and The Ugly in Tuco (Eli Wallach). All three men have knowledge about a grave of gold and the uneasy alliances formed to achieve their goal in retrieving the cash is what the film is about. "Once Upon a Time in the West" is sometimes touted as the pinacle in Leone's career but this film is where he will be remembered. Nearly every scene in this film is a classic and defines everything about Leone's skills, talents and his style of directing and story telling. Cinematography is excellent with gritty locations and vast green landscapes capturing the screen. Performances are perfect with Wallach leading the way, playing a character who is not just the film's comic point but a complete character and not just someone to laugh at to loosen tension. Eastwood's Man With No Name (he adopts Blondie) shows new depth to his acting and his delivery never falters, playing a character now iconic. Lastly Van Cleef plays Angel Eyes in one of the best villain turns in history. Memorable, slick and chilling he is a person you struggle to hold your nerve around, Cleef holds the character together and with little screen time shows what an effect he can have on an audience. Characters in a Leone film are people you will never forget, lines, stances, the eyes. Characters very core are not left exposed and stay with you. Morricone is genius in music and his most memorable score is here, I think "Once Upon a Time in America" is his best score but this is his most unforgettable and has the greatest theme in any picture. Morricone is a man on par with Leone for excellence and does the film credit. Now onto the greatest achievment, the directing. Sergio Leone made in total about seven films, this stands as his best in his field. Some directors take in favour style over substance or vice versa, Leone takes both into maximum consideration and is why his films are unique. What you see is as important as what you hear, this applies to viewers who dislike his observing technique. Leone respects the viewer and entices them in every scene to be a part of the action on screen. "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" has that great quality, the acting is perfect, the writing is perfect, the cinematography, sets, sound, editing and directing I can honestly say this film does not lack and is cinimatically perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone OWN the "American" Western. Call them Spaghetti Westerns, call them what you want. It is a little strange that the country that birthed the legends of the "old West' should get bested so profoundly in it's own back yard by an Italian. But The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly was indeed the final nail in that particular coffin. This was a movie that proved that a limited budget cannot limit the creative power of a visionary director and writer(s) and it cannot conceal good actors.The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly was by far the best Western ever committed to film. It was gritty, it was suspenseful, it was well written, directed, and brought to the screen a great plot and characters. It was also far enough away from "the good guys wear white hats and shoot last and the bad guys wear black hats, don't shave, smoke, and shoot first" westerns and the ilk that JW and GA stared in that it drew you in enough to make the story come alive.I love all of Sergio's films, but I have to rank this as his masterpiece.Bravo!Martin</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly classic and amazing western.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one was the first movie I saw by my now favorite director Sergio Leone. It's one of those films you'll remember forever.Eli Wallach is simply astounding as Tuco, a character which you both love and hate. Eastwood is in his prime as the avenger and Van Cleef gives one of the chilliest performances in western movies as Sentenza.Morricone did some of his finest work on this very movie. The main tune is one that sticks in your brain like a tar-drenched dart. It's almost impossible not to whistle it after seeing the movie.The camera work by Tonino Delli Colli is a treat for the eye. From the high mountains to the railways. Everything oozes hot, sweaty western atmosphere (though it's filmed in Spain.The gunfights are really impressive. And there's lots of them too. The moment which I rate as number one in any movie, is the grande finale of this one, I'm not going to spoil for you unlucky few who have yet to see this movie but I can promise you all that it won't let you down.You might think that this must be impossible to better, but Leone actually topped it with the even greater "Once upon a time in the west", which, by the way, is my favorite movie. I may not rate this movie as high as "...West" but this is more entertaining while "...West" is more slowpaced and dramatic. So if you want action, then this is a better choice.Basically; you can't call yourself a western fan if you haven't seen this one.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On so many levels this film is amazing. I am a huge fan of Italian Horror films and leone is making me a fan of the spaghetti westerns. My father was always a huge fan of the dollars trilogy and had many times told me that the good the bad and ugly was the best. Perhaps the best thing about this film is the many ways it has influenced the film makers of today. I think many of my favorite films would not be the same at all with out a leone influence and his great films raising the bar.Eastwood will own you every time you watch this film with his pitch perfect performance as the man with no name. While he doesn't say much at all part of the charm of it all is you know what he is thinking and you almost can't believe he is able to hold it in. When Clint opens his mouth it is quotable everytime. `there are two types of people in this world, the ones with loaded guns and the ones who dig'.Awesome film. That is saying a lot because I generally hate westerns. As you might be able to tell from my user name I think the enslavement of animals is wrong. I don't think it is ok to `break' horses or exploit them for any use. This makes westerns and many Kung fu movies that I love mildly painful in moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Score - shame about the film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>3 men out west seek hidden loot in the civil war.The Good the Bad and the Ugly starts brilliantly, with each of the three in question shown in their own opening scenario. Eastwood is quickly established as the 'Good', Van Cleef the 'Bad' and Eli Wallach as the 'ugly'. Though generally there's no difference in their characters, as they all steal, kill and betray. Blondie (Eastwood) and the ugly repeatedly steal from the law by collecting ransom demands for the latter, not stopping at one to forgo the increasing value on his head. Van Cleef murders anyone for money. There a rather spirited bunch. From their on the experience becomes tedious and very slow. There are some great set-pieces including a battle on a bridge involving hundreds of extras, and the standoff at the end is excellently done, with extreme close-ups that heighten the tension. Once again the Italian scenery is efficiently, if excessively used. It's just a shame that it's alloyed by Wallach's hamming and a ten minute scene of Eastwood crossing the desert - sound exciting ?. The film is badly dubbed but even this doesn't mar the enjoyment as much as Ugly's cringe worthy sentimental scene with his brother, superfluous ? -not entirely. It does lead to some 'Good-Ugly' relationship humour which is where most of the film gets it's laughs. To be fair, none of the humour seems out of place with all the explosions and blood as the film doesn't take itself entirely seriously (Sergio Leone seems to have been satisfied with the over-the-top performances by virtually every character except Eastwood and Van Cleef). But this doesn't matter - because the score is one of the best for any western ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three great actors, one great western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Serve yourself a bowl of chilli, open a beer, light up a cheroot and sit back in front of one of the great pieces of cinema. Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach shoot it out for a dead man's loot against perhaps the most distinctive soundtrack of its day (and I don't just mean the ah-ee-ah-ee-ahhhhhh main theme).What is most impressive is the variety of emotional strings that the film pulls. As well as rollicking action and tense drama, 'buono, brutto, cattivo' is also a deliberately funny movie. Wallach, as the buffoon Tuco, gets most of the slapstick, but Clint, as the man with no name, holds the upper hand in sarcastic put downs.The final showdown is worth waiting nearly three hours for. Three men with three guns stage a face-off for the final clue to the location of the buried treasure. Who will draw first? And who will aim at whom? As the bugles and guitar build up the tension, the camera closes in gradually on each of the combatants' eyes, cutting occasionally to their hands at their holsters. Even those who know the outcome can't resist being drawn towards the edge of their seats. There are very few films that merit a straight 10 out of 10. This one gets it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That line starts my favourite 20-odd seconds of any movie. But, those twenty seconds aside, this is Sergio Leone's masterpiece. Better than Once Upon a Time in the West or Once Upon a Time in America. The whole dollars trilogy was magnificent, but this finishes it on a high note.Clint Eastwood is great in the role of a man who doesn't follow any rules, but makes his own (when isn't he great in that particular type of role?), with great support from Eli Wallach as Tuco. The movie doesn't seem to move like any other, moving left, right and back again in the space of five minutes, but still being easy to understand.There is a great turn from Lee Van Cleef, who serves as little more than a sub-plot until the above mentioned scene. The film isn't exactly over-flowing with dialogue (Leone relied more on huge, engrossing images) but the inter-play is sharp and witty."'See you... soo-soon... idi-idi-idi...'""'See you soon, idiots'. It's for you."In short, a fantastic film that is a must-see for all Western and movie fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is very hard picking out a best list for Leone's films as the auteur that he was, redefined the western genre and quite honestly action movies as a whole. The references to his films are so evident in todays culture and films that they have become a dogma. His influence is so widespread that it is virtually impossible to do a believable action film without drawing from some of his codes.This film is the absolute best of the lot. It is vulgar, vicious, funny and deliciously entertaining and epic by scale and content. It tackles the thin line between greed and friendship so effortlessly that it does deserve to be rated as one of the best films of all time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic western at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no doubt that purists would rank The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (GB&amp;U) quite a way down in their list of the greatest westerns, but I consider this film easily to be in the top five, if not the top three. I don't know the genre well enough to say if GB&amp;U was genuinely ground-breaking in its approach to the tried-and-true classic, but I am always impressed by its panache, its bravado, its earthy atmosphere, its interesting camera shots, its top-notch soundtrack, and the chemistry of its stars.One of the things that distinguishes GB&amp;U from other westerns for me is the quest model that the film follows. After developing the characters played by Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach, the film brings them together into a series of adventures (mostly misadventures) that tie together into a larger quest. The result makes the viewer feel that the he has been pulled into a larger-than-life tale of epic proportions, and yet the less glorified reality of GB&amp;U is that of three men of varying levels of disreputability vying against one another for a fortune in gold coins.Although I'm sure that GB&amp;U didn't introduce moral ambiguity into the western, it does so both successfully and memorably. The central characters are all anti-heroes, the plot revolves around a fairly base motivation (i.e., greed), and the backdrop of the Civil War provides director Sergio Leone with an opportunity to expose the inhumanity and hypocrisy of war. Truth, justice, and glory are not held up as eternal values in this film, yet GB&amp;U nevertheless shows how even morally ambiguous characters set within an amoral environment can still carve out an occasional bit of humanity or simple decency in spite of themselves.I've seen GB&amp;U probably at least a dozen times, and each time I'm pulled in as completely as I was the last. Simply put, it is a very good western--well worth the three hours of viewing time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be the greatest Western ever made. The plot is classic, with all the appropriate twists; the (American) actors are excellent, particularly Eli Wallach as Tuco. He gives depth to what could otherwise be a stock bandit character. Lee Van Cleef gives probably his best performance as Angel Eyes, simply the most chilling villain to ever appear on film.Even the music is top-notch, especially the score heard as Tuco searches the graveyard and at the final shootout. Director Sergio Leone is at his best here, with his trademark extreme closeups intercut with sweeping panoramic landscapes. Don't miss the huge Civil War battle or the three-way(!) shootout.The action is great, the dialogue is great, and there are some really memorable quotes to be found here ("Whoever double-crosses me and leaves me alive, he understands nothing about Tuco"). This is a five-out-of-five winner that every fan of film must see again and again.</fullReview>

Nevertheless, there is much to be said in a video rental. The characters might seem to be cardboard cutouts on the surface, but upon close inspection, the viewer sees amazing subtlety. The cinematography is every bit as good as anything produced out of Hollywood, and the Italian locations sure look a lot like the American southwest. Morricone's music may be the finest of the entire western genre. Leone's debt to Kurosawa is obvious here, but his inventive use of close-up and cut-away to build tension in this film may be unparalleled in the history of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic spaghetti western with the best set-piece climax ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leone's conclusion to his DOLLARS trilogy once again shows how he had progressed as a director from the previous two films - with his style now evident and developed, his pacing slowed down to a gentle speed and exactly the right combination of editing, photography, and art direction, Leone was ready to make what many consider to be his greatest film - ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST. Unfortunately, THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is sometimes overlooked in place of that film, and although it's only the third of a trilogy, the film still has an epic feel to it.This film's main benefit over the previous two is Ennio Morricone's score. While his music was very good in A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE, here it becomes the stuff of legend and one of most recognised western tunes ever written; it's also by and far Morricone's best ever work, to this day. Leone retains the solid Eastwood from the previous two films and also brings back Lee Van Cleef, this time playing a bad guy (unfortunately - I prefer his heroes to his villains as I like the guy). Most screen time, though, is given to THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN's Eli Wallach, who is also excellent as the wanted criminal Tuco, a man who lives by his wits and courage and isn't afraid to take risks.Eastwood plays his role to perfection, as he should with so much practice. He gets to say some well-remembered lines such as "There are two kinds of people in this world, my friend..." Van Cleef is exceptionally evil and sadistic as the villain of the piece, my only complaint is that he has relatively little screen time in comparison to the other two main stars and thus feels slightly underused. Also appearing are some familiar faces like Luigi Pistilli and Rada Rassimov.The plot is a wider and more political one than before, as it shows how the Civil War intruded upon the quiet serenity of the Old West. The brief battle scenes we do see are sweeping and epic, up there with the best put on film. Leone's direction is stylish and a work of genius, and he serves up a number of odd, memorable situations. These include a shoot-out in a bombed town, complete with blackened smoking ruins; an ingenious way to remove handcuffs; and the blowing up of a bridge. The scene is also set for one of the best sequences in cinema; the confrontation between Wallach, Van Cleef, and Eastwood in the cemetery at the film's end. Here, the music, quick photography (close-ups of people's eyes, etc.) and acting combine to make this one of the coolest, most tense showdowns in history. One must not forget the element of comedy which Leone also uses to make the film lighter and more enjoyable; he succeeds well. Definitely one of the best spaghetti westerns out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Films I Have Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took me a long time to come around to the idea of watching "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly." I'm not generally a fan of Westerns, and I always dismissed this film as the kind of movie fan boys would like.Well I've been watching movies for a long time, and I've seen most of the "best of all time" movies, so it's pretty rare anymore for a movie to join the "one of the best films I've ever seen" ranks. But Sergio Leone's simply magnificent film did just that. The first thing I asked myself when it was over was, "Why did I wait so long to see it?" For a cinephile, it's just utter joy to watch this movie. It's beautiful -- beautifully composed, beautifully scored. Every shot is a work of art by itself. But what surprised me the most was how funny and playful the movie is. It's like reading a Charles Dickens novel, waiting to see how the various plot threads are going to come together and what crazy twist the storyteller is going to throw your way next.Watching Sergio Leone's movie made me instantly appreciate Quentin Tarantino less. He obviously adores Leone and borrows (steals) from him outright, but what seems daring and original in Tarantino's work feels instantly derivative when you see the real deal and realize it was made over forty years ago yet feels more alive than almost anything filmmakers are putting out there today.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is the final and finest of director Sergio Leone's 'dollar' trilogy. The good: Joe(Clint Eastwood). The bad: Sentenza or Angel Eyes(Lee Van Cleef). The ugly: Tuco(Eli Wallach). Joe, also known as Blondie, is a shiftless gunman with a touch of honor. Angel Eyes, is a hit-man who always gets his assignment done...usually in a sadistic manner. Tuco is a Mexican bandito always looking out for his own interest...without a conscience. These three are looking for Confederate gold worth $200,000. The cache is buried in a nameless grave...but who will be the first to get his hands on it? The finale proves borderline hypnotic as Tuco pathetically runs in circles through the graveyard looking for the hidden treasure. This surely ranks with the best westerns of all time. Other cast members: Claudio Scarchilli, Benito Stefanelli, Livio Lerenzon and Aldo Giuffre. Ennio Morricone's wonderful score will echo in your mind long after the final credits roll.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Sergio Leone, this is the third and last of the "spaghetti" western trilogy to star The Man With No Name and the man who became an international superstar playing him. Basically, the title characters are introduced in reverse order, (The Ugly) Tuco (Eli Wallach) is the wanted outlaw caring only about himself and wealth, (The Bad) Sentenza aka Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) is the hit-man who will finish a job and get the reward, and (The Good) the Stranger, or Blondie (Clint Eastwood) is the professional gunslinger trying to earn a few dollars. The stranger and Tuco form a partnership making money off Tuco's bounty, but the Stranger wants to finish it, and Tuco punishes him making him suffer from heat and thirst. Going across the desert they come across a crashed horse and carriage, with the only survivor, Bill Carson (Antonio Casale) revealing that he and some other men have buried some gold in a cemetery. Tuco only knows the name of the cemetery, but the Stranger knows the name on the grave its buried in, so they must keep each other alive as they travel to this cemetery. Angel Eyes meanwhile, who was looking for Carson, knows that the Stranger and Tuco know where the cemetery is, so he is hoping to get there before they do. After getting themselves caught in the civil war battle, and helping out a little bit, the Stranger and Tuco make it to the cemetery, but Tuco doesn't have the real name to find the gold. When the Stranger does tell him the name, "Unknown", the Bad shows up, and it all comes to a final showdown to get the gold, thankfully the Bad dies and the other two live. In the end, Tuco does dig up the gold, but the Stranger puts him in a noose (just like he did to him), and it is only when he rides away that the Stranger shoots him down and lets him have his share of the gold. Also starring Mario Brega as Cpl. Wallace, Luigi Pistilli as Father Pablo Ramirez, Rada Rassimov as Maria the prostitute and Livio Lorenzon as Baker. Eastwood plays the poncho wearing, not very talkative and very cool stranger once again to perfection, especially being the only one speaking in sync, well, him and Van Cleef who makes a good (if underused) villain, and Wallach is terrific as the Ugly, and there is plenty of gun play and some explosions to entertain you, and fantastic theme music by Ennio Morricone, it is one of the best classic westerns, and easily the best of the three. Clint Eastwood was number 18 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 61 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and the film was number 46 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Until I saw The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, I didn't know what the `big deal' was about spaghetti westerns, Sergio Leone or Clint Eastwood for that matter. After seeing this film, the proverbial `light bulb' came up over my head, and I understand the iconic imagery attributed to the genre, the director and the actor.In terms of plot, it's quite simple ? stay alive and be the first to get the gold. What turns probably an hour's worth of plot into three hours of film are the atmospheric touches ? the vast expanse of the `frontier', and the many, MANY extended scenes of men looking at one another over and over again. I don't say this as a criticism of Leone, rather it is quite a compliment. To be entertained for three hours by a western is amazing, and I was entertained in spades. I loved seeing actors that I have long associated with different kinds of roles in this film ? I know Lee Van Cleef as a B-movie guy from the fifties, later the Kung Fu guy, and Eli Wallach has always been Don Altobello for me. I loved a lot of the stylistic elements, such as the freeze frame with the nicknames appearing next to the character, the extreme close-ups, and the fantastic music. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and am really glad I finally got a chance to see it. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly makes me want to explore the other spaghetti westerns of the era. Its reputation was very warranted.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reinvented the Western Genre and Great Movies in General!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Sergio Leone's third installment in his "Dollar's" trilogy or "The Man with No Name" trilogy starring Clint Eastwood as the Good, Lee Van Cleef as the Bad, and Eli Wallach as the Ugly. It follows three men who learn about the whereabouts of a large sum of gold and begin to a journey to find it.Blondie is, in my opinion, the smartest and safest movie character ever brought to film. Everything that Blondie does puts him in little to no danger at all. He is the one shooting Tuco's rope before he is hung, he had Tuco take the name of Bill Carson in the POW camp and get beaten up, he knew not to give Tuco the real grave name with the treasure in it, he unloaded Tuco's gun and knew to shoot Angel Eyes in the iconic "Mexican Standoff" scene. Not to mention that he also had the right amount of bullets to kill off each of Angel Eyes' crew, which may have influenced his decision in joining them in the first place. Blondie is the man that Clint Eastwood's character used to be in "Unforgiven." He is first introduced as "The Good" after seemingly turning in a wanted criminal for the reward money.Angel Eyes is the epitome of a western villain. He has no official name, only one made up by our main protagonist. He kills anyone in his way of the treasure. From his mischievous mustache to his black clothes and his squinting eyes, everything about him says evil. His first appearance is of him showing up at a man's house and eating for a few minutes only to kill him afterwards. He is named "The Bad" after killing another defenseless old man in his bed. Tuco is a loose cannon. From his very first appearance as "The Ugly", he is shown smashing through a glass window in a freeze frame shot while escaping attempted assailants. He is neither good or bad because he switches sides almost every scene. Everything he does is done in a clumsy, disorderly fashion. He isn't trustworthy, clean, polite, or nice. He is simply ugly. These characters exist only in the Civil War-era West when all of their actions fit them into their place on the title. Blondie is an anti- hero who only seems like the good because in this time period, viewers see killing many guilty and few innocent people as good. Had this film been made to take place in the present society with more civil laws and more security, all of the characters would be considered the bad. Ennio Morricone's score, which always puts a smile on my face, fits perfectly into every scene it is played in. It matches the mood of the characters, the vastness of the setting, and the general tone of the film. He includes gunshots, whistling, howling, and yodeling which has become the cliché for westerns. His score has become inseparable from the western genre. He even uses different instruments for each character. The flute for Blondie, the ocarina for Angel eyes, and screaming for Tuco. Many people criticize this movie for its slowness at some parts. I completely disagree with that because it adds to the tension and bleakness of some of the character's lives. We see a man at his farm with his wife and children and then a shady-looking man sit down and eat with him in silence for five minutes. Do you think that Leone wanted to try and excite people with people eating? No. He wanted to show the bleakness of this man's daily routine, which was, ultimately, his last. The slowness also creates suspense in some scenes. If the Mexican standoff scene hadn't have been five minutes long with suspenseful music and quick cuts of people's eyes and weapons, it wouldn't have had an as effective payoff as it did. Leone could have easily shown three people walk across the center of a graveyard and have one of them shoot the other in a matter of ten seconds but he doesn't. He makes us wait and slowly increases the musics volume and intensity until, finally, we are shown three different reactions as a result of that suspense: Confusion from Tuco, shock from Angel Eyes, and control or victory from Blondie.From a tired, sweaty stranger appearing seemingly out of no where, until the end credits roll, this film entertains, thrills and excites us through it's nearly 3-hour run time. I am not usually a big fan of the western genre, but this film got me interested in westerns and inspired me to give other genres that are not my forte a visit (music, documentary). I would consider this as my favorite film of all time. (This is also my very first review, so excuse any errors, please)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ego, the Super Ego and the Id battle it out under the sound of Mexican trumpets and the thunder of war.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone's Spagethi Westerns are the main reason why I don't pay attention to movie critics. During the 1960s I used to go with my pals to see these flicks at a time when they were just coming out and having a whale of a time while the entire profession was panning them. No, the ones panning them were the critics who were forced by their bosses to review them; the rest wouldn't be caught ten blocks away from a theatre playing them. Leone's movies were condemned by these gatekeepers then, who considered them well below them, the Sharknados of the day. They changed their tune later, yeah, but not because "they saw the flicks with new eyes" but simply because they couldn't swim anymore against the flow. At the time when Leone's Westerns "conquered America" they had already conquered the rest of the world, which allows me to clear once and for all a usual misconception on the meaning of "Spaghetti" as an ethnic slur, something not surprising considering that many in the U.S. think that everything starts at home and then spreads to the rest of the world. Fact is Leone's flicks were already the rage abroad, years before they arrived in the U.S., and the term Spaghetti Western had been around for quite some time at a world scale, referring to the use and abuse of spaghetti sauce as replacement blood, which was being needed aplenty at a time when entire Frontier towns were been wiped out of its people at the sound of exultant Mexican trumpets and well tuned whistling. That's the true meaning of the expression.TGTBTU is widely considered as closing the Dollars trilogy after FOD &amp; FAFDM but the fact is that this is an entirely new and different movie, as the progression from the others is lost somewhere before it. In FOD Leone revolutionized the form of the Western, that is why the content has nothing new on it, just a copy of a Japanese classic. He uses the movie to set the table, to establish the new laws that would rule in the future the Western, that was its whole purpose. I refer more extensively to those new elements in my FOD review. In the next movie, FAFDM, having established already the new parameters for form and style, Leone sets to work on the content, the drama. One even more telling difference between those two lies in the situations and motivations of the main characters. In FOD they can walk away, at least the principals: Manco--a drifter--the Rojos and the Baxters--business people who can sell out any day and leave. No one is being forced to stay, even Silvanito could choose to stay out of trouble, which is all the trademark of what I'd call "false drama". In FAFDM no one of the leads can leave, which is the telling sign of real drama, even more of tragedy?"if you can walk away, then it isn't drama, neither tragedy". In FAFDM Manco has a regular job, bounty hunter, which is after all something that ties him; Mortimer is a captive of his own desire for revenge and Indio a prisoner of his own madness. No one can just walk away, that's the main difference between both flicks and the sign of a progression.And why GBU is so different from the other two? Leone explained it himself, when he declared that there was a bit of the Good, the Bad and the Ugly in his own personality. One thing that intrigued me since the first time I saw GBU is the respect with which Angel Eyes treats Blondie, a man nevertheless who thinks nothing of murdering a kid and who has just brutally tortured Tuco. Instead, he talks with him, he bargains, he even gives him his gun and freedom back. Also, see that despite all the violence and ill will going on between the three, most of Blondie's interactions with the other two imply bargaining. At this point any psychologist worth his salt would say that the trio is acting out like the three aspects of the human psyche, with Tuco playing a perfect Id?instinctive, bent on survival?Blondie doing the Ego?the thinking, reasoning part?and AE the Super Ego. But then why is the Super Ego, AE. the one holding the wisdom the fruit of accumulated experience, such a bad apple? Why not; AE is the one that will never let Ego-Blondie forget that this is--or was in the West--a violent world and by doing so he forces him to get in touch with his survival skills?i.e. Tuco. See also that Ego Blondie is the one who prepares the final outcome, who decides who lives and who die. The one being tortured also by his basic impulses in the extreme heat of the desert (A perfect allegory. Think of sexual abstinence for a 18 year old in good health) So Blondie decides at the end the logical, natural, outcome, yes; but he doesn't kill AE because AE is bad but because he doesn't need him anymore, or so he thinks. But certainly he needs Tuco, because Id Tuco carries his survival instinct, without which he can't live so he lets him go free but not before showing him who is the boss, which is something Blondie Ego has to do.In all, a lasting classic, maybe for ages to come. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I hear "3hr run time" I sigh. Few movies that clock in at 3 hours please me. Apocalypse Now Redux had me bored two hours in, King Kong (2005 version) was too stretched out, and while I love them, the Lord of the Rings films could've been shorter.But Sergio Leone's The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is an exception. Never will there be a movie as classic or timeless as this. It's gritty, brutal, realistic, and unpredictable. The acting and cinematography are put to great use, and thank gosh, it knows when to shut up and let the score do the talking.The film has a simple plot, which I feel makes it better. It's about three gunslingers who race to find $20,000 in gold. It's simple enough that a moron could enjoy it as equally as a genius would. And the writing isn't even the best part. Ennio Morricone's classic score is one of the best in cinema history, and Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach's acting is superb. Place that in with intense gunfights, a smooth Civil War battle scene, and one of the best movie endings of all time, and you've got one of the greatest movies ever."There are two kinds of people, my friend. Those who love this movie and those who dig... You dig".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best western ever made - in my opinion. The story is amazing, and there is not a dull moment at all throughout the movie. All the characters are interesting and challenging, with amazing costume design - making me want to get a poncho, like the one Clint Eastwood wears on some of the poster designs. The posters are amazing as well. The whole design of the film is fantastic, and the music is amazing and haunting. Clint Eastwood is brilliant, and I wish I could see him in a western like this one again in the near future - that would be awesome. I love the this film and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. It's a classic, and after watching it you will know why. It's a movie that will never go out of style - like the toothpick in Clint Eastwoods mouth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tuco ''Eli Wallach'' was Nailed it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Movie is the Best Western movie until now. The direction was awesome! All actors perform exquisitely. Specially Eli Wallach. In these opening frames, Sergio Leone established a rule that he follows throughout "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly." The rule is that the ability to see is limited by the sides of the frame. At important moments in the film, what the camera cannot see, the characters cannot see, and that gives Leone the freedom to surprise us with entrances that cannot be explained by the practical geography of his shots.There is a moment, for example, when men do not notice a vast encampment of the Union Army until they stumble upon it. And a moment in a cemetery when a man materializes out of thin air even though he should have been visible for a mile. And the way men walk down a street in full view and nobody is able to shoot them, maybe because they are not in the same frame with them.Leone cares not at all about the practical or the plausible, and builds his great film on the rubbish of Western movie clichés, using style to elevate dreck into art. When the movie opened in America in late 1967, not long after its predecessors "A Fistful of Dollars" (1964) and "For a Few Dollars More" (1965), audiences knew they liked it, but did they know why?I saw it sitting in the front row of the balcony of the Oriental Theatre, whose vast wide screen was ideal for Leone's operatic compositions. I responded strongly, but had been a movie critic less than a year, and did not always have the wisdom to value instinct over prudence. Looking up my old review, I see I described a four-star movie but only gave it three stars, perhaps because it was a "spaghetti Western" and so could not be art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic Sergio Leone's classic spaghetti gold Western film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) for a lot of people is one of the greatest best epic classic spaghetti western films of all time. For me is not! I don't like this film, it is not my favorite Eastwood western movie. I don't love it, I don't like it but I also don't hate it. A lot of people are going for this one as Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood's best movie, I don't. For a Few Dollars More (1965) and A Fistful of Dollars (1964) are better and the best masterpieces ! They are my favorite Clint Eastwood western movies in the series. The problem with the film I have, it is too long. On Blu-ray disc the film it is 3.hrs long which is over long. It is boring the film takes so long that plot starts so slow, I hate long movies and this one is defiantly not my favorite film. That doesn't mean is bad is not, it is an epic classic Sergio Leone's best film and it is good, it is just not my couple of tea. The things I love: I love the music score by Ennio Morricone that did wrote different and new theme music score for this film. The Action sequences are awesome and the bullets are flying, the guns in this film are plenty. The scene action are also good which this film makes such an entertainment from begging till end. It is the third entry in to The Dollars trilogy or better known the Man with No Name, it is the final installment of The Dollars Trilogy. This film is a classic that made Clint Eastwood in to a big star that he is today. An epic Western that follows the adventures of three gunfighters looking for $200,000 in stolen gold, Sergio Leone's 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' is one of his best masterpiece, one that continues to get better and better with each viewing. A bounty hunting scam joins two men in an uneasy alliance against a third in a race to find a fortune in gold buried in a remote cemetery. The inimitable "Man With No Name" teams with two gunslingers (Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach) to pursue a fortune in stolen gold. But teamwork doesn't come naturally to the outlaws, and they soon discover that their greatest challenge is to stay alive in a country ravaged by war. Forging and Vibrant and yet detached style of action never before seen and not matched since, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly shatters the western mold in true Eastwood Style! The film is known for Leone's use of long shots and close-up cinematography, as well as his distinctive utilization of violence, tension, and stylistic gunfights.The plot revolves around three gunslingers competing to find fortune in a buried cache of Confederate gold amidst the violent chaos of the American Civil War (specifically the New Mexico Campaign in 1862), while participating in many battles and duels along the way.The film was the third collaboration between Leone and Clint Eastwood, and the second with Lee Van Cleef. Still the race and the three gunslingers were just fantastic who will get the first the gold. The final scene on the cemetery is one of the best action scenes ever. The iconic Mexican standoff, with Tuco, Angel-Eyes in the middle, and Blondie is the best scene in the film. The trio all separately are traveling trough American Civil War who doesn't want any part of the war to do.Clint Eastwood as "Blondie" (a.k.a. the Man with No Name): a subdued, bounty hunter did a really wonderful job as the good person, he showed that he is honest a good kind gunslinger. I think Clint Eastwood as Blondie did made memorable character and one of his the best acting performance on screen I have ever saw. Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes: The Bad, a ruthless, unfeeling, and sociopathic mercenary who always finishes a job he is paid for. Did a terrific job as the villain in this film, gosh this movie is awesome! He convinced me of his acting skills that he is a professional actor. Eli Wallach as Tuco "The Rat" The Ugly, a comical, oafish was amazing in his role, Sergio Leone choose him for this film with natural talent as the main cast. Those trio actors did a wonderful job as a different gunslingers on searching for a gold. The film also has humor and it is also brilliant in the both terms, the scene on cemetery where Tuco arrives first and is looking for a tombstone was brilliant. It turned out the gold was buried in a unmarked grave, that was hard to find. I was laughing when Blondie throws a shovel to Tuco for digging up the grave and the Angles Eyes comes and throws another shovel for Blondie, where both of them have to dig now the grave the scene was funny. They are a lot of moments in this film that do love, tough I don't like this film. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (Italian title: Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo, lit. "The Good, the Ugly, the Bad") is a 1966 Italian epic Spaghetti Western film directed by Sergio Leone, starring Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach in the title roles respectively. 8/10 Grade: B- Studio: Produzioni Europee Associati (PEA), Arturo González Producciones Cinematográficas, S.A, Constantin Film Produktion Starring: Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, Eli Wallach Director: Segio Leone Producer: Alberto Grimaldi Story: Luciano Vincenzoni and Sergio Leone Rated: R Running Time: 2 Hrs. 99 Mins.

		<shortDescription>Classic End to the Trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) *** 1/2 (out of 4) The final part in Sergio Leone's trilogy has three men racing against one another to locate $200,000 in Confederate gold. THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY has become one of the most loved Spaghetti Westerns out there and it's easy to see why because it contains all the style and violence that the genre has become known for. It's also easy to see why this film gained so many negative reviews when it was originally released but I think it's safe to say that its reputation of a classic isn't going anywhere. As with the previous two installments, Leone does a masterful job with the style of thing and especially the ending, which is clearly one of the greatest ever filmed. It's really amazing to see what Leone was able to do with the budget he had and the fact that he constantly tried to top the previous film in the series is something mighty impressive. I think most directors would have been happy with A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS but Leone managed to build on that and then build on FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE. Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach are all wonderful in their parts and there's no question that the three of them and their chemistry is now legendary. The violence in the film is often graphic but it's also very realistic and fitting for the subject matter. Then there's Ennio Morricone's score, which is so iconic yet it still sends shivers down your spine each time you hear it. The action scenes are excellently put together including the terrific battle on the bridge as well as some of the comedy relief early on dealing with hangings. If there's one problem with the film I think it runs on way too long for its own good. Yes, I know many love the epic feel of the picture but I still think it runs on way too long in its extended version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Good, The Bad and the Ugly is one of my favorite westerns. I watched your airing of this movie, and was extremely disapointed. You must have cut an hours worth of material out of the movie. Some of the best lines, and scenes were gone. Then, to jump from the gunfight in the bombed out town straight to the Sad Hill graveyard scene was the worst. I had my teen aged son with me watching. I played the movie up to him telling him how great I thought it was. It was impossible to follow for someone who has never seen the movie because so much was missing. He though it was lame. If this is what you do to the movies you show every evening, Im sure I'll find something else to watch.My two cents.MS</fullReview>

Wallach's warm &amp; charismatic performance helps make the character more than just a greedy, violent bandit. Instead Tuco is the most interesting character in the film.Ennio Morricone's score is one of the most brilliant, if not THE most brilliant in the history of film. It is Morricone's score that takes this film from very good to masterpiece category. Well worth checking is the new version, with scenes cut from the original English version now included. Many of these scenes help explain how many of the characters (mainly Angeleyes) ended up where they were. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is so much that can be said about this film and is unforgettable performances....especially Eli Wallach as Tuco. Has there ever been anyone better at saying nothing than Clint? The ending is classic, and for those who haven't seen it, I won't ruin it, but it takes the classic gun fight to a new level..... not to mention the sound track, does it get any better....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>you won´t even notice that it´s more than 3 hours long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" when I was still in my early teens and didn´t like it much then. I thought it was like an action movie but without the comforting elements usually associated with action movies like moral clarity and extremely spectacular fight scenes. However, recently, I saw it again on video and liked it for this exact same reason and more. The movie begins with a credit sequence of gun shots, grainy photos from the movie, and great music by Ennio Morricone that already tells you to expect a trip that´s exciting and fun. Then it rushes straight into a set of fight scenes which introduce the three main characters very dramatically (complete with titles to let you know which adjective in the title each character represents). Each of these characters is a morally flawed person who makes a living off of death. The "Bad" Angel Eyes makes his living as a soldier and a mercenary. The "Good" Blondie makes his living by making a travesty of hangings by always freeing the convicted men he turns in for reward money just before the rope should kill them. His "goodness" is only relative. The "Ugly" Tuco basically makes his living any way he can and his list of crimes is absurdly varied (ranging from all kinds of violence to statutory rape). He is a true opportunist without overriding morals but not entirely without a conscience. Played by Eli Wallach, Tuco actually steals the show from his 2 more famous costars because while they are almost superhuman in their skills, he is strikingly human in all his flaws. All three of these men, on individual terms, eventually come to know of a fortune buried in a graveyard and constantly keep fighting each other for knowledge of its exact location since each man only knows a different hint of where it is hidden and not the whole story. While such a plot does not seem too great, Sergio Leone choreographs every scene (violent or otherwise)to make it as suspenseful and expertly made as possible. The film also gets a lot of its entertainment value from Tarantinoishly holding nothing sacred. The three heroes scheme against other characters with a joyfully effortless malevolence, and not even the American Civil War is held sacred as the men try to manipulate the "senseless" conflict full of hopelessly drunken soldiers to make their quest for the treasure easier. The result of all this is that although "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" is more than 3 hours long, there is never a dull moment, making it seem about an hour or so shorter than it actually is. What´s most important, though, is that it is a thinking person´s action movie which unpretentiously demonstrates the absurdity of real life and helps us to laugh at it. If there is such a thing as a perfect western, this is the one. 10 stars out of 10 !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The West as it never was</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took an Italian to revolutionize the American Western. Everything was strange and new about the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. Perhaps the strangest was that it was not a contest between good and evil -- the white hats and the black hats -- as was the typical western, but instead had a plot driven by the greed of the three characters -- one of whom is charitably called good, the other two certifiably bad and ugly.  The music is extraordinary -- one of the best and most original soundtracks ever. The photography is weird -- no one had ever focused so close-up on people's eyes or the pores in their skin. The violence is brutal and surreal. The three-cornered gunfight is one of the great scenes from cinema. The scenery is off. It doesn't look like the American west -- and in fact it isn't. The movie was made in Spain. The characters are incredibly seedy. Most of them look like they took a bath about a decade ago and haven't changed their clothes since. And nobody gets the girl -- because there isn't any girl.  I love this movie! It makes my all-time top ten list. Clint Eastwood is cool beyond belief; Eli Wallach is a hoot; and Lee Van Cleef is really, really bad. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one lowbrow film. It has a strong air of tight budgets, underpaid extras, and general disorder a la your typical B movie.Yet, this production ends up a masterpiece whose cracks enhance it, a classic painting whose poor condition makes it more appreciated.Wallach, the lone "known" actor at the time, has no airs. He just comes across as your typical self-centered individual who learns something from his fellow humans. Eastwood is Eastwood. Quiet, unassuming, intense beyond human limits. An amazing performance.Van Cleef is evil and debonair.Perhaps the most chilling presentation comes from Mario Brega. This Italian character actor makes you really think that he's about to gouge a man's eyes out. The difference between this cinematic triumph being made then and now is that now, they'd probably show him doing so in gory detail. Implication is everything.Forget the jet trail, the pickup, and the other low budget goofs. Just lose yourself in a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Of the best 5 westerns ever made, this one is on everyone's list.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "Good, Bad, and the Ugly" is one of the best westerns ever made (contending for top dog position only by "Unforgiven" and "Once Upon A Time in the West"). This movie is a Western (as opposed to "cowboy movies made by John Wayne where the men are always clean and hair well combed even after a fistfight). It focuses on three characters, none of whom is really good. It's characters are real and the scenery stark and harsh as is the style of Sergio Leone. What takes this movie over the top is the superb music score by Ennio Mirricone whose theme song for this movie was whistled for decades. Westerns don't get better than this. A must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely the best western ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And it's the truth. This is the western that broke the mold. Clint Eastwood IS The Good, Lee Van Cleef IS the bad, and Eli Wallach IS the Ugly. Good guys and bad guys were no longer separated by wearing white hats and black hats. One can certainly question just how "Good" Eastwood's character is. Set during the civil war, it follows the title trio (comprised of Eastwood, Van Cleef, and Wallach) on their quest for 200 thousand dollars in gold. The question is, who will get it first?As "The Good" Clint Eastwood leaves nothing to be desired, giving the role just enough of the quiet cockiness that it needs. Eastwood had the two previous films to build the character on, and it shows."The Bad" Is definitely my favorite role in the film. I do some community theater acting and if there's a bad guy in the play I usually play it! That's why I like the role. The bad guys have all the fun! Lee Van Cleef is exceptional. no one else could have given the role what he did. This is the first movie I saw Lee Van Cleef in, and it put him at the top of my list of favorite actors. What really is amazing is that he plays the exact opposite of this role in the previous film, "For a Few Dollars More." Since I saw the films out of order(I still haven't had a chance to see the first) When I saw Van Cleef in "For a Few Dollars More, I kept expecting the other shoe to fall with his Colonel Douglas Mortimer character. To my Delight, it never did. If you are going to watch "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, You have to get "For a Few Dollars More and watch them both. Van Cleef Really is amazing to watch. And I Think he was a hell of an actor! And as "The Ugly" Eli Wallach Physically embodies greed. That is the only way to describe it. Wallach definitely has the most developed character. One minute, he's the best friend you've ever had, and the next minute he's stabbing you in the back for your money. When he and Eastwood find The man who knows where the money is, Tuco tells the dying man not to die until after he's told Tuco where the money is! He also has a great line in a scene towards the end involving him and a gunslinger that lost his arm because of him. I would describe it, but I don't want to give it away. Wallach gives on hell of a performance. I actually thought he was Spanish, until someone told me that he was Jewish! Sergio Leone certainly Gives us one hell of a movie. There is not a second of film wasted. While the whole movie is great, there are two scenes that really stand out in my mind. The first is the scene where Tuco("The Ugly") runs through a graveyard searching for one name on the hundreds of grave markers. The total scene is about three and a half minutes of him searching, and blended with a superior song from Ennio Morricone, and it is part of film history. No one will ever be able to duplicate what Leone, Wallach and Morricone did with it. That's another thing I have to mention. While all the soundtrack music Morricone composed is terrific, He outdid himself with this Soundtrack. Every song fits every scene perfectly. The only soundtrack I can compare it to is the shark theme from "Jaws".The second scene is the final showdown between the Three main characters. Leone took his time with this one. It has dozens of different camera shots, and terrific song to underscore it. Leone builds up the suspense until it's almost unbearable, and trust me, the climax is worth the wait. To give any of it away would be criminal.If you want to see the perfect western, you have to see this movie. There truly are none that can match it. if I could give it higher than ten I would!10 out of 10***** out of ***** </fullReview>

It made me want to throw my stupid copy on tape in the garbage. It was like a whole different movie. My tape isn't even wide-screen and rule no.1 with Leone movies is: Always watch them wide-screen. If you don't see them in wide-screen you just miss too much.I could now explain why this movie is good and everybody should see it but I think that would be a waste of time since everybody knows that this is a must-see classic.I first thought that 'Once Upon A Time in the West' was Leone's masterpiece but now I'm not sure anymore. What I do know for sure is that Eli Wallach makes this movie. Eastwood and van Cleef are good of course but nowhere near Wallach.For those who haven't seen this movie: SEE IT!!! (duhh!)

		<fullReview>What can I say. This is my favorite movie of all time. There is no contest. I still remember the first time I saw this masterpiece. I was about 15 years old, and it was on TV one night. I sat down ready to watch, and then there where a technical problem, and a 10 minute delay. But I stayed up and waited, and that was my luck. Because the music, the pictures, the slow pace, the Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Sergio Leone's direction and the fantastic story just swept my of my feet. I usually say that the Shawshank Redemption is the best movie made in the last 20 years. There are several people who will agree with me on that. Luckily that doesn't conflict with my firm belief, that there will never come a movie that can compete with this one. I know many will agree on this, but certainly not as many as with the Redemption.There is nothing wrong with this movie. Everyone is cool, Snake Eyes is evil, and the whole thing is wound perfectly together under Leone's direction with the fantastic music by Ennio Morricone.The only reason that I haven't written a comment before, is that I was sure that I would never be able to write good enough to express the way I feel for this fantastic movie. I'm still sure that I can't, but now I gave it a try.I hope that they one day will show it in a cinema close by, so I can get the ultimate experience. Because this movie was supposed to be watched at the big screen, and I long for once again to hear the Ugly's final scream turn into the first tone of the main theme, and just let the music take me away... (And I actually did get that chance some years later, which is by now some years ago! It was everybit as great as I could have hoped :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Spaghetti Western ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the opening sequence to the final shootout, The Good, The Bad and the Ugly doesn't cease to surprise and provoke unrestrained guffaws and laughs as Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach emerge as three foes searching to get the better of each other, while at the same time making as much money as possible. Ennio Morricone's music twangs with delight at the perfect moments, emphasizing the most startling twists in the plot's development.After developing the characters with a few minor sketches, the film switches to the main plot: finding a treasure buried inside a grave only Eastwood's character can identify. The way in which Van Cleef, Wallach, and Eastwood exchange the upper hand in their objective is done brilliantly, as Director Leone completely disregards all previous norms of Westerns and anti-Westerns. People shoot each other at will (no classic shootouts), shootouts are bloody, and an element of dark comedy pervades the entire film.The Civil War looms in the background of the story. It doesn't take away from the film, but it adds an element of the reality of war. Lots of people die (thus the existence of the huge graveyard for the final scene), but the main characters remain indifferent. Their indifference emphasizes the point that this film is outside the realm of normal - and thus takes the classic format of a spaghetti western.The ending is not to be missed. This trilogy, and especially the last few minutes of this film, is what made Eastwood a star.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I , a non-professional reviewer, say about The Good, the Bad and the Ugly that hasn't already been said? It's one of the God-sends of cinema, a platinum accomplishment in film-scope that inspired every epic after it to aspire achieving its own greatness. It shows the old west as a diverse, adventurous and desolate place to live in. What happens when three people look for Confederate gold in the midst of the American Civil War? Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach make up the perfect trio of leading characters for this film, and Sergio Leone's ceaselessly observant and pitch-perfect direction of the actors adds to the experience of watching the film. The film is big, really big. The sweeping cinematography easily ranks among the best cinematography in cinema history. We not only see the story of three men out against each other, but the world around them is composed like a visual song that shows how beautiful and dangerous the Old West really was.This is truly Sergio Leone's finest piece of work. He never wasted the time he was given on his projects; he squeezed the value he could get out of every second he had and it's payed off with his movies. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly deserves to be seen on the big screen (or the biggest you can find/use yourself); it practically commands itself to be seen in the best format possible.P.S. This is the one of the films that greatly influenced Quentin Tarantino.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film to stand the test of time as one of the best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this when i was 5 years old. 13 years later and many viewings later, it still blows me away. Let's just give you the numbers and letters that you want. 10/10 A+ 5 stars Two thumbs up etc. etc. This is a masterpiece. A film so brilliantly epic focusing on insignificant characters of the West. Not only is it the greatest Western film of all time, it could easily be regarded as THE best film of all time by some. But let's get into it.The story and characters. Both are simple. Very simple. And that's not a problem. From this movie we get the three typical characters; the bad guy, the funny man and the bad-ass "good guy". Each are unique in their simplistic way and have great chemistry between each other. The interactions between Blondie and Tuco on their adventure always sparks dark humour and Angel Eyes always has a sinister presence on screen. Their introductions to the audience are amazing, especially that of Angel Eyes, and they continue to be be lasting, memorable characters long after the film is finished. The story is a simple "three men going after the same gold" plot, but quickly grows into a Western epic as they travel around the open deserts, through towns, pulled into the bloody civil war and appropriately finishes in a graveyard. This entire epic adventure all occurred because of a simple treasure hunt plot. The movie therefore exceeds in providing great, memorable characters, and a simple plot that creates an epic adventure through the wild west.The acting is great. Eastwood pulls off his best bad-ass role as Blondie, whenever appearing on screen. His presence within the film gives off this almost demigod-like character that roams the west - truly awesome. Eli Wallach is also great as the rude, dirty and humorous Tuco, who provides the bulk of the comedy in the film, especially when interacting with Eastwood. Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes is also superb, truly pulling off a great villain. He's calm, ruthless and brutal and always has a presence when he's in the shot, standing out with his piercingly calm eyes. Each character has great dialogue, with memorable phrases and one-liners and each have their moment in the film to shine. Their personalities, dialogue and looks, portrayed by a great cast, provides some of the coolest, most unique characters ever put to film.The cinematography in this movie is astounding. Leone as a director is exceptional, always favouring the extreme long shots to get a feel for the location. The film is continuously breathtaking with its large, epic shots that capture the beauty of the west. Every frame of this film, is indeed a painting. Not only is the cinematography exceptional in the travelling and dialogue sequences of the film, it also excels in its action segments. A variety of long sweeping shots and precise close ups to eyes and guns brilliantly conveys tension in these scenes. Nothing is boring, everything is riveting. The quick cuts are never done during the action, but only leading up to it to effectively build the atmosphere of the showdowns, which are shot in a way in which doesn't confuse the audience and prominently displays the violence of the film. It feels gritty and real mixed with the myth-like invincibility of the main characters that lead them through showdowns and war-scale battles to a final showdown of epic proportions. It really gives the film an epic scale and never shies away from the drama and violence within the film, effectively capturing action and character emotions to portray a brilliant visual story.And how can I not talk about the score. Ennio Morricone, my favourite composer and easily one of the best, provides an astounding western score to solidify this film into history. It's epic and atmospheric and fits the movie so well. The movie's theme is brilliant and iconic, unique and memorable earning its place with the likes of Jaws, Star Wars and Terminator. Morricone's score fits in beautifully with the excellent cinematography, which really helps to further add to the atmosphere of the setting. It's an iconic and brilliant score, suitable for the greatest western film of all time.Overall, everything in this film just comes together perfectly. Everything. Sure, it's 3 hour run time isn't everybody's cup of tea but you should at least treat yourself to this epic at least once before you die. It's characters, cinematography, music, etc is all perfect. It is a perfect film. It has stood the test of time and will continue to do so for many more decades. A cinematic masterpiece. The western to rule all westerns. And not a bad pick for the greatest film of all time if I do say so myself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better civil war movie than "gone with the wind"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first western film I ever saw, and I must say that it was a pleasant surprise. While it's made clear which characters are the good, the bad and the ugly, There's no real 'good' in the film: all of the three main characters have their 'good' side (except maybe the bad, who seems the only really cruel character). The first really good thing is the setting. With the civil war background, it gave quite realism to the whole story. The film could make feel the horror of thew civil war much better than 'gone with the wind' did, simply because it showed one single battle. Tuco's character is maybe the most interesting one. Ennio Morricone's music felt sometimes too peaceful respect the scenes it was meant for, but was still really good. The best thing about the good, the bad and the ugly is that despite it's 2h 40m long, and there's not too much action, it keeps you on. While I'm not really happy with extended violence, and this movie has plenty of violence and cruelty, I really enjoyed this film. I don't usually say if a movie is the best ever made, but this deserves its high position in the top 250.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best spaghetti western I've personally seen so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been holding off doing this review for a couple of days now considering that, while I did enjoy this movie... I didn't really enjoy it enough to rank it the #8 on the Top 250. The plot is simple Three outlaws come together under extremely shaky terms. One being Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name, Another being a scumbag he hires to constantly get arrested for numerous crimes, collect the bounty money and stop him from being hanged and flee town together and another being a bastard outlaw who tries to find them and subsequently the numerous amounts of gold only Eastwood knows about. Okay so the plot is simplistic but what works here is what could be done with it and here they do address the American Civil War and they represent both sides and neither are good or bad in the eyes of the film. There is also the obvious theme of greed and that's done well. If I was to name the tone of this movie, I'd say it's cheesy but it works, it isn't laugh-out-loud cheesy but the sequence at the end when the three men are staring down one another in a circle trying to get the name of the grave the gold is buried in that Eastwood wrote on a rock is suspenseful and yet cheesy at the same time, so it is something that ages well. I'd also say the cinematography is excellent in my opinion and if there was anything to raise against it, it would be the music. It is an extremely iconic piece of film score to the point that association with that music and the genre of Western goes hand in hand, and I did like the piece. The problem is that is almost all the music for the entire movie played over and over, it just gets tiring after a while. I'd say this is extremely worth watching, while A Fistful Of Dollars is a straight up remake of a Kurosawa film, this is the closest movie I've personally seen to reach the standards of Kurosawa, Hell I'd say in some cases it actually reaches those standards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This classic spaghetti western follows three men as the search for a quarter of a million dollars during the American Civil War. The first 'Angel Eyes' is a gun for hire who learns the name of the man who stole the money from one of his victims. The other two are Tuco and 'Blondie' have been working a scam where Blondie turns in Tuco for the reward money then rescues him to do it again in another town? till they have a falling out. Shortly afterwards they come across a Confederate coach that just happens to contain the man Angel Eyes was looking for; he tells Tuco about the gold and the name of the cemetery where it is buried then, while Tuco is getting him water he tells Blondie the name on the grave? if either of them are to get their hands on the money they will have to work together. Things don't go according to plan and they have a run in with Angel Eyes; he gets the name of the cemetery from Tuco then offers Blondie the same 50/50 deal he had with Tuco. Ultimately the three of them will be reunited in the cemetery but which of them will get the gold.This is probably the best known of the spaghetti Westerns? and deservedly so. It starts with a quiet menace as we are introduced to Angel Eyes (The Bad) then shows a touch of cynical humour as we are introduced to Tuco (The Ugly) and Blondie (The Good). The plot is fairly simple but the journey for our protagonists will be anything but as the travel through the war torn American South West towards a grave in a remote cemetery. Their journey will be full of betrayals as each tries to get the information that will cut the others out of the deal. People who are used to classic American made westerns may be a little surprised that there are no heroes here; all three protagonists are venal, cynical and would happily kill the others for the cash? this of course is what makes the film so refreshing! It is also quite violent for a film of its time with numerous shootings and plenty of blood.Director Sergio Leone captures the action perfectly and the cast do a fine job. Clint Eastwood brings a dry humour to the role of Blondie, Lee van Cleef is delightfully unpleasant as Angel Eyes and Eli Wallach is great as Tuco. The story has plenty of action, some amusing moments and even a few touching scenes such as when Tuco meets his brother. The Spanish scenery looks spectacular? and more like the 'Wild West' than many westerns churned out in California. It is impossible to comment on this film without mentioning Ennio Morricone's score; it is brilliant throughout but there are some scenes that will have the viewer reaching for the remote to crank up the volume; not only does it sound great it also fits with the action. Overall I heartily recommend this; it is deservedly considered a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>putting things in perspective: i was born in 1995, so old film classics like star wars, jaws or alien can often be really painful to watch. then again there is a long list of great pieces of true art (where this movie will have a place forever). i put this film in my top 2 favourite films that were made before 1985 and my all time top 5. i'm only writing this review because my profile checklist told me to do so and i have other work to flee from. to complete the required 10 lines of minimum text, i want to list all the films that shouldn't be in the "list of great pieces of true art". the deserved first two places will undoubtedly have to go to "ghostbusters" and "alien", i wish someone in my age that loves this movies, could explain me in which form, i'm to stupid to appreciate them. "avatar" shouldn't be in any top100 and because of the same reasons, some of these "classics", shouldn't either. thats at least 10 lines :) i feel bad for anyone who will actually read this :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent tribute to the spaghetti western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is easily the best of the dollars trilogy and one of Sergio Leone's finest works in cinematography during this era. The plot is captivating and the quality of the film is very good even for a film dated back in a year when England won its only World Cup. It's hard to believe that so much has changed since then but yet this classic gem is a shining reminder of an age of westerns that has yet to see its like again. I don't even think "django unchained" could successfully mimic a milestone of this caliber as much as it tried. This is the genuine cinematic treasure for western fans from all walks of life. The cast is loaded with classic stars like Lee Van Cleef and the legend himself, Clint Eastwood, and it's worth its value for the price you pay when purchasing the restored DVD with all of the extras, this is one film any western fan wouldn't want to miss in their collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is truly a masterpiece in ever sense of the word, with regards to the cinema arts. The sound, the music, the editing, the context of the movie within the trilogy. The actors, the perfect use of timing and building the suspense and still leave just enough undetermined, but still giving the viewer enough satisfaction. I went into the movie knowing it was pretty amazing, but just truly didn't grasp just how amazing it would be. Yes, its a bit slow for modern times and there is very little talking, but if you go into the movie with the context of when it was made, along with the context and understanding of how other movies in this time frame and genre, you will find that this movie truly is the pinnacle in not just western films, but in all cinematic movies in general. This movie is truly worth the time, and I do think you should try to watch the movies that came before it in the trilogy, before watching this one. Overall an A+ movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wonderful film despite any anachronisms that were used. This movie was not about trying to be an accurate account of history but instead was telling a good fictional story. I am not a big fan of the western films but this one is very good. The move does not have an exceptional amount of dialogue but it didn't need any - the expressions on the faces of the characters as well as their actions tells the storyline. This is one of my favorite Clint Eastwood films and is among my least favorite movie genres: western -- that is saying a lot. If you have not seen The Good, The Bad and The Ugly - see it soon!

It's the perfect blend of widescreen mise-en-scene, sight gags and genre "revisioning." Is that even a word?

		<shortDescription>Nothing bad or ugly about this movie, all is good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well what do you know? Another amazing movie from Sergio Leone. The Good, The Bad and the Ugly has so much good about it, and quintessentially it is one of the best westerns ever made. There may be nothing new about the story at first glance, but that's the point, Leone is paying homage to the Hollywood western, and despite the initial simplicity there is also a complexity mainly in the film's characters. Regardless of whether simple or complex it is, The Good, The Bad and the Ugly does have a compelling and brilliantly written story.But there are other assets that make The Good, The Bad and the Ugly so good. The dialogue is always excellent, while Leone's direction is superb once again. The characters are great and are superbly played. Clint Eastwood gives one of his best performances ever here, and Eli Wallach is perfectly cast and more than a match for him. I was also very impressed with Lee Van Cleef, who I recognised from High Noon and such, but he makes a bigger impression here. The Good, The Bad and the Ugly is also the most violent of the trilogy, and one of the most violent of the genre, not a bad thing whatsoever.The pace was spot on too, even though the film is nearly three hours long, it is never boring or dull. The best things though about The Good, The Bad and the Ugly are the visuals and Ennio Morricone's score. The film looks amazing, the cinematography is gorgeous and the sweeping images and scenery are very lovingly crafted. Morricone's score is even more impressive than that, it is simply one of the best film scores I've ever heard, and if I had to say which was Morricone's best score, I would immediately say this.Overall, there is nothing bad or ugly about the film. The film is amazing. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The archetype, the archetype, and the archetype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's really interesting. I really don't like Westerns and I don't particularly like Italian directors. But Sergio Leone's Westerns, that's a whole 'nother bucket of fun.Basically, three characters defined by the title--the Good, the man with no name who travels the land turning wanted bandits in for money, but not really so they can die; the Bad, a man set out to track down a soldier who holds the secret to a lot of cash; and the Ugly, a bandit that runs into the man with no name and gets caught up in their journey--set out on a fateful journey across Civil War torn Western landscapes in search of $200,000 gold. The money is buried in a graveyard that the Ugly knows the location of, in a grave that the Good knows the name of, in a place that the Bad wants to get to. However, they all must cross Confederate and Union lines, somehow keep each other alive, and prevent each other from double-crossing each other (typically by doing just that, double-crossing each other) until the inevitable fateful showdown at the rocky center of the graveyard.You definitely gotta give it to Mr. Leone, even in the extended 3-hour English language cut, he keeps the movie building gracefully and moving forward to its exciting conclusion. Whereas I did not find this movie to be quite as good as the profoundly moving vengeance narrative of Once upon a Time in the West, I still have more than enough to keep me interested merely in the vast widescreen compositions. Clint Eastwood is every stolid hero wrapped up into one, and even Eli Wallach's Tuco has some sympathy built for him. Meanwhile, Lee Van Cleef's Angel Eyes, well, he's just around to make things more worrisome, it seems.In a way the title refers to the three main archetypes of the West, the roving, solid marksman we admire, the roving, lonely bandit that we pity, and the roving, powerful evil that insinuates itself into every railroad path, wooden town, and power situation, seemingly. And of course it's not a question of who is the toughest, but the most quick-witted, that decides how the outcome is.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The iconic spaghetti western!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the second sequel to A Fistful of Dollars, returning Clint Eastwood as The Man With No Name (Blondie), who forms an on-and-off partnership with bounty hunter Tuco (Eli Wallach) to find $200,000 worth of gold hidden in a cemetery while dealing with the nefarious hit man Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef).Eastwood gave another solid performance as the gun-totting cowboy, providing much action, wit and incognito elements in a film full of drama and action. Like the previous film, I believe Director Sergio Leone gave us a very adventurous film with unpredictable moments that captures your interest, especially during the very tense scenes of the American Civil War (the scene where Blondie gives his coat and cigarette to a mortally wounded young soldier is the most touching scene, I believe). It is suspenseful watching Eastwood and Tuco race against Angel Eyes to find the gold, all in the mist of the war. For a three-hour movie, the pacing is a little slow at times, making you crave for more action. But, the drama, tension, and excellent acting (the unpredictable, suave yet good-hearted Blondie, the capricious and money-hungry Tuco and the cold-blooded and sinister Angel Eyes) keeps the movie captivating nonetheless.Ennio Morricone gave us another catchy music score, perfect for a western movie and delivering one of cinema's most recognizable and iconic music themes. Tonino Delli Colli's cinematography captures the vastness of the dessert, the aura of the western towns and the chills of the war. Overall, it's another good western to catch.Grade B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great story in this era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the last and the best installment of his so-called "Dollars" trilogy of Sergio Leone-directed "spaghetti westerns," Clint Eastwood re-prised the role of a taciturn, enigmatic loner. Here he searches for a cache of stolen gold against rivals the Bad (Lee Van Cleef), a ruthless bounty hunter, and the Ugly (Eli Wallach), a Mexican bandit. Though dubbed "the Good," Eastwood's character is not much better than his opponents -- he is just smarter and shoots faster. The film's title reveals its ironic attitude toward the canonized heroes of the classical western. "The real West was the world of violence, fear, and brutal instincts," claimed Leone. "In pursuit of profit there is no such thing as good and evil, generosity or deviousness; everything depends on chance, and not the best wins but the luckiest." Immensely entertaining and beautifully shot in Techniscope by Tonino Delli Colli, the movie is a virtually definitive "spaghetti western," rivaled only by Leone's own Once Upon a Time in the West (1968). The main musical theme by Ennio Morricone hit #1 on the British pop charts. Originally released in Italy at 177 minutes, the movie was later cut for its international release. ~ Yuri German, Rovi</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterful, immersive, and showing off all that is cool about a western with a bit of Eastwood swagger.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This classic western Film by legendary director Sergio Leone remains to this day as one of the greatest westerns of all time. the characters, story and filming itself still to this day hold up against modern film making and storytelling and considering this was made in the mid 60's that is quite a feat, with special effects not quite coming into their own yet. The film is the third and final installment to the Leone spaghetti western trilogy with the star of each film in Clint Eastwood, the famed outlaw of no name. in this film he takes on the character of Blondie, "the Good", working with Eli Wallach's Character Tuco, "the Ugly", until of course the partnership they hold falls apart when Tuco a wanted outlaw reaches the peak of his value to Blondie, a partnership of money grabs from sheriffs of different towns by pretending to hand in Tuco to the authorities to be hung before Blondie after receiving the reward sets Tuco free at the hangers rope. Finally there is the character of Lee Van Cleef, "the Bad" who is a cruel sadistic bounty hunter, a killer in every respect whose tag line is "when I'm paid I see the job through". These men all come together in the pursuit of hidden gold, when soldiers fighting the civil war, tell Tuco and Blondie of a cemetery with $200,000 of hidden Gold, they again form a begrudging alliance after Tuco has tried to Kill Blondie. Meanwhile Angel Eyes, "the Bad" is searching his confederate connections where he learns of the hidden gold, and in-turn intercepts Tuco and Blondie as a Yankee in disguise in a prison camp where Tuco and Blondie have been taken, when they dress in Confederate army uniform and are captured. This then brings us to Angel eyes forming somewhat of an alliance with Blondie after he frees him of his capture in the prison camp after he sends Tuco to be killed. Yet again however , alliances fail with Tuco escaping his Yankee captor and Blondie staying defensive of Angel Eyes, fully aware of his dangerous potential. Tuco meets up gain with Blondie in a small town where they together kill angel eyes's men, with Angel eyes escaping and the pair making off together in pursuit of the gold. before they reach the cemetery the final hurdle for the Good and the Ugly comes with them running into the heart of the civil war, the bridge over the river is the final obstacle with fierce fighting taking place in order to protect it, so Blondie and Tuco go forth and destroy it after they agree to tell each other's part of the secret, which cemetery and which grave, yet once across the river Tuco makes a break for it, but the composed Blondie with Classic Eastwood cool again meets up with Tuco at the supposed grave site, where too Angel eyes again appears making for an epic showdown in the centre of the cemetery over discovering the name of the grave, with Blondie being the only one with actual knowledge of said grave. The epic showdown accompanied with the epic score of Ennino Moriconne to back it up like was done throughout the film, see's angel eyes taken down by the quick drawing Blondie and Tuco again beaten by Blondie who emptied Tuco's gun barrel the night before, allowing for Blondie to be the one with all the advantage. the final scene is where Blondie with gold on horseback with Tuco strung up in a tree like he did to Blondie, Blondie like he always has done shoots the rope freeing Tuco for the last time to have his share of the money and to have Blondie ride off into the distance unbeaten and victorious. The 3hr long epic is to this day one of the best ever films and one of if not the best western ever made, it was made in the golden era of westerns which extended into the 70's with other classics many of which starred Eastwood himself. The actors, the writing, the filming and the music all make for the most unforgettable western ever made and like i said, despite its age, and the quality of film at the time, everything about this film all the way down to the sets and costumes is accurate to the time portrayed in the film and holds up against modern films and indeed modern westerns. after watching the film many times over it is fair to say they simply don't make movies like this anymore, movies with character, movies that are in so many ways imaginative and inventive in style and structure, the acting and scenarios never seem forced the actors never seem insincere and the tone of the film is entirely engaging throughout the film. the greatest scene of course is the final shootout, but like most westerns it is the proper conclusion of the film, though you may think it typical, i guarantee the final scene is anything but typical, it is dramatic it is tense and the music that carry's it completely immerses you into the fear and focus of the characters and I personally believe that few other westerns achieve such an intense and engaging finale and indeed an intense and engaging film throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every gun makes it's own tune in a world populated by two kinds of people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If ever there was a movie that needed no explanation plot wise, it is The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. Even if you're not a fan of westerns, you'll at least have a vague idea as to what it's about. However for those of you who are unsure, it's about greed, war and er, two kinds of people.In 1966, Sergio Leone followed up the unparalleled awesomeness of A Fistful of Dollars and For A Few Dollars More with this gritty tale of the battle-of-wits between three outlaws whose fight for survival is driven not by instinct, but by greed. A somewhat politicised story of greed, there is more to the premise of TGTBTU than brazen immorality. In the powder keg decade that was the 1960s, the anti-war film was becoming increasingly popular thanks to images of U.S troops in Vietnam being projected into households worldwide. Many fans of TGTBTU will even ignore it's anti-war subtext, sadly dismissing the movie as nothing more than a cool cowboy flick. Our three main characters are "temporarily" sobered by the effects of war, but choose to remain ignorant to it's horrors. Leone isn't only interested in the physical effects of combat, he doesn't hold back from showing it's crippling emotional strain. Take the character of the unnamed Union Captain, who has begun a slow descent into madness and severe alcoholism due to ridiculous military logic. I also found the sight of the thousands of soldiers charging into battle in the film's second half rather haunting, these men aren't going to fight, they're going to be slaughtered. We are transported to a post-apocalyptic world by visuals of towns ravaged by cannon fire and bodies littering a barren landscape. Tongue-in-cheek cynicism is the order of the day and the hanging scenes allocate pinches of dark comedy, after all the movie is a satire. There are great performances all round but the three leads are just excellent. Clint Eastwood's Blondie is great but it is Eli Wallach's Tuco who steals the show. His foul mouthed tantrums are nothing short of humorous and the odds are stacked so ironically against him throughout the film. He also carries one of the coolest pistols ever to feature in a western and the gun store scene is just sublime. The last five minutes of the movie in which he is nearly hanged will always raise a hearty chuckle too. The legend that is Lee Van Cleef played the sadistic Angel Eyes brilliantly, a far cry from the valiant Colonel Mortimer of FAFDM. Although, Van Cleef gets considerably less screen time than Eastwood and Wallach and he is really the most villainous of the three.Of course no Sergio Leone film would be complete without the presence of a poetic Morricone score. You would need to have been living underground all your life not to have heard the iconic title score at least once. Thrillingly roaring over the gorgeous title sequence along with thunderous bursts of rifle and mortar fire, the score denotes the epic that is TGTBTU. "Story of a Soldier" is chillingly sincere, evoking the film's anti-war theme and "The Trio" commences the climatic showdown, giving the sequence a pinch of Gothic. "Ecstasy of Gold" is a truly majestic composition and will forever be one of my favourites. As with the previous two movies, the masterful editing techniques generate the tension brilliantly. Here it isn't the action itself that matters, rather the heavy build-ups of disquieting tension prior to the sharp explosions of gunfire. The film climaxes with the amazingly operatic triello(three way showdown)in which Leone relishes those continuous tight close-ups. Spectacularly taut, I still have to force myself to watch even on a fourth viewing. Heralding a new style of suspense, Leone creates a superbly baroque feel and the movie's violence as a whole is so aestheticized that it becomes lyrical. He spent AFOD and FAFDM practising the craft of tension and by this movie he had become a master of that craft, although the triello is such a phenomenon in itself that the entire sequence could be a short film on it's own. TGTBTU features impressive stunt-work and special effects(the controversial destruction of the bridge was fantastic!)and the aforementioned battle scene and subsequent bombardment were both extremely tense. The movie is set during the New Mexico campaign of 1862 and maintains authenticity by making reference to prominent historical figures such as Abraham Lincoln, General Sibley, Lee, Grant and Colonel Edward Canby. It is also a prequel to AFOD and FAFDM as they are set several years after the civil war.Nobody will disagree that Sergio Leone revolutionised the western genre and this movie itself will forever be a pioneering force. Arguably the best film of the three, the Dollars trilogy goes out with a thunderous bang and an effect that no modern director can ever dream of achieving. 10/10</fullReview>

The film is set in the south western desert area of the United States during the civil war. There are three characters all of which are outlaws but some are at times much more brutal and violent than the others. Frist there is Blondie (Clint Eastwood) the There is Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleff) and Finally Pablo (Eli Wallach). In an abstract way this is a classic story of good versus evil, but as all three are outlaws and bandits at times it is hard to tell who is good, bad or ugly. This trio fight and taunt each other across the war torn south west in search of buried union gold. During this quest they stack bodies everywhere. Until the final show down and yes you guessed it Blondie wins and kill Angel Eyes and holds Pablo at gun point and makes him dig the gold up for him. Then he rides off into the sunset as it were. It seems that this is a western explanation of yin and yang as in this movie nothing is 100% bad or 100% good. It seems that most of Eastwood's movies follow this path. I found strong story ties between this movie and "A fist Full of Dollars". A scene that stands out as a picture of good versus evil and the yin and yang theme is at one point Blondie and Pablo wonder on to a battle field and talk to a union captain and then watch a battle where the killing is no stop. During a lull in the fight these two, who could have went around the battle sneak onto it and blow a bridge so that the two sides cannot get to each other to fight.The wide angle camera angles and photography by Tonino Delli Colli that show the landscaped some the best I have ever seen. Then it would be snapped instantly to an extreme close up. These scenes were incredible as it would put an exclamation point on the feelings and emotion of the scenes. The biggest down point he allowed some stereotypical elements enter and were pushed too hard. Probably the biggest one of these was Pablo. One aspect that truly sets the film and adds an element that if it were not present the film would be far less. That is the haunting and captivating ability of the musical score by Ennio Morricone that is present though out the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Amoral Treasure Hunt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prior to the release of "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly," whenever a bunch of people in a movie embarked on a project to obtain a great deal of money, something always went wrong. In some cases, the project was illegal, and given the Production Code in force at the time, the criminals had to die or be arrested, as in "The Killing" (1956). In "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" (1963), the treasure hunters are not criminals, but the buried treasure was stolen loot, so they all had to be arrested in the end. But even when the enterprise was entirely legal, there was an unwritten rule that it must fail, that pursuing money per se was wrong in some way and must not be rewarded. For example, in "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" (1948), there was nothing illegal about the three men prospecting for gold, but it had to fail nevertheless. When the two surviving members of the team realize that all their gold has been lost, they laugh about it. Presumably, even when the search for money was legal, it had to fail, as a way of making those in the audience content with their lot. One slight exception is "King Solomon's Mines" (1950 et al.). They do manage to keep a handful of gems, but the vast treasure is lost for good.And then came "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly." Three men set out to find buried treasure, and something incredible happens: the treasure does not turn out to be worthless Confederate bonds; it does not blow away in the wind; the men pursuing the treasure are not arrested; and only one of them dies, leaving the other two alive to split the loot. Nothing like that had ever been seen in a movie before, and the violation of the taboo against that sort of thing was exhilarating.This amoral ending was perfectly in line, however, with all that had come before in that movie. Were it not for the advance notice provided by the tagline, "For three men the Civil War wasn't Hell. It was practice," we would not even realize that the movie was set in the Civil War when it begins. And it is only gradually that we become aware of the war, because it really does not seem to concern the three principle characters. The Ugly is a bandit, the Good is a bounty hunter, and the Bad is a hired killer, each pursuing his own business with no interest in the war. Only when they find out about the buried Confederate gold does the war take on significance for them. And as they pursue that gold, the war slowly closes in around them, either getting in their way or providing opportunities. They walk through that war as if they were walking through a cluttered room. In one case, when the war is really getting in their way, they blow up a bridge so that the soldiers will leave the area, which has as an incidental byproduct the result that the pointless daily slaughter is brought to an end.Actually, the amoral nature of this movie was no surprise, for it was also characteristic of the two previous Westerns by Sergio Leone featuring the Man with No Name, "A Fistful of Dollars" (1964) and "For a Few Dollars More" (1965). This was a new kind of Western protagonist. He was not a law enforcement officer; he was not seeking to avenge someone's death; and he was not trying to reform and hang up his guns. Instead, he was either a hired gun or bounty hunter who profited by his expertise with a pistol, and had no intention of changing his ways.In many ways, the movie is a comedy, for it is replete with cruel jokes and humorous dialogue, of which these are some of my favorite punch lines:"Once I'm paid, I always see the job through.""But you don't look like the one who'll collect it.""I'd hate to be placed in his shoes.""More feeling!""There's no name on this stone either."If you don't recall some of these lines, that is a good reason to watch this movie one more time, as if you needed a reason.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a must watch for movie fans. Cinematography is excellent. The cast contains 3 big names and the movie itself contains good acting.Eli Wallach gives an unforgettable performance, Lee Van Cleef is excellent a sadistic killer and Clint Eastwood is as good as always. Ennio Morricone must be equally appreciated for his music for the movie which is a masterpiece itself and therefore is unforgettable. Sergio Leone proves himself to be one of the greatest directors by directing this masterpiece. In my lasting opinion, i recommend anyone who loves movies to watch this masterpiece and i am sure they will not regret watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I believe Once Upon a Time in the West to be a better film overall, I still believe that The Good, The Bad and the Ugly is one of the finest westerns ever made. It's hypnotic directing and story, combined with the grittiness and operatic nature of the music compound to create an absolute treat. If that's not enough for you, the performances in the film are entrancing. Clint Eastwood as the Man With no Name is as good as it gets and Lee Van Cleef is as excellent here as he was in the previous film. Add in Tuco, a character who has some real memorable lines, and you have one heck of a movie.Not my favorite western, but darned close!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A colorful yet classic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a classic movie, which brilliantly shows different colors of life in the old times. Emotions of greed, confrontation, tolerance, compassion and vigilance are presented. Based on civil war, landscapes shown are as diverse as barren land, public area, detention center and church. The movie revolves around 3 gunmen traversing the war ravaged country for easy money. One of them, Tuco (the ugly), is a bandit who is wanted for many crimes and has reward offered for his head. But considering himself courageous, he usually gets himself handed over to police by Blondie (the good) with the agreement that Blondie later helps him escape the custody and share the reward. Angel Eyes (the bad) is introduced as a contract killer. During one such contract, he gets to know about a treasure. In its quest, he tries to search for a man named Jackson who knows the treasure location. But luckily, Tuco and Blondie are first to know of the location from Jackson just before he dies. Now what follows is a struggle to reach the location first. The movie cleverly shows how they navigate the country amid the war. The characters are nicely portrayed with Blondie being compassionate and composed, besides being a sharp shooter, alert and lucky. He has a humane side, even though he is initially shown to be the friend of a bandit. His actions and reasoning align with his benevolent nature many times in the movie. Tuco is also sharp shooter and alert, but he isn't a tactical person. He doesn't carry similar compassionate nature and is shown to be carried away by greed. Angel Eyes has a relatively small role but he still leaves his mark on the viewers. He is depicted as a tactical and vigilant man and the name "Angel Eyes" suits the character. Overall it's a good and recommendable movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Sergio Leone made the final chapter of the man with no name spaghetti western trilogy with star Clint Eastwood this time collaborating with Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef the film turned out to be the best film in that series with me loving the movie and really wanting to see it again and again and again. The movie is not only a great adventure movie and a great western it is also a good comedy at times. Eastwood, Wallach, and Cleef give top notch performances as three men one with no name, the other an Italian thief, and the other a Hit-man who try to compete with each other to find some money but the big question is Who is going to get it first?, as I mentioned in one of the last sentences in my review for John Ford's The Searchers (1956) that the film did not get consideration which was pretty stupid, the same goes for this movie including Touch of Evil, The Night of the Hunter, etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Western of all times on so many levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly" is one of the earliest films I can remember and is probably the only film I would never get sick of watching over and over. IMO, it's not only the best 'Western' ever made, but one of the best films of all time. Not for the picture quality... as it can be a little rough and grainy. Not for the dialog over-dubbing, which is often out of sync due to the range of languages spoken when it was shot. And not for the historical inaccuracies or feasibility of the physical burdens endured by the characters (it's way more realistic than James Bond anyway). Those are what give the film its charm and retro appeal! Personally, I think this film is great because of the overall 'mood' it creates, both visually and audibly. It has, by far, one of the most unusual and recognizable music scores in movie history, blending the traditionally-used orchestral brass section with human whistles, cackles, grunts, and an electric guitar, to create a tapestry of sound that strangely fits perfectly (even though the time period depicted predates the electric guitar by more than half a century). Then, in the spaces, the wind-blown desolation in the sound track really gives you the sense of being there with the characters in that barren desert. It's the dynamic range in both the soundtrack and the pacing of the story that sets such a great undercurrent for the talented trio to do their magic. All three seasoned actors with impressive credits both before and after this film seemed to cross paths at just the right time in their careers to face off in their most memorable performances to date. And rather than a typical Western--one wronged man against a whole town; a masked hero and his trusty sidekick; or a rag-tag posse banding together only to get killed off one by one by bandits--this is three distinct personalities going head to head to head, each with a little good, a little bad, and a little ugly in them to varying degrees. On the script side, it's really more of a human interest story than an action film. And it poignantly bullet-points (no pun intended) that often the "good guy" really only needs to be the "least bad" of the bunch to obtain that moniker, which has all sorts of parallels in all walks of life. To fully rave about all the intricacies of this masterpiece would take a novel. But these are just a few aspects that make it a timeless classic and well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Most Intitally Underrated Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon its' release in the United States, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, was marred by film critics and their reviews of the film. I believe the Wikipedia page on the film, if you would like proof of its reception when it was released, it is under Contemporaneous reception. But since it's' release and contemporaneous reception, several well-known film critics like the great Rodger Ebert, have given it the rating it deserved and recognition as the film we know and love. I had known about it for a while and never watched it until my father showed it to me back in 2009. I will never forget watching with my dad and then learning how all great classic films are meant to be watched, with the people that you love. That next day my father passed away suddenly, but the memory of watching this movie lives on. From now until I die, I will cherish The Good, the Bad and the Ugly for all that is!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Story and Excellent Direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Eli Wallach, Lee Van Cleef, Clint Eastwood are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful direction from legend Sergio Leone as well. This film probably had the largest impact on my life. It set the tone for everything I then got interested in. American Civil War. Film Music. Clint Eastwood. Real Westerns. This is the best of the Dollars Trilogy and by far one of the best Westerns of all time. It has drama, comedy, cracking dialog, some of the most brutal battle scenes - especially around the bridge - that I'd seen up to then, music to die for and set pieces that just ooze atmosphere and tension. I have never forgotten the end shoot-out. It was just simply incredible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tuco (Eli Wallack) gives the biggest impact</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film seems to get the higher evaluation than the previous film "For a Few Dollars More"(1965), but honestly, I prefer the latter to the former because the latter is simpler. This film is actually presenting to us dynamism by involving the Civil War, but I felt a kind of incoherence, because the bounty hunters, who tried to snatch big money, are mismatched with the Civil War soldiers, who fought for their victory of their own country.The story proceeds by three main characters in the balance, the Good (Clint Eastwood), the Bad (Lee Van Cleef) and the Ugly (Eli Wallack), but the personality of Tuco, the Ugly, is too strong and seems to upstage the other two. In particular, Lee Van Cleef, who had presented a big presence in the previous "For a Few Dollars More," is diminished here. Tuco's exposure also seems biggest among three. But, in other words, Eli Wallack is really one of the finest character actors.In spite of the above, in general, this film is dynamic, shooting again the great scenery, this time big battles of the Civil War, under the relatively lower budget we have heard. It is thrilling till the end even if we know that Clint Eastwood wins in the end.Those who have not viewed this film, please compare the Sergio Leone's trio, "A Fistful of Dollars"(1964), "For a Few Dollars More"(1965), and this "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"(1966).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leone's comic Dollars Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Generally thought of as the third of the 'Dollars' Westerns, this sprawling Western quest flick (a Questern?) could as easy be counted alongside the other two Once Upon A Time films. A constant satellite narrative is the Civil War, a pitiful, bleak subplot to the search for the gold.In fact it's entirely possible that the mangled and weary infantry that crop up all over the picture were the reason Leone made one of his principals such a clown. Gian Maria Volont?, the Latin star of the first Dollars films, was a natural first choice for Tuco but instead the more spirited Eli Wallach was cast and this really makes the film. Tuco, tellingly monikered 'the ugly', is neither bad nor good, a bandit with a heart of (for) gold. Wallach's exuberant performance not only offsets the misery of the War but also acts as a welcome foil to the now familiar 'cool' of Eastwood and Van Cleef.An epic, episodic affair, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly uses all the tried and tested components of its predecessors - startling Morricone score, unmoderated dirt and heat - whilst broadening itself to accommodate the grand sentiment and vista of the War in the background. A Western for Lord of the Rings fans. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another flawed classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the colossal story of three men. Two of which are bounty hunters who are at opposite ends of the moral compass, with one (Angel eyes) who will kill anyone and anything in order to reach his goal and with the other (Blondie) with limits that make him desire the right outcome, even of he sometimes doesn't get it. The third member of this triumvirate is a criminal (Tuco) who will do anything to remain free.As Tuco teams up with the Blondie in order to perform a bounty collecting scam, a missing treasure to pay soldiers in the civil war has been uncovered by Angel eyes, as the film progresses the final piece of the puzzle of the treasure's location is revealed to Tuco and Blondie. The remainder of the film sees the two of them split, team up with other people, intervene in a major civil war battle and have a final reckoning where only one can be the winner.This is a colossal film in terms of its vision and scope. The running time at 161 minutes is a tad long and the film is at its best after the first 40 minutes when the pace is a trifle slow. It is only when the treasure's location is revealed that the film really starts to move and we feel the scale of the vision being revealed. The characters are excellently drawn and each of the three men are interesting and even likable in their own ways. Angel Eyes as the villain is a magnificent one and he is great to watch as he sneers over the screen. Clint is magnificent here and around this time with both this, and Dirty Harry, he has a couple of his best ever performances. Eli Wallach doing a sterling job representing the worsts aspects of greed and selfishness of humanity, however, even within this vessel of degradation there are still redeeming features that he attempts to hide.Directing such a colossal work must have been a nightmare and Sergeo Leone does an incredible job of combining the disparate strands without losing track and, largely, doing so while moving the story forward. The musical score is impressive and during the quieter moments is at its most effective, as, for me, I find the larger pieces too invasive and take over scenes rather than compliment them, and for this and the issue of pace at the beginning marks this down for me, but then again it is a question of taste.Nuff said Em</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Punctiliously crafted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the biggest regrets I hold to this day is not having seen The Good, The Bad and The Ugly many years ago. I've been well aware of its revered reputation amongst moviegoers, but I had no idea just how mesmerising it is to watch, no matter who you are or what you know about cinema, nor how quickly it would pop into my list of perfect movies.Set in the unforgiving environments of New Mexico, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly tracks the three eponymous bounty hunters racing to find Confederate gold. The narrative is original, unpredictable, and meticulously constructed throughout the three- hour runtime. The context of the American Civil War is used as a setting rather than a subject so we can focus on the story. The script, bereft of dialogue in most places, slowly builds up to one of the best endings in all of cinema. Picture a desolate cemetery with the three leads in a tense Mexican standoff, contrasted by Ennio Morricone's blazing score, and polished by a memorable quote - "You see, in this world, there's two kinds of people, my friend: Those with loaded guns and those who dig. You dig."Despite the language barriers between the American actors and the Italian crew, coupled with Leone's alleged perfectionism, he executes his vision to perfection, utilising a wide variety of camera angles and real locations to further captivate the audience. However, Clint Eastwood (The Good), Lee Van Clef (The Bad) and Eli Wallach (The Ugly) combine Leone's direction with their own aptitude in acting to elevate the material. Leone veteran Ennio Morricone establishes himself as a god in film scoring, combining conventional instruments with whistling, gunfire and the iconic two-note whistled motif that forever changed film music.If there's one thing I'll remember The Good, The Bad and The Ugly for, its the enormous similarity it bears to the work of one of my biggest filmmaking idols: the self-professed, highly knowledgeable and irrepressible Quentin Tarantino. It's easy to see how the smooth dialogue, punctiliously crafted tension, genius orchestration of music, varied cinematography and the overall epic and grandiose experience of this movie are replicated effectively in films like Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill and Inglorious Basterds. I should also mention how The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, like Tarantino's films, instigates almost every type of response from the audience, including laughter, anger, anxiety, confusion, etc. Tarantino sure wasn't joking around when he declared The Good, The Bad and The Ugly as "the greatest achievement in the history of cinema".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the First Great Western or the Last, but Certainly the Greatest of Them</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a reason that this movie has inspired so many parodies over the years. There is a reason it is the first thing that comes to people's minds when they think of Westerns. There a reason that its theme is instantly recognizable.It is the best Western movie ever made, plain and simple.Every angle is perfect. Every line contributes something. Every event both captures your imagination and sets up what is to come. It does not involve me as much as Skyfall does, but it is just so inhumanly great without sacrificing its very human grit and style. Even people who are not film critics or analysts of any kind or even frequenters of high art can look at this movie and say, "That's a really good film." Of course, this movie is not watched by as many people as it should be. I'm willing to bet that for every twenty people who have heard of this film, maybe one or two have actually seen it. Again, I get it. If you're not a major film buff or film buff wannabe or die-hard lover of Westerns, it is hard to convince yourself to take a full three hours out of your busy schedule to watch a slower paced film that was made fifty years ago. But if you ever have a chance, check it out.There is everything to be said about this movie. About how it subverted many traditional western tropes while laying the groundwork for far more. About how it catapulted Clint Eastwood into stardom, stardom that he has fostered and still basks in fifty years later. About how it took what worked in the first two Sergio Leone Westerns and made some additions of its own. And so much else that I could likely think of if only I rewatched it. From what I remember, it is so dense despite being so sprawling.There is also nothing to be said about this movie. It is like the American West itself (ignore for a moment the fact that this film was shot in Spain by a team of Italians). I've been fortunate enough to explore the West myself, and let me tell you, no words can capture the open freedom that you feel out there. This movie is something similar. Just like any journey, everyone will have a separate experience. But like any journey to a beautiful place, it will be worth it.There is something about the movie that makes you wish, at least for a second, that you could be in that world. Not the Old West, though that would be interesting. No, I'm talking about this film's version of the Old West. There is pain and danger and adventure and action and risk; but also those long pauses that allows everything to sink in. Combine that with the fact that they are going off of a real place, and you can both see yourself there and legitimately want to go.The main, is, of course, played by Clint Eastwood. He is subdued but fierce and sly. Whether or not you consider the 'Dollars Films' a trilogy- I don't- there is no doubt that his character here could easily be the same man from the other movies. This doesn't mean he hasn't changed; he is more visibly weary here, something that both helps this film stand out from and tie together to the other two films.But of course, he is only 'The Good.' The other two, Lee Van Cleef's 'Angel Eyes' and Eli Wallach's Tuco... Ramirez, make up 'The Bad' and 'The Ugly,' respectively. The three of them are searching for some hidden Confederate gold, and yes, it is an epic quest that takes them across the West. This is one of those movies where it's less about what sets the story in motion and more what it does when it's there. So much happens. It builds up and up, so high up that if the climax isn't spectacular, you would be disappointed and let down.But of course, that's fantastic as well. I'm not going to spoil what happens (though I don't think I'd be hurting anyone if I did; this film came out over fifty years ago) but I will say that you are in for a treat. On the surface, it's simple, if cleaver and well-written and smart. But the way they shoot it and direct it and score it and act it gives it so much depth and atmosphere. Ennio Morricone has composed many, many great pieces in this film alone, a few of which even people who have never seen this movie would recognize, so often are they repeated and parodied. But for my fist full of dollars (couldn't resist), none tops the piece that plays hear, simply called 'The Trio.' This scene is famous for what people who went to film school might call 'super tight shots.' The camera zooms in right on the character's eyes. This, like any artistic technique, can be used masterfully or horribly, depending on the production (check out the Dutch angles on Battlefield Earth; I shudder every time I see clips of it.) For this film, of course, it is the former. It is the crowning cherry on the top of three hours of conscious, radiant camera-work.In fact, now that I think about it, this scene perfectly captures the essence of the movie. The drama, the emotion, the art, the pure statement of excellence: it's all there. Catch the clip and see what the film's about. Just don't forget to watch the rest of the flick too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing less than the finest western ever created!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is a classic 'spaghetti' western, with unforgettable characters and, in my opinion, the greatest ending to a movie ever. Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef give 3 iconic performances. There is no good, there is only bad. Although film is named 'The good', none of the characters are heroic. Eastwood is a backstabbing fraud. Wallach is a dirty rebel. And Van Cleef is a lying bounty hunter. The story is the first of its kind, an undeniably iconic story in fact. The soundtrack is one of the best ever made, Ennio Morricone has made countless other iconic tunes, but absolutely none of them can beat his incredible 'Ecstasy of gold'. The film has loads of quotable dialogue such as "There are 2 kinds of people in this world... Those with loaded pistols... And those who dig... You dig." Its 3 hour run time flies by, it has a fantastic 3 act structure and a truly unforgettable ending. Strongly recommend this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three gunslingers compete to find a fortune in a buried Confederate gold amidst the violent chaos of the American Civil War.One of the greatest Westerns ever made. While Spaghetti Western For a Few Dollars more is debatably the better tale, The Good the Bad and the Ugly is grander in scale and scope (thanks to Director of photography Tonino Delli Colli) with the main characters even getting caught up in the New Mexico Campaign of 1862 complete with war camps, prisoners and an exploding bridge.Clint Eastwood returns to the genre as protagonist Blondie (aka The Man with No Name) along with Lee Van Cleef who this time plays Angel Eyes (The Bad). Both Eastwood and Cleef are outstanding with Sergio Leone's 1966 offering benefiting from the addition of Eli Wallach who delivers a sterling and memorable performance as Tuco Ramirez (The Ugly). The characters written by Age &amp; Scarpelli, Luciano Vincenzoni and Leone (with additional material provided by an uncredited Sergio Donati) are well defined archetypes which are constructed perfectly.The Good the Bad and the Ugly has one of the greatest crescendo building endings ever and the film is complete with Leone's perfectionist directorial trademarks. Ennio Morricone's iconic theme completes the package as the score complements the three players double crossing each other throughout to the closing Mexican Standoff.You can feel the heat and taste the dust in this highly influential recommended Western.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched a lot of westerns growing up, Parents hey. But I have always Liked the good the bad and the ugly. It is a timeless classic and is still a very good watch to this day. Same as a few dollars more. Made at a time when cinema was at it's peak and new avenues of filming was coming about. This film and many others should never be touched or re made. (True Grit aside). It spawned a fascination of the time with me the Music the settings, All added in t a masterpiece of a film. For those that have not seen this or are in 2 minds if to or not, Trust me you will not be disappointed, I say again it is a great Western with great Characters. Clint Eastwood is fantastic in it. The rest of the cast are also very good inc Lee Van Cleef who in my opinion was never a great actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An outstanding Western film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, this movie is in fact the best Western film ever made. It is amazing but it isn't perfect.After 3 men find out that $200,000 is buried under a gravestone, it leads them to race for it. They encounter many different things along the way including the civil war but eventually, they all meet up by the cemetery which leads to a duel.Most famous trilogies as good as they were, never quite captured the charm of the original. But with Leone's "the man with no name" trilogy, the movies kept on getting better as it continued on.Despite the fact that Clint Eastwood's character is labeled as "The Good", he is not much better than the other 2. It's not quite clear why this movie was titled that but it's open for interpretation.The memorable and haunting score does a great job setting up certain scenes and it feels very "Western" to me too.The characters are introduced excellently as always in the opening. The movie often only shows eye contact and body language to convey their personalities. In fact, not a single word is said in the first 10 minutes.Leone has an environment of "every man for himself" as the characters constantly lie and backstab each other as much as possible.The ending when all 3 characters get in a "Mexican standoff" is one of the tensest scenes in cinema. It slowly builds up by the haunting music and the shots of the 3 men getting slowly closer to their guns ready to draw them at any moment.The only thing that bugged me about this movie is that it took 1 hour and 15 minutes for the film to introduce the inciting incident. So the first act is unnecessarily slow moving but that's the only thing I didn't like about this.This is the best Western out there. It's not perfect but its remarkable shots and filmmaking make it a movie well worth viewing a second time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The essence of true film making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I may have seen this film about twenty times, but somehow this film never bores. For me this film encompasses the true art of film making, with simplistic scenes, sets, intriguing conversations and great music. From the opening scene where hit men gather in a deserted town, saying nothing, but express determination in fulfilling their objective, to the last duel where every tiny detail is filmed from eyes to fingertips. This in combination with greatly build sets (without CGI at the time) like a POW camp, a mysterious cemetery in the middle of nowhere, but above all the real naturalistic recordings at deserts and desert mountain areas. It really gives you the feeling of the real deal, outside Hollywood studies and that's what makes a spaghetti western great. You almost wish to be a cowboy yourself. Last (but not least) to mention the music, which perfectly fits the scenes and creates the extra dimension that makes this film a western masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You want some Pasta with your Sauce?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is the greatest spaghetti western ever made, and may just possibly be the greatest western ever made. It is a perfect film, and would easily win a fight against the Godfather. If you look up "perfect" in the dictionary, you first see Meryl Streep's Oscar Nomination Record, then The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. But what could possibly be so good about this western?The film begins with the most jarring cinematography I have ever seen to start a film. After the intro theme, this man, Elam, pops his head into the screen. This not only sets up the rest of the film's cinematography, with the camera either super close or super far away, but also gives us a face to remember, as in an hour and a half or so we will meet this character again. In this scene we meet The Ugly. Later The Bad. Then The Good. This contrasts from the title, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, as we show the characters in the opposite order from which we may expect. The Ugly runs off after attacking Elam and two other outlaws. The we turn to an arid section of the desert where we meet Angel Eyes. We know that he's up to no good as everyone nearby quickly hides. Except for this guy, who keeps eating his soup. This probably because he knows its his last meal. We learn that Angel Eyes is looking for a man by the name of Bill Carson. He is searching for Carson because there is a lot of money behind his name, and because he was hired to help Baker, the man who hired Angel Eyes to take out this Soup Man. However, by the end of the meal, we have not only set up an objective, but also some character development. Soup Man knows that he is going to die, but pays Angel Eyes to kill the man who paid to kill him. Angel Eyes accepts the job, and the cash, but still kills Soup Man as, "Once I'm paid, I always see the job through."He goes through with his new job kills Baker, the man who hired him originally. This shows that although Angel Eyes is The Bad he has honor. If The Ugly were to be in Angel Eyes' situation he would have taken the money from Soup Man and not have gone through with the job. So now we have to think. Who is the better man, a scoundrel or the Bad?Finally we meet The Good. We find out that he is working with The Ugly and that the two are con men. What they do is this: The Good turns in The Ugly for a reward. He takes the money and then frees The Ugly. Then they split the cost and repeat. Now we must once again start to question morals here. The Good is not literally "good," as he does bad things. However, deep down he has a heart of good and in the end will usually choose the wiser, more moral route than the other characters we meet. One thing I love about this film is how even though there are three separate characters doing three separate things--The Good and The Ugly eventually split off--they all coordinate with each other in the end. One thing that happens in the beginning of the film at one location may come back to haunt certain characters later in the film at a completely different location. Let's take Elam for instance. In the very beginning of the film he and his two partners are shot by The Ugly. Then two whole hours later Elam find The Ugly and tries to kill him. This doesn't work out too well as The Ugly apparently bathes with his gun. Other moments like this occur throughout the film which adds realism to the story.The most critical point of joining these three together by chance is when the plot is revealed to our trio. We already know that The Bad is after a certain amount of gold, but The Good and The Ugly don't know about this gold or Bill Carson until an hour into the film and the only reason this happens if because of great character development. See after The Good has left The Ugly in the desert to die, The Ugly finds The Good and gives him the same punishment. Whilst doing so we begin the absolutely hate The Ugly as he torments The Good. While in the desert they find Bill Carson, the man who The Bad is looking for. The Ugly is told the location of where the treasure is hidden, a cemetery. The Good is told the name of the grave. Now the tables have turned as The Ugly must keep The Good alive in order to find the treasure. Shortly after The Bad, who by the way is a army captain, finds the two and The Ugly poses as Bill Carson. Soon The bad tortures The Ugly and we once again question our thinking. We saw The Ugly earlier being just awful to The Good but now we are sympathizing toward him because of the bad. From here I will reveal no more of the plot, as this is a movie you need to see and I do not want to have it spoiled for you. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a masterpiece. Not only is it a brilliant Western but also a film. It has an outstanding plot, cinematography, acting, music, and directing. For all of these reasons I give The Good, the Bad and the Ugly a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

So many epic westerns have come since and none, NONE!, can equal this movie. Someday some one will finally figure out again how to make a peerless western but until then The Good The Bad And The Ugly is the grand champ, and I myself am contented.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this were the only movie Leone made there wouldn't be enough praise you could lavish on it. It is amazing and fans of this genre will be thoroughly pleased. However, this is not only not Leone's best, but actually is his third best! Yes, I am aware Fistful of $ is a remake- doesn't matter, watch the movie, it's mesmerizing. You had the classic opening 10 minutes with no dialogue, the clever storyline where each character knows something the other doesn't and the climactic gunfight. One mustn't forget the wonderful Morricone score. There were some problems though that we might not want to face because we love Sergio and Clint, but let's face them just the same shall we? Brutal violence is a trademark of this genre, but here it was done over the line where it was unnecessarily vicious. It worked in Fistful because there was a sort of logic to it whereas here in scenes like the shot through the pillow and the abandoning of Tuco it came off as being just too cruel to justify. Slapping of women and leaving people to hang are tough elements, but ones that had a feel that they belonged. As for the gunfights, they were good of course, but you get the feeling that they could have been better or more convincing. Also, I must agree with those who say it's a trifle long and before you say "Hey, you have to get the feel of the movie and you don't understand what Leone's trying to do" remember I'm a huge fan and am merely saying that there wasn't quite enough here to fill out 3 hours worth of movie. To say this movie was awesome doesn't really do anyone any good because we all know that. What we don't seem to know judging by the fact that this is #4 on IMDb is that there are better movies out there that didn't have these kinds of problems. Leone took his concepts and gelled them into the masterpiece that followed called Once Upon a Time in the West. I dare you to watch that one and then still give GBU a 10. OUATITW does all the things exactly right that this movie almost got right and then some. Even Morricone's score gets better in that one if you can believe it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Leone's third work in his man-with-no-name trilogy (although Eastwood's character did in fact have a name-- and no I'm not talking about "Blonde") and probably his most interesting visually. There are enormous battle scenes intermixed with the more usual operatic shootouts and epic shots of blank, desert expanses. There are tons of anachronisms in the film, but this isn't really any fault. Leone is not trying to come anywhere close to any form of realism and instead is working with melodrama and stylized acting that creates a well-conceived and detailed western fantasy world that is purely a joy to immerse yourself in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is an operatic scene in a graveyard towards the end of this film that a lesser director may not have thought of. Though irrelevant, it is a moment of pure exhilarating cinema as Wallach runs around in a dizzy attempt to locate a stone.The problem with Leone's films are their curious lack of suspense and tension. They plod along, then end. The characters ignore the fact that people are dying around them for real issues and values while their own cynical interests extend only to money. This obsession that cinema has with unsavoury and morally worthless people soon becomes wearisome as no amount of inspired camera work and direction can prevent the film being pulled down towards dullness by dull people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As much as I love Eastwood and his westerns, this movie is not his best western. Though it may be highly viewed as such, for that era or even now perhaps, I still believe Hang em High is the best western ever made. Westerns to me are action packed adventures not experiments for dramatic directing. The character Eastwood played Hang em High was a God compared to the easily subdued and capturable Blondie in TGTB&amp;TU, and made HEH an adventure. Most of these praises for TGTB&amp;TU stem from a childhood experience of this portrayal of the west so perhaps that explains the accolades from the hypnosis of novel directing. My suggestion to them is that they forget the fact that TGTB&amp;TU reminds them of the dillydally days of youth and watch it for the film that it truly quite isn't. You'll probably wish IMDB had a comment removing feature</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly" is the perfect example of hype backlash, where people say this is one of the greatest films ever. I watched it and it was honestly "this is what all the buzz was?" Honestly, I have never been disappointed in a film, and part of the reason why I look down on the Western genre.This film in particular is rife with horrible acting, especially from Clint Eastwood, and the directing is honestly shaky at best. The movie's main flaw is how extremely predictable and formulaic the film is. Sergio Leone is held too high in regard, though he made the same film over and over again, with bringing nothing new to the table.If anyone suggests watching this film, I'd strongly suggest skipping it. The only saving grace in this movie is the score - that's it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the mysteries of modern life is how this motion picture currently comes to occupy its No 4 spot on the IMDb list of all-time greats. If not totally insane, the story is undeniably either ridiculous, ludicrous, hilarious or risible. Perhaps the word I'm looking for is laughable. I'm not saying it isn't entertaining. It is that also.It is an American Western partly written by an Italian director, Sergio Leone, who shot it in Spain. He invented a new cinematic genre, by linking the maniacal overstatement of Italian grand opera with the Spanish picaresque tradition, as he himself has indicated. Picaro is a Spanish word for "rogue" or "rascal", and the picaresque novel is usually satirical, depicting, "in realistic and often humorous detail, the adventures of roguish heroes of low social class who live by their wits in a corrupt society." The viewer is asked to believe that two picaros, Clint and Eli, can make good money, if not a steady living, claiming bounty rewards for Eli's sins (which include playing cards with a marked deck), and then having Clint shoot through the rope which is hanging Eli, from some considerable distance. Eli then fortunately stays sitting on his conveniently placed horse which gallops away. Pull the other one; it's got bells on.For a detailed exposition of the plot, and the different putative locations, see the FAQ, which is required reading if some sense is to be made of the narrative, as filmed. This is of little help when actually watching, however.Two of the weirdest scenes occur at the very beginning, and at the very end. The opening starts with one of Leone's trademark facial closeups, of a peculiarly evil-looking individual. A little further on Eli bursts through a window. Difficult to tell why, since he leaves about three gunmen dead on the floor of the room which he has just left. He was apparently in the middle of gnawing his dinner.Some way into the movie we leave Spain, which has been doubling for Mexico, and enter what looks like the Sahara desert. I was expecting at least a camel, or possibly Omar Sharif, to materialize out of the sand. But no, instead we get a driverless coach and six, full of dead and dying soldiers, coming out of nowhere like a bat from hell --- had we wandered into Hammer Films territory? Skip to the end, where our two heroes, Clint and Eli, now find themselves in what has been called a Mexican standoff with evil-eyed Lee van Cleef. Difficult to know why he hadn't been shot a long time earlier, since he didn't appear to have any valuable information about where the buried treasure was, like the other two. Anyway, he sure gets shot now in an amazingly pointless and prolonged three-cornered duel, which takes place in a uniquely circular cemetery, specially designed for the standoff.Leone is fond of scenes where a man is shown to be terrified by suspension from a rope round his neck. This turns up four times in this movie, and once more in his far greater masterpiece, OUATITW. This film (GBU) is much inferior, but you can't say it isn't entertaining. Clint is cool, and the rest of it is comical, and brutal. Look out for Cpl Wallace. Eli takes his gun into his bath with him. Never saw that in a Western before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The beautiful cinematography by Tonino Delli colli (The name of the rose, Life is beautiful, Once upon a time in the west), the excellent music by legendary Morricone and great camera work make this a stylish masterpiece. It is a landmark film in many respects. It has a wonderful cast of characters. Clint Eastwood is at his best, Lee van Cleef (For a few dollars more, Escape from new york) portrayed perfectly the evil one and Eli Wallach (Magnificent seven, Mackennas gold) steals the show as the Ugly. Director Sergio Leone (Dollars trilogy, Once upon a time in the west) takes his time to tell the story. He uses different types of camera angles, extreme close ups etc. The close ups are amazing. Facial expressions are very key to this movie which has very little dialogue at times. When I saw this first on a VHS as a kid, i was blown away by Ennio morricones score. I lost the count of the number of times I saw this flick. This movie is the grand daddy of all westerns.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was outstanding! Usually I do not watch Western movies, but I think I will watch more. I have seen one other movie with Clint Eastwood and in it, called the Unforgiven. I love the Unforgiven, but I felt that this movie had everything. It is really interesting to find out how the good, the bad, and the ugly are related to each other in this movie. The story is very complex and the acting is terrific. The soundtrack, by Ennio Morricone, is excellent as well; I have heard the theme music before and I never knew that it came from this movie. I also recognized the Ecstasy of Gold, which plays as an introduction for Metallica concerts. In the film, it was really interesting to learn why the good, the bad, and the ugly needed each other alive in order for them to complete the same quest: to obtain the money from the grave in the cemetery. This film has so many great quotes, such as "When you have to shoot, shoot. Don't talk." I laughed so hard at that part! It was interesting when Tuco wants justice for what Blondie did in the beginning, but later on, the two of them develop a friendship. Trust also plays a role in this film. When Tuco and Blondie put TNT on the bridge, they share secrets about which grave the money is in; however, when Tuco discovers no money in the grave, Blondie reveals that he never trusted Tuco. This is why I feel like character development plays a major role in this film; however, I feel that this film is mostly plot-driven. I could keep going on and on about this film, but I am going to end my review here. I recommend this film for anyone who is into Clinton Eastwood or Westerns.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (Italian title: Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo, lit. "The Good, the Ugly, the Bad") is a 1966 Italian epic Spaghetti Western film directed by Sergio Leone, starring Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach in the title roles respectively. The screenplay was written by Age &amp; Scarpelli, Luciano Vincenzoni, and Leone (with additional screenplay material provided by an uncredited Sergio Donati),[5] based on a story by Vincenzoni and Leone. Director of photography Tonino Delli Colli was responsible for the film's sweeping widescreen cinematography and Ennio Morricone composed the film's score, including its main theme. It was a co-production between companies in Italy, Spain, West Germany, and the United States.During the American Civil War, mercenary Angel Eyes interrogates former Confederate soldier Stevens about Bill Carson, a fugitive who stole a cache of Confederate gold. Stevens offers Angel Eyes $1,000 to kill Baker, Angel Eyes's employer. Angel Eyes accepts the contract, and kills Stevens as he leaves. Angel Eyes returns to Baker for his fee, then shoots Baker, fulfilling his contract with Stevens. Meanwhile, Mexican bandit Tuco Ramírez is rescued from three bounty hunters by "Blondie", who delivers him to the local sheriff to collect his $2,000 bounty. As Tuco is about to be hanged, Blondie shoots Tuco's noose and sets him free. The two escape on horseback and split the bounty in a lucrative money-making scheme. As Blondie grows weary of Tuco's complaints, he abandons him penniless in the desert.</fullReview>

How do I remember a baseball game, it was the night Hank Aaron was going after Babe Ruth's homerun record. Baseball or a movie. Tuned into the the baseball game, flipped to the movie -a western, cool. 'Uh, what is this no one is talking it makes no sense'. After what seemed like an eternity somebody finally spoke, Lee van Cleef. The rest is Movie History. Since then I have seen this movie well over 25 times. Numerous lines that have been etched into my memory. Forget whatever minor flaws this movie has. Put yourself in the movie. Sergio Leon, John Ford these are the people that defined "The Western". On a scale of 1-10, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is nothing less than a 10. Plop the tape into the VCR, sit back and experience a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the offset let me just say that I am not used to watching old long westerns like this, but my dad convinced me by saying son we have to watch this together. Let me tell you this is an absolute classic. This movie got me hooked into watching a series of Spaghetti Westerns. All three actors are a almost made for their respective roles, and their dialogues can be repeated in other movie but never have the same effect as they did in this movie. It was surprising for me to see the level of patience I had to to watch this long movie because there were moments where i know i would have stopped watching it. But this movie always made sure they kept the viewers interesting. Even in the last scene the director's idea of the last show down was brilliant! It kept me on my toes.All in all a must watch if you are a guy who is even remotely interested in an action movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes that's right , it is one of the greatest action movies I 've ever seen.And it stands between the years and decades from it's realize ,as a classic cult movie , a legend of the Spaghetti Western era, or I should say "the Legend".I 've seen it about 5 times and I could watch it again. Sergio Leone has a cynic way to describe life in the Wild West ,between real people ,not just heroes who save their country from the Indians, but people who fight for their own lives. And also I must mention the composer Ennio Morricone whose brilliant music matches perfectly( like a piece of a puzzle ) in Leone's scenes and make the whole movie "A Great Piece Of Art".Old school though , but I would say that word again : - "Perfect!!" - "Cut!!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint Eastwood at his best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Clint Eastwood in pretty much everyone movie he acts in or directs. He is just such a bad ass in all his movies and it makes them very enjoyable. I don't even much care for westerns but I really liked this one. It had good action and good story line. If there is something wrong with this however it is probably that it is too long. Overall I say give this one a watch if you don't mind older movies and westerns.When a movie is made in 1966 its obviously not going to have the production values of the movies these days and thats why I feel the old movies are getting lost by everyone in the new generation and im only 20 but I know none of my friends like good old movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, but far from great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't quite understand why everyone loves this movie. It's way too long and doesn't have any new revelations in plot. The simple story is about three men who all want the same thing: a buried treasure. That's it. Two of the men team up and the third guy is the villain who pursues them. So it's nothing new, but the background imagery goes all out and that's why this movie is so well known. It puts scenes like one of them crossing a bridge, right smack in the middle of the civil war. It's elaborate in settings, but anything but elaborate in plot. The characters are for the most part just okay. Then there's the ugly guy who is funny as all hell. If he wasn't a part of this movie I would have certainly disliked the film because there isn't that much great about it. That one character makes the movie and sets the tone. So this is an okay movie, not what you'd expect based on word of mouth, but not bad either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo." (1966) is epic picture in every meaning of this word. I saw it couple of times, and although i like "Unforgiven" better, "Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo." is a true western, one of the movies that make the genre famous. Acting is very good here, cinematography is amazing, directing, settings are top notch. It's a long movie, and it takes it's time to tell a full story, but it's a very rewording experience. But the scope of this movie is simply epic.Overall, "Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo." is one the best if not the best westerns ever made, it's captivating from start till finish, it's superbly crafted, well acted and combined with unforgettable musical score it's a genre classic.</fullReview>

In the vast expanses of the American mainland, three men trying to reach a treasure ... buried with a fallen war. And everyone of them will use similar methods of character. The Bad (Lee Van Cleef) will torture and kill. The Ugly (Eli Wallach) will treat the cunning and treachery. And The Good (Clint Eastwood) uses his mind, the cynical humor and his amazing ability to spin. The scale will sometimes leans to one and sometimes in the other direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so good I have to watch it every 5 years. It tells an epic spaghetti western tale of the lone rider and his battle for good against absolute evil and the general pollution of the ugly. As a western with civil war background there is no lack of action. Just see it because you can't simply describe this movie.From the first scene where you are introduced to the depravity of the ugly, this movie grips your attention. Then, there is the roller coaster of evil characters to wade through. Finally, there is the ultimate cowboy shootout with Leone's great use of eyes to convey the battle to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest Western Films ever made that stands tall even today.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest Western Films ever made that stands tall even today.There is an element of thrill right form the first frame till the last in this film. Mind you, this has a running time of nearly 3 hours (177 minutes to be precise). Thus, the greatness can be attributed to the fact that this film keeps a viewer engaged for such a long time. I watched this film a couple of time before and was always awed by the technical aspects of this film. When I finished watching it just now, I was thinking how a small story can be made into a grand script and then into a magnum opus too. It takes the vision of a director and his team. Sergio Leone definitely had that.The music is iconic from Ennio Morricone and the theme music is great and the soundtrack is just terrific. The cinematography which was done as a cinema scope film in the desert and wastelands of New Mexico state is just amazing. Technically this film is flawless I must say and there is a touch of greatness too. Yes, this is taking forward the good work done in an earlier film "For A Few Dollars More". But the grandeur is something that's enticing. The characterization is slick and straight, it's not complicated but very simple. Good plays good and Bad plays bad while Ugly struggles to be something in between. Ugly is perhaps the most interesting character in the three who does a wonderful job. Eli Wallach as Ugly is just impeccable.Clint Eastwood, who plays the Hero is a master of style and he shows it here. With minimal dialog and mostly through the looks of his eyes, he conveys a lot. From the way he lights his Cigar to the way he triggers his gun, his style is unmatchable and indeed inspiring. I suppose, his style is replicated by many actors later.Sergio Leone, has given one of the best cowboy films indeed. Also, he has given one of the finest films in terms of characterization, style, cinematography and music. I loved it and this film will be there and watched over by many generations. A 5/5 for this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest movie i have ever seen!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the last and the best installment of his so-called "Dollars" trilogy of Sergio Leone-directed "spaghetti westerns," Clint Eastwood reprised the role of a taciturn, enigmatic loner. Here he searches for a cache of stolen gold against rivals the Bad (Lee Van Cleef), a ruthless bounty hunter, and the Ugly (Eli Wallach), a Mexican bandit. Though dubbed "the Good," Eastwood's character is not much better than his opponents -- he is just smarter and shoots faster. The film's title reveals its ironic attitude toward the canonized heroes of the classical western. "The real West was the world of violence, fear, and brutal instincts," claimed Leone. "In pursuit of profit there is no such thing as good and evil, generosity or deviousness; everything depends on chance, and not the best wins but the luckiest."</fullReview>

The movie was a bit slow. It is highly predictable and runs the gamut of a typical western. I don't believe that most people under the age of 25 will appreciate the movie. It does seem to have a timeless enjoyment factor in it. It's enjoyable landscapes, scenes, costuming, and gunfights do make it a timeless western. Clint Eastwood's performance is stellar like always. He alone makes the movie worth watching. This is a movie you can watch it again and again and still enjoy. It does not require intensive viewing nor is it a nail biter. Instead, a passive viewing works. The scenery, landscapes and the acting of Clint Eastwood will involve you enough to enjoy the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most overrated movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't say this is the most overrated movie ever made. There are many movies which are considered among the best ever by the majority of people that are as overrated as this one is. However, that this is one of the most overrated of all time, no one can deny that.I hate westerns. However, considering the fame of this one, the fact that it is in most lists of the all time's greatest movies, the fact of being a Spanish-Italian production and the value that most people give it (including this guy who is a friend of mine, who owns the movie and loaned it to me), I decided to give it a look, even though its long runtime could easily scare me off.I know that its Italian title is 'Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo', but I don't know if it was filmed in English language and later dubbed in Italian or the contrary, although I believe it was filmed in English.This spaghetti western was directed by Sergio Leone and stars Clint Eastwood as Blondie ("The Good"), Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes ("The Bad") and Eli Wallach as Tuco ("The Ugly").To be frank, the character Tuco annoyed me very much, not to mention that he was worst than snakes. Angel Eyes was nowhere near as annoying, being a more likable character in comparison. Blondie is a more complicated character. He's supposed to be the good guy yet he teams with Tuco during most of the movie and actually saves him twice from his execution rope (including in the end, when he was supposed to kill him). He kills Angel Eyes, yet he doesn't kill Tuco - and after everything that Tuco did to him. He is not that good after all...There's some good in this movie but I saw far more of bad and ugly in it. There is brutal violence in this. Plus, the movie is way too long. And it doesn't really offer much during its runtime of nearly 3 hours.Certain sequences were filmed in a way that strongly resembles me '2001: A Space Odyssey'. The first 9-10 minutes are a good example of this. The opening is long and has music, there is no dialog, the slow pace of the scenes gives us time to appreciate the scenario. Another good example of this is the Mexican standoff scene that lasts 5 minutes near the ending when the 3 main characters stare each other down in the graveyard's circular center, calculating alliances and dangers (and the amazing distance which the camera films it).The famous film score by Ennio Morricone (who is a genius, like John Williams) is phenomenal, especially the spectacular and unforgettable main theme. But the music that plays when Tuco is running in the Sad Hill cemetery is equally memorable.I didn't know that this movie was part of a trilogy, much less that it was the 3rd one. I also thought it was from the 50's, not the 60's. Anyway, none of that matters. This movie didn't do anything for me. Is this one of the all time's greatest movies? Absolutely not!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good, The Savage, and the Ugly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to add much to the very long list of reviews on this one, except to point out that I've never seen anyone critique the title. "Bruto" is not "bad". It's more "animalistic", literally "brute". So, I think "savage" is the best match. It's MUCH better than "bad". I know this genre has many titles and they seldom translate directly, but Sergio Leone's were always literally translated, so I think it's an issue.I'll also add that for purists of the "every Marxist on the block in Rome in the mid '60s wanted to make a Western"- particularly the Zapatista sub-genre of this filone, this is not the best. It's solidly in the top 10 and most of our top 5, but those that put it at #1 usually don't rate the political content as highly as the style.I rated it a 9- it has plenty of political content and true pasta western themes. I have nothing against it, and do really enjoy it. But not as much as Companeros. It's a statement, but not like The Great Silence. Good character development, but not like The Big Gundown.The trilogy is, without doubt, though, about the most important movies ever made. That's history, not opinion. When people diss the hundreds that came in the following years they seldom note that at least 50 of those are pretty good, not ones you'd want to live without seeing, and none of them would exist without these three.So, could we at least refer to it accurately?</fullReview>

The film unfolds with a backdrop of the civil war and some of the battle scenes are beautifully shown with great cinematography,how much more may one ask for?Wallach steals the acting here as a cunning, sly, vicious character who along with the Van Cleef character, see killing as nothing providing they can get their hands on the $200,000 quantity of gold. Wallach, with the look of a ferret, is most convincing here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You see, there are two types of people in this world; those who make Spaghetti Westerns, and Sergio Leone. Leone, the king of the Spaghetti Western, and one of the all time greatest filmmakers truly outdoes himself with his classic, 'The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly'. With this installment of the "Dollars" trilogy, during the Civil War, we find Blondie (Clint Eastwood), "the man with no name", in a not so morally sound partnership with an outlaw/bandit, Tuco (Eli Wallach). The two characters go from town to town performing a genius scheme that is Blondie catching Tuco and turning him in for money, and then setting him free the day of the execution. They split the reward and prosper, until one day Blondie ends the partnership, causing Tuco to begin a hunt for Blondie, until they cross paths with deadly bounty killer, Angel Eyes. Now its a three man witch hunt, and to make matters worse, they all get word of buried Union gold. Now a race for buried gold, and vengeance, is underway as the three men will do anything to prosper. With classic Leone intense close-ups, shootouts, and unique dialogue. 'The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly' is one for the ages, and will forever go down as one of the most phenomenal films in history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good, yes, but imo not at the level that most reviewers seem to have put it.As ever, Sergio Leone has created a bit of a masterpiece greatly enhanced by the music of Morricone. The music and film play in the final graveyard scene probably stand shoulder to shoulder with anything else produced in film history.The main minuses: Good, Bad and Ugly does not accurately describe the main characters. None were good, and Tuco imo was easily the most bad. Probably should not make too much of this, but it makes the title deceptive.The film is too long. Whilst the storyline is sprawling, some scenes could have been cut back timewise and maybe even omitted.I found Tuco annoying, and it was out of character for Monco to let him live.I preferred For a Few Dollars More in the trilogy, and certainly think Once Upon a Time in the West is far superior.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Movie, But Had Some Annoying Flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just want to make a quick few comments here. I know this film is highly rated and people love it. And yeah, I found it enjoyable. I like a good shooter film with Clint Eastwood. But it seemed flawed and people are quick to forgive here where they don't elsewhere.The historical accuracy of the film is the biggest problem, with guns that are incorrect for the period, and the really strange suggestion that the North fought the South in this region... which, really, just didn't happen. I liked the drunk military man, but it wasn't realistic.The dubbing was annoying. Clint Eastwood speaks English and he speaks to a variety of characters who are speaking Italian. Okay, one or the other. Hire actors who speak English or get Italians and subtitle the film. It's awkward to have Eastwood talking to people who, on the set, who probably didn't understand.Lastly, I need more Lee VanCleef. If he's "the bad", he should have a bigger role. Instead you have mostly Eastwood, who is "the good", being just as bad as the villain. I respect the idea that good and evil are not clear-cut, but why do I side with Eastwood if he's no more good than VanCleef? That being said, the film had a lot going for it. Very fun shooter, great bridge explosion scene (possibly better than "River Kwai") and the very memorable theme song. As far as Westerns go, I don't know that it was really much more advanced than "Stagecoach". Maybe more epic and longer, and Eastood can out-act John Wayne any day, but there wasn't much new here.I recommend this and feel I need to see it again, but perhaps see "For a Few Dollars More" first... that will give you some VanCleef action and Klaus Kinski.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I read most of the reviews on the board for over two weeks now. I am dismayed by the amount of viewers who give this a 10/10 and say nothing poignant or useful. Similarly, ones who give it a 1/10 just say it's overrated. I will try to give depth to why I give this movie a 7/10. The cinematography is spectacular; this movie really does contain some of the best shots I have and ever will see in a movie. The length does not bother me, although there are certainly a few scenes that could have been cut down like the final showdown or some of the Civil War scenes. Now the plot. And here arrives the main problem. Historically and contextually, almost all the weapons and battle scenes are out of their time and place in history. I'm sorry, but I can't award a movie a 10/10 for messing up so many basic historical facts. Besides that, there are scenes that just don't mesh well, and I believe the film is somewhat poor on its pacing such as the scene in the monastery vs. the civil war bridge scene. The acting is decent, but seriously how much depth can any of the actors give with these one sided characters. And here, the next problem arises: The characters themselves have NO depth. One is ugly and greedy, the other is bad and....wicked, the last one is good...and a good shot. There's nothing else about them! At least in some of his other movies like A Fistful of Dollars or Once Upon a Time in the West, all the characters are multi-faceted. Moving right along, the production is fairly decent, but how does it help with so many historical errors? The music......is not that good. I have never understood why so many people think it's amazing. It's very simple and....rather childish to be blunt. Sergio Leone is certainly a qualified and somewhat talented director, but this is not his best movie or even one of his better ones. For a good Leone movie, check out Once Upon a Time in the West. That's my favorite. Again, this is not a bad movie, just not "the best western" or "one of the greatest films ever made".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing end to a fine trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" is a curiously unsatisfying conclusion to Leone's memorable "Man With No Name" trilogy. For starters, it is hideously overlong. The sheer number of fights and battles puts it in the mold of a stinker like "Star Trek: Nemesis." The tedious Civil War subplot keeps resurfacing like an unwelcome guest; it is entirely unnecessary except as heavy-handed anti-war commentary. Even Morricone's musical score is greatly inferior to his earlier efforts: it's more like parody Morricone, with that irritating bird-call repeated so many times as to be almost unbearable.For those who consider "non-stop action" to be an asset rather than a liability, please ignore everything I've said here; you'll join the millions who love this movie. But for anyone who started the trilogy with this bloated, gaudy fight-fest: Don't give up! The earlier films -- "A Fistful of Dollars" ("Yojimbo" remake) and the very fine "For a Few Dollars More" -- are well worth seeing. Each movie stands alone; the only constant is The Man With No Name himself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint was on a tear in the 60s with his spaghetti westerns. He proved a washed-up American TV idol could reinvent himself successfully and end up rich enough to make splatter movies for decades before doing a few artsy films for fun. I'm unsure of his politics, but the man has to have bad dreams always. I detested them when they came out; now, I find them amusingly quaint considering how vulgarly violent the newer films have gotten. Unfortunately, these films brought about the disintegration of morals/manners in the world, an antihero crazy society and the notion that only very wealthy people can make a film anymore. They are essentially a very bad thing for humanity, but there's no turning back now.Eli, Eli, what made you think you could pull off a Mexican accent/persona? You are a joke. The NYC grit is still there but mixed with spicese, it becomes a very bad scene. Your tristate accent cannot be squelched. You sound like you're about to hail a cab at any second. And you're just not mean enough, dear. You're basically a teddy bear and it shows. Did you owe Eastwood a favor or did he offer you a bundle? It's very sad because your performance drags down what might have been a more interesting film.</fullReview>

Why does the Ugly keeps waiting patiently before killing the Blondie for something miraculous saving the Blondie every time!The 3 stooges(Good, Bad and especially the Ugly) walk through the open spaces as if they are covered head-to-toe with an invisible, impregnable shield and no bullet will touch them!

		<shortDescription>note on bad English dubbing for the DVD collector's set</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just seen this movie in it's complete form and I have mixed feelings about it. Here are the good points and bad points (no ugly points cause it's still a great picture and no pun intended.)The bad: The major problem with the English track is the additional dubbing for the new scenes; they stand out like sore thumb. Sure it's the voices of Eastwood and Wallach, but (the movie being forty years old)there voices have changed, Eastwood's voice has a lower pitch while wallach's is higher; I don't even want to go into Van Cleef's dubbing(he passed on so they brought in an impersonator to do his dialog). the dubbing quality for these new scenes are also not as good. I assume the original English dub was done in Italy. Even though the sync in audio and image was not perfect it's still one the best English dub tracks I've ever heard for motion picture. The Good: All hope is not lost however since MGM decided to include the original Italian mono track. Watching the film with this track makes the viewing experience a whole lot better.the restored scenes are better with this track as well since the Italian version was shown in its entirety when it opened in 1966. It does take some time to get used to watching it in this way (eg reading subtitles). Until we see a new edition that gives us a US and Italian cut of the film I would give this DVD marginal recommendation (or rent it just to see what it's like). The original DVD edition, with the cut US version, should still be for sale in some places so if you are a purist (or a nostalgic) you can still get that one at least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish and entertaining but drags badly too often</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two men have a partnership ? one (the good) pretends to capture the other (the ugly) claiming the reward before rescuing him from his sentence. When the two have a falling out they spare each other simply because they both know part of the location of hidden confederate gold. Meanwhile a corrupt soldier is also hunting for the location of the gold or anyone who may know where it is.Routinely heralded as one of the greatest westerns ever made, I must admit to always feeling a little disappointed by this film whenever I watch it. However I always then assume that it is a classic and come back to watch it again! There is no denying that the film is very stylish and very memorable but it's main problem is in it's basic plot not being long enough to justify such a luxurious running time. This results in the film really dragging at several points ? this is not a major problem but I did wonder why it could not have been edited to suit it's spaghetti style.The music and action is much imitated and well known to even those who have not yet seen the film. The closing stand-off is fantastic and the music throughout can only be described as iconic. The film does manage to cover 180 minutes well but I just had an issue with it's very wandering nature and the fact that it does drag a bit.The cast is all good. Some of the support is badly dubbed but I always found that to add to the character of the film rather than be an annoyance. Eastwood had a hard time on the set but still delivers a really good performance ? the type which made his name in this type of film. Wallach has the biggest role as Ugly and is very good in an unsympathetic role. Van Cleef is a good Bad and is a cool foil for Eastwood.Overall I always enjoy this film but would draw the line at putting it as high up the top 50 list as it usually appears to be. The film is iconic in so many ways but I just don't like the way that it seems to drag at several points ? it could easily benefit from losing 20 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Classic Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you were looking for the classic western, this would probably have to be it. Sergio Leone's stylish genre piece has all the ingredients that every western needs, and the title of the movie describes those ingredients very well."The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly", respectively Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach, make up the trio of tough 'old west' characters. Each of them is searching for $200 000 in gold which is buried in a grave. The three are spot on with their portrayal of the desperate outlaws.Visually the movie is great, and it's also marvelously photographed, while Ennio Morricone's moody score is fantastic. A movie in which everything works, even though it's quite long.Saturday, February 13, 1993 - Video</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I fell asleep twice. Yes, it was a pretty good movie. Yes, the music was, um, great. No, this was not the best movie ever. Why? Because the story is still just ho hum, western.The most redeeming part of the story is the way the Civil War gets in the way of the three main characters. But Eastwood's famous line about "So many lives wasted for so little" or whatever it was, sounded pretty meaningless, not to mention unreal, coming from a killer for money. Was that "The Good" talking to us, or just the movie maker?I'll call it a Great Western, but too long. "Unforgiven" is much more appealing to my tastes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>slightly histrionic and very tedious - cleef is great though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If it were not for Cleef's great pacing and character or Eastwood's humorous character development, this film would be considered a great failure (at least it would be in my humble opinion). the humor, the camera work, and the music, make this worth watching at least once.Unfortunately though, whatever pleasures one gains from the acting, is lost because Leone could not control himself when it came excessively long cuts. While he was clever and original in his cinematography and direction, his films would be much more tolerable had he spent some time studying under Hitchcock when it came to editing. Scenes that probably would have been 3 minutes during "A Fistful" became 6 minutes in "Few Dollars More" and 20 in "Good the Bad and the Ugly".Yes, the story is great, as it was in Few Dollars More, but the payoff in the cemetery at the end (while clever) is just not worth the price of excruciatingly long scenes of eyes and melodrama. Pale Rider and Josey Wales, even in their lamest moments, put this one to shame at its best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Isn't The Same Now, But Still Love The Soundtrack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually, the more I see a film the more I learn to appreciate it. Here's the opposite: I really enjoyed this when it came it at the theater. It made such an impression that I remember where exactly I saw this film, and I enjoyed it on TV a few other times afterward. Now, 40 years later my opinion of it is not the same. The only aspect that I still have a high regard for in here in the music, now considered probably one of the "classic" soundtracks.However, the three main characters - the men who dominate this film - played by Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef - are really nothing but overly crude and excessively violent morons. The worst, of course, is Wallach's "Taco." He makes me want to take a shower after watching this film! He and Eastwood's "Blondie" just take turns brutalizing each other through much of the film. Van Cleef's role is considerably less, as "Sentzenza" or "Angel Eyes."Wallach's character is just plain insulting. He is a real lowlife and a horrible witness for anyone of the Catholic faith, which is why they probably emphasize the latter with him genuflecting throughout the film while acting like a complete degenerate. It's another slam on that denomination (of which I am not a member, by the way).I usually like Director Sergio Leone's long, dramatic, slow shots and good facial closeups Leone keeps his camera so long on one subject that it gets boring. So, there is a rarely a happy medium in this movie: it's either too violently stupid or too slow. What was once "good" has now turned "bad" and "ugly."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Long, Too Slow , Just Watchable. Sorry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really couldn't understand most of the reviews here that place this film as a great western or even the best ever for some fans. In my opinion this is just a watchable and good western, but not much more than that.I think the only possible explanation would be that IMDb reviewers consider "spaghetti" westerns a sub-genre within the western genre. If that is so, "The Good, The Bad and the Ugly" would probably stand among the best (if not the best)in the "spaghetti" westerns ranking. But the point is that in my opinion there are no sub-genres within the western genre. So I analyze this film just for what it is: a western film.In such terms, this film has its moments, fine open-wide outdoor locations, good action gunfights (though hardly believable) and an acceptable plot. Good acting too mainly in Eli Wallach's Tuco.But what really demerits this movie is its incredibly unnecessary overrun; there's no way the story can stand almost 3 hours in duration and so the development is definitely slow. Overruning has always been a characteristic of director Sergio Leone; he sort of engages madly with some sequences and he goes on and on and on at it (the final duel here is an example with all those unnecessary close shots in the men's faces and eyes). Another clear sample of what I'm saying was the incredibly long -and even boring- opening sequence of "Once Upon a Time in the West", where Leone takes more than 10 minutes in the opening sequence where three gunmen are waiting for Charles Bronson at a train station.Come on guys, let's face it. "Spaghetti" westerns are "B" movies and even if at the very start they could have seemed sort of original and somehow enjoyable, once you take an honest critical look at them they're not great films but just good a few of them but no more than that. Sorry again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the sad little world of critical reviews, both professional and written by jobless house-husbands, the words "MASTERPIECE" and "CLASSIC" are always used to mask any disappointments a film may have. When you go to a fine restaurant and spend half your paycheck on a piece of meat, you unconsciously force yourself into denial that that piece of meat is the best you've ever eaten. Even if you would have been more content with McDonald's. Why? Because you just spent half your paycheck on it, and some French guy somewhere says it's fine meat, thus you have to agree. You HAVE to. You're unwilling to admit your disappointment. You tell yourself that your taste buds just aren't evolved enough, even though that is just stupid. It works the same way with movies. Once you've seen 500 pages of perfect reviews, read that the film received 100% rating from professional critics, admitting to yourself that you weren't content with the film isn't easy. It's even harder to admit it to other people. It's nearly impossible to write a review stating it. This opening paragraph can apply to thousands of movies. But this is how I felt about The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. It wasn't bad, but it lacked the full contentment I expected.Emphasis on story/plot has died out over the years. In 2009, top critics put only slightly more emphasis on it as they put on the color of the main character's shirt. Perhaps this is why we see movies, forget about them, go see another one just like the last one, forget about it: repeat the same hollow cycle until we die. Aristotle put story at the center of all fictional work; modern critics put cinematography and acting at the center. Whether you side with an ancient dead guy or bitter middle-aged men devoid of sex lives, it's hard to deny that the latter mindset just leads to pretty moving pictures and eventually is completely forgettable. That is the main flaw I had with The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.While this film has purely awesome moving pictures (more on that later), the plot is weak. In fact, it's so weak and so predictable that I found that I could quickly care less about anything happening. For the film's credit, I will say that the predictable linier plot did have some quirky variation, and added scenes that you wouldn't normally expect in a Western. However, the fact that the driving force of this epic film is nothing but a cliché treasure hunt is the reason I found it so lacking. Couldn't the writers have been a little more creative? If they had been, this would have been an absolute perfect film. If they had been, there would be nothing for me to criticize. Even those who already find this a perfect film, can you really deny that a little more creativity would have made it even more perfect? Furthermore, the Civil War scenes pumped an even more annoying vibe into The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly because they were just copy/pasted from generic war films. They added nothing but another layer of seen-this-thousand-times to a generic plot that was already getting annoying because I've seen it a thousand times. And none of this criticism is from a modern standpoint. Everything I just criticized was unoriginal in its time.What was good was the ugly. You've read this part in hundreds of other reviews, so I'm not going to take much time here. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly perfected true grit like never before. That's where the credit lies. From rugged faces to rugged deserts to rugged clothing to rugged buildings to rugged camera style, nothing was left of the sanitized world we live in. Some people criticize the realism of this and the realism of other aspects of the film, to which I say: I just don't care. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly can be taken as a mature fantasy set in a overdone western world?what's wrong with that? People also criticize the film by saying it's not as good as its prequels, which is a matter of taste. However, it isn't a matter of taste that the prequels didn't even come close to the epic scope or raw grit of this film. They didn't have the brutal nihilism of the characters. They were more polished, with tight conventional plotting and less overt backdrops.Another incorrect criticism of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is that it is nothing but a macho, quirky, masculinity-fest with no bearing on the realistic world. Those people make me laugh. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly pretty much singlehandedly brought the nameless antihero into cinema. While this character really gets annoying in modern films, he works here because he was one of the first, as well as one of the best. While I will agree that he has little bearing on real life, it's the secondary characters that break the cliché. The title of the film as well as the film itself both illustrate the opposite that the typical period western would illustrate: the world is not black-and-white. Good doesn't always win. People can stand on both sides of the moral line. Good guys can do immoral things. It's here that the true underline genius comes out, because this is something even modern filmmakers don't understand.Overall, there is nothing I can say to shake people from the belief that The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is the best film ever made. Be it due to nostalgia, or be it due to a level of depth I missed, I can't change that. I'm not trying to. But I just want to say that The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is typical in some aspects. In others, it's legend. I just refuse to give it a perfect score because it's a supposed "CLASSIC".6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A preposterous Italian rewrite of the Civil War starts my list of what is wrong with this movie, followed by plot grotesqueries, e.g. Van Cleef becoming the commandant of a prison camp with no explanation? I'm appalled that this film is ranked among the top ten movies, not just westerns, of all time by the voters on this site. Just goes to prove that the internet isn't going to raise the level of collective consciousness, as if anyone wondered. Eli Wallach chews the scenery, like always, and Van Cleef plays the same character he has played in everything he's been in, so what's new? Eastwood was at least handsome in this flick, but just as wooden-faced as you would expect Dirty Harry to be if he were wearing a dusty serape. At least A Fistful of Dollars was a remake of the classic Yojimbo, and A Few Dollars More didn't have gross historical inaccuracies, so I'd have to rate them a few points higher. These are, however, comic books on the screen, and as such don't reach quite the level of the Batman or Spiderman flicks. More like XMen. Shallow, bad acting, pointless violence, and random cruelty to sate the Neanderthal appetite are the mainstay of all of Leone's spaghetti westerns, and this movie is the worst of the lot in that regard.</fullReview>

This gray, sandy, grainy landscape illustrates the film's misery best of all - it is not captivating, nor does it manage to hold attention for a speck of time.

		<fullReview>After the impressive For A Few Dollars More, director Sergio Leone reunited once again for the third and final time with Clint Eastwood for this chapter in the Dollars trilogy. And to call it disappointing would be an understatement. Why the hell people praise this so much is anyone's guess. The movie is an overlong, dull, pretentious mess with no plot, no substance and hardly any action. The only good things about the movie were Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes (who was underused) and Eli Wallach as Tuco (even though he didn't convince as a Mexican), and some of the music. Scenes are padded out at ridiculous length for absolutely no reason. And the tone of the film. Is it a spoof? Is it a black comedy? Well it fails at both. The tone is all over the place and there's just no realism anywhere but it's played out as if the audience is supposed to be taking it's plot seriously. In one sequence, Van Cleef sits across the dinner table intending to kill a man if he doesn't give him any information and the man just sits there fearing for his and his family's life with a gun around his waist. He doesn't even attempt to kill Van Cleef, even though he has a chance. And Clint Eastwood (who I usually like) just sleepwalks through the film as if he as an invisible shield around him, and the scenes where is life is saved twice from the hands of Tuco (right on cue) are beyond stupid. I like a story, especially in an epic movie, not just characters roaming around and bumping into each other. Which is exactly what happens. The whole movie is a series of coincidences thrown together to try and create a plot. The events that happen are illogical and farcical. Eastwood and Wallach do a bounty hunting scam in the same town as Van Cleef, who is looking for a man who knows the whereabouts of some gold. Then Eastwood ditches Wallach and Wallach tracks him down. Later they just happen to come across the same soldier Van Cleef is looking for about the gold. Some time later, they are captured and just happen to be put in an army camp where Van Cleef (now as a soldier too) also is. The contrived situations go on. It's lazy writing, episodic and laughable the way the movie progresses.Even the so-called classic three way climatic shootout is dull beyond words and what actually happens when the fingers finally hit the triggers doesn't justify the five minutes you have to sit through waiting for it because the outcome is predictable from the start. One of the most overrated, over-inflated and poorly constructed movies ever.</fullReview>

I came into the movie knowing it was long, but was told it was worth it. That statement caused me to waste 3 hours of my life. Anyway, on to the reasons why it was a waste. The movie itself had a decent storyline. The problem with this movie, however, was that it is the longest, drawn out movie known to mankind. This movie could have been played out in literally 20 minutes based on what all happened in the movie. Instead, viewers get to wait 30 minutes while it shows Clint Eastwood crawl 20 feet through the sand not saying a word. Against my better judgment, I continue watching, waiting for something spectacular to happen in the end. As the end approaches, viewers get to wait through yet another drawn out scene, of 3 men standing in a triangle pointing guns at each other. After, 10 minutes of watching that, I lost interest of who was going to die anyway. It literally switches cameras more times than I can count. Then, the finale comes. That is when I comprehend just how much time had been lost in this movie.

		<fullReview>There is something amusing about the Italian fascination with the wild West, the absurd over-the-top score, the cheesy sound effects (at one point, one of the bandits sounds like he's walking across a marble floor in high heels), even the obsessive closeups of Eli Wallach's dentition. Less amusing is the relentless glorification of brutality and exaltation of greed--I can watch the NFL any time, I don't need a movie for that.The campy fun of this movie is dampened by the knowledge that it has somehow been mistaken for a classic. All the characters are pretty equally repellent, unless you count Clint's gesture of giving his coat to a dying man 2 hours into the movie...in fact, this seems to be the only point where the movie even considers anything resembling humane values, and it's really not enough.And the title is mistranslated. In English, "the X," where X is an adjective, doesn't refer to an individual who is X, it refers to a class of people, and is always plural. The movie should have been "Good, Bad, and Ugly" or "The Good One, the Bad One, and the Ugly One."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (Sergio Leone, 1967)There are a number of great things about this movie. The first ten minutes. The last ten minutes. The theme music, which has come to be synonymous with the American west. Lee van Cleef, who was great in every role he ever played.And then there was the middle hundred sixty minutes.There's an odd tendency among filmmakers to take a razor-thin plot and stretch it far too long. Such is the case here, with the plot being a race between the Man with No Name (Clint Eastwood), a hired gun named Angel Eyes (van Cleef), and the Man with No Name's on-again off-again sidekick Tuco (Eli Wallach) to find a cache of stolen gold during the Civil War. This plot meanders for two and three-quarters hours before getting on track, and that's about an hour and three-quarters too long. The subplots are never developed, nor are the characters. Tuco switches allegiances every ten minutes. After a while, it gets just plain boring.Definitely could have used a good editor. Eastwood's westerns got better with age (his, not theirs); Unforgiven and Pale Rider are better, tighter films. **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good it isn't only bad and ugly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good the Bad and the Ugly is one of the most overrated movies ever made. It's considered a classic because of Ennio Morricone iconic theme and because it has Clint Eastwood in it. The plot what plot. There is not consistent plot. Only action scenes upon action scenes pieced together to create a three hour long bore fest. I think I would rather take the three hour tour in Gillian's Island and get shipwrecked on a island then watch this turd again. It's as if Sergio Leone who made a masterpiece with Once Upon a Time in the West and another great film in Fistful of Dollars went to his screenwriter and said lets make a film with many showcased action sequences and piece them together with our twenty page screenplay. The result a paper thin, very thin story with no solid characterization or development.The movie is more like the adventures of the man with no name and his annoying nerdy partner Tuco who can't shut the hell up. The pair play one another in con games, shootouts, duels, and other antics. They both happen to fall upon a deserted stage wagon full of dead men where they learn the secret to ones fate of hidden gold. They both end up in a Civil War prison camp, right in the middle of a Civil War battle and other clueless adventures in a story that might have been written by a couple of adolescents. Just one adventure after another that has nothing to do with telling a strong story. This film is like a clumsy, sloppy serial with no motivation by any of the characters involved.The one thing that make Sergio Leone films so great is the style and action. The action sequences in the film are dull and not the least bit engaging. The Civil War battles look way too much like a World War battle. The duels and showdowns that were so thrilling and fun to watch in the previous two films I mentioned are drawn out here in very long and tiresome sequences. Especially the duel climax which is almost laughable which consists of endless and endless shots of eyes, guns, expressions. The whole thing last for a total of 5 minutes and after it ends the viewer like me is not excited, but more relieved that it's over. Any longer I would of fast forwarded it. Other sequences such as showdowns in western towns are mere cartoonish and over the top.Even Leone's style of film-making isn't impressive. There are some shots that amuse me, especially the desert sequence which had artistic look to it. However, because of so many drawn out long boring sequences I really start losing focus on the art of film-making and really don't care anymore about this shot or that shot. That's not the case in Once Upon a Time in the West or Fistful of Dollars.As for the characters in the film. Clint Eastwood's portrayal of the man with no name is no longer mysterious or cool like he was in Fistful of Dollars. I've never seen the second man with no name film. In this film he's more of a spoof. Talks very little, but he's way to silly and not serious enough. As for Elliah Wallach his role of Tuco is way too comic and not the least bit intimating. He's also extremely annoying and he's also ugly. As for Lee Van Cliff his turn as Angel Eyes is the only character that I somewhat enjoyed. He played the part well with his narrow eyes, but he was in far too little of the film.Too sum it all up I'm extremely disappointed at the final result of this film. So many people love it. I don't know why. My theory is that the ones who love it are too dumb to realize why they like it and don't know what a great film is. Once Upon a Time in the West is a great film and so is Fistful of Dollars. I've seen The Good the Bad and the Ugly three times now and every time I watch it I hate more and more. A masterpiece I think not. More like a turdpiece!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is certainly one of the most over rated movies of all time- I just saw it again-not lousy, but pretty boring How many hours can you spend looking at close ups of faces-eyes squinting? It just drags- No plot development, just a bunch of gimmicks Hey- How does Lee VanC suddenly become a Sargent in the Union Army? ETC !!! The music is a bit better than a 30's John Wayne epic but certainly not great- Leone did some good stuff later-but he used the faults of this thing to learn and correct himself- Clint E was in a interview about the movie before it was shown(on TMC) He was a older than in the movie, but a lot younger than we know him now He said Leone taught &amp; showed him many skills-it shows!So see it, but don't expect that much</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>most overrated film in cinema history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just want to say that I don't hate this movie or am I making a statement here just to make a statement. It just seems like everyone is jumping on the "10 out of 10" bandwagon, and id like to be the few to give my two cents about a movie may be flashy, but has no depth and is poorly crafted. My main complaint with this movie is Leone's ineptitude for blending tones, which sway between high camp and western sensationalism. He mixes them so awkwardly that one's not sure what is supposed to be funny or what is supposed to be serious. For instance, when tuco is trying force information about the gold out of the dying men in the crashed train, the slow death scenes are so melodramatic and over-the-top that I couldn't help but laugh, but I wasn't sure if I was supposed to be laughing or I was really mocking it. The plot is interesting but the story is badly structured and feels all over the place (the scenes where tuco is torturing blonde before he tries to kill him really tried my patience). The characters aren't dimensionalized either and for a 3hour movie I would like to know a little more about them than the fact that one is bad, one is good, and one is ugly (and one really doesn't know what that means... Blonde did some bad things in the movie and yet he was labeled "good" and I have no clue as to why Tuco is ugly?). What keeps u wake till the bitter end is Leone's bravura and his passion. Despite the fact that his directing is inept, u definitely feel that he loves these characters and the movie he's making. The romantic score, the fast cutting, the grand sense of battle, the frontier, and adventure all feel like the great fantasy of 4 year old who grew up mesmerized by the stories and the personas of cowboys and Indians. So overall, Leone allows u to watch him play along, but u don't get the sense that he let's u play along with him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst in the series of excellent "Speghetti Westerns"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, unlike the two previous ("A Fist Full of Dollars" and "For a Few Dollars More"), is borish, long, contrived, and for once, the "Man without a Name" is anything but a good guy. In this movie he's a liar, a thief and is more interested in money; compare this to the first movie where he is more of a quiet hero who ends up giving his money away to a girl, her husband and son and leaves town with nothing more than he came in with (although the town is cleaned up) and the second where, although less of a benefactor, he helps take down a vicious madman. The story is a rampant anti-war film made in 1966, right when the war in Vietnam was really heating up. The last two movies did not make themselves allegories (which rarely hold up as good classics over time) but rather well crafted short stories made into movies.Do yourself a favor and skip "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly". It's one of those things where, until you see the movie, you won't realize how much worse the dialogue, pace and tempo is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How did Eastwood ever make it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is obviously for immature and uneducated males. I could only watch about 20 minutes of it before becoming thoroughly disgusted. I suppose the creators of this film were aiming for that audience, since the dialogue is sparse and what there is of it is very juvenile. I've not seen many things with Eastwood that varied from this however. If you are into gratuitous violence and bloodshed, then this film certainly has that. There were so many non-continuities and unbelievable twists in the short portion of the film I watched that the entire film must contain a record number. I noted that there were more than two hours left of this thing when I switched to something more enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Angel Eyes (Lee van Cleef) is a very cool bad guy. Blondie (Eastwood) seems quietly bemused throughout, as if he knows, as do we, that he will prevail. Tuco (Eli Wallach) is hilarious if one-dimensional (he's greed personified). But what the heck is the deal with that excruciatingly long and pointless Civil War battle excursion? It made no sense whatsoever. The context of the film had already been established earlier, when Blondie and Tuco are put into a POW camp (and meet up with Angel Eyes -- moving the plot forward), but this scene is worthless. All of a sudden, any momentum that the film might have had is diffused by this "statement" that war is meaningless. It is as obvious as an Oliver Stone film, and as off-putting. By the time the film gets back on track, one finds it difficult to care, and the three way showdown between the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, with its long shifting eyeball shots, plays like a satire on the classical western. If that is the point, then why is the majority of the film up to that point played straight?Other Sergio Leone films are better than this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is western, my friends.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hi everybody ! This film is just another "western". What is "western" ? We know that Americans adore money. Tons of money is their American dream. And they'd kill anybody who has big money. That's in their history, that's in their ? art also, if I can say "art". So, this is another piece of "art" showing you during more than 2 hours how they kill for money. Only personality of Mr. Eastwood and couple of non-standard scenes differs this chewing gum from thousands of others. Americans also invented such an "art" genres like horror, thriller etc. Also about killers and money. And ? don't forget ? they made Hollywood !!!, which produces on our heads with this "art" for a whole XX and XXI century. And they estimates these pieces of "art" 10 out of 10 here and anywhere. All that things made that real cinema art ? like Pasolini, Fassbinder, Bunuel etc. ? is completely dead now. Pieces of "art" like this replaced real art, and after seeing of this "art" ? now - your thoughts about how to reach more money replaced your real life, your love, your former principles. And ? are you ready now to kill somebody for money ? :) But ideas of kills in this "art" already became obsolete. Now Americans do it in real, on the level of governments, presidents and nations. God bless them. Maybe one time their American dream will come true and they'll do themselves for money, at last.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Except for music, Wallach, and Van Cleef, how not to make a Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't the worst of the spaghetti films, but it is a terrible films. If you don't know what a spaghetti film is, it means, great exciting music trying to make up for a weak stupid plot, uninteresting, unlikable characters, silly comic book style gunfights, terrible writing, terrible directing, and slow paced boredom. This film isn't a complete bomb because of the efforts of some of the actors. It's no secret that Eastwood wasn't a gifted actor, and he had to be surrounded by superior actors such as Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef. Those two, and the supporting cast almost make this bearable. It involves three men. One is good, one is bad, and one is the guy who took your last girlfriend away from you. But which is which? The film literally has to tell you. Eastwood is supposed to be good, but the only two not completely vicious things he does are try to save a handicapped from hanging (so he can take him to be executed again), and offering a dying soldier a puff from his cigar-not trying to stop his bleeding or even give him some pain killer, but to just do a cigarette commercial in the middle of a movie. There's no reason to care about him at all. In fact, the guy who stole your girlfriend comes across as almost sympathetic (almost.) The plot is the three are after a decent amount of gold. The trouble they go through, they could've much easier just stolen that much cash somewhere is. So the plot is ludicrous. The characters are just an example of that era's movie making in which movie makers tried to outdo each other with evil characters. Billed as anti-heroes, they don't come close to filling that role. True anti-heroes are self absorbed, maybe somewhat selfish, probably anti-social, such as in "Hombre", "The Lost Continent", and the Edmond O'Brien version of "DOA". These guys are just vicious punks who you would not want to be your boss, your law enforcement official, your anything. That said, there is some great music, which doesn't match up at all with the mundane events and characters. The shootout scenes are ridiculous, probably comical, and unfortunately they paved the way for a multitude of later movies that copied these inferior techniques. For exciting shootouts you really need to go way back before these movies, or to more modern movies that know better. This cannot be construed in any way as a good movie, much less a classic. You will be bored to tears if you let one of these guys talk you into watching it. These are the same guys who would take you on a snipe hunt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The funniest, but not the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>C'mon people, time for a little objectivity here. OK, I understand the deconstructionists love this movie for obvious reasons, but to call this the "best western ever"??? Hell, it ain't even in Clint's top three! OK we have three great characters, great cinematography, a unique, quirky, and sometimes powerful score, the first ten minutes, and the last ten minutes of the movie that are all dynamite...but then there's all that crap in between! Apparently, after 'A Few Dollars More' somebody convinced Leone he was a great maker of CINEMA(rhymes with enema) and so he set out to create this interesting but overlong sojourn to a Civil War ravaged New Mexico where bandits roamed freely between the Union and Confederate armies. Nice premise but everything drags and drags and drags-JEEZ! Each scene develops on an excruciating timeline and if you view this as a serious Western you'll be asleep 30 minutes into it...that's always the effect it had on me-even when I was 16 on it's release. But if you plant your tongue in cheek and forget about the artistic grandeur of it all then you might enjoy this thing. For example-let's dissect the famous "bridge" scene. (spoiler alert) So we got a drunken Union commander leading the charge (and he even looks a little like Grant but he never led any charges except to the bar at the Appomattox Holiday Inn) back and forth, to and fro...cannon fire.. boom boom...drag the dead back...yawn! Now Blondie and Tuco got to get to the other side of the river, but there's this battle raging on and on and on over this bridge so it's logical that our heroes have to blow up the bridge right? We don't know WHY but we want to see Clint blow the hell out of something don't we?? Me, I would have forded the river, which appears to be about waist deep, somewhere downstream of all the fighting but that wouldn't suit our purpose here. I fall out of my chair everytime I see our boys knock that poor wounded yankee off his stretcher so the can load it up with dynamite to haul it down to the river. So the boys wait for an intermission in the battle, wire the bridge while no one on either side is looking, blow said bridge, jump behind the sandbags for cover but one of our heroes-Tuco, has his butt stuck up in the air just waiting for one of the Rebels to shoot it off. More cannon fire..boom boom...now EVERYBODY is dead, except of course our two boys who miraculously survived. Even Tuco's ass survived all the shelling which took out everybody and everything in sight! Now with everyone dead it's safe to walk across the river to get the gold. Oh, did I forget to mention that? Yeah, they're after $200,000 in gold and there's another character in hot pursuit but I'm getting to that. First Clint/Blondie finds a cannon that hasn't been fired yet pointing in the opposite direction of the battle which suits him just fine cause it's aimed towards Tuco who is racing off to find the gold. Now Clint is so cool he never even so much as flinches when he lights the fuse with his cheroot...without a doubt the coolest scene in the film. The three finally converge at the location of the gold, there's some witty repartee' between our hero/villains, and then we all square off for a three way gunfight. Tuco, Blondie, and Angel Eyes.......eyes, guns, fingers, eyes, teeth, guns, twitching fingers, more eyes, jeez get on with it! I'm sorry people but this is not a serious western and I laugh my ass off everytime I see it. Not only is this not the "greatest" of all time, hell it ain't even in the top 25 IMHO. I will give the director his due for a number of innovations that have been roundly lauded here, hell I even thought the Confederate Pep Band at the prison camp was a cute idea-silly as it was. They really needed a tuba though and the woodwind section was sorely in need of beefing up, but other than that? This thing is at least an hour too long but as a satire of the western genre I can live with it. I can't however live with this "best ever" tag which is an insult to the genre and to the myth, which is a myth to begin with. 6/10 but only for making me laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most overrated film in the western genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is this film supposed to be a comedy ? (eg with Eli Wallach from the New York classical school of over acting). If so, it is in poor taste with the butchery of the civil war prominent. The civil war was not fought on the sand dunes of Spain. Moreover, able-bodied young men in civilian dress would not be able to freely prance around in the civil war 'theatre'. Clint is burnt to a cinder in the sun and yet within a few days has a baby soft complexion. Eli is beaten to a pulp and yet somehow manages to keep all his teeth and his engaging smile. A overlong, overrated lot of nonsense. Clint only made three good westerns: Josey Wales, Pale Rider , High Plains Drifter. The only Leone western worthy of a repeat viewing is For a Few dollars More due to Lee Van Clef , a better script and better music.My advice, stick to John Wayne, Randolph Scott and Audie Murphy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alas. Allow me to surmise a bit of history: having created two of the greatest westerns ever with "A Fistful of Dollars" and "For A Few Dollars More", some unscrupulous soul was able to convince Sergio Leone that he was a creator of great cinema, instead of a creator of great westerns; this movie was the result. Gone are the brilliantly set-up action sequences, replaced with senseless and dull confrontations, with size, not even quantity, trying to make up for the lost quality. Gone are the witty and interesting characters and the deep character development, replaced with annoying, inconsistent, and flat caricatures. As to just what Leone was trying to say with this movie, for clearly he felt it had a message, it is either horribly unclear or completely and pathetically trite. In his quest to make a movie with meaning, Leone cast aside what had made this movie's "predecessors" so wonderful, and found that not only did he lose the bird in his hand, but he couldn't catch the ones in the bush and fell in a pile of excrement in trying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film borders on the absurd, from the Civil War Scenes supposedly showing The Battle of Bull Run-filmed in a locale resembling the American Southwest-instead of Virginia-in the east, to the pathetic acting of Clint Eastwood-this film as a serious western is very sad. I know it enjoys a high rating, perhaps I missed something. As a possible camp like dark comedy it is easier to watch. The only person who could act in this film-is Eli Wallach, who hams up his role quite well. I will give Lee Van Cleef some credit as well-he makes a great "Angel Eyes". Clint is Clint, what else can be said. Somehow this guy was able to build a career on very little. To be sure, he has done some works that I have been able to enjoy-however, this is not one of them. If you wish to see a violent movie, with terrible sets and horrible screenplay-then go for this one. I am sure that if you really sit back and digest this movie-you will see as a comedy it has potential.</fullReview>

The film tells the story of three men, who´s greed leads them to an eventual, highly predictable conclusion. During this time we get to witness children getting killed, ridiculous comments and a very overrated score, by the terribly over-estimated Ennio Marriconne.Instead of showing something of historical relevance or moral justification Leoni made a highly overrated film, that can not be compared with "The Searchers", "High Noon" and other great westerns. A talentless movie which becomes no more than a rather mediocre, entertaining film.</fullReview>
