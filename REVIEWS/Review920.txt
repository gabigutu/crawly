		<shortDescription>I remember.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it hard to comment on this film without simply repeating what has already been said. It's not that I can't think of anything original, but that others seem to have felt the exact same emotions as I did when watching this film.I saw this movie when I was about 12, 13, maybe 14 years old. So it didn't have the same nostalgic sense it had for so many. But what it did, was make me ache for those memories. I wanted (in the words of another reviewer) to be 12, and *that* cool. I wished I had been like that, that I had had friends like that, laughed like that, and had adventures like that.The 'milk-money' scene was probably one of my all-time favourite scenes in movie history. Up until I saw this movie I had never held much regard for River Phoenix, but the poignancy and sincerity which River added to the role of Chris Chambers touched me to the point of tears. I read in yet another review that in this scene, River was asked to think of a time when he had been hurt by an adult, and that even after the cameras stopped rolling, River sat there still, sobbing and hurting. And I felt every tear and heard every word as though I were there with Chris.This movie made me laugh, cry, rejoice and fear with Chris, Gordie, Teddy and Vern. I loved the campfire scenes, and today I look back on my own childhood, and remember with a laugh the amazingly similar things I used to laugh and wonder about with my friends. I remember dreaming about being a writer and an actress, I remember standing up to bullies, I remember walking or riding with my friends, I remember being afraid, and crying onto a friend's shoulder.I guess what this movie does for everyone, is take them back in time, even though the situations may have been different, chances are you'll find the similarities, and remember with a smile that yes, your life was once *that* cool. In the words of Vern, "a great time"I especially loved the ending. That they found out who was strong, and who just talked tough. I loved the last scene with Chris and Gordie, and the closing monologue."I never had any friends later on, like the ones I had when I was twelve...Jesus....does anyone?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best adaptations of a Stephen King story ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stand By Me is yet another one of the stories made into a movie from the author who has had more stories made into movies than any other author in history, Stephen King. Clearly, the central character here is Gordie Lachance, from whose point of view the story is told and who obviously symbolizes King himself, given many of his characteristics as well as some of the content of the film. This movie is literally filled with actors who have achieved varying degrees of success over the years, such as Jerry O'Connell, who played Vern, River Phoenix, who could have been bigger than Leonardo DiCaprio if he hadn't died, Corey Feldman, who has grown into an unenviable but visible existence, Kiefer Sutherland, who has become an excellent and very well known actor, John Cusack can be seen in a small role as Gordie's late brother, and of course, Richard Dreyfuss, who played the narrator and Gordie as an adult, has remained famous but originally achieved fame more than a decade before Stand By Me was filmed or the original story was even written.Stand By Me takes place in the summer of 1959, the general time period that Stephen King is most skilled at presenting, and four friends set out to find the body of a kid who was killed by a train, hoping to find what they predicted would be astronomical fame. Unfortunately, the town's bullies are also out to find the body for the same reason, which leads to the films ultimate final climax. Even though this is a very clever story with which to tell a fall from innocence story, it is the brilliant characterization and the incredible acting that really make this a classic film. It is extremely rare that a film comes along that stars young kids and is so moving and powerful. Also, every one of those kids is made three dimensional in creative and smooth ways, making you feel like you really knew them by the end of the film. Vern is the fat kid who always gets picked on, Teddy and Chris both have abusive or deranged fathers, not to mention Chris's cruel brother, and Gordie is a young boy who lost his brother three months earlier in a violent accident and who has been largely ignored by his parents ever since. In one memorable scene, Gordie wonders how Teddy can be so enthusiastic about his father's alleged military achievements when the man once held his head to a stove, nearly burning his ear off. Gordie is mystified because he could care less about his own father, who hadn't laid a hand on him since he was three years old and got caught `eating bleach under the sink.'Stephen King pokes fun at his own craft many times in the film, such as in Gordie's vehement line, `F*ck writing. I don't want to be a writer, it's a stupid waste of time!' Not only that, but there are also obvious references to his other works, such as when the boys first realize that no one brought food, and Teddy says, `This is great, what are we supposed to do, eat our feet?' People who actually read instead of just lazily watching the movies will recognize this as a major part of the plot of another of King's short stories, `Survivor Type,' from which Cast Away borrowed heavily. And why don't you people read these books? `The Body,' which Stand By Me was based on, is only 148 pages long, you could read that in a couple of hours and the experience is totally different from a movie. It's even more disturbing that `The Body' was published in the same book (Different Seasons) as a couple of King's other famous stories ? `Apt Pupil' and, of course, `Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.'Stand By Me is a story of how one event can unexpectedly change lives. It seems to be a story about friends and how important they are, but this possible theme is clearly dispelled in a line from the narration spoken at the end of the film ? `As time went on, we saw less and less of Teddy and Vern, until eventually they became just two more faces in the halls. It happens sometimes, friends come in and out of your life like busboys at a restaurant.' Instead, the film is about learning from a life changing experience and actually making changes or modifying your life in some way because of it, and this is heavily emphasized at the end of the film.Stand By Me is a timeless film. Stephen King's story is skillfully brought to the screen under the direction of Rob Reiner, and the 1950s are brought back to life just as successfully as King so often does in his stories and novels, with the slicked back hair, the hot rods, and in the film, and excellent 50s soundtrack. There is so much more to this film than just the superficial story ? things about the characters and the story, but also about the tremendously talented man who wrote it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This classic film is worth a watch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a brilliant, well-acted masterpiece! What touched me the most was the late River Phoenix's acting, but all of the young actors performances were incredible. They are why you should see this film. 'Stand By Me' is not a bubblegum Disney film, nor a dry Hollywood film; it is a movie that captures childhood in a poignant, non-candy coated manner that is dead on. I saw this movie only a couple months ago and was blown away by it's style and acting. It is rare that you see such fresh, relaxed and deep performances that the actors in this film offered. Although this is not a recent film, it is a genuine, inspiring film that is so refreshing-being so different than the films Hollywood often gives us. I give this film a 100+ and recommend it to everyone. You will benefit from it's message and it's wonderful acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Biggest one in four counties</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps this is a personal bias because I had friends like this when I was 12, but having said that this is one of the best films I have ever seen and it hits every chord perfectly.There were four of us that were friends and we were known as the Stand By Me Crew. Mike, Gary, Andy and myself were inseparable. And as this film prophesizes correctly, the group has since split up and now I am only good friends with one of them. This movie makes you remember what it was like to have friends when you were 12 and it makes you glad that they were there when they were.The story involves these four kids going on a weekend hike to find a dead kid that apparently got hit by a train. Now if that is all the movie was about, it would probably be pretty boring. But this film explores the fears and anxieties of what it was like to be 12 again. Twelve year olds deal with a plethora of issues and it is not often that adults listen to what kids have to say or see what they deal with. But this film is honest about it's assessment of how they feel.The four boys are played brilliantly by Wil Wheaton, Jerry O'ConnellCoosh from Jerry Maguire ), Corey Feldman and River Phoenix. The story moves along and hits a nerve because of the life that these four actors brings to their characters. There is a real sense of comrarderie between the four of them. But ultimately it is Phoenix that brings the most life to his character and I would say that the milk money scene with him and Gordie (Wheaton) is one of the more touching and poignant scenes ever filmed.What Stand By Me does is brings you back to a time when friendship was more pure and innocent and meant more. You can't help but get caught up in the nostalgia. Perhaps this film means more to me for personal reasons ( as I've already stated ) but it is a wonderful film and it should be enjoyed by everyone.The last line of the movie is so true. Do we really ever have friends as good as the ones when we were twelve? I doubt it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HELLO? if you've never seen this movie, man you're missin OUT!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am 14 years old, and I absolutely love this movie. But don't let my age fool you. I'm not just going to sit here and talk about how hott River Pheonix was.This movie is well rounded in my perspective. Everyone can relate to at least one of the boys in it at one time in their life. The actors are matched perfectly with who their character portrays.Corey Feldman's character Teddy is the boy who's sensitive about his dad, but tries to hide it, Jerry O' Connell's character Vern is the chubby, wussy kid, but still part of the club, Wil Wheaton's character Gordie is the sweet, intelligent friend who tells stories to the other boys and is ignored by his parents, and River Phoenix's character Chris is the boy in the neighborhood that's been labeled a bad kid and feels he'll never get out of their town, the peacemaker, and Gordie's best friend. This movie just sucks you in as soon as you start watching it. It's not overly mushy and sad, but it's not so tough that only a sixteen year old boy could stand it. You feel for each character, no matter how mean or nice they are. My personal favorite is Chris Chambers, which i know this will probably drive you guys nuts that almost every other person does too, but River Phoenix is just so touching. The campfire scene is great, the milk money seen is great, and one of my favorites is the train scene. You can definitely see the terror in their faces. It's funny that they all act so tough, except maybe Vern, although he tries, and they still like talking about goofy and dancing and singing along to Lollipop. You also just want to be there with them. Feel that kind of friendship that so many people long for. It's such a feel good movie, but not in the sense of a 10 year old's feel good movie. It makes you feel complete when you watch it. It's not jam packed with action sequences or it doesn't have fluffy pink bunnies hopping around in it either. It's just one of a kind. Definitely worth my time and yours.The newest DVD of Stand By Me (Special Edition) has Walking the Tracks: The Summer of Stand By Me where all the main actors,except River, and Rob Reiner are interviewed. They also talk about working with River Phoenix. There's also the Stand By Me music video with River Phoenix, Wil Wheaton, and obviously Ben E. King. Not to mention an extra CD with some awesome oldie's songs like Everyday, Lollipop, Stand By Me, and Mr. Lee.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspiration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a lover of Stephen King's writing style and Rob Reiner's directing techniques, this movie leaves me speechless every time. It is an almost forgotten film about a time and a youth nearly forgotten, as well. And I will say, as a writer, the novella that this film was based upon, "The Body" has and always will be the inspiration for my style of writing.First of all, I enjoy the title that was chosen for the film. "Stand By Me" fits what the characters in the story are facing. I think that all who have seen this film will agree that the problems are all things that we can relate to. All of us know someone like these characters. Most of us have met the boy down the road who had a brother with a bad name and a father with an alcohol problem, automatically being labeled as a "bad kid." And the boy with the military father, abusive and a little whacko. The fat kid, picked on and ridiculed for his weight.To me, Gordy represents all of us. I found myself seeing a little of me in Gordy as I watched the film. I don't know if any one else shares this, but it was true. Gordy was not very strong, at first, and was not sure what he wanted, except to be with his friends. Still coping with the loss of his brother and the fact that his father was disrespectful to him, Gordy still stood up for what he believed in. And, in the end he surprised the characters and the viewers by standing up to the bullies that had plagued them all.This film is certainly one of my top favorites. In fact, it lies in my top three, probably at #2 or #3. I feel that it is a film that everyone should see at some point in their life due to the fact it changes your look at youth and their trials. Few films are able to do that and I think that this one was an inspiration for others that will do the same in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A small masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Growing up isn't easy for anyone. There are times when you feel no one understands you at all. Although growing up is tough, the friends you have at a young age are the friends you'll remember for the rest of your life. Stand By Me is a very wonderful film, a masterpiece on a small scale. The film is full of great insights into the minds of a group of four boys who decide they want to see what a dead body looks like, and it sparks their interest even more that they actually knew this dead person. A young boy's mind is full of many things, they feel lost sometimes, strong at others, but mostly they feel invinceable. Rob Reiner has directed a film about four young boys who discover life is quick, sometimes merciless, and magical. I've seen this film numerous times and it always seems better than the time before. This is a perfect little film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not a GUY'S film only</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without a doubt this movie is probably the best coming of age flick around, it has terrific acting and an incredibly touching plot that keeps you going throughout the whole film. I think the reason I love this film so much is because, everyone in some way could relate to it. When you're a pre-teen and have a close group of friends and face something so intense together, there's that special bond that no matter how much you loose touch with each other, one day, you just think of them and that one incident.Stand by Me is about 4 pre-teen boys whose summer is about to end and they are about to start junior high. They've obviously grown up together and are nervous of the world they are about to face, where they are no longer kids, but just about to become adults. When their friend, Vern, tells them about a kid their age that is missing that he found out by listening in on his brother where the kid's body is, the boys think it would be so cool to find the body and become the local town heroes. They have one problem though, there are these big tough guys who want to find the body first, it's a matter of who will reach it first. But of course, it's the bonding of the boys that really gets you into the film.These are some of the best characters I have seen on film, we start with Gordy. Gordy is an intelligent writer who lost his big brother, his idol, in a car crash recently and can't get any love or respect from his father and it's obvious that he gets it from his friends. That's what keeps him going. Chris is the leader of the gang and Gordy's best friend, he comes from a very bad family and is dubbed the bad seed everywhere, he's the kid who you knew in school and just knew he'd turn out bad, but there's a deeper side to him. The speech that River Phoenix turned out for Chris was so beautifully dilvered as a child who's been disappointed so many times by an adult.Teddy is another bad kid sort of speak, he has a bad home life where his father is crazy and nearly killed him a few times. He has a quick temper, but you can tell that his friends keep him down to Earth and help him through the worst times. Then there's Vern, the funny fat kid who is pretty much scarred of everything, and in some ways is the 4th wheel. Still, Vern you can tell is a great friend and the other's appreciate him despite how he can hold them back.The acting is just phenomenal. Now, the directing, Rob Reiner is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time, he took these young boys and pushed them to their limits, he was so smart about it as well. He said in an interview that he had to get pre-teen boys who were close to the personality of the character in the film, so it would come natural to the pre-teen actors, and you could tell that this film was his baby, he put so much thought and love into this film. That's what makes this film so special, nothing could ever compete with a coming of age film like Stand By Me.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four boys go on a quest to find not only a dead body the true meaning of friendship and reality.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hands down this is my favorite movie. (With the Sandlot in second place). My mom got this movie for me when i was about 12. I saw it the first time and realized that i had friends like that. The movie is definitely one every teenage kid should see. I think it is more of a movie for boys but girls can get out of it the same as the boys can. But the movie overall is great because its just about a four friends who have no experience with the "real world". They find out about a dead body and go in search to find it. At first they just do it to be famous and get a reward. But the quest of the boys throughout the movie reveal things that even themselves didn't know about. After it all, the boys find out about reality, and how it isn't glamorous. They realize that the body could of been them and they respect that. In my opinion the point of the movie was not to have you think of when you were 12 and your good friends but to think of what you have now, and what you do with it. In the end Gordie tells us what happens to each and how each kind of go their separate ways. (Such as the last scene of the movie). This is definitely a movie to not only rent but buy. I tip my hat to Reiner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stephen King adaptations can be great. In my opinion the less horror pictures, and The Shining, are the best. Misery, The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile and this one. Stand by Me is a great film, you can say it is a drama with some thriller elements.Four boys hear the location of the dead body of a boy from their small town. The boys go on a trip to look for the body, about 30 miles away. There are some little problems on the way, including another gang with its leader Kiefer Sutherland. One of the boys thinks about his late brother because of the recent events, played by John Cusack. It seems to be a simple story but it is told perfect.The performances the boys give, one of them is the late River Phoenix, are all extraordinary. I liked the way their friendship was shown. Just a great movie, see this. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sadly just can't agree...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am as many are, a huge fan of Stephen's King Works. I have also been a fan of many of the films made from his books. Some I am not a fan of. I have not read as of yet and I'm sure I will, The Body. I have seen Stand By Me several times and I am conflicted in many of the great portions of this film and the ideas behind the movie vs the fact that it just doesn't sit with me as entertaining.Stand By Me is considered perhaps one of the forefront coming of age films and for good reason. It's the story of four best friends set in the fifties/sixties told through the eyes of the Gordie Lachance who has lost his role model best friend older brother to an accident. Haunted by the loss of his brother and the fact that everyone seems to have only cared about his older brother including his parents, he is compelled to encourage his group of friends to go on a trek across the county to find the dead body of a missing boy. Unfortunately the "bad kids" and "bullies" in town also discover that this body is nearby and they race to find it first. During their trek they discover more about each other, and they stand together to overcome their fears about their own lives.I do whole heartedly agree in the pure heart of this film, the coming of age, the different personalities of each boy in the film. It does aim to find a little something of everyone in each boy and it accomplishes that. The cast, especially for young actors is very good. Wil Wheaton as the lead character appears to be weaker than his best friend played by the late River Phoenix but in the end he is really who holds them altogether and overcomes the most of all of them. River Phoenix ironically plays the "bad boy" best friend who seems to have very little future but has taken Wheaton's character under his wing and encourages him to make something of himself. Corey Feldman fills in his usual role adequately. Jerry O'Connell as the made fun of "fat kid" also plays his role well. Keifer Sutherland who can't help but look like a jerk and an evil fiend also plays well. The cast is basically The Brat Pack and yet for an eighties film it's quite darker than most Brat Pack films. Wholely realistic is the kids' views on life, their fascination with death, cigarettes, adult things, and their adult language. Their trying to be as grown up as possible without any real adult role models.My issue is that the film just doesn't hit me. It never satisfies me or entertains me. I find it entirely too short, very, very, predictable and without any real depth of plot. I know everyone sees this film as a classic and certainly it has it's strong points as I outlined but overall it just falls short for me. The soundtrack, and I absolutely love these songs feels forced like Reiner is trying to force the feeling of the era on us rather than create it all around them. In this case I don't expect anyone to believe my opinion because I am sorely outnumbered but I don't care for this film much at all.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The death of childhood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stand By Me is probably the best film ever to come from a Stephen King story. (The Green Mile sucks, by the way.) The story is told from an adult writer's point of view as he recounts an adventure he shared with his three best friends in the waning moments of the summer before junior high school began. We see the four boys head out into the wilderness to see the dead body of a boy who was apparently hit by a train. The boys encounter bullies, other trains, leeches, vicious dogs, and many other things on their trip. And they have some pretty deep and emotional conversations along the way.This is a very awkward age in the life of a young man. You can tell by listening to their conversation topics which range from boobs to whether or not Mighty Mouse can beat up Superman. The youngsters are portrayed flawlessly by four terrific young actors. Who would have thunk that Jerry O'Connell would turn out to be the most successful of them? At times they laugh, other times they pick on each other. Sometimes they seem on the verge of fighting, but when challenged by the older gang of bullies, they stick together. Richard Dreyfuss, who plays the adult writer, narrates the action as things move along. Their trip is full of surprises and emotional insight.Stand By Me is not quite a classic in my book, but it is very memorable. The script is a little too pessimistic for my liking. Right down to when River Phoenix describes an incident where he's caught stealing milk money from school, and his teacher ends up keeping it for herself. There is also a complete lack of positive supporting characters during the scenes set back when they were kids. Only John Cusack, in a cameo role, is shown as a positive older character. No wonder these kids felt so unwanted! All the adults around them were jerks! The script uses more swear words than are actually necessary to convey the anger these kids sometimes feel. And you'd think any dead body that had been hit by a train would be more damaged than the one they find out in the woods. Wouldn't this kid have heard the train coming in time and jumped well out of the way? If he was trying to kill himself, then you'd think he would have stood in the way and been completely pulverized. I know these may seem like petty beefs, but they are enough to knock the review down a star or two.It seems like the film is trying to portray the dead Brower boy as the death of these kids' innocence or something to that effect. As someone who's been their age, I can understand some of what they were feeling. And I totally agree that some of the people you thought were your best friends eventually just turn out to be faces in the crowd at school a few years later.Despite it's faults, this is a powerful film you aren't likely to forget. It's one of Reiner's best, and the outstanding cast does some wonderful work themselves.8 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies ever made...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stand By Me is without a doubt one of the finest pieces of film ever made in the history of humanity. A truly excellent movie that really strikes and affects you with all its glory. It leaves no one untouched whether you're 12 or 112 years old. Simply because it deals with life and friendship, and all that comes with it. Both the good and the bad.Everyone can relate to it and feel what the characters feel. Because we've all been there. We have all done similar things to what they are doing, we have all been dealing with the same issues in life as they are faced with and we all still are.Few films are able do depict the theme of life and friendship as successfully as Stand By Me. In my opinion there are practically no flaws in this production, everything from the plot and the screenplay to the characters and the actors are top notch. Also the music is great.Watching the movie one feel everything from happiness and laughter to fear and grief. Laughter because we remember how fun it was being a child. With everything being new and exciting in life. And facing it all together with our friends. Fear and grief because of how hard it can be having to grow up and let go of the past. Let go of our old friends and our old life. One can't help but to feel nostalgic. At least I do. It makes me think about life in a larger sense. Thinking about my childhood I realize how long ago it was or at least seems to be. The movie frees a lot of emotions and thoughts regarding both my own life and life in general.This movie also has one of the best opening scenes in film history. I almost burst into tears every time I see it. It's as close to perfection as it gets. It's so beautiful and sad. Simply the perfect way to launch the rest of the movie. How the beautiful soft music first almost reaches out and touch you, while seeing the landscape. Then a close up on the car and the main character reading the chocking news of his dear old friend's death. Thereafter such a smooth passage back to his childhood with focus on the kids passing by on their bikes and the music still in the background. Excellent!To conclude I have also one little flaw, or at least I think of it that way. It's regarding the whole "Lardass-scence". When I was little I could never figure out why it was in the film. I couldn't see the connection to the rest of the film. Being older and hopefully a little wiser :D I now see that it's a way of showing Gordies talent for making up stories, the talent that have him becoming a writer one day. However I feel this could have been illustrated in a better way. I've always felt that scene is just a little bit over the top and I still do. Otherwise Stand By Me is close to a masterpiece. No one should go through life without seeing and experiencing this wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This wonderful movie opens the place where your secret heart is buried</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In ancient Greece people watched the great tragedies in the amphi-theatres, and eyewitnesses tell us that audiences of 20'000 sat crying when the main character on the stage became aware of his fatal guilt and had to face death. They called it catharsis, best translated by 'cleaning the souls'. Well, measured by the tremendous effect on all of us writing reviews on the film, STAND BY ME has the power and qualities of ancient tragedy. This jewel of a film touches and shakes the best sides in us. I have watched it over and over again, and even if I watch it several times a week I still sit and laugh and cry, and it leaves me sad and confused and grateful, feelings that can last for hours and sometimes days.So what is the mystery behind this masterpiece?First of all it teaches us that good filmmaking isn't about the dollars spent on the production, but about the people who make it.And it's about a unique and humble (I hope you understand what I mean) director: Rob Reiner doesn't try to show how good he is, leering at the Oscar-jury:the story is told without any visual effects, the pace is slow and the cinematography is unspectacular, but he succeeds in inspiring his young actors to perform honest feelings and letting the story develop by its own terms. An example is the milkmoney-scene. It is told that Reiner wasn't satisfied with the performance of River Phoenix. They tried again and again. Finally, he told River to remember a situation of his own life where a grownup had let him down. Guess if he succeeded with it! River Phoenix started crying and he couldn't stop crying a long time after the shot was taken. That's why this film is pure gold: it doesn't show professional acting, it shows young boys who open their hearts in front of a camera. They can do it, because they can relate to similar experiences and because the message is important and universal. We all can relate to similar situations. These scenes make me remember events from my own youth that I had inhibited for a long time, because I didn't like to remember them. That's the pain!But it's not only the director and the actors who should earn all the credits. I read the novel after watching the film, and since that time Stephen King is one of the great contemporary writers in my book. I just don't understand why he doesn't write more of THE BODY kind. To me this book is pure poetry (including all those four-letter-words that Maltin e. a. don't like, because they don't understand why they are necessary)! But the most amazing thing is: the script doesn't only catch the quintessence of the novel, it's partly even better! This perfect balance between humor and seriousness! It doesn't manipulate the audience. In the book grownup Gordon sits in his car when he had read about his friend's death. "I drove out of town, parked, and cried for him. Cried for damn near half an hour, I guess." In the film Gordon doesn't cry. He doesn't need to. Everyone in the audience feels like crying, because they understand the tragedy! There are only 13 pages of dialogue and narration, and there really is not one line too much. It's so good, I almost know the whole of it by heart. Take the ending: In the book, the famous writer Gordon Lachance tells about how he met Ace Merrill again, some twenty years after the Ray Brower event: grown fat and the only one alive of his old friends and enemies. How much better is the film's ending! This important line about the friends we had when we were twelve years old is only a line in King's book, commending the good time the boys have at Milo Pressman's junkyard! If there had been an Oscar for impressive film endings, this film had deserved the first!And thank you Jack Nitzsche for the intense score. It's Gordie's theme, when he's not with his friends. In the group Gordie is the smart boy with the sharp, quick, fresh replies. Without the friends, at home or in the store he barely speaks a word. And then we can hear that fragile Jack Nitzsche variation on Stand by me. It's like Gordie crying `where are you, Chris? Come, stand by me'. That's brilliant and exactly what great filmmusic should be: serving the film's dramaturgy.Well, I don't know how many hours it took me to express my love to this film in a language that isn't my own. It seems impossible. It is exactly as Stephen King expressed it himself (end of chapter 29): `Even if I'd known the right thing to say, I probably couldn't have said it. Speech destroys the functions of love, I think - that's a hell of a thing for a writer to say, I guess, but I believe it to be true. If you speak to tell a deer you mean it no harm, it glides away with a single flip of its tail. The word is the harm. Love isn't what these asshole poets like McKuen want you to think it is. Love has teeth; they bite; the wounds never close. No word, no combination of words, can close those lovebites. It's the other way around, that's the joke. If those wounds dry up, the words die with them. Take it from me. I've made my life from the words, and I know that is so.'10 out of 10, no doubt about it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Time of Their Lives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie Stand by Me is a story about four close twelve year old friends growing up in rural Oregon who are bitten by the curiosity bug. The main Character, Gordie (Wil Wheaton), and his three friends, Chris (River Pheonix), Teddy (Corey Feldman), and Vern (Jerry O'Connell) set out on an adventure to find the body of Ray Brower. They had heard of his whereabouts by Vern's older brother and they were determined to find him. They incur many setbacks during their journey. They are bullied by the older boys of the town who are also trying to find the body and get the fame, attacked by the junkyard dog Chopper, almost getting run down by a train, and attacked by the swamp leaches. The boys learn many lessons on their journey, but more importantly they learn about life. The actual goal of Rob Reiner, director of the film, was to show that growing up has its ups as well as downs. All four of the main characters have had some trouble in their life. He showed this when Gordie's athletic brother was tragically killed in a car accident. By doing this, Reiner elaborates to the audience that bad things do happen to the best people. Chris and Teddy also have very neglecting fathers at their homes. Even though it is all fun and games on the hunt for the body, they still have a troubled life lingering in the background that they can not get away from. And good old Vern has an older brother who wreaks havoc in his life. He is actually one of the older bullies also on the hunt for the body. Reiner cannot make his point much clearer. One of the things I really loved about this movie is how few rules the young twelve year old boys had. The first evident thing is when the movie opens and they are smoking in their tree house. These boys smoke, shoot handguns in town, and cuss like sailors throughout the movie and know one seems to notice. Wow, the times sure have changed since I was a young child.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When it comes to coming of age films it is the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It happens sometimes. Friends come in and out of our lives, like busboys in a restaurant."Stand By Me is Rob Reiner's love letter to friendship and nostalgic memories. It's ironic that Reiner's film looks at the past with such high regards because we can do the same with his filmography. His best films were all made in the 80's (and we can squeeze Misery and A Few Good Men into that list as well although they came out in 1990 and 1992 respectively), and despite not having directed many great films over the past few decades we can still look back at his early films and appreciate his classics. Stand By Me reminds us all of our early childhood and the friendships we made. It doesn't matter what decade we grew up in, we all cherish special memories of adventures we shared with our friends and how they helped shape us. That is what is so universal and appealing about Reiner's film; even though we may never have grown up in a small town or had similar outdoor adventures it still recalls us back to a time where we were discovering new things about the world and standing up for our friends when they were in trouble or running with them when we got caught playing in our neighbor's yards. Stand By Me focuses on these memories and it's not just about the adventure in itself but the bond these friends shared together. It's probably the go to movie when we are comparing or referencing other coming of age films, and in my opinion one of the best ever made considering how much I appreciate the genre. I'm sure the film itself was a life changing experience for many who grew up watching it and dreaming of having similar adventures with their friends.Based on Stephen King's short story, "The Body," the screenplay for the film was adapted by Raynold Gideon and Bruce Evans. It takes place in 1959 and centers on four 12 year old friends from Castelrock, Oregon who overhear a conversation about the location of the body of a dead boy who had been missing for several days. The news about the disappearance of this boy had spread all over town, so these kids decide to embark on an adventure through the woods and bring back the missing body so they can be received as heroes. Since the journey would take more than a full day, they plan to tell their parents that they are staying at each other's home. Gordie (Will Wheaton) had recently lost his older brother (played by John Cusack in the flashback scenes) a few months prior to this in a car accident so he knew his mourning parents wouldn't even mind him being gone for a few days. His best friend, Chris (River Phoenix), came from a troublesome family and despite knowing he'd get into trouble if they'd discover his lie he didn't think it would be any different if he stayed with his drunk father. Teddy (Corey Feldman) still has the scars from the abuse he suffered from his mentally unstable father, and currently lives with his mother. Vern (Jerry O'Connell), the clown of the group who isn't taken very seriously is the one who came up with the idea of looking for the body, but he also is the first to back down when it comes to it. The four finally decide to go ahead with their plan and begin their adventure, which will eventually shape who they are. The story is narrated by the grown up version of Gordie (played by Richard Dreyfuss) somewhere around 1985.The strong performances in this film are one of the reasons why it continues to work today. River Phoenix was such a natural and is so charismatic that he steals every scene he's in. The chemistry he shares with Wheaton's character is strong and it reminds us all of that best friend we had in our childhood. Corey Feldman must have had the best agent because he starred in some of the best films that were released in the 80's (Gremlins, The Goonies, The Burbs, and The Lost Boys). Jerry O'Connell is probably the one that has undergone the greatest physical transformation, but he was perfect for the role of Vern and he reminded us of that friend who always seemed to be the butt of every joke. These four young actors carry the film and despite not having the most exciting of adventures, the way the story is told is what makes it such a fascinating one. There are small moments like the one where they gather around the camp fire to listen to Gordie's story, or when they are crossing the pond and discover its full of leeches, that stand out. The film is told through Gordie's recollection of these events and each scene feels like an authentic memory someone would have of such a life changing experience. The 50's soundtrack also plays a key role in the film since it adds to the overall sense of nostalgia. Reiner's film reminds me how much I actually have enjoyed Stephen King's non-horror stories (this along with Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile are my favorite film adaptations of his work). Since its 1986 release, all the coming of age films that have followed it seem to heavily borrow from it. Stand By Me is the measuring stick for films in this genre.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't get the hype....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Currently, "Stand By Me" is rated #180 on IMDb--a very, very impressive score that would indicate that this is a great film. However, try as I might, I have no idea why the film is rated this highly and I thought the movie was just average to above average and no more. This film is based on a story by Stephen King and is directed by Rob Reiner. It has a very interesting cast of kids all about age 12--Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Connell, River Phoenix and Wil Wheaton--all before they became stars. These four boys decide one summer to go looking for a dead body--the body of a kid who is missing and who was hit by a train. They know about where the body is because one of them overheard one of the older punks talking about discovering it. Almost the entire film consists of the four boys trekking cross-country to find the body. Along the way, they have some adventures, curse a lot and experience togetherness.There were two things I really liked about the film--the nice 1950s music and the acting of two of the characters. Wheaton and Phoenix were blessed to have been given well-rounded and interesting characters to play--and both were outstanding. On the other hand, Feldman and especially O'Connell played characters that seemed much more like caricatures--difficult to believe and rather stereotypical. Something I didn't like was the language, as f-bombs and lots of other nasty language abounded. Now I know that some kids talk like this, that's true, but it tended to make the kids less likable AND made the film less family-friendly--which it easily could have been.Overall, the film really was adequate and nothing special. I expected special but only once or twice (such as with a poignant scene with Wheaton) was I left thinking the film was anything other than a coming of age story and nothing more. I just didn't get it...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love River Phoenix in this movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am still a big River Phoenix fan even after his death. This movie I would have to say was his best movie in his earlier roles. All the guys did an awesome job portraying their characters. This movie made me cry, laugh, and rejoice. This movie is just another Rob Reiner masterpiece! I especially love the very last scene where Gordie (Dreyfuss) is finishing his story and he writes about how he has never had friends like he had when he was twelve, and that as anyone? I am only thirteen, and this movies was made the year I was born, but I can still relate to this film so much. I have seen the movie about 12 times, and every time I watch it I understand it more and more. I saw most of the movie when I was about 10 years-old, and the message didn't really sink in then. Now that I am older I can understand the message and relate to it better. The actors really pull you into the movie and script to see what it really was like back then. I know I will refer back to movie time and time again until my dying day. This movie is spectacular!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie a few years ago and I instantly thought it was great. It's a memorable story (adapted from an unusual literary venture for Stephen King) about four 12-year-old boys in 1959 who go in search of a dead body. Everything about this movie was memorable: the script, the acting, and most of all, the four boys. All of them had distinct personalities and backgrounds and didn't blend into each other like so many other movies like this. My favorite character was Chris Chambers, who was not only cute but a "bad boy" with a heart of gold (also the breakout role for River Phoenix). This is a must-see for anyone who likes a good movie. The only problem I had with this movie was that I found it unrealistic. The 12-year-old boys in the movies cussed every two words, smoked cigarettes regularly, and talked admiringly in detail about some girl's boobs. I found this unusual even for 1959. I was 12 once, and most of the boys I knew rarely cussed, never smoked anything, and were just a smidge too far from puberty to talk about a girl's boobs in detail. However, these small qualities are redeemed. This is a great movie from the great Stephen King.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie: Stand by Me Rating: Rated R for strong language by the use of children Starring: Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Connell, Kiefer Sutherland Summary: This story begins with adult Gordon Lachance sitting in a car unsure as he stares into the article in the newspaper saying one of his closest friends died. After seeing two kids ride past his car, we are taken back to when he was 12 years old...Gordie Lachance is a sensitive boy with three other friends, scared cat Vern, flamboyant Teddy and leader of the pack, Chris. Together, they are four close friends in a simple group of friendship. One say Vern enters their tree house panting, and tells the pack about a kid's dead body he heard had been found by his brother of whom hadn't told the police. Suddenly, they all form a plan to go search for the kid's body imagining their popularity for finding it.Thus begins the two day cross across their hometown, Castle Rock. Sooner or later, the four discover a bond they never knew they had as their personal feelings and lives corrupt with each others.Opinions: What makes this movie so separate from other movies about kids and friendships is this movie really does captures the aspects of friendship and kids everyday hard lives, like a kid with a family who he feels ignores him, a kid who feels society will never appreciate a kid from a bad family, a kid who feels of getting his importance from his father "storming the beach at Normandy".Every kid in this movie has a realistic conflict and the kids acting is so real, I feel my friends act the same way at school, the real and close friends that stood by me. This movie is not about finding the dead body but really those two days the kids are together and realize how much closer they are than they thought. Even though this movie was made in the 1980s it's a shock kids still act this way today.While many may complain of the four-letter words in the movie, but I have to say kids like to cuss to feel cool in my school. They call each other names and dis, or as they say in the movie "rank", each other.In conclusion, this movie should be watched by many, and don't let the R rating fool you for the best movie about kid friendship I've ever seen in my life. They probably will never be a greater movie ever made. This is the closest you can be to superior! Total: 9.7 out of 10</fullReview>

There were also some tearful moments in it too especially towards the end but i think that just made the movie seem even more special to me.

		<fullReview>Stand by Me is based on one of my favourite Stephen King stories. It tells about a man remembering his youth in a small town where he and his three friends, all of them twelve and about to embark on different schools, decide to crown their last summer together by taking a trip down the railroad tracks in pursuit of a rumour about a dead body seen by the river. A sight that naturally appeals to the horror freaks in prepubescent boys.It is a quintessential Stephen King story in that the basic premise isn't all that complicated, a couple of lads walking down the tracks, but is filled with insight, purpose and life by the smallest of details given to his characters. I've rarely encountered more interesting, yet so believable characters than I have in his books. He's the one author that has made me realize that every single man or woman alive is interesting beyond belief if you only get to know him or her well enough.Unfortunately the novella is so bountiful and full of details that the movie seems pale by comparison. Most of the important plot points are referenced and acted out, but they don't reach the same emotional impact because details are missing and/or not given enough time to sink in. In addition the film suffers somewhat from the fact that all the main actors are children. They're very good child actors, Wil Wheaton and River Phoenix especially, but you can definitely see through their acting in most scenes.Nevertheless, it's an excellent movie to check out, even if you've read the original novella. It speaks about childhood through very unconventional means, but it rings no less true because of it. Quite the opposite. We really never have friends like the ones we had when we were twelve.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remembered watching this 20 some-odd years ago and what I remembered were three things:1.) I liked it 2.) The crossing the train tracks scene 3.) The leeches sceneI watched it again just yesterday and I can completely see my childhood fascination with this movie. But before I mention why I liked it I first have to ask... what is with Stephen King and children?Carrie, The Shining, Cujo, Firestarter, Cat's Eye, Children of the Corn, It, Stand by Me, et al. OK, granted, Stand by Me is nothing like the others, but it stars kids nonetheless. Stand by Me was a good ol' fashioned drama and I can see why I liked it and still like it. I got to see four foul-mouth pals take an adventure that I only dreamed of taking when I was that age. To have the freedom to just roam the woods with three of my best friends on a mission; that's little boy heaven. These four youth all had their problems but they were a band of brothers together. They laughed, cried, fought, played, roughhoused and everything else together; exactly what all regular boys do. There were no heroics, no real highs and no real lows just life. For all of the adults who forgot what it was like as a kid, Stand by Me is the reminder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stand By Me is the story of four adolescent boys who venture out of their small Oregon town in search of a boy who has disappeared and feared dead. Only two people know where he really is. When word reaches these boys, the race is on to find him.The leader of this crew is Chris Chambers (River Phoenix), a strong willed individual who carries a bum rap. Gordie Lachance (Will Wheaton) idolized Chris and everything he does. Gordie has been the "other child" at home since his brother died. The headstrong Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman) is the renegade "wild-man" whose war weary father has made a strong impact on, for better and for worse. The last of this "gang" is Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell), the one who found out about the resting place of the lost boy. Vern is slightly overweight and jittery; the tag-a-long friend.Narrated by an older Gordie (Richard Dreyfuss), now a writer, we see the characters through his eyes essentially, even though it isn't just about Gordie, but all of them. Reiner's casting is superb for all four friends and even the older kids. The leader of the older kids is Ace Merrill (Kiefer Sutherland), a dark and menacing character who strikes fear into the hearts of the four boys. It is his presence that makes the boys more determined than ever to find the body before he does The next two days for these boys is filled with obstacles, both on the tough Oregon landscape and in their troubled minds. It seems like they live their entire childhood and adolescent years in a span shorter than 48 hours. Usually a person experiences certain things one at a time over a long period of time. It seems that no matter where these boys go in life, they will never forget those two days when they were no long children, but men.</fullReview>

They are why you should see this film. 'Stand By Me' is not a bubblegum Disney film, nor a dry Hollywood film; it is a movie that captures childhood in a poignant, non-candy coated manner that is dead on. I saw this movie only a couple months ago and was blown away by it's style and acting. It is rare that you see such fresh, relaxed and deep performances that the actors in this film offered. Although this is not a recent film, it is a genuine, inspiring film that is so refreshing-being so different than the films Hollywood often gives us.

		<fullReview>The movie 'Stand by Me' (Rob Reiner) is coming of age film about four young boys. Throughout the film, they undergo many challenges and come to conclusions about their hometown, the world and themselves. All the boys are very different; there is at least one trait within each of the boys that everyone can relate to. This movie has a perfect combination of seriousness and the more immature and fun ways of youth. The characters deal with normal problems at the age of twelve as well as other problems like dealing with death, bad reputations and local myths. Some of the things they learn are discovered in a comical way and they learn the difference between myth and reality. The script is based on the novel "The Body" by Stephen King. Reiner closely follows the book but adds things here and there that make it much more exciting and relatable. The script is clever and well written. This movie is funny, emotional, suspenseful and a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An all-time classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film "Stand By Me" is hands down one of my favorite movies of not only my childhood, but even still today. When I look back on my own youth around the years of 12-14, I can remember so clearly the moments portrayed in the film. Whether it be talking smack about our parents, running around all night saying we were each staying at different houses, or walking along the train tracks during the scorching summer days chucking rocks at the freights that passed by. I recall being skeptical at first about watching this so called "classic," simply because of the fact that i was an adolescent girl and not some "young dirty boy" taking hikes to see dead bodies and smoking cigarettes along the way. But from the minute the movie started with all the boys' playing cards in the famous tree house to the moment where Chris Chambers fades away at his and Gordie's final goodbye, I could not help but get a thousand of overwhelming emotions passing through me. I laughed, I cried, I felt angry, and at times even surprised by some of the language that these thirteen year old boys were using. But that is the magic of it all. How often does a movie about pre-teen kids come along where there is no sugar coating, just a plain and real depiction of how all of us acted when we were that age. The average movie always leaves me laughing or feeling entertained for the night, but very so often a dime piece will come along that leaves you in awe feeling nostalgic for days about your own childhood. And then there are the actors - how could I possibly forget about them? River Phoenix with his heart-gripping scene about the milk money, Whil Wheaton so believably portraying a quiet and vulnerable boy who had lost his brother, Corey Feldman evoking so much anger and hurt through the words he says and the emotion in his eyes, and then Jerry O'Connell-just being plain old, clumsy Vern. Rob Reiner also did a fantastic job to have the ability to take a Stephen King novel and turn it into a heartwarming tale that still held the "spooky" element to it all. Filled with an outstanding cast and beautiful theme song, it is no wonder this is a movie I cannot seem to go a year without watching. It is definitely a must see for anyone who feels they want to relive their past every now and again. Like the famous quote says, "I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve. Jesus, does anyone?"</fullReview>

It is absolutely the greatest Stephen King adaptation, and I think it is awesome how Stephen King liked some of the things better in the movie than what he wrote in the book. like when Gordie pointed the gun at Ace instead of Chris. I have never really cried during a movie until I saw this one. It is absolutely beautiful, and I love every second of it.

		<fullReview>These kinda movies come along very rarely. This is my personal all-time favorite movie. The actors are very talented, especially Wil Wheaton (Gordie) and River Phoenix (Chris) who are my 2 favorite actors. It is based on a Stephen King novella called "The Body" and I have read the book and it was fantastic also. The script was put together very well and they done very good on the screen play. All of the actors were very young whenever they shot this and they all showed extreme maturity. I think a lot of people can relate to this movie because it cuts so deep into the heart. I wish that I could have a best friend like Gordie had Chris and Chris had Gordie. Yeah, I have a best friend, but we aren't "best" best friends... If you have not seen this movie you need to go out and find it because im sure that this movie will change your life like it did mine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film need not be expensive to be Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was 1987 when I first went to see this flick and in fact wondered why I saw it THREE times? Later it occurred to me this was a coming of age film and anyone from 18-80 who is a man, probably has some unconscious baggage about such hard, yet unforgettable experiences.I recently got a 50 inch plasma so thought, why not get some of the films I recall as classic.I very much enjoyed River Phoenix as a kid, who was 16, but in the film looked not a day over 14.The sad and prophetic part, is where River walks away and vanishes down the road forever.Isn't this what time does for us? Just as we realize we have had an experience, its over and gone, who knows where.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Adventures Of A Child I Wish I Could Get Back.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved Stand By Me, a great childhood adventure film which shows how growing up can be tough, fun, exciting &amp; life changing. Now i'm a bit older the movie reminds me about how great it was being a worry free kid with so much to explore, and how the word boredom barley existed. I guess watching it these days could make me a little jealous &amp; depressed that my childhood is over, but in the best possible way. Its always good to look back and smile, even if you can't turn back the clock.The acting was great, especially from Corey Feldman &amp; Keither Sutherland who both have roles within other movies in my top 20 list as well, i really think it deserved an Oscar and not just a nomination but an 8.1 on IMDb is just as rewarding i guess :)i too give it an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolute must watch movie for all boys/men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my all time favourite movies that has spanned 20 years plus for me and is as emotional an experience watching it now as it was when I was a 19 year old the first time round. As others have said, it's so poignant, so relevant to growing up (particularly as a boy) in any town, anywhere, at anytime, that I don't have anything original to add, other than I am waiting for the right time to show it to my 13 year old. Would he get it yet? I don't know, but he absolutely will sooner or later.A true genius of a film with an ending that'll have tough adventurous middle age guys like me sobbing their heart out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And its still my favorite movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everythings been said and done about this movie. But I just thought I would put my own opinion on it.I'm 14 years old. I seen this movie for the first time this summer. And I bought it. After that, I've watched it over 50 times. I showed it to all my friends, they all watched it. They also, all loved it.So I thought I'd just mention how this movie, which was probably my grandmothers favorite movie back in the day, can still be popular for kids my age. It makes me wish i lived in those days, it makes me want to be a part of their gang. With "Chris Chambers", and all of those unique and hilarious characters. It makes me want to have my own adventure like they did.I recommend this movie to everyone! Because I think everyone will like it just as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the death of his friend, a grown-up Gordie, now a writer, recounts a childhood journey. Gordie and three friends travel a long way to see the body of dead boy, and have several adventures on the way. I thought this movie was excellent. I thought it was a really nice, simple, unpretentious movie with themes that were really great, and really relevant. The characters, and some of the actors playing them, were amazing. River Phoenix stood out especially, he was a fantastic actor for his age, but the same applies to the other child actors; they brought the characters to life so well. I felt like I knew them all so well, and I suppose I do have friends, or know someone just like each of the characters. Although the characters were great, the one criticism I have about them is that they were a bit clich and stereotyped. For example, the quiet artistic child whose brother died and whose father hates him. Or the fat, loser, woosey boy. But I suppose the characters are like that so we do relate and feel like we know each one of the characters. Apart from that, everything else was great. It wasn't too long or too short, and the story never seemed to lag. It's funny, hilarious even at times, but it's still touching, and sweet. The filmmakers and the actors manage to capture every aspect of childhood without being one of those awful, lovely, candy-coated, happy, Hollywood movies. The movie makes me feel lucky that I'm still young, and that I still can make the most of my life, but at the same time, it made me wish I was 12 again, that I was still innocent, and had friends like Vern and Gordie and Chris.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nostalgia Central!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was born 25 years after this film was set, yet the single 1 thing that made me remember that this wasn't based in my own childhood years was the amount of food that Gordy managed to buy with their spare change. This films portrayal of childhood is so timeless and real.Most of us who saw this film can probably relate completely to this story. We too spent all day long trekking around outside, getting dirty, and yes-occasionally cheating death. (I'm sure we all have our own "crossing the train tracks" story...) Not carrying a wallet. Not thinking twice at the prospect of having to spend all day walking in the heat to get somewhere. Being gone all day, unsupervised, with no mobile phone to rely on if you got caught in a jam. There are so many scenes and pieces of dialogue that resonate so strongly as you watch this film.However, childhood nostalgia is not the only emotion you feel watching this movie. Learning about the lives and hardships of these characters is heart-rending to watch (particularly Gordy's personal reaction to the body, and River Phoenix's famous "milk money" scene). I can't think of another film starring child actors that has made me feel even a 10th of the emotion I felt during this movie. This is due largely to the fact that they managed to cast some great actors here. But I think also, the fact that these characters weren't predictable and 2-dimensional, like so many other children portrayed in films. Yeah, these are regular kids, who spend much of their days eating sugar and laughing at vomit stories. But that's not all they're about. They all have real problems and real emotions, and care about more than collecting baseball cards.This movie is bittersweet. It makes you laugh, and brings back so many fond memories, but it also makes you ache for your lost childhood, and the friends who shared it with you (who are now, as so accurately put, just "faces in the hallway"). It also drives home the fragility of childhood innocence, and the harsh realities of life. Hearing the outcome of Chris's adulthood is one of the most boldly pessimistic things I've ever seen in a film. But hey-that's life."I never had any friends later on, like the ones I had when I was twelve?Jesus, does anyone?" True, how damn true.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stand by Me (1986) **** (out of 4) Coming of age film about four friends (Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Connell) who set out to find the body of a missing teen. For my money this is the best coming of age film ever made because of how real it comes off. Perhaps I see myself and my friends in the role of these characters when we were their age but the movie has always struck me as being as true to teenage years as a film can possibly get. The bad language, the stuff the boys talk about and their looking for adventure is something any guy can connect with and I think this film delivers all the laughs, tears and drama of growing up. Each of the four boys are given great character development over the course of the 88-minute running time, which is pretty remarkable since the film doesn't run too long. We get to know each of the characters from their fears to their hopes for the future even though it's obvious that some won't ever reach their goals, which again, just falls back on how real the movie comes off. This is certainly one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King story and director Reiner handles all of it with great care and his visual style and song selections all hit the right mark. Another thing that keeps the film great are the performances by the four leads. Wheaton, Feldman and O'Connell all have some very tough scenes for such young actors but all pull them off without any trouble. The film belongs to Phoenix however as he clearly sticks out from the rest of the cast, which is saying a whole lot. The maturity he shows here is rather amazing to watch because there are actors twice his age that wouldn't be able to pull off the material here. The way the four boys work together makes their characters very memorable. The supporting players include future stars Kiefer Sutherland and John Cusack who also turn in great performances. Richard Dreyfuss appears in a few scenes and narrates the film and he does a great job. I think narration quite often ruins films but that's not the case here because Dreyfuss really puts his heart and soul into the narration and it really comes off as he's telling a story from his own childhood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most honest portrayal of how 12-year-old boys really are. One of my all time favorites.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is such a great movie. It is a very brave, and entertaining comedy/drama, that actually has the courage to show 12-year-olds as they really are, and doesn't clean it up for the whole family like most movies of this kind do. It's a hilarious comedy at times, but is also very heartwarming and tragic.Most of you know the story. The set up for the adventure is when four pre-teen boys learn about the whereabouts of a missing local kid's dead body. They end up going on a twenty mile quest to find the body, and hope to become heroes. Gordie Lachance (Wil Wheaton) is a sensitive, and intellectual kid who lives in the shadow of his dead older brother Dennis (John Cusack), who was the only one in his family who actually understood him. Everybody acknowledges to him about how well his brother played football, which makes Gordie's pain even worse. His parents don't seem to care about him anymore, and he feels that his dad hates him. He is a great storyteller, and his best friend Chris Chambers (River Phoenix), gives him hope and encouragement.Chris Chambers is an abused kid who comes from a family of lowlife thugs, including his cruel older brother Eyeball (Bradley Gregg). Chris is a good kid, and although he has made some bad choices, he still remains a very positive character. His family's bad reputation alienates him from society, and he doesn't have much of a chance in life because of it. In one of the most heartbreaking scenes, he tells Gordie about how a teacher cold-heartedly took advantage of his bad reputation, when he tried to return some money he stole. Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman) is a somewhat crazy and disturbed kid, who loves his dad (only because he was a WW2 veteran), who nearly burned off his ear on a stove. Teddy is sarcastic, and rude, but in a rather nice way, and would still be a good friend.Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell) is the main source of the movie's humor. He is a squeamish, cry-baby, scaredy-cat. He insists that Gordie doesn't tell any horror stories, and is worried about the dumbest things (a coyote, a dog, the results of a coincidental coin flip). He is really just a tag along, who is always being picked on by the rest of the gang, particularly Teddy (who frequently punches him, and gives him two more for flinching). He is the one who learns about the body's whereabouts, and gives the others the idea for the quest.The dead body is really just a set up for a series of adventures that the boys have on their journey. They nearly get run over by a train on a bridge in one scene, and in another they face a mythical junkyard dog. And when they find the body, they have to face a ruthless gang of older kids led by Ace (Keifer Sutherland), who are also after the body. They have campfires, and share a bond that is very touching. Any guy who has ever had a group of friends can relate to the antics of these four boys. They cuss like sailors, smoke, and do other things that they wouldn't do with their parents around. The way these boys talk, and act is very accurate to the way kids their age are (though their insults are very old and 50's). I was their age not long ago, and was exactly like that. The ultimate example of the phrase "boys will be boys" is depicted in hilarious detail in this film. There is a sequence of gross- out humor when Gordie tells a story he wrote about a massively obese kid nicknamed "Lardass," who takes revenge on his tormentors by entering a pie-eating contest with funny, but gross intentions. That scene is very, very disgusting, but is a silly, lighthearted way, and when you see it, you'll understand what I mean. Boys really love that stuff.The movie has a very tragic ending, that is still heartwarming. It really makes you cherish your friends more, and brings you closer to them. Every pre-teen should see this, but unfortunately, few kids I know actually enjoyed it. They usually thought it was corny and boring. This movie may be slightly sappy at times, but it is all for good purpose, and makes you feel great. Also, it is the complete opposite of boring. Every scene is interesting in some way. The scenes are either hilarious, heart-wrenching, or heartwarming. Sometimes even suspenseful. I cherish this movie, and recommend it to EVERYONE. Watch it now, and love it. 9/10.Stand By Me is rated R for Language Including Sexual References, and Some Crude Humor. Sex: 4/10 Violence: 5/10 Swearing: 7/10 Drugs: 5/10</fullReview>

But, they day after I watched it on TV, I rushed to the store and bought it. It's been about 2 weeks and I have seen it so many times, and yet, every time, I laugh and cry the same as I did the time before. After I bought the movie, I had two of my best friends come over and see it. I knew they would love it just as much as I did. Sometimes my parents actually have to drag me out of bed in the morning because I stayed up so late watching it the night before.

		<fullReview>I'd have to say that this movie is my favorite movie of all time. It's an incredible, sentimental tale of four boys, Chris, Gordie, Teddy, and Vern and their quest to find the body of Ray Brower. This movie had me right when I saw the charm of it. During the movie you get to see into the lives of the boys, and you find that this movie is really about friendship, and needing your friends through hard times. Stand By Me also has a few funny wise cracks, and times that will pull at your heartstrings. I think the ability to include so many different aspects in one movie is fantastic, and definitely a worthwhile film. I recommend Stand By Me to anybody and everybody- I can't think of many people who wouldn't enjoy this "coming of age story" that will grab you and catch your attention just like it has mine, over and over again, not matter how many times i watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitive teen coming-of-age drama - NOT a comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is virtually the definitive teen coming-of-age drama story filled with fondness for the 60s - (with a ripper soundtrack); and setting a major film trend in the late 80s/early 90s. It's poignant and melancholic with some comic asides - but definitely NOT the great fun comic story that most professional film critics ranked it as.***Spoiler warning***IMHO, the best comedy scene is the one where Chris and Gordie find the gun ("don't worry, it's not loaded...")! The story Gordie tells is also funny, but the characters are very self-conscious about it, due to the fact that they're snickering all the way through it, which means it's not really funny for the audience.But one of the best proofs this is not a comedy is the climactic line "We decided that an anonymous phone call would be sufficient" - which I rank as one of the most anti-climactic lines in the history of cinema! After going through all the hassle and drama of the whole movie in order to become famous and get away from their drab lives. And after defeating the bullies and seeing the body, they just chuck it in at the end. If this was a comedy, the characters would have tried to become rich and famous (even though they probably would have failed.)By the way, in answer to one of the questions posed in the movie, Goofy is a dog. In fact, as an interesting bit of trivia, he was originally going to be called Dippy Dawg.Still this is a very good dramatic storyline about young teenagers going on an adventure and discovering things about life and themselves (even if that is an old plot line clich). And I highly recommend viewers to check the the Mad magazine spoof version of this movie; it's a dead-set spot-on parody.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Happened to Lardass?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.The first duty of a filmmaker is to worry about how to transport the viewer into the special world they have in mind. The hard way to do this is by devising a very strong narrative. Expert filmmakers then worry about the identity of the camera.The simple way to do it is to just evoke a feeling, the bane of countless genre films. But sometimes you can strike gold by making `personal' films. Here is about the only one I can recall that works. It's very risky.This is a highly abstract film. Essentially nothing happens. The four characters exist without much visual reference to the rest of the world: some punks drift in and out, a junkyard worker, few others. Four characters, boys who are young enough to behave exactly as stereotypes and not have the audience revolt. The stereotypes go through just what one would expect, but that doesn't matter because that's not where the value is: it is all in the very fresh here and now and the dialog that creates the ephemeral moment.Lots and lots of great one-liners. That's the magic of this project.Reiner knows this, or perhaps King. (I haven't read the story.) That's the point of the story within the story. The story has no real story to it, only a mood. If this were real boys it would be a diarrhea joke, but vomit is good enough. Reiner follows the hard rule that the story within the story has to be abstracted from the movie the same distance that the movie is from real life.Check out the berry connection.The comment from the listening boys is an inside joke: `but what happens to Lardass?' That story is the same type as this one. It is all about situation, not movement. All about not growing up, not about growing up. All about the moments, not the consequences of those moments: the junk man will call their Dads. The thugs will threaten violence. None of the boys will keep the secret of the body. Since we are relieved of the consequences, of the very notion of dynamic narrative, we can steep in an artificial zen of remembered childhood. It works.The only blot is Richard Dreyfuss whose job it is to frame this and provide the bridge to `reality.' What's needed is a writer's stance, someone who lives in the frame, not the framed. Instead, Dreyfuss places himself in the world of the kids. But his posturing, all his mechanical acting just dumps the stereotypes of the kids on his shoulders and on him it is not charming. The right stance would be that of Michael Douglas at the end of `Wonder Years.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like busboys in a restaurant.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Stand By Me, Rob Reiner has perfectly captured what it means to be a adolescent male among adolescent males. The story is built from the ground up, through anecdotes, gossip and whispers that may or may not be hard truths. Reputation is everything to these boys. We may never see the addled war veteran that is Teddy's abusive father, or the alcoholic criminals in Chris' family that give him such a bad reputation, but we feel their presence through their pained, clipped dialogue and the taunts of others. And still these bad people become dysfunctional male role models; Teddy fiercely defends the man who held his ears up against the oven, although he does not know why, and Gordie is fighting for the approval of parents who could not care less about him. So what do they do? They lean on each other, of course. They have neither the knowledge or maturity to excel at the job, but momentarily prop each other up and distract themselves with fantasies of fame and fortune that might come with discovering a dead body. And even as they find it, and realise that it has little practical use, they stubbornly fight for their right to the corpse because their reputation and face is at stake. It is a symbolic victory, but while the real objective of the journey is scarcely valuable, what it does it open up emotional crevasses that have been hidden deeply by layers of development masculinity, sarcasm and ineffection. These are boys who think the most important truths of the world are that if you flinch you get punched in the arm, and what lies deep underneath takes the strongest of bonds to not be immediately deemed 'pussy'.The acting reflects this mindset. It is full of performances that are doubly layered; they act braver than they admit, and as tears are finally shed they are already hurriedly trying to brush them away. River Phoenix is unsurprisingly the stand out; his sharp features betray a youth that has already been corrupted and hurried along, and the forced stoicism in each word of his dialogue reminded us that he has been asked to grow up much sooner than he should have to. Reiner captures that moment in between - in a few years or so they might become like Ace and his goons, nearing adulthood and wielding the prime days of their physical dominance and irresponsibility with evil relish. In King's original novel the adult Ace makes another appearance in the future epilogue, no longer the bully he once was. The framed narrative is where it slightly stumbles. It allows Reiner some room to breath - to make a two day trip seem like an epic odyssey in the eyes of the boys, to wink as chopper's true nature is revealed, to subtly suggest that Lard-Ass is really just Gordie's attempt at comforting his friend. But ultimately the story-within-a-story structure somewhat tames the screen's events; they have been filtered and sanitised for what will be another bestseller for the future successful writer. The voice-over at times sounds bored, and robs the moment of true emotional poignancy. I'm reminded of the final words that show at the end of American Graffiti, and how they hit like a truck. But there's enough here to definitely strike a powerful chord with at least a few, in particular those who have never forgotten the urgency and intensity of their troubled teenage lives, and the friendships that keep them afloat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredibly important and profound story - this movie is a life-altering experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no questioning the significance of this film, describing a period in time and the way society was during that time, but what has amazed me, the second time viewing it, is the purity that characterizes this movie, and in particular its 4 main characters. This movie is so smart in describing the complexities of the minds of four young teens, how their nature and nurture has shaped them into the personalities they now carry, and how these traits and characteristics are influenced and changed themselves throughout moments in life, and by interacting with others. There is almost a post-war melancholy lingering over the air in this town of Oregon, Portland where these four kids happen to live in 1956. This group of friends bond over the support and comfort they find in each other, being 4 kids trying to survive in a period of their lives where everything is so intense and confusing, and where they've found themselves pretty much on their own, without the support of their families. The bravery of these four kids (and yes, even Vern's) inspires me, their willingness to plough on and to continually try to make sense of what this world has given them. The screenwriter and director have created incredibly profound and deep characters in these kids, while still not taking away their innocence and youth. When I watch the games they play, the manners they use, I'm reminded of the things I held important in that truly magical time of my life, like the sacred importance of a pinky swear, or the two punches for flinching annoyance. To me this is a story that pretty much any person can relate to, as it symbolizes a period in the life of someone where they felt lost, terrified, completely isolated, but not defeated. The need that Gordie feels to find the dead body is essentially a need to make sense of it all, of the things that happened in his life; why his brother had to die, why his dad never seemed to show any interest in him, why he felt he would never be able to amount to anything. These four kids are oppressed in a society that treats them with indifference and where they're victims of incessant bullying, and through this journey, they are able to fight through those feelings by exposing themselves to situations that push them to the brink and essentially, make them face those emotions of injustice head on. When I compare the world that these kids live in to the one my generation lives now, one thing remains the same: it is exhausting a job to try to make sense of everything that is happening around you. And in a world where nothing seems to be right and within your control, these kids find a mission that makes sense to them, one simple adventure that no one can take away from them, something that is within their control. And through this simple plan that only they have thought of, through this journey outside the confinements of this empty town they were brought up in, they could find the strength to face their deepest fears and to be the most vulnerable, in the company of true friends, where no real judgement and mockery can be found. Not all of these 4 heroes ended up truly succeeding in life, and that's okay because the truth is few of us will ever reach a true sense of achieving in life. But just like the narrator of this story, as long as we are able to remember that period in our lives that was the toughest, yet the most magical and intense period of our youth, as long as we find people to share a trip to the woods like these teens did, then we will capture a moment, a moment in our lives that was shared and experienced with certain souls that will never truly go away. And maybe a life filled with moments like these will truly suffice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thoroughly unforgettable coming of age film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, based on the novel 'The Body' by Stephen King, one of the astounding authors of our generation; comes a mesmerizing story of growing up and the emotional dilemmas in the lives of youths. Directed by Rob Reiner, this film tells the story of four 12-year old boys living in a tranquil town of Castle Rock, Oregon in the late 50s: Gordie Lachance (played by Wil Wheaton), a sensitive kid who faces disillusion by his father after the death of his older brother Denny and thus, feels lonely at home; Chris Chambers (played by River Phoenix), a tough, but peace-loving boy who is labeled by many as a bad kid after he was caught stealing milk money at school, and is plagued by guilt after since the incident; Teddy Duchamp (played by Corey Feldman), a flamboyant young man with abusive, war veteran father who once held his son's ear to the stove, requiring him to wear an ear piece; and Vern Tessio (played by Jerry O'Connell), a down-to-earth and overly cautious kid who also deals with a rude older brother. These preteens spend their summer in a tree house playing cards, smoking, and telling tall tales, until they hear the news about a dead kid their age gone missing after being hit by a train. So the four boys set out on a quest in search of him with nothing standing their way but a gang of older kids lead by bully Ace Merrill (played by Kiefer Sutherland). This story told is from narration by an older age Gordie (played by Richard Dreyfuss). Rarely have I seen a coming-of-age film so powerful and moving as this one. This is a rare film that dives deeply into the quandaries of growing up as a young teen, and director Rob Reiner does this exceptionally well, as do the writers. The film presents us with a story of four young teens who go on an adventure, and learn more about themselves than they ever imagine, and as story goes, we watch as witness how the lives of these kids change and how they learn the true meaning of friendship. These characters develop so well throughout the picture, and the performances these actors are so touching; it is incredibly difficult not to care for these characters. When the film hits its emotional spots, you can just about feel the emotions the characters are facing, especially, for an example, in the scene when Gordie and Chris have a gut wrenching discussion about the hatred Chris deals with after an incident school. This is such an rewarding achievement done by Rob Reiner. There are some parts that will make you laugh, then there are some parts that can have you choked up, maybe even shed some tears. Yes, as this is Rated R, the characters do use some swearing and smoke in scenes here and there, but the film presents this in a subtle way to where it is not exploitative or gratuitous.Stand By Me is a riveting coming of age film I may never forget, and probably one of the most memorable coming of age films its decade. Rob Reiner did a tremendous job with the film as well as the cast who put on mesmerizing performances. This is also a film that is quite realistic that many teens could relate to in ways. If you haven't seen this film, please watch this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding Performances, especially from River Phoenix</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only discovered this movie in the summer but as soon as I started watching it I knew I would never forget it. As I didn't know any of the cast because the movie was out before my time I looked them up, River Phoenix being of particular interest. As soon as I saw that River had actually passed in 1993 my heart sunk a little bit, his acting in Stand By Me is incredible and definitely some of the best acting I've ever seen. I have took it upon myself to watch all of Rivers films, he was a very talented but underrated actor and my heart hurts for such a tragedy to have happened to him. All of the boys provide an outstanding performance, from the heart breaking scenes of Chris Chambers crying his eyes out to the boys insulting each other and uncontrollably laughing. When I found out River actually couldn't stop crying after they shot his crying scene I truly felt for him. The ending when Ben. E Kings, Stand By Me plays I got shivers as the song just sums up the film. This film is a true masterpiece and I hope that its legacy lives on for a very long time as it is truly amazing and will forever be a favourite of mine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing, realistic and nostalgic experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't read Stephen King's novel and I wasn't really sure if I was going to like this movie or not. My expectations were high, though. And it turned out to be one of my favorite movies of all time! The first thing that shocks you and leaves you speechless is the maturity of the main actors. Their acting seems to be so real, so down-to-earth and yet fascinating. I am not much of an emotional person and I do not often cry over movies, because there is always an inner voice telling me: This is not real, this is art, it is supposed to be entertainment. But this... It just hit me as hard as it could, I found myself with tears filling my eyes even the day after watching it. I am only 17, and I know that life is ahead of me, but for some reason it just made me feel nostalgic and old. It made me somehow regret watching it, but at the same time I want to watch it over and over again. I am not a movie expert, but for me - this was not a movie. This was my childhood, my memories, my desperate wish to turn back time. And maybe some more competent people criticize particular parts of this movie (for example, the main actors smiled in some scenes even though they were supposed to be serious), but for me these "flaws" made this movie perfect and real. They reminded me of me and my squad when we were that age, our pointless conversations, fights, joking, crying... For me, this movie is by far the best picture of that innocent stage in our lives. And a raw reminder that you'll never be that young and free again. But there are memories that help us. Memories - and things like this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wistful and sentimental classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a touching film where four friends go on a journey through the woods and countryside to find the body of a missing boy. Throughout the journey, they learn more about themselves, dealing with adversities and friendship.Set in 1959, this film gives off a wistful and nostalgic atmosphere of the good old and bygone days. Even if the four friends' goal is to locate a missing body, something that is no less ghastly, the plot's centering around the friends' bond and life challenges gives off a taste of innocence and courage. Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell all did an excellent job portraying the four friends, showing off their young-at-heart vibes but also showing that they're mature enough to face down life's adversities, from dealing with their dysfunctional families to standing up to a gang of punks headed up by a young Kiefer Sutherland.In watching this film, you will feel sentimental, yet optimistic, and you will also feel a sense of adventure and humor where appropriate. Great cinematography from Thomas Del Ruth, capturing a nice 1950's aura, and great direction by Rob Reiner, keeping the plot engaging and well-paced. This film really reminds you of the sadly bygone days of America's innocence, but also offers a ray of hope for the future generations. From the film's title to the song of the same name sung during the ending credits, this adds onto the very heartfelt drama this film offers and is a movie that one should see. Grade A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coming-of-age drama from the pen of Stephen King</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a certain irony that one of the most mature films to come from the pen of Stephen King is the one based on a group of kids in the 1950s. Yet this is far from a children's film, instead it's a thoroughly dark coming-of-age drama that explores what it means to be growing up in a realistically downbeat world, as childhood innocence is abandoned in favour of harsh adult reality.It's also a cracking "gang of kids" drama, stylistically similar to the likes of THE GOONIES and THE MONSTER SQUAD and even sharing some of the same cast members, albeit with a much more realistic theme. The film is set in 1950s Maine on a hot summer day, where a gang of lads decide to track down the body of a boy hit by a train in return for a reward.In reality it's an excuse for lots of adventures with trains, leeches, and junkyard owners, as well as a nasty antagonist played with gleeful relish by Kiefer Sutherland. There's plenty of crudity here alongside that infamous gross-out pie eating contest, but it's surprisingly mature too with deep characters and genuine performances. River Phoenix is the one who really shines (RIP), but Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell really nail it too. Perhaps the wraparound scenes with Richard Dreyfuss are a little too sentimental, but it's not enough to detract from STAND BY ME being a minor classic of the decade. Great soundtrack too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Soundtrack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stand by Me is a coming of age film starring Will Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, and Jerry O'Connell. The Movie is based upon the novel by Stephen King, "The Body." Four childhood friends embark on an adventure to find the body of a missing boy. The four friends are different from each other and each have their demons that they are battling. Throughout the film, their issues are unfolded which lead to the choices they make. Will Wheaton plays the lead, Gordie Lachance, a quiet, reserved character who is living in his late brother's shadow and with a resentful father, he bears guilt. River Phoenix plays Chris Chambers, who came from a bad family and is known as a thief. Corey Feldman plays Teddy Duchamp, a known physically abused kid. Jerry O'Connell plays Vern Tessio, the pathetic, easily teased, "fat kid". The editing effectively guides the audiences' thoughts, associations, and emotional responses right from the beginning sequence. In the beginning, we see the storyteller, played by Richard Dreyfuss, sitting in his pickup, looking into the distance as two young teens pedal by on their bicycles. He looks at a news article telling of a person's death. The camera zooms in slow motion focusing in on the expression of Dreyfuss' character who looks deep in thought. The zoom transitions into a start of a flashback as the narrator begins to voice-over the story. This one scene involves a massive amount of editing in such a small amount of time. The music in the background also sets an emotional tone. The kids on bicycles riding by, perhaps foreshadows that the story is about kids that age. And who is the person in the article of the paper? Will we find out? This scene is a great example of smooth continuity and coherence.During the scene at the junk yard, involving Chopper, the infamous, scary, guard dog, sound effects come into play. The invisible dog sound effects are effective. These sound effects of a dog barking evoke a mood and atmosphere of fear for Gordie and the others which creates drama of what's to come next. The camera angle is also focused on Gordie's face and it's only after he makes it safely over the fence that we see that less intimidating Chopper. This same effect reminds me of the scene in the movie, The Sandlot, where a similar effect was achieved. The sound effects along with the filming of the scene creates the mood of suspense right before the object, the dog, is shown. It achieves a greater effect by leaving it to the audience's imagination. The movie is a great coming of age film, riveting, and nostalgic for many. I grew up loving this film at about the same age as the leading characters. I also am a fan of the fantastic soundtrack that was included in the plot line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Books into movies...some times they work some times they don't but Stephen King always works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this movie many times but still love it as much as I did 30 years ago!! Stephen King writes awesome stories which turn into awesome movies for the most part. This movie about boyhood friends who decide to become heroes by finding the body of a boy hit by train. As they travel they learn the true bonds of friendship. I love the soundtrack and the fact that Richard Dreyfuss narrates is a plus! It stars most of 80s-early 90s crushes. River Phoenix and Wil Wheaton are wonderful as Chris(Phoenix) and Gordie(Wheaton). I loved Corey Feldman's Teddy and even overweight,naive Verne(Jerry O'Connell before his days as a slim cutie Derek from Scream 2). Keifer Sutherland always made a great bad boy and of course that made him more attractive in this. My favorite character through the whole film has to be Gordie's deceased brother Denny played by John Cusack. I have this movie on a 2-disc set DVD set but I still have it on my DVR for easy viewing access. If you enjoy coming of age movies or Stephen King I really believe you'll enjoy this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Making At It's Finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stand By Me is movie making at it's finest. It is a highly professional piece of work, with a good sense of pace and atmosphere it makes for perfect entertainment.Plot In A Paragraph: After the death of a friend, a writer (Richard Dreyfuss) tells the story of how along with three friends he went looking for a dead body when he was twelve. The likable cast is headed by Will Wheaton, Cory Feldman, Jerry O'Connell and the late River Pheonix, with the strong support from Kiefer Sutherland, John Cusak and Casey Siemaszko. I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here, there is not a weak link among them, especially the four young boys, While Wheaton carries the majority of the movie, Feldman gives one of the best performances of his career and O'Connell gets the majority of the laughs. I hate to say any one of the actors steals the movie as all of the young cast are superb, but Pheonix is the star of the show. he was always reliable, but here he is truly awesome. His death at such a young age was tragic. One can't help but wonder what other wonderful films we may have missed out on. Sutherland is perfectly cast as the bully. And I need to mention Dreyfuss's voice over. His delivery is superb. The full soundtrack is excellent too, not just the title track, the score is another valuable asset to the movie. Simply Rob Reiner could not have made a better movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite Stephen king adaptations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Something about Stephen King's writing seems to lend itself particularly well to the screen, which has spawned such film classics such as The Shawshank Redemption and The Shining. Of all of these, I found Stand by Me, based on King's novella The Body, to have the most aesthetic quality and universal appeal. To begin with, I found King's book the be one of the best coming of age stories I have read which follows in the tradition of Huckleberry Finn (in that children are forced to deal with life's harsh realities too soon) and Rob Reiner and company were able to faithfully capture that on the screen. Film adaptations of literature should usually be more focused than their source material, and Stand by Me accomplishes this in droves. The stand out for me, like so many others have expressed, were the performances of the four main child actors which should have been appreciated with golden statuettes. They present a perfect blend of maturity and gradually lost child like innocence. I would recommend this film to anyone (though children should mind the R rating).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty cool...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young boy and his misfit friends are the main protagonists of this movie as they go off to find a dead body and collect a possible reward from the cops. However, although this is a Stephen King film it isn't his usual horror stuff, this film takes place in the 1950's and is just a coming-of-age adventure film.The acting was great especially for child actors, the plot was interesting and it had both sad and funny moments, as well as some great nostalgic soundtrack.My one complaint? Well, I was a kid once, everyone was, and I've never heard kids swear as much as they do in this film, even when they're alone... maybe in the 50's swearing from kids was more common? That's just a minor thing though; overall this film was entertaining from start to finish. I can't say it was thrilling or suspenseful but it was pretty cool.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Time That Memories Are Made Of.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An authentic portrayal of childhood, a heartwarming rendition of friendship &amp; a pleasant shot of nostalgia, Stand By Me is an elegantly crafted coming-of-age drama that today ranks amongst the finest examples of its genre, and deservingly so. Packed with sincere performances from its young but terrific cast, this film's real strength lies in the right balance it finds in each of its filmmaking aspects &amp; the manner in which it captures the time that memories are made of.Based on a Stephen King's novella &amp; told in flashback by a writer recounting his boyhood journey after learning of his friend's demise, Stand By Me is set in the town of Castle Rock and concerns a group of 4 adolescent boys who take a hike across the countryside to find the missing body of a dead kid in order to become local heroes. The adventure turns out to be life-changing experience for them as they learn more about themselves, the nature of friendships &amp; the need to stand up for what's right.Rob Reiner's direction is admirable for the film is beautifully structured from start to finish &amp; has a serene atmosphere that adds an incredible amount of warmth to the whole story. Screenplay keeps the innocence of its characters alive while managing to subtly deal with its underlying themes. Cinematography is beautifully carried out, editing provides the drama its required pace to connect with the viewers &amp; the choice of music is tastefully done.Coming to the performances, Stand By Me features a young cast in Will Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman &amp; Jerry O'Connell in their respective roles of Gordie, Chris, Teddy &amp; Vern. And although everyone delivers fabulous performances, it's Wheaton &amp; Phoenix who end up impressing the most and played their part extremely well. The film is bookended by the shots of old Gordie, played by Richard Dreyfuss, who also chipped in finely in his short role.On an overall scale, Stand By Me is an ingenious example of a coming-of-age story that hasn't aged a day despite being nearly 30 years old and its themes remain as relevant today as they were during its years of release. A celebration of childhood, friendship, young passion &amp; the time when we were always curious to discover new things, this nostalgic masterpiece is an ode to those years in everyone's life when friendships is at its most pure, innocent &amp; selfless. Delightfully recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stand By Me a 1986 film. Based on The Body by: Stephen King directed by: Rob Riener</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stand By Me is a story of four best friends in the 1980s went on an adventurous trip to find a dead body. It turns out that they begin to come closer and learn more about each other. They are finding out who they are and who they will become.All four kids have parents who could careless about them. One of the main characters, Gordy, had an older brother Denny who died in an accident. Gordy's parents never pay any attention to him and when they do, they nag him about how he should be more like Denny. Gordy's best friend Chris has an alcoholic dad who could careless if he were dead. Chris if like a father from time to time with Gordy. He wants the best for him and he is always there for him.I learned a few lessons while watching this movie. No matter who it is, who ever doesn't believe in you, you don't give up. You need to be yourself with no worries. Don't let anyone expect you to be anyone else but yourself. Gordy's father expects him to be just like Denny. Denny was the only one who really believed kin him. Chris encourages him to not give up. It is amazing what he can do with his writing. Chris proves to Gordy how good of a friend he is by encouraging him to apply himself and that he wants the best for him.As the four boys, Chris, Gordy, Teddy, and Vern are on the trip they find out a little more about reality. They begin to realize that you can do anything if you apply yourself. Even if you don't have your parents who don't believe in you, you have at least one friend who does. That would be your best friend. The time of day and the soundtracks throughout the move really goes along with the plot line.I would definitely give this movie 10/10 stars. It has life lessons in it and can really show people that life in the 80s wasn't anything like it is now. It's a whole different perspective. It's really neat that it was filmed at that time period too!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You never have friends as good as the ones you had when you were twelve"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stand By Me is the story of one-of-a-kind friendships. The movie starts out with a man writing a book recalling that "you never have friends as good as the ones you had when you were twelve". The author is who the movie revolves around, Gordie Lachance. Gordie (Wil Wheaton), Chris (River Phoenix), Teddy (Corey Feldman), and Vern (Jerry O'Connell) are four friends who embark on a journey of their life at the age of twelve. They set out to find the body of a dead kid, whom Vern overhears his brother stating the boy's location, but the foursome end up facing many obstacles along the way including a bully, Ace, played by Keifer Sutherland. While the boys are going to a grim destination, the bond and adventure that they endure is one that will last them a lifetime. A theme of this film would be to enjoy your childhood because growing up sucks and happens way faster than you realize. Gordie realizes this after the death of his older brother at which point he becomes invisible to his parents. All four of the boys came back from their journey with a new sense of maturity. I think seeing the dead boy along with the run-in with Ace's gang contributed to that along with other iconic scenes such as sleeping in the woods, Chopper, and swimming with the leeches. Another good movie that has the same theme as Stand By Me would be The Goonies. Both movies have a group of kids set out on an adventure that end up growing a little on the way. The scene in which Gordie and Chris are talking about Gordie taking advanced classes when they go back to school uses lighting to contribute to the theme. The lighting is soft on Gordie which makes him seem very childlike and hard on Chris with makes him seem more mature. This was kind of ironic as Chris was the one that was supposed to be the trouble maker and who I think would be considered childish whereas Gordie is more mature most of the movie. For example, Gordie doesn't horse around as much as the other three boys. I think the radio music also contributed to the theme since it was happy 50's music used as a motif to portray happiness, which goes along with most childhood memories especially those with your friends. In conclusion, enjoy your childhood while you still have it. As this movie teaches the viewer, it goes by way too fast. We always seem to take time for granted and issues that occurred while we were young seemed such a big deal then but now we know that they were trivial compared to issues that we have to face as adults.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rob Reiner directed this adaptation of the Stephen King story 'The Body' in this reasonably successful coming-of-age drama about four young 12(or so) year old boys who decide to go searching for a body rumored to be in the woods some miles away, so they walk along the railroad tracks to the area, all the while talking about various things(television, comics, their parents, etc.) while trying to dodge the attentions of the local toughs(led by Kiefer Sutherland) who also want to see the body. When they finally do find it, is where life-long friendships will be forged, bullies faced down, in a time of their lives that they won't soon forget...Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman, River Phoenix, and Jerry O' Connell are all believable as the four friends, and the script is also realistic, though whether there was so much profanity back then is debatable, and some scenes(like the pie-eating contest) are obnoxious and silly. Framing device with "The Writer"(Richard Dreyfus) is nice, though not as emotionally cathartic as it believes. Worth watching for the cast and recreation of a specific time and place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stand by Me is a perfect book-to-movie adaptation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's great about acclaimed writer Stephen King is his diversity in his works. He may be regarded as the "master of horror," but not every novel put out by this author is not a suspenseful horror thriller. King has put out many smaller novels and novellas in addition to classics like "Carrie," "The Shining," and "The Stand." One of his best non-horror books is "Different Seasons," a collection of four novellas that focus on drama rather than horror. Three of the novellas were adapted to film, one of them being "The Body." Renamed Stand by Me when adapted to film, the movie is a masterful book-to-movie adaptation, with a simple yet effective story, extremely well-written and well acted characters, and a perfect recreation of the late 1950s.Stand by Me follows four twelve year old boys as they follow the railroad tracks of Castle Rock, Oregon, looking for a dead body which has not been recovered. Each of the four boys has a quirk or flaw to them. Gordie Lachance, the main protagonist of the story, is emotionally scarred from the death of his brother and the lack of attention from his parents. Chris Chambers, Gordie's best friend, a wrongly accused criminal from a family of alcoholics and criminals. Teddy Duchamp is the fun loving member of the bunch, but he's physically scarred by his mentally insane father. Vern Tessio, Teddy's best friend, is overweight and picked on by the boys, usually in good fun, of course.Along their trip, the boys encounter several small trials that test them physically, as well as emotionally. One of the main trials is a gang of older bullies and thugs, led by "Ace" Merrill. Ace and his crew are also looking for the body in order to be town heroes. These trials teach the four young boys about the importance of friendship, as well as the inevitable realism of growing up and entering adulthood.The fact that the story is so simple and relatable makes it all the more charming. Stephen King's novella was perfectly adapted to the screen by Raynold Gideon and Bruce A. Evans, earning the duo an often overlooked Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. The themes of growing up and facing adulthood are some that everyone goes through at some point, so it's simple to relate to the characters and their reactions. Even better, the movie is even more relatable as viewers age upon watching the movie, realizing that there was so much that was right about the thoughts of adulthood and growing up. The well-written story was acted perfectly by four amazing young talents. Wil Wheaton's Gordie Lachance was really well done, garnering Wheaton his widespread acclaim as an actor. Wheaton was relatable, emotional, and charming. Corey Feldman plays an absolutely hilarious Teddy Duchamp, but does so without diluting the charm of his character. Jerry O'Connell's performance as Vern Tessio is probably the weakest of the four, but he is still quite a likable and funny character. The real scene stealer, without a doubt, is the late River Phoenix as Chris Chambers. Every time his character speaks, it's near impossible not to relate to what he has to say. Phoenix brings everything he has to the role, often leaving you on the verge of crying.The icing on the delicious cake is the fact that director Rob Reiner was able to create a perfectly constructed atmosphere of the 1950s. Everything from the hairstyles and outfits to the cars all match the decade very well. What matches it perfectly, however, is the soundtrack. Songs like The Chordettes' "Lollipop," The Coasters' "Yakety Yak," Jerry Lee Lewis' "Great Balls of Fire," and the inspiration of the movie's title itself, Ben E. King's "Stand by Me."Stand by Me is a perfect book-to-movie adaptation. Rob Reiner adapted King's novella with fantastic charisma, making the film relatable, charming, funny, and emotional to everyone. The script is satisfying well-written, and perfectly acted by the quartet of young actors, and a well made atmosphere that recreated the 1950s. Stand by Me stands as one of the best coming-of-age movies, one of the best book-to-movie adaptations, and one of the best movies to ever grace the silver screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off I'm just putting it out there. This is my favourite movie of all time :)I love the innocence of the boys who think they are tough and can handle an adventure to see a dead body. Takes guts or at least stupidity and ignorance. As all groups of friends seem to have a leader, it seemed fitting that the smartest and the toughest, Chris got the spot. It was great to see both sides to all 4 boys. they each had their tough outside demeanour but on the inside they were all as damaged as the other. -maybe not vern as much hahaWhat makes the movie stand out as a 'Great' is that is deals with an important issue all the while showcasing the true meaning of friendship. Although i love romantic movies one of the better things about this movie is that it doesn't deal with all the dramas of girls and relationships instead it focuses on a group of friends in their youth before girls became the most important things in their life.I personally recommend this movie to everyone who has taste. (my sister hates the movie but thats because she wouldn't know a good movie if it hit her in the face) Trust me... 'Stand By Me' is one of the best movies you will see :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>coming of age masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I LOVED this masterpiece. I'm also a big fan of Stephen King and read 'Different Seasons' years before this came out; had no idea it was based on 'The Body' but should have known since it has Kings' unmistakable imprints all over it. King adaptations seem to be either boring flops or home runs - The Shining, Shawshank - Stand By Me was a Grand Slam. No movie has transported me back to childhood as effectively other than, perhaps "A Christmas Story" (Ralphie gets a BB-gun). This is a character study of 4 young boys growing up in small-town 1950's, not the typical Hollywood pabulum of plastic people mumbling mindless dialogue while surrounded by CGI explosions and idiotic karate fight scenes churned out for the short attention-span masses. The 4 actors - Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Connell - were simply great, I couldn't single out one exceptional performance they were all so good. Even Kiefer Sutherland was effectively creepy as the town bully foreshadowing his future character in 'The Lost Boys'. Rob Reiner has created a timeless classic and certainly one of the best 'coming of age' movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indeed, one of the best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Labor Day Weekend of 1959 for four boys in Castle Rock, OR, would turn out to be the best weekend for them, for as news of a dead teenage boy's body found outside town would turn that into such a weekend that they will never forget.Based on Steven King's The Body - part of his story collection Different Seasons - Stand by Me (I've watched that movie before in HBO several times) is one of the best coming of age films ever made, and one of Rob Reiner's best directed movies ever.Told first hand by one of the boys years after that weekend, this movie is a tale of friendship and growing up that everyone should like.Staring Wil Wheaton as Gordie Lachance (and later more famous in his 3-year stint in Star Trek:The Next Generation as Wesley Crusher), the (sadly) late River Phoenix as Chris Chambers, Corey Feldman (one of the Goonies) as Teddy Duchamp and Jerry O'Connell as Vern Tessio with John Cusack and Kiefer Sutherland in other roles plus Richard Dreyfuss serving as the narrator (and the adult Gordie), this was one of the best hit movies (and teenage movies for that matter) that made 1986 one of the best. What a great adaptation it was of a Steven King work and BTW Different Seasons was the source book for two more successful adaptations of King's works in film: The Shawshank Redemption and Apt Pupil.The finale somewhat mirrors what happened to the four lead actors after the movie was made, but we all know that friendships truly last forever indeed and we can always remember what it was like to had one.To paraphrase Dreyfuss's final line: I had so many great friends when I was 12 and preparing to graduate from my school in Makati in the Philippines that I will always truly remember. Jesus, does anyone?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another adaptation of a short novel by horror writer Stephen King, although this time around the original story, The Body is not a scary one but a drama about preteen boys growing up in a small town.Rob Reiner; formerly well known as meat head on All in the family, does a marvelous directing job turning Kings work into a first rate film depicting the journey of four friends looking for the body of a missing classmate. He was apparently run over by a train. River Phoenix, Jerry O'Connell, and Corey Feldman play the youngsters and Wil Wheaton is Gordie, the narrator of the story told through flashbacks with Richard Dreyfuss taking over as the adult Gordie. The four encounter the local bully, Ace(Kiefer Sutherland) and his cronies along the way and they also learn a great deal about each other on their adventurous quest. Stand by me is one of the better Stephen King inspired movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has become a cult classic. A brilliant adaptation of Stephen King's book, the Rob Reiner adaptation shines brighter as the years wear on.Who hasn't ridden through the great state of Oregon on a train and wondered if they were passing through some of the same scenery used in the film? Who didn't secretly wish as a young boy to have had the same chance to escape for a few days of adventure.Jeff Burleson &amp; Geoff Chisholm and the rest of the lighthouse keepers at Safe Harbor Northwest heartily recommend it as a heartwarming story set in a simpler time.Stand by your friends.

		<shortDescription>Nice ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only realized it was based on a novel written by Stephen King with the credits roll. No wonder the script is brilliant! the story goes like this, 4 teenage boys go on a walking trip to see a dead body of another teenage boy who have been missing for days. On their way you start knowing about each of them and their backgrounds. The movie was produced in 1986 and is told as a flash back from the main character's memories of 1960's.I must admit the directing was spot on! it kept me interested the whole time, I didn't want to pause the movie for a minute. I think because the movie is set mostly outdoors, the lighting was really good, even scenes set indoors had the same quality of lighting.Again the script was beautiful, you can relate to each and every word these 4 teenage boys talk about. It draws you back to the times where the biggest questions we faced were about Micky Mouse and Goofy. Another thumps up to the 4 kids, I didn't feel for a second they were acting a role, they were incredibly professional. My favorite character was Teddy Duchamp by Corey Feldman, he was the little crazy teenage boy. There were few scenes when you could tell they are trying hard to show a certain emotion like crying, but it works.Oh, almost forgot, soundtracks were fabulous! I loved them all, but here to share my two favorites. Lollipop by The Chordettes (it might be a little cheesy, but its lovely)also the main soundtrack of the movie Stand By Me by Ben E.King (its very touching)The few things that I didn't like about the movie, was it felt a little bit teenagy, like teenagers would like it more, however I absolutely loved the movie, it kept me interested, it made feel nostalgic and I simply enjoyed it. I would defiantly say its worth watching (and worth being on the top250 list) and would see it again and again, no doubt. its-lalas-land.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic beyond belief for what it is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Stand By Me" truly is epic beyond belief for what it is. This is due to various reasons. 1). Its cast is mainly children. Quite often films with casts children dominated lack quality acting as the youngsters simply have just not been in the business long enough to be able to deliver impressive performances. However "Stand By Me"'s young cast all are believable and show great chemistry. River Phoenix in particular is amazing as the brave , yet troubled "Chris". 2). The film is very very short. Quite often the best films are around 2 hours in length. Often this duration is necessary for a film to drum up enough depth for it to stay with the viewer long after the credits. "Stand By Me" has no trouble going into decent amounts of depth and staying with the viewer in only 85 minutes. Its nice to watch a film which doesn't drag on. There is too many of that these days. 3).The focus of this film is on children so you would think it would probably only appeal to a childish audience.Yet it doesn't. It deals with some heavier material than initially expected but this is welcomed by more mature viewers. Plus most of us value our childhoods so its childhood friendship content is refreshing to view as it encourages us to reminisce on our good times of our younger days. In saying that it is epic for what it is I guess it was always going to be in some ways as its written by arguably the most successful writer of the 20th century Stephen King. Richard Dreyfus (Jaws) plays a satisfying side role as the older "Gordie" who narrates the story. "Stand By Me" is an excellent film. i recommend it to anyone who values childhood, friendship or just wants to witness a fine and ultimately moving piece of cinema.

		<shortDescription>A convergence of brilliance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie combines the best of so many truly gifted artists. It's based on a Steven King short, directed by Rob Reiner and stars 4 perfectly cast and directed young actors. It runs the full gambit of emotion, in no way lessened by the youth of the characters of actors portraying them.No matter what your youth was like, this movie has some of your past in it. Anger, confusion, coming of age, finding independence, camaraderie with peers, standing up to bullies (or not), misunderstood or abusive parents, and most dramatically, finding the friends who get you through whatever you may face.And if you have the opportunity, you should definitely view the 'featurette': Walking the Tracks. The interviews with the actors, director and Steven King are as informative and entertaining as any special feature you'll ever watch. Among other things, hearing Rob Reiner talk about how he took 4 very young and completely inexperienced actors and made this movie is a true vision into the art of being the "Actor's Director".This one should be on everyone's favorite list. A solid 8+.But that's just my two scents. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death at an Early Age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"In a small woodsy Oregon town, a group of friends - sensitive Gordie (Wil Wheaton), tough guy Chris (River Phoenix), flamboyant Teddy (Corey Feldman), and scaredy-cat Vern (Jerry O'Connell) - are in search of a missing teenager's body. Wanting to be heroes in each other's, and their hometown's eyes, they set out on an unforgettable two-day trek that turns into an odyssey of self-discovery. They sneak smokes, tell tall tales, cuss 'cause it's cool, and band together when the going gets tough."When they encounter the town's knife-wielding hoods, who are also after the body, the boys discover a strength they never knew they had. 'Stand By Me' is a rare and special film about friendship and the indelible experiences of growing up. Filled with humor and suspense, it is based on the novella 'The Body' by Stephen King," according to the DVD sleeve description. The adaptation, by Raynold Gideon and Bruce A. Evans, is one of the best treatments of an original Stephen King story.Twelve-year-old kids from the 1950s were a lot more mature than I could imagine? Nevertheless, Rob Reiner orchestrates the film beautifully, recapturing feelings that die when puberty begins taking its toll. The four lads from the fifties are played by four young actors from the eighties, but the attitudes and feelings are timeless. This isn't a horror film, but it is all about death? dead cars in a junkyard, death-threatening trains, leeches in a swamp, the dead body at the end of the boys' quest... The protagonist's dead brother haunts the film. And, most of all, "Stand by Me" wistfully recalls the death of childhood.********* Stand by Me (8/8/86) Rob Reiner ~ Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Connell</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Title says everything, "Stand By Me"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has its own pace and the greatness of this film lies in the fact that it has one of the simplest plots yet the story telling is magical.Its about 4 close friends Chris, Vern, Teddy and Gordie who adventure out one day for an event they considered very important and life changing for themselves. During this adventure there are quite a few priceless moments that they share but few of them are pure GOLD like the camp-fire scene.It also has a great scene towards the end between young Gordie and Chris, which I absolutely loved. That brings me to the brotherhood Chris and Gordie shared, special mention of River Pheonix here, he played Chris and was truly amazing. Chris' character was the best according to me and the special relationship he shared with Gordie is very pleasing and heart melting to see. Almost everyone had friends like these when they were young {may not be exactly 12 years old} BUT thats not the point, We all had our special few before adulthood. Those days were really something else...All the irrelevant things now were very important then. Life was full of fun and carelessness.One point that instantly put this film on my favourites list is its ending. There are usually two kinds of ends to a film, one the satisfying/predictable and the other is shocking/unexpected. But this film has what I call the perfect ending. The last monologue was so true that I was amazed at its truth value...You will understand what I'm talking about once you see it {I don't want to spoil it for you}. Quite astonishing end and one I'll remember for a long time.Great, and a classic coming of age film that everyone will enjoy. If it had not shown young characters smoking I would've given it 10. But that doesn't take anything away from the film, its just that I didn't enjoy watching them smoke {I hate people who smoke...I know they probably faked it but the scene was not required IMO}.I give this a 9.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stand By Me is an amazing movie, to put it simply. All four of the young stars gave first rate performances, especially River Phoenix. I loved so much about this film, especially the scenes with Gordie and his brother, which were so touching. Some people criticize this movie because it depicts 12 year old boys as smoking, frequently cussing, and even making a clever joke about a touchy subject. To these critics, I say, "Nonsense!". It's those little details that make the story so believable, and even more important, so relateable. Bottom line: this is the ultimate coming-of-age movie. Boyz N the Hood, another outstanding movie, used to be my favorite movie, but now it is Stand By Me. Now I'm off to go enjoy some delicious cherry-flavored Pez!!! Ta-Ta for now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Stand By Me" will forever stand the test of time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of "Stand By Me" is a rather simple one. A group of four tightly-knit friends living in a small Oregon town, circa 1959, set out on foot to find a dead body. What could easily have been a routine Stephen King horror show is instead an often touching and nostalgic story about the purity and innocence of friendship before the teenage years and adulthood sets in and sours the deal. Director Rob Reiner's best film by far, the subject matter will hit close to home to anyone who has ever had close friendships that crumbled before their time, regardless of what you went through together.It helps that the actors who portray the foursome ? Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Connell and the later River Phoenix ? are about as natural as they come and have seemingly strong chemistry with one another. Watching the story pan out, you truly believe these friendships are real, and for such young actors, they manage to handle the tender and emotional moments of this 90 minute film quite well. The most notorious performance is that of Phoenix, whose budding career was tragically cut short when his life met an end eight years later at the hands of a drug overdose. While Phoenix manages to steal the show away from the lead, Wil Wheaton, it must be noted that the ensemble as a whole did an outstanding job. Heck, if Corey Feldman can make you like him in any film, you know an actor and their director have done their jobs right. The film focuses strictly on these four, with minor characters popping in and out of the past and present, and if the cast wasn't so strong, the movie would have easily fallen apart at the seams.With such a small running time, you'd think that the film is rather shallow, but such is not the case. Although more could have been expanded on (possibly this film's only true flaw), the story flows naturally as you share the ups and the downs with its characters. "Stand By Me" is a true classic in every sense of the word. It's got a significant amount of nostalgia, and it also has a bittersweet edge, both for its downbeat but true to life ending and for anyone who has lost similar bonds in their lives. The last lines of the writer in the film rings truest and sums up the film nicely: "I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve. Jesus, does anyone?"</fullReview>

I watched it when i was about 12 or 13 with my best friend and it definitely described us, our closeness and willingness to stick by each other no matter what. We have since lost touch with each other but i still think back often of the many good times we had together and all of the memories we made. back when you spent all summer long hanging out and having sleeping overs at your friends, before you had to worry about getting a summer job and everything else that comes with growing up. This movie makes you remember your youth and it's purity and the gift of close friends.this quote from the movie just about sums it up: "I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve.

		<fullReview>Another seminal 80's classic that passed me by until now. It's not actually set in the 80's though. Taken from the Stephen King novel "The Body", the plot takes us to 1959, where four 12 year old boys go on a search to find another child's remains. Sounds grim, but this is actually a heartwarming tale of friendship, and it really makes you look back and reflect on those great experiences you had when you were younger. The four young performers are excellent, particularly River Phoenix. He was such a natural performer, and delivered lines beautifully. There's a sad irony to his character too. All round excellent classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems that this film is not one that everyone is familiar with. I watched this movie when i was about 14 years old. My older cousin put it on when I was ill off school. Then when i spoke about it to my friends, they had never heard of it. I played it to all of my friends and they loved it. I most recently watched it with my Boyfriend and he also loved it and said that it brought back memories of childhood and made him wish he were 12 again.The film is innocent and moving. There are wonderful performances from each of the child actors. Especially the late River Phoenix. The boys want to be heroes and set out on a trek to find a missing boys body. Whilst on their Journey they bond with each other and discover themselves. They stick together when the going gets tough and the film portrays a true sense of friendship and 'growing up' I'm saddened by the ending, when we learn that the character Chris Chambers (River Phoenix) was killed. It is coincidental that River Phoenix has himself passed. i think because of this, it does indeed make the ending sadder.Overall it is a great film, It is both Humorous and tense. It also makes you want to be 12 again. a 10/10 and i recommend it to everyone.</fullReview>

We are both 15 but I like MArtin Scorsese and she still likes Disney channel. But we both loved this film. It was funny, sad, and heart-warming. We could identify with all the characters. I have never before seen such a cast of young talents. Even though this is Gordy's story, (played perfectly by Wil Wheaton) the real scene stealer is River Phoenix. He portrayed his characters pain and difficulty by his eyes and the way he delivered his lines. It was clear to the audience that he wasn't a bad boy but just a kid longing for attention.

		<fullReview>'Stand By Me' is the story of four kids who set out to find the body of a friend, they learn about each other and their friendship grows. Stand By Me is a fantastic film, a kind of guilty pleasure.The story is simple, four kids look for a body, see? simple. I was expecting more blood or gore from Steven King but it is very restrained and there is very little violence etc. for a 15 (at the time i guess, and it is a Steven King). The other, older gang is pretty tough and happy to speak and act in all kinds of outrageous ways, talking about progress with girlfriends or carving words or pictures into their arms with a knife. Believe me, this is shown pretty graphically in the film. The acting is top-notch, all the boys are portrayed well by brilliant actors, the late River Pheonix gives an especially great performance. Overall, a simple, but charming coming-of-age film. 8/10, a great film that rightly deserves its place in the top 250, if not the top 100. Star Wars? Move over!</fullReview>

It partly comes from the fact that i am 13 years old, and so i can really relate to what the characters are going through in this movie. There is nothing more sacred than the friendship of children. I can relate to this movie because of how Stephen King, and Rob Reiner had there characters act. Most movies with children portray them is goodie two shoes, who do whatever they are told. This movie has the four 12 year old boys, cussing, smoking, playing poker, and breaking all the rules.The movie stand by me is about four 12 year old boys. The sissy of the four, Vern (played by Jerry O'Connel) is underneath his porch searching for pennies that he had buried some time ago, when he overhears his brother, and his brother's friend talking about how they had passed the body of a dead boy, Ray Brauer. He than tells his gang about the conversation he overheard. The gang is made up of tough leader Chris (R.I.P.River Phoenix), main character Gordie (Wil Weaton), and crazy boy Teddy (Corey Feldman), all of which were cast perfectly although they in real life are a couple years older than the age they are playing.They than go on a quest to find the dead body and turn him so they can be heroes of their small town of Castle Rock, Oregon. However, Vern's brother's gang lead by Ace (Keifer Sutherland), is also on there way to becoming famous. It is a fabulous coming of age tale, with such memorable scenes as the leaches, the junkyard, and Gordies story. It is a movie NOT to miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brings Me Back To My Childhood...if Only It Was This Much Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen King makes a lot of good books and stories that turn into good movies, so I had high hopes for this one. And I was in no way disappointed.This is the story of 4 kids, on one last adventure before they are forced to grow up and move on with their lives. They all have/had misfortunes in their lives.There's the protagonist of the group, Gordie Lachance (Wil Wheaton), who is telling the story. Gordie's brother, Denny (John Cusack) had died the year earlier, and Gordie's parents still haven't accepted the loss, making an impact on Gordie.There is the mean kid with a soft heart, Chris Chambers (River Phoenix). Chris is pushed around by his brother, Eyeball (Bradley Gregg). People assume that because Eyeball is bad, that Chris is automatically bad as well, and Chris gets blamed for things he doesn't do.There is the "Joker" in the group, Teddy Duchamp. Teddy admires his dad for storming the beaches in Normandy back in WWII. However, Teddy is also plagued by the fact that his dad is in the "looney bin".Finally, there is the "pushover" of the group, Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell). Vern's only misfortune is that his friends don't respect him at all. He is always the butt of the jokes and whatnot.The story is moderately simple but entertaining enough: Vern is under his porch and he hears his older brother Billy (Casey Siemaszko), and his friend Charlie (Gary Riley) talking about the dead body of Ray Brower, a kid from school. Apparently, he was hit by a train and his body left in the woods. Gordie and his friends hear about this and set off to find it. However, Billy and Charlie tell Ace Merrill, the leader of the group, and Ace wants to find the body before Gordie and his friends do. Its a race between the 2 teams to find the body, Gordie's group walks the railroad tracks and cuts through the woods, while Ace's gang take a car. Along the way, Gordie's gang share memories, go on mini-side adventures, and just be kids for the limited time they still can.This was a very moving story. The characters the plot, the music, the atmosphere, all authentic and nicely done. If only all childhoods were this interesting. Oh well, one can dream, right? 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Shockingly Wonderful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first I had my doubts about the movie "Stand by Me". Usually I'm not a big fan of sentimental stories or coming-of-age flicks. I'm more into action films and intriguing battles, but "Stand By Me" was one of those rare coming-of-age stories that I found to be extremely riveting. The tale of four boys set out on a journey to search for a dead corpse didn't have much appeal like "The Goonies" where seven kids search for lost treasure. However, the kids from "Stand By Me" exceeds "The Gonnies" in terms of more believable characters and the story is centered more on the boys rather then the mission that they are on. The train track scene provided a very scary incident, though it was one of the more memorable scene in the movie. I literally yelled at the boys to "get off the damn tracks". The movie can boast an impressive soundtrack with classic rock and roll and doo-wop music that was widely listened to back in the late 1950's to create a nostalgic atmosphere during time when life was simpler. I was taken back a little bit by surprise that this movie was written by horror guru Stephen King (originally titled "The Body"). The meal ticket to this movie was superb acting by the four kids who would go on to become successful stars in their adulthood. Wil Wheaton was excellent as the intelligent, but poor self-esteemed Gordie Lachance who would grow up to follow his dreams to become a successful writer. Gordie feels left out in his family after the tragic death of of his brother Denny and is desperately yearning to find someone to encourage him in achieving his ambition. Corey Feldman turns in a hilarious role as the mentally unstable Teddy DuChamp. Like, Gordie, Teddy can't seem to find love in his family as well. His father has psychological problems. One day, Teddy's father tried to burn his ear off on an oven and got in trouble for that, making poor Teddy trying to find love. Jerry O'Connell was in top form as fat kid Vern Tedessi, a fat kid who has his doubts about his friends' quest, but tags along for moral support. But the best of the quartet goes to the late River Phoenix as rebel kid Chris Chambers. Phoenix is hugely impressive as being the kid with a tough outer demeanor with a soft spot on the inside. It's a sad ironic truth that his character in "Stand By Me" has his life taken away shortly just like in real life as well. The scene where Chris is crying in the woods is one of the most sensitive scenes in the story. Aside from the four boys, I have to give my hat off to Kiefer Sutherland. Over the years I have watched Sutherland vary in characters making him one of the most versatile actors then and now. As Ace, the boy's bully along with his gang of meanies, are also destined for the same mission as the four boys as they try to find the dead bodies before Gordie's gang does. It's a shame we don't see enough of Sutherland, but he was still effective in his supporting role. Although the central character is around Wheaton's Gordie, Phoenix and Sutherland turn up the best performances of the cast.Overall, this movie has plenty of witty dialogue, intriguing adventure, a suspenseful mystery and a sensitive drama that will you satisfied. A definite must see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is amazing for many reasons that are apparent and others which are not.I've never heard so many people say that they loved it when they first saw and no how many years since then that they still do. This movies captures childhood, and those last moments before people expect you to act mature. The one last adventure, and on that adventure, they discovered more about each other and themselves than they could have in a lifetime. With a movie like this, It could've been terrible or awesome, and it wasn't terrible. It light hearted, funny and serious all at the same time, which normally spells out disaster. But it's a story thats so easy to relate to. It's a universal thing, but it's still its own. I cried during this movie, and this movie will stand the test of time, just like it has all this time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this movie is definitely sad and you just don't feel the same after watching it. It holds a special place in my heart, especially the unfortunate fact that not only did actor River Phoenix die in the movie, but in real life too! If you've never seen Stand By Me, I highly recommend seeing it uncut instead of watching it on a channel like AMC. Not because of the profanity itself, rather because you need to experience what these boys truly said to each other and how it relates to their emotions so you can fully grasp what the movie's message is all about - how short life really is. I think the saddest line in this movie is when the Writer (Dreyfus) talks about how friends come in and out of your life like "bus-boys in a restaurant". Man, that is very true and very sad to think about. I've been trying to find a best friend I knew when I was 12 and to this day, I cannot locate him. For all I know, he could be deceased. I also used to walk with childhood friends along a railroad track near my grandmother's house in the summertime, so that part brings back fond memories too. The Stephen King novella Stand By Me is based on is also very emotional and I recommend reading it first to get a taste of what Reiner's film will be. It's unforgettable and timeless. Plus, I guarantee your eyes will leak tears by the end credits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film about the journey of true friendship, based on a Stephen King novel. Rob Reiner is a master at directing simple but touching little stories. Anyone who has watched The Princess Bride and this movie would agree that the late 80's was Reiner's golden years. Most notable of the names in the cast is that of the late River Phoenix, in one of his first film roles. The story revolves around four 12-year-old boys living in the small town of Castle Rock. They set out to find the corpse of a missing child and in the process build brick by brick a friendship that transcends all kinds of relationships. It makes you look back on the past faces that have come in and out of the pages of your own life. The last line of the film is considerably one of the best lines in the history of cinema. "I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve. Jesus, does anyone?" Recommended for children of all ages.http://iwascalledclementine.multiply.com/reviews</fullReview>

Everyone with a soul can relate to this movie enjoying a long summer with your friends and facing something scary and coming together when the going gets tuff. This is a rare and emotional film about the experiences of growing up and what kids face. Stand by me has to be the best coming of age film every maybe even the best all round film. The cast did a great job in creating a atmosphere that makes us think back to our childhood. i am only 16 and even now i am starting to loose the inocence of youth and growing up. My friends and i were actually like this round about when i was 12. we looked out for each other and then as time went on we started to go our separate ways. I never had any other friends later on in life like the ones i did when i was 12 Jesus does anyone?</fullReview>

When I rented the DVD I loved the film and it still hasn't lost its magic. The amount of times I laughed I lost count but the story Gordie was telling them was one of the funniest moments and so was when they were trying to cross the train track and Vern is crawling along the way until a train comes. fans of Cory Feldman (Teddy) will love this movie.Recommended to all drama fans and you obviously won't be disappointed.

		<fullReview>It's just the best film. The very best.I watched it first when I was 11, in 1989 or 1990, and I thought it was pretty good. I then became 12, and experienced the most profoundly wonderful time of my life, with my 12 year old friends.I saw Stand By Me again when I was 13 or 14, and it all made sense to me. Ever since, the film has brought out every possible emotion in me, many times over.When River Phoenix died, I couldn't face watching it for a couple of years. The scene at the end where Chris/River 'disappears' - the thought of it killed me. I returned to it after that, but haven't watched it now for at least 3 years, probably more.I know virtually every word, but each time I watch it, something new occurs to me. Whoever put the soundtrack together deserves immense credit, it is beyond poignant, beyond beautiful, beyond words.I often wonder if girls and women are able to appreciate this movie in the same way that boys and men are. I'd be interested in feedback. I have supposed that my intense emotional connection to the characters in this film come from having once been a boy.I have it on DVD and VHS, but so profound is the effect this film has upon me, I am waiting for the right moment. It is always with me though, and for that I dearly thank the writer (and yes, I've read 'The Body' many times over, but this is a very rare case of film being better than book), the director and the actors, and everyone else involved in making 'Stand By Me' the incredible experience it has been for me, over the course of the last 19 years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Stand by me" gets you go to the past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film based upon the "The Body" named novel of Stephen King and seeming like a simple story has a touching side and made me remember the times when I was twelve or thirteen. Like the last sentences of the film, all of us sometimes is lost in thought about those years and these sentences say "I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve. Jesus, does anyone?". The film stresses this idea and it exalts "Stand by me" and estranges it simplicity. Also the song that we are used to hear from Ben E. King is compatible with the end of film. What did the song say in its' worlds: "I won't cry, I won't cry, No, I won't shed a tear Just as long as you stand Stand by me"But we usually cry and shed too much tears as long as we lose our friends in the all stages of life. But the life continues and mostly the people who are nearby us become a stranger. "Stand by me" stresses this idea with four little children's friendship. They are depended on themselves like the pieces of chain. They hear a dead child who had an train accident and they want to be heroes finding his dead body. They set out a long distance on foot. They reach the body after difficult adventures containing death dangers. After finding the body, they come across with an older group looking for the body. Our younger men doesn't want to give the body after the facts which they live and they become successful. But this doesn't prevent them to understand doing a wrong thing and they return their homes. After that their ways differ and the classical end becomes fact. Only one of them who is Gordie sets up a good life for him and he becomes a writer as a childhood dream.I must clearly state that this is the best one of children role weighted films. Because the children do their best and the story reflects our life. All of us did such fantastic things in such ages.I celebrate all the staff who works for "Stand by me"...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies ever. Rob Reiner does a great job as director. It seems like most kid actors don't have a true connection with the other actors and aren't really being the character. In this movie the kids seem to genuinely feel like good friends that are acting as themselves and really feeling their emotions. I give a great deal of credit to Rob Reiner for that because he really had to help them learn how to act at that age.I was most impressed, however, with River Phoenix who was a fantastic actor, even as a kid. All of the kids are so true to their characters and do an excellent job. I love coming-of-age stories, and this is the best I've ever seen. Not only is it hilarious, but also has a great theme and story. Kiefer Sutherland plays the bully and really does an amazing job at making you hate him. The American 1950's was so well presented and everything that is in the movie really puts the audience in that setting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite movies of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I tend to get emotional just hearing about this movie. When I first saw it as a little girl I didn't understand the true concepts of the movie. I just got a little scared by the ending. Anyway, the basic concept is that 4 boys go out on a search during the summer to go look for a dead body that was rumored to be out on the tracks. The whole trip takes basically 2 days. But these 2 days teach the boys life lessons that they'll take with them forever. The story is being retold by Gordie as an adult after the passing of his friend. (Not a spoiler because IMDB.com says it in the plot outline). Throughout the story you see Gordie mature and become able to stand up for himself. Before the trip begins you see Gordie's home life is basically none at all. Ever since his brother Denny passed away (a role by the always yummy John Cusack) his parents tend to ignore him. Writing was always his escape. His friend Vern (played by a cute lil chubby Jerry O'Connell) tells the gang (also consisting of Vern-Corey Feldman&lt;3 and Chris-the late River Phoenix) that he heard about a dead kid who went missing and is supposedly dead on the tracks. The gang jumps on the chance to go looking and they make up lies to their parents to let them go missing for 2 days. However, there is a slight problem. A bigger, more dangerous gang, also knows about this body and they want dibs on it first. The leader being a young Keifer Sutherland.This movie is definitely worth the time spent watching it. It shows compassion, caring, and basically, growing up. I think River Phoenix plays an excellent role and it shows the kind of great career he would have had as a great actor. Also it's pretty funny to watch Jerry O'Connell with a squeaky voice ;). It has laughs and tears and puts it all together pretty nicely. One of my favorite quotes comes from this movie."People come in and out of your life like busboys in a restaurant".That was long..hope that was enough :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie about ten years ago, when I was at 6th grade.I liked it very much.Just recently I saw it again.Now I liked it even more. Richard Dreyfuss plays a writer who looks back to the summer of 1959. There are four twelve year old buddies, Gordie Lachance (Wil Wheaton), Chris Chambers (River Phoenix), Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman) and Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell).They have heard there's a dead body near the railroad tracks.So they have to find him, before the local teenagers, led by Ace Merrill (Kiefer Sutherland), do.This isn't a movie only about the adventure, it's more a movie about friendship.Gordie's brother, Denny (John Cusack), has recently died.So there's lots of grief in him.But he's not alone.Especially Chris is there to comfort him.Rob Reiner directed this masterpiece back in 1986.It's based on Stephen King's novel 'The Body'.The young actors in this movie are unique.It's sad what happened to River Phoenix in 1993.He could be one of the great ones now.Young Kiefer Sutherland plays a bad guy in this movie. These days you can see him in "24" saving the city.Also the dialog is great in this flick.Even though this is drama, it is pretty funny in some parts.There's the pie eating contest and the scene, where the boys are talking about Goofy, that's funny.And the title song is a true classic.This nostalgia filled movie is a movie that's never going to age.People are always going to like it.And why? Because it's so darn good.If you haven't seen Stand by Me yet, go see it now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfect Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERBased on Stephen King's reputedly semi-autobiographical novella `The Body' which, in itself is a powerful piece of work, STAND BY ME is by far the best movie adaptation of any of King's titles. It also stands head and shoulders above nearly all other `rites-of-passage' movies. Although the subject matter (a voyage undertaken by four 12-year-old friends to discover the body of a dead child) is serious, the bulk of the film avoids becoming too solemn by focusing on the relationships between the four friends, especially that between Gordie LaChance (Wil Wheaton), the intelligent boy with aspirations to be a writer whose brother has recently died, and Chris Chambers (River Phoenix), the misunderstood child from the town's bad family. The humorous manner in which crude insults are casually traded between the boys is expertly weaved into the more serious aspects of the tale, and effortlessly evokes memories of one's own childhood.With the exception of Kiefer Sutherland, who somehow manages to transform King's ?cheap dime-store hood' Ace Merrill into a vaguely camp and effete character, the performances of the leads (all children) are excellent throughout. It is River Phoenix, however, who truly shines in the strongest role. The scene in which he reveals to Gordie the secret of the stolen milk money is possibly the finest example of child acting the screen has ever seen. Phoenix went on to display equally impressive performances in early adulthood, and it is an (ironic) shame that he suffered in true life the fate shared by his character in this movie.And if the story isn't to your liking, then see the film on the biggest screen you can and lose yourself in the lush visuals that make this one of the most beautiful movies to ever come out of Hollywood. This movie is a true masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must have seen this movie ten times and each time it gets better. The tale about the lives and adventures of four boys who live through trials and tribulation. I cried with them, laughed with them and felt their fears as my own. That is what this movie becomes...a true experience. Yes I saw it again and I too remembered that not too long ago, I too was like them, a boy with friends who would go to the end of the world, a boy in search of himself. River Phoenix delivers a performance that we have not seen from an actor his age. Truly splendid, leaving one to wonder what he might have achieved only he was still alive. A very poignant ending, where the actor looks back at his life down nostalgia lane and delivers a worldly truth...yes the best friends are those that we had when we were still young, free and looking forward to all the challenges the world may hold...for we were invincible then!!Its a movie you should watch and once you have you should try and relive that age once again. Its a movie which brings your inner child back. Go swimming through swamps, get bitten by leeches, run on rail tracks, taunt the dogs which chase you and most of all enjoy and relish the true friendships that you have and reconnect the ones you had forgotten about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest films ever made, and is in my top ten movies. The performances of the four boys was not Hollywood at all, it was a realistic movie. What made this movie so great is that it shows a real group of kids and their strong friendship. They take a two day trip into the Oregon woods to retrieve a dead body so they might become famous and beloved by the town, but the trip has a series of events that show how hard they will fight to remain friends.Kiefer Sutherland did an especially good job as the no good hoodlum Ace Merrill, he was a very convincing low life. All four kids, River Pheonix, Will Wheaton, Corey Feldman, and Jerry O' Connell did a stand up job, especially Jerry O' Connell, because he was working with 16 year old kids while he was only 11.A very touching movie that shows four kids who go off into the woods in search of recognition, but found themselves, and came back a little wiser. I recommend this to any one who enjoys real life stories and tales of self discovery. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Made in 1986, "Stand by me" shows all the issues about growing up, specially relationed with morality &amp; ethic. It's written by a genius, Stephen King, &amp; acted by great young actors ( who later were quite famous) like River Phoenix (a kid who was made to grow up fast by force &amp; circumstances), Corey Feldman (the typical crazy &amp; hyperkinetical friend), Jerry O'Connel (the group's "mascot") &amp; a great performance of this kid named Wil Wheaton, who is the protagonist of the film.The plot is about this group of 4 friends who decide to start a quest searching for a dead guy's body near a forest. They have to hurry up because another group of friends, older that them (&amp; headed by the great Kiefer Sutherland, playing again, as the whole 80's decade, the role of the teen bad guy) are searching for the same thing.But the real matter of the movie are the dialogues &amp; the developments of its characters, specially the little friends.Gordie is a great character, as the fragile desperate 12 years old kid who wants to escape from his family (he thinks they don't love him) &amp; his bitter past (he feels really pity, even guilty for the death of his brother).The role of River Phoenix, as Chris Chambers, is also awesome, showing us how hard could be for a kid the fact of growing up alone, in a hard way.Jerry O'Connel , as Vern, is the funny &amp; tender point of the picture, making laugh for his ways of seeing life, just thinking that life is still a game.Corey Feldman, as Teddy Duchamp, is terrific. This actor, who once was famous just like Macaulay Culkin &amp; then later disappeared, shows all his arsenal of dramatic profile playing a kid who is crazy about military stuff (he likes to brag that his father was in Vietnam) &amp; acts like he is not afraid of nothing, but in the deep of his heart he know that he is so scary like any of their friends.Other famous actors in this movie are Kiefer Sutherland (playing the bad, bad, bad Ace Merrill), John Cusack (as Gordie's dead older brother) &amp; Richard Dreyfuss as Gordie when adult. There are also great &amp; funny parts of the movie (who can forget the great story of the Pie contest?) &amp; also a lot of dramatic issues, even about existence (the reaction of Gordie after seeing the dead kid's body).Resuming, I think "Stand by me" is a GREAT, GREAT movie, also with a great theme (When the night has come, &amp; the land is dark...). Try to watch &amp; I think you will agree when they say "The best friends of our life are those when we are 12".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"But kids lose everything unless there's someone there to look out for them".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was already well beyond my formative pre-teen years when I first saw this film, but there's no denying that if you grew up in small town America, this is about as close as you get to capturing the essence of childhood friendships that remain with you forever, even after time and distance take their eventual toll. Director Rob Reiner skillfully crafts a compelling tale from a Stephen King short story, layering it with various sub-texts that run the gamut from dealing with the town bully to confronting the loss of family. What's probably most remarkable about the picture are the performances that Reiner obtains from his young starring cast, most notably River Phoenix as Chris Chambers, and Wil Wheaton as his best friend Gordie Lachance. Told through the perspective of Wheaton's character, the film conjures up memories of the many trials and tribulations one faces while growing up, often unsure of oneself and even worse, feeling alone and disoriented when personal tragedy strikes and threatens to overwhelm one's very being. Yet the story never gets maudlin or depressing, there's enough youthful camaraderie and mischief on hand to keep the adventurous foursome going strong. Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell round out the group, and together they manage to grow and mature in a way that none of them could have imagined prior to starting their quest. Scored with a soundtrack that memorializes some of the great song hits from a half century ago, "Stand By Me" is a strange and wonderful journey, in it's own way reminding us of what might have been the best time of our lives. Sincerely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Stand By Me yesterday for the first time in one and a half years, (I'm 17) and I absolutely loved it, and it is definitely one of my favourite Stephen King adaptations. I will say I absolutely loved Shawshank Redemption, and despite the fact that it was unfaithful to the book, and badly flawed, I liked It too.Stand By Me, based on the novella by Stephen King, which I admit I haven't read, not only has a wonderfully engaging story, but it is both funny and moving. This is helped by the strong and wholly believable performances from the entire cast that include Kiefer Sutherland, John Cusack, Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Conell and River Pheonix especially.The script was very well-crafted, and the film tells brilliantly of the values of friendship and standing together. Other strengths were the beautiful photography and the fine direction from Rob Reiner. But what impressed me most about Stand By Me was not only its nostalgic feel, but despite the hour and a half running time, the characters particularly Chris were so well developed. And I mustn't forget the beautiful song Stand By Me over the end credits.A beautiful, unforgettable film, with a definite 10/10. Bethany Cox.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A growing up film for grown-ups: a classic coming-of-age story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Stand by Me" is such an excellent coming-of-age story that I almost wish I'd grown up in the '50s. I can only imagine then, for anyone who has, the kinds of emotions through memories that the Stephen King novella-turned Rob Reiner film must evoke. Still, anyone who's gone through puberty can appreciate the adventuresome innocence yet underscored maturity of "Stand by Me."Taking place in the summer of 1959, the film is a childhood memory retold by Gordie Lachance (Dreyfus) of when he was 12 (played by Wil Wheaton) and he and three friends named Chris (River Phoenix), Teddy (Corey Feldman) and Vern (Jerry O'Connell) journeyed away from their Oregonian small town to find a missing teenager's dead body and fulfill an absent sense of adventure.Leaving behind their troubled home lives, the boys soon discover something else when they're out on their alone with only their own decisions to guide their actions. They make these choices together, quarrel together, look out for each other's backs and bare themselves emotionally in front of one another. You get the sense that if adults took this same journey that events would not have unfolded the same, with each man looking out primarily for himself. A boy, however, has nothing but his friends to help save him from a world that wants only to swipe his innocence away. That's the real power of childhood that this story unearths as it tries to understand that golden hue over our memories.Incredible, then, is Rob Reiner's achievement at making such a mature film about so much more than childhood with only children as the main characters. He captures these young boys on camera in a way that makes them appear like tiny sages helping us make sense of our own past. Having come only from rock mockumentary "This is Spinal Tap" at this point in his career, it's incredible the kind of performance Reiner gets from these boys.Young star Wheaton is instantly the boy we identify with most: he's quiet, doesn't pick on anyone, but commands the respect of his friends. Feldman, child star of the '80s, sheds his nerdy "Goonies" character to become the daredevil of the group, which he manages to excel at. O'Connell plays the scared fat kid who gets picked on the most and Phoenix, giving easily the best performance of the four, is the tough kid with a good head on his shoulders who is really sensitive inside. There's no doubt that if Phoenix hadn't died tragically in the '90s that he would've become a major acting force as an adult. John Cusack makes a cameo as Gordie's deceased older brother and Kiefer Sutherland also appears as Ace, the leader of a gang of teenagers who are also after the body, but this film belongs to the young ones through and through.Giving the children their authenticity are writers Raynold Gideon and Bruce A. Evans. These are normal pre-teenage boys above all else: they fight and pick on each other, have temper tantrums and occasionally break down into tears. Beautifully constructed is the metaphor of children following railroad tracks to an inevitable and shocking discovery.Stories about growing up are commonplace in Hollywood, but none will impress you like "Stand by Me." It's the only film starring children that serves adults first and that places it in a folder in history where it might never be touched again. It's really a treasure of a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I would like to say I'm not the best of film critics out there and what I wanted to say about this film has already been said through the other fantastic posts on here. I just want to repeat it myself, echo my borrowed thoughts through the tool of writing. Let people know how great this film is from my own view.The film is about four friends who share the emotions, trials and tribulations of growing up, through a decision to go on a trek and find the body of a missing child of a similar age to them. This film makes you so feel so much (without giving too much away).Although I have seen a few films on TV, I usually change the channel half way through. On one particular day last year I was flicking through like I do, half blankly staring at the screen, when I came across this film. I sat and down and watched it to the end, a rare accomplishment for me.From my own opinion, films can never really evoke real life. Some films can, fair enough, but what hit me most about this film was how the ending could fit into real life. The ending was so ordinary. There was no fairytale element to this film whatsoever. Thats what made this film so feel-good for me.I have seen the films My girl, Casablanca, Titanic and The Shawshank Redemption (all brilliant films which I have also taken the care to watch). They have never even brought a lump to my throat. The ending to Stand By Me was so personally heart-felt, however, I was not ready for the emotion that would overwhelm me. A personal experience that has changed who I am.Definitely one of my top 3 films for life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most amazing Stephen King movies ever filmed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is one of the greatest movies that I have ever seen. It's one of the movies that will touch you deep into your heart. It's what makes a movie amazing. The kids did an amazing job of acting out the characters of Teddy, Vern, Chris, and Gordie. It is an deep and does an an amazing job of reanacting the novella. The plot is amazing. It's the summer that every kid has to have. The one where the only thing that matters is being with your friends and having fun. Before everything else sets in. It tells of four best friends with all messed up family life's which mostly all they have is each other. Most definitely one of my favorite movies ever. It follows the boys as they journey to find something that will either make them or break them. What they are searching for is something that will make them local hero's. I thought that book was greatly amazing as the book. Stephen King did an excellent job on his part. But he never ceases to fail in my book. The cast was well chosen out for each part. Especially River for Chirs, and Corey Feldman for Teddy. They both did an amazing job adapting to there characters. This goes above and beyond of movies that friendship movies that go deep. Absolutely amazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Childhood Is Temporary; Friendships Are Eternal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw "Stand By Me", a film of the coming-of-age experiences of four young pre-teen boys, I was in my pre-teens, trying to find my place in the world. Looks like the movie kicked me in the pants, so I could get somewhere in the world, and I thank it from the bottom of my heart.Based on the novella "The Body", from the collection "Different Seasons" by Stephen King, the story introduces us to the four main players who live in the town of Castle Rock, Oregon, circa 1959. Sensitive, wunderkind scribe Gordie Lanchance (Wil Wheaton of "Star Trek: The Next Generation") still mourns the accidental death of his understanding jock brother Denny (a young John Cusack) while being "invisible" and "a disappointment" to his equally mournful parents; tough kid Chris Chambers (strong River Phoenix of "Little Nikita" and "Dogfight") tries to be a good kid, despite coming from a family of reprobates.Wild-eyed and hearted Teddy Duchamps (Corey Feldman of the "Lost Boys" films) vocally dreams of army service, wanting to please his mentally unstable, abusive, WW II vet father, who burnt the boy's left ear against a hot stove, and goofy coward Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell of "Sliders" and "Crossing Jordan") who provides loyalty and comic relief to the group. He also tells them about the location of a dead boy's corpse, after inadvertently hearing it from his older scumbag brother and a friend.This leads to a two-day trek for the four, during Labor Day weekend, through the Oregon wilderness. They seek fame and adoration, but they find themselves, especially during a dramatic moment over the corpse with a band of knife-wielding hoods, led by town bully Ace Merill (Kiefer Sutherland, who was probably practicing his future, iconic lead role on the hit, serialized TV action drama "24"). Growing up isn't a solid timetable.Director Rob "Don't call me Meathead" Reiner ("This Is Spinal Tap", "A Few Good Men", "The Bucket List") hugs the Oscar-nominated adapted screenplay by Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon ("Starman", "Mr. Brooks") tender and tense, funny and tragic, humble and honest, beautiful and poignant, sweet and thoughtful. In their pre-teens at the time, the four players perfectly play their roles, reminding us of ourselves. Wheaton's Gordie is a reflection of me, and I decided to be a writer, after seeing the film. The pie-eating tale he tells to his buds over a campfire is a hoot and a half.However, it's the performance by Phoenix (who should have been also Oscar-nominated for echoing James Dean and Marlon Brando) that's forever haunting since he and his role met unfortunate demises, making the film all too powerful. Heart-breaking is the moment when he tell Gordie-crying-about a good deed he did, but goes wrong due to his family's rep.Kudos have to be given to Rick Dreyfus ("Jaws", "Silver City", "W") who narrates the film and plays the adult version of Gordie, a successful writer with his own kid, who notes to a friend how weird he gets when he's writing. The 1950s rock music soundtrack suits the film and is enjoyable, even to those who didn't grow up in the era.Though I didn't have friends, let alone close ones, growing up because I was (and still am) a weird, "old young man", I look at my childhood, and like others, find it temporary. I wish my friendships were like Gordie and Chris: eternal (despite one's passing, in the case of the film). Go see this classic, even with your kid (the underage smoking and profanity were part of King's life as a boy) and remember your childhood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something far deeper about this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I read the other comments and think about this film's effect on me -- the fact that before I even sought out IMDb I immediately recognized the 'River Phoenix character' in my own life: a pal called Babe, whom I have tried in vain to relocate, now nearly 70 years after our 12-year old childhood days -- but yes, we had that kind of friendship, in my own recall; he gave me the confidence to fight back, against a bully, which meant a whole lot, in my young years. But what I was about to say is that I suddenly see something almost archetypal in the kind of situation recognized by so many others, and myself, as the age-12 friendship scenario.Now that I can look back over an entire life, it is possible to see the elements that seemed so distinctive at the time, and are remembered as so personal, so unique, as actually being very characteristic of a time-of-life. And to see them so uniformly recalled convinces me that this is so. We already know a few such passages: the midlife crisis, and the sentimentally romantic teenage years (as certified by the pop music that is forever afterward what we favor best and return to most). Similarly, then, is there an idealized moment directly at the crossover between childhood and being what we call grown-up. In fact, it is the final passage of childhood, after which nothing is ever quite so wonderful. We get 'drafted by life' . . . channeled into careers, relationships, professions, family concerns, and not to forget: debts and mortgages and the passion for 'getting ahead'. But before all that begins, life has left with us something richly remembered as an idealized friendship. It is really love, however, before it becomes sexual. And that precious slice of it will always be back there as a kind of prototypical ideal, for challenging comparison with every other relationship we ever have in our lives. It's back there to model our future connections . . . for as long as we can retain the ideal. As I now see it, that's what this film, along with the comments on it, has revealed to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what it meant to me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In all of the films i have ever seen, never have i seen a film that has left such an impression as 'Stand by me'. I've seen many 'coming of age' films, but 'Stand by me' just had that something, that something special.Maybe, the reason it was so brilliant was because of the extremely talented cast. It's rare to find a film with such purity, where the actors use each other to make their performances better. Especially considering the cast were so young, they do such a professional job.I can really relate to this film, as can everyone. It contains the four main stereo-type high school kids: the crazy/strange one (Teddy), The 'wimp' (Vern), the intelligent/sensitive one (Gordie) and the tough guy that no-one can be bothered to get to know (Chris). It's hard for somebody not to like this movie as you can relate to at least one aspect of it.Although there are quite a few wrenching scenes, it's not 'mooshy' or 'cliche' at all. Instead, it's the opposite. It portrays it truthfully, in a bare form in which really makes you think about your own childhood. I went away after watching this film feeling speechless. I couldn't believe how amazing it was. And i'm so glad i watched it at the age of 14, so that i could really appreciate my childhood. Anybody who hasn't seen this film is seriously missing out on life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget "Casablanca," "Schindler's List," or "The Shawshank Redemption..." This gem from the 80's takes the prize.With it's incredible acting, precise direction and wonderful story, "Stand By Me" stands alone as the brightest, most uplifting, personal and effective story ever told on screen.I remember the first time I saw it, I was 12 or so. I thought it was scary. Years later, I found out that the mighty Stephen King had penned the story and it made sense. It is so realistic and heartfelt, it's hard to imagine a movie ever surpassing this one. Each character represents one side of humanity and all of them beautiful and crafted to perfection. There is never a moment in the film that pulls you out. The story is so simple, it's timeless and appealing to everyone out there with a heart. It's about growing up and and it's about childhood innocence at the same time.I get the feeling that this movie was a deeply personal project and you can tell that everyone involved took it 100% seriously. Add to all this the fact that it shares the title of the best song ever written, (in my opinion,) and what you have is a miracle of a movie that will make you laugh, cry, laugh some more and leave the couch feeling like a new human being.10 out of 10, kids.</fullReview>

That, and because narrative movies have always fascinated me.The only real disappointment is that these kinds of movies tend to have the same problem: they're not as lengthy as many people would like.I shouldn't have to even give one of my verdicts, but it's a specialty of mine.9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since a few months before, I had tackled on true art cinema. Kicked back again in true classics like Amadeus, Cinema Paradiso and started new ones like The Graduate. And I have seen almost all Anderson films, (I will see There Will Be Blood tomorrow) And talking about Anderson, I think that is a good example for what I'm trying to say. When I watch Magnolia or Boggie Nights, there are scenes that, I just keep silence, I don't know why. Wheter if I have no words, or I'm shocked, I keep silence for almost the entire film. And then, all the rest of the day, I think about that film, saying nothing, even thinking nothing, just "feeling" the movie. Well, that's the exact case with Stand By Me. I first saw it when I was like 8 years old, and I didn't catch it, I didn't like nor hate it, nothing. Just a movie. Yesterday, I bought the DVD, I saw it this morning and now I'm in silence. The story in Stand by Me is actually simple: in a small US town, end of the 50's, a small group of 12-almost 13 year old boys escape on the search of a teenager's dead body, so they can come back home and be awarded as heroes. Easy thing. Sho why is this so special? It's not the story, is the characters. Based on Stephen King's The Body, director Rob Reiner grabbed a cast of kids that, in my opinion, wheren't actors playing those characters but rather those characters in the flesh, with their pros and cons. Stand By Me is just a classic film about growing up, and if we aren't kids all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Feldman at the beginning of their careers. The entire cast is superb and it so perfectly paced, that the story unfolds with wit, pathos and sensitivity and completely free of emotional shortcuts.The subsequent early death of one of the young stars serves to make this story of friendship even more poignant, and the end has added extra impact.The tale itself, adapted from a Stephen King story, dwells on the mates' quest to find the body of a schoolboy supposedly struck down by a train while walking in the woods. They set off hoping to find fame, but then start to reveal their own personal secrets and the journey becomes as emotional as it is physical.It's hard to tell if the four young actors are all geniuses or just perfectly cast, but the performances are never short of real, and if some of the key scenes don't have you choking back tears, you are without a soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Isn't it interesting that the best stories Stephen King ever come up with are drama instead of horror. Stand By Me, or actually the novella The Body as its called, is the greatest of them but there are others too. The Shawshank Redemption -story for example. Considering that these two plus two more novellas (Apt Pupil and one more, which doesn't strike my mind right now) are included in Different Seasons makes the book a wonderful piece of art.I'm quite a nostalgic fellow and things about friendship concerns me a lot. Maybe that's why this movie gives me such kicks. But also, in this movie it seems like even all the small thing matches perfectly.The actors are perfect. The young fellows, including the late River Phoenix, are great. My favorite is probably Teddy Duchamp played buy Corey Feldman but also the others do a nice job. Kiefer Sutherland is fantastic as the tough guy with his stupid disciples. One of my favorites is John Cusack as the main characters dead brother and then of courses Richard Dreyfuss as the narrator.Also the pace of the movie is so fantastic. There are a few fast-paced dj-lines on the radio and a lot of pop and rock music but still the tempo of the movie is slow and calm as life itself in an almost forgotten small town as Castle Rock.When watching the movie you soon start to realize that the important issue is not finding the dead kids body but all the small things which happen along the way and the stories which are told by the becoming author. To me the climax is in the ending (as it should be in good movies). The storyteller sits in front of his computer and reminisces. He writes down the line: "I've never had any friends later on, like the ones I had when I was twelve. Jesus, does anyone." Then he shuts the computer and goes out playing with his kids as we hear Ben E. King sing his beautiful Stand By Me - hit. One of the best endings ever in a movie.Only death ends the sadness of life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just a note - I wrote this for a school project. I would never have the patience to write something this long otherwise.Stand By Me ***** out of 5 DVD edition Viewed March 4, 2005 Based on Stephen King's bestseller The Body Directed by Ron Reiner Dead Bodies, Vomit, Bloody Leeches, Swearing, Knives and Cigarettes: Why This is the movie for your family By Rachael C., FILMAttention parents! What do you want most for your children? Do you want them to become young, successful and aspiring people? Is it your only wish that Joey and Larissa go out into the wide, wide world and inspire other young people as you inspire them? If so, the 89 minutes of film, which stars the young, successful and aspiring River Phoenix, Will Wheaton, Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell, is for them.But it's full of dead bodies, barfing, bloody leeches, swearing, knives, and cigarettes!, you say. This is not entirely true. The film, released in 1989 by Columbia Pictures, is not merely about a group of friends who travel along a rail track to find a dead body they have heard about. Themes of heroism, self-confidence and friendship are packed together in hilariously heart warming scenes that flow cleanly form frame to frame. Stand by Me is good for both you and your kids to see because of its realistic plot, the talent of the actors and the youthfulness of the movie.The adventure is seen from the point of view of Gordie Lachance (Will Wheaton) who throughout the trip is tortured by the memory of his older brother, who had just died recently. Chris Chambers (River Phoenix), Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell) and Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman) all struggle with problems of their own.This movie is what is known as a "coming of age film" featuring characters around 11 to 15 years of age who discover something new about themselves and who they can become through the progress of the story. You may find yourself relating to one of the characters during this movie because the script is incredibly realistic. This reality that you are forced to watch is what will make you both laugh and cry. The way the characters react to each other and the obstacles they face are ways you will remember yourself or your friends reacting. These could just be the facial expressions or words they use, but it conjures up memories of your own childhood. The impeccable performance of the actors in Stand by Me brings in another aspect of realness. The characters are believable, especially in their speech. Although the kids use what is considered to us "foul language", it is how kids of that setting (1950's, fictional town of Castle Rock, Oregon) spoke. The emotions of the audience are constantly changing as each character struggles with his own problems. The main theme of this movie is youthfulness and the friendships we possess at the time. It relishes in both the beauty and the pain of being a kid, as the four friends sing songs at the tops of their lungs, swim in mud, and hold spitting contests, but also experience death, the sheer terror of getting run over by a train and the loss of things special to them(Gordie's hat that his brother gave him). This movie is one your kids will learn something from. And maybe you will learn something from it too. As Teddy Duchamp says, "This is my age. I'm in the prime of my youth and I'll only be young once." Stand by Me will help you relive your youth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stand by Me was a movie that truly blew me out of my socks. I saw it first when I was very young and I thought it was great, but completely forgot about it. Over the years, I thought less and less about it until I came across it again one day. I popped it in to see what I had forgotten about, and I found myself crying more than once. It sent a message that children should be receiving very early on. It's a movie about friendship and loyalty. I think my favorite scene was the 'Milk Money' scene. I found myself crying with Christopher Chambers about his dramatic loss and how everyone thought nothing of the 'low-life Chambers kid.' This movie is essentially about four boys looking towards one goal. To be a hero by finding the missing body of Ray Brower and to be redeemed in their town's eyes. And when they set out on their 2-day trek, they learn things about each other that they never knew before. They learn that in each other's eyes they're all equal, and that's all that matters. They learn that they don't need to be redeemed in each other's eyes, because all of them have enough issues with themselves to be able to worry about the issues they have with their friends. But when the rival gang sets out with the same goal and they meet in that last scene, the whole movie pulls together to its ultimate climax. And this group of boys makes for a fun, dramatic and hilarious movie. Teddy Duchamp and Chris Chambers, both doomed to a life of misery by their deranged or angry fathers. Vern Tessio, the sacredly cat with a brother in their rival gang, and Gordie Lachance, perhaps one of my favorite characters in this movie, and the narrator. Gordie is the sensitive writer who just wants a little love from his parents after his brother died in a jeep accident. He was one of the characters that made me cry most, along with Chris.Chris and Gordie are the best of friends, which is something that I think sends out a good message as well. Having a best friend whose shoulder you can cry on and who will always try to be there with you if you ever, in slightly dramatic terms, have a mental breakdown. This movie is highly recommended. Definitely worth seeing, as it has turned into one of my favorites. Especially that one last line:'I never had friends later on in life like the ones I had when I was twelve. Jesus, does anybody?'</fullReview>

The way the film's narrator, who is played by legendary film actor Richard Dryffus (apologize for any misspelled words and erroneous grammar)who plays one of the young boys grown up as a writer, and how he sees in the beginning of the film those two boys on the bike allows him to reflect on his childhood and how friendship is eternal. The last ten minutes of the film, for me, are the most memorable and emotional when Chris Chanmbers, played by the late River Phoenix, is described by Richard Dryfus as being killed to try to settle a dispute, which reflects Mr. Chambers kind and conciliatory character, which was greatly accentuated by Mr. Phoenix understanding and passionate role. Thank you to Rob Reiner, Stephen King and the entire cast and filmmakers working on the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This story was one of Stephen Kings best written story's. Unlike his scary and thrilling story's, this one has shined over all of the rest. Very well picked actors. Will Weaton and River Phoenix are a great team together. A very good dramatic performance by all the actors, my favorite performance is by River Phoenix. When he talks about him stealing the milk money. It was very touching. I would recommend if any girls liked this movie, to go see The Sisterhood Of the Traveling Pants. Basically it was a Stand By Me for a girl audience, and guys also.Amanda, RIP River Jude Phoenix</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautifully acted, amazing adaption of Stephen Kings novel 'The Body'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most amazing films I have ever seen. The acting by the four boys is incredible, in particular Wil Wheaton and River Phoenix.Directed by Rob Reiner 'Stand By Me' is a funny heart warming story of four best friends with very different family backgrounds who go on a journey to find the body of a kid who had been missing but never found. The boys figure if they find the body it might bring them fame and fortune and may help them to escape their dreary lives in Castle Rock.Along the way the boys discover things about themselves and realise they aren't as strong as they thought, and maybe finding a kids dead body isn't exactly going to be the trip of a life time that they had had in mind. 'Stand By Me' is a film I couldn't fault in any way and the sound track is just as good. A must see film and one the best I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stephen King is now very well known for his novels and other pieces of writing being made into movies, and in my opinion, Stand By Me is one of the best King adaps. The Green Mile and The Shawshank Redemption being my two other favourites. Both are powerful and touching films, and Stand By Me is no exception.The story, based around the lives of four young friends simply growing up in America, going through some not so simple adventures.Gordie and his three friends hear of the dead body of a young boy, and go in search for it, with some unexpected events along the way, the train scene and the leech scene being two of the best. All four boys turn out amazing performances, but the two most outstanding come from Gordie and Chris, played by Wil Wheaton and the late, great River Pheonix respectively.Keifer Sutherland also makes an impressionable appearance, although isn't in the movie for the majority.Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell provide some light comedic relief, and the four boys together create a spectacular story and audiences feel a strong sense of the bond between the boys.One scene in particular is made all the more moving by the fact that River Pheonix has sadly passed away since the making of the movie. We see Gordie waving goodbye to Chris Chambers (Pheonix), who fades into the trees and is not seen again in the film. This scene usually provokes me and anyone I'm watching it with to tears, and this is a sign of the heart-felt respect most people have for River Pheonix.Rob Reiner has done an incredible job of getting astounding performances out of all of his cast, but if you watch the bonus material on the DVD you will see that he really had to go to extreme lengths to drag out the potential that he knew he had found in these four unknown Young actors. And it is clear that he did well in picking the right people, because if it had been any other four boys the film would not have come off as well as it did.Overall, this is an incredible tale of four young boys, told with sensitivity,and the four boys deliver mature and moving performances. A must-see for all film fans, and any Stephen King Fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stephen King always knows how to do nostalgia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Four boys, Gordie (Wil Wheaton), Chris( River Phoenix), Teddy (Corey Feldman) and Vern (Jerry O'Connell), go on a two-day hike to find a dead body along the railroad tracks in 1950's Oregon. Coming as it does from a Stephen King story (called "The Body"), one might assume that "Stand by Me" is a horror story. In fact, it is nothing of the sort. It really shows these boys slowly but surely coming of age, especially when they meet up with local hoodlum Ace Merrill (Kiefer Sutherland). As is a recurring theme in Stephen King's stories, the boys come from rather unhappy homes, and the four of them getting together as a group is their only escape, which King also explored in "It" and "Hearts in Atlantis".While this movie is mostly serious, there is one scene that is probably there just for comic relief: the Barf-o-rama. But I won't spoil it. You have to see the movie yourself, by which I mean that I truly recommend the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Stand By Me" strictly categorically, is not great. There are some obvious flaws in sets, dialogue and even the acting. But a presence about the film leaves you feeling plain happy; however, this is not just a feel good movie. It is a classic coming of age comedy that is timelessly perfect that should be viewed by all.Gordie (Wil Wheaton) is currently undergoing family surgery, after the death of his brother. Chris (perfectly played by River Phenoix) is the tough guy, smoking and cussing frequently. And the two side characters: Teddy (Corey Feldman, funny as heck) and Vern played by Jerry O Connell. What seems like another boring day in the tree house turns into much more...News of a dead body is around, and the boys have a lead on it. So in a quest of part adventure, part fame, they set out to find it in the woods. A spectacularly funny, fabulous and touching journey follows.There may be the odd mistake, but the boys do the best they can to be real. And they do. So, so funny, sad and purely lovely, Stand By Me is a timeless classic.10 out of 10</fullReview>

This movie was also very hilarious! I especially enjoyed the train scene. All of the boys transform so fast. It took a lot of work to make this movie. I loved this movie so much it is one of my top three favorite movies! I think it is definitely a perfect movie! Stephen King did an awesome job on this great story! My favorite character is Chris.

The other performances in this should also be recognised as they were all fabulous and Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell have the perfect chemistry of such close friends.

		<fullReview>What's not to love about this movie? It is a truly touching film that shows what the friendships of twelve year old boys in the 50s. It shows us what true friendships should be like and what it was like to be twelve in the mid-twentieth century. I have never spoken to anyone ( anyone mature) whose life wasn't majorlly impacted by seeing this film. Even though words can't express the beauty and honesty of this film, I'll try to do my best. It is true that this film is usually appreciated more by adults, but I believe it would be a shame if children didn't see it ( to fully appreciate their childhood and friends). The film is rated R for language, some use of tobacco, and some sexual references ( not too bad). If you are worried about showing it to your children think about this: the film teaches a good lesson about life and friends; that is worth letting them hear a few bad words. I cannot express the impact the movie will have on you personally ( ranges for everyone); but it more than likely will change the way you look at life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest, severely underrated, moving, funny, nostalgic and so, so true movie's of a lifetime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To give this film as high praise at it deserves is near impossible. There is nothing that, given the power, a true movie fan would not change. Stand By Me has bag's full of entertainment, comedy elements and thought provoking scenes with plenty to spare.To brand this a "kids" movie would be so wrong. Simply having children as the lead actors does not take anything away from the movie, it actually makes it the greatest coming of age movie ever, and one of the greatest EVER movies. AND WHAT ACTORS THEY ARE!This story, like so many King novel's, use's character substance to carry it instead of seen-them-a-mile-off constant "twists", trying to hard to be clever plots or poor action. Only actor's of the highest calibre could pull this off (and that includes adults). The actors perfect their parts so much that you feel you personally know each one of them, that you are friends with these people, that you have been on this journey with these people and that is why it saddens come the end of the film. Never before has an audience laughed and cried with movie characters.A portion of this acting praise must go to director Rob Reiner. Only perfect directing could show the boy's talents in their true glorious light, and thank god he did not patronise and treat them as children with how it was shot. Many times the boy's were contained in a group and while this meant them all being on top of their game throughout it brought the film to life and really gave a sense of a close group of friends.The main character here is Gordie LaChance, a boy practically dis-owned by his parents as their favourite, perfect child, Gordie's older brother, has died. This leaves Gordie with no identity and no life purpose, something he will pick up from his journey, as will the others...scaredy-cat Vern, flamboyant army fanatic Teddy and tough-guy with a hard surface Chris.Though maybe not intended i did not see Gordie as the hero in this pic. It was the tragic story of Chris (River Phoenix), who had been severely mis-judged and given the reputation of a "bad kid". This is due to his family reputation, one that Chris cannot shake off. Always the strongest with the most life set-backs Chris is the light of the movie, and River Phoenix the star.One excellent scene in particular, the real gem in this crown, is where Chris (River Phoenix) tells Geordie (Wil Wheaton) about his milk-money experience. It was the strongest point of the film, by far the most emotional and River Phoenix acted well beyond his years, more believable than most adult actors.I cannot rave about the performance's enough. To carry a film that, while already stunningly shot with an excellent 50's soundtrack, needed so much substance to work each actor had to be perfect...and they were. Ace (Kiefer Sutherland) was so realistic, a character representing the boy's problems, Vern (Jerry O'Connell) is that kid we all no from our childhood, Teddy (Corey Feldman) was such an elaborate, original yet realistic character, Gordie (Wil Wheaton) witnessed all of this and listened to his friends problems while suppressing his own, while River Phoenix, as Chris, is all of the above and more. It is Chris who make's you laugh, make's you cry, makes you sympathise with while envy at the same time. He has the most problems in the group yet still put's his friends (particulary Gordie) first, keeps the piece, and keeps the group, and the movie, together.This is beautifully crafted, intensely directed, has an amazing soundtrack, gives a story that has it all and acting performances that make you wonder...where were the Academy? I do not think I build up his performance enough by claiming that River Phoenix deserved an Oscar nomination AND win for his portrayal of Chris. I have not seen that many better performances by an actor, not a child actor, but by actor's in general....EVER! (Only Jack Nicholson in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" &amp; Marlon Brando in "The Godfather" can boast better performances)This film deserves the praise it gets x100. Everything you could want from a movie is here, in Stand By Me, one of the greatest movie's of all time.....Superb 11/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Little Chill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beauty of "Stand By Me" is how well it captures the small moments of adolescence, the cheap jokes, the time-wasting card games, the pet phrases of the kids you hung around with. It's not necessary for you to have spent a summer weekend on a long hike to see a corpse to relate. Hell, it's not necessary for you to be male.Based on the Stephen King novella "The Body," part of his 1982 collection "Different Seasons" (along with another IMDb top 250 film, "The Shawshank Redemption"), "Stand By Me" moves at a pace so languid it should almost be in French with English subtitles. Wil Wheaton stars as a youngster named Gordon Lachance, seriously neglected by parents in mourning for his recently killed brother. Gordie finds himself on a journey with three friends to find the missing body of Ray Brower, a boy about their age who disappeared while collecting berries, but who they hear is lying beside the railroad tracks on a back road miles from town.This was one of those films you remember well if you were around when it came out. For a long time in the 1980s, it seemed like movies were either suffocatingly serious excursions into what it all meant with Meryl Streep debuting a new accent, or else popcorn fluff. "Stand By Me" was that rarity, a serious film that dared to be popular, and was it ever. Even the old Ben E. King song that inspired the title was trotted out after 25 years to become a hit again. Everywhere you went, people told you how great it was, even a professor in the middle of a lecture in my Asian history class.The film is still great. You watch four young actors, all of whom have recognized public identities beyond the film, and still get totally submerged in their created reality. River Phoenix as Chris Chambers is the obvious leader, wearing an aura of sad maturity that you gravitate to as much as Gordie does, while Corey Feldman is perfect as buggy Teddy Duchamp, a self-deluded 'wet end' spoiling for a fight. Jerry O'Connell, the only one to transfer his acting career into adulthood, is a welcome laugh magnet as the fat and hapless Vern. They play off each other so well, you forget the E! True Hollywood Stories and just focus on the to-and-fro, hearing echoes of your own childhood in what seems improvised dialogue.What else is perfect about this movie? The camera work, the narration by Richard Dreyfuss, the clever use of period music, the attention to detail (like the old Hills Bros. coffee can the kids pitch rocks into at the junkyard), the pace and rhythm. The juxtaposing of the main storyline with detours like Vern's penny hunt and the sad but hilarious tale of Lard Ass Hogan is brilliant, and makes this a hard film to get tired of, no matter how much you see it.Comparing this to the original King story is interesting. On the one hand, whole sections of dialogue are carried over into the screenplay without change. But there's a less rueful tone to the movie, a lighter touch that is welcome. We don't need to hear about Vern and Teddy's awful aftermaths after enjoying their company for 90 minutes, and director Rob Reiner wisely gives them somewhat happier fates. There's more joy here, but its not stupidly happy. That final line, pulled from King's text but not the end of it, brings it all back home.If there was anything I'd change, it would be some of the adult casting, especially Gordon's father and the junkyard guy. Both overplay the hostility. There's a bit too much hugging and male-bonding (when I was a kid, this would have been grounds for "mowing" and an early exile), and the flashbacks with Gordon's brother are a little contrived.But this is a great big enchilada of a movie, full of vigor and fun, and some deeper questions. What did the body really mean for Gordon and his gang? How did it change who they were, and how much were they changing already? It's like that scene with the leeches. You can see Gordon pull that bloody thing off his scrotum and think there's something being said there about the crossroads between sex and death, or else you can say 'That's one big ugly leech.' You are on the money either way. Seeing this movie makes winners of us all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Real Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Stand by Me" is often regarded as a real classic. It is based on the Stephen King novella "The Body," a story that depicts four close adolescent boys who go on a quest to recover a missing boy's dead body in hopes of becoming town heroes. Even King himself has said numerous times that "Stand by Me" is one of his favorite movie adaptations of a book. Nowadays, it is a very rare thing to come across a movie that has such superb acting, a gripping plot, and such a wonderfully made bittersweet ending as shown in "Stand by Me." Although made more than 20 years ago, this movie is so timeless.The movie is set in the summer of 1959. Gordie Lachance (Wil Wheaton), Chris Chambers (played beautifully by River Phoenix), Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman), and Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Conell) play four very close twelve year old boys who help each other through the hard times and make the best of memories together. Gordie is the sensitive writer. He is unfortunately overlooked by his parents due to his star athlete brother's untimely death four months earlier. Chris may be the most complex yet relatable of the group all at once. He is a tough guy on the outside, who steals the milk money at school, and has a reputation of being the bad seed. Yet underneath it all, he wants nothing more than to succeed in life. Teddy Duchamp is the zany one, who can make everybody laugh without any effort. His dad "stormed the beach at Normandy," a thing Teddy greatly admires even though his dad held his ear to a stove (more is revealed about it in the film). Vern Tessio is the portly kid who everybody picks on but still loves. A little bit slow and always forgetting something, Vern is a character I think everyone eventually feels for. Keifer Sutherland also does a great job playing Ace Merrill, the town bully who the four boys are constantly insulted and teased by. Although it is clear Ace will be stuck in the small town the boys live in for the rest of his life, he still reigns.The four main boys set out on an adventure together in order to find the dead body of missing 12 year old classmate Ray Brower. At first, the viewer may assume that this adventure is solely about four kids just wanting to see a decomposing body. However, "Stand by Me" is far from that. The adventure is accompanied by coming-of-age revelations, emotional breakdowns, heartache, and the longing for acceptance. This is the time in which their lives will change forever. Their last real time of innocence, as the movie's tagline states.I must point out River Phoenix's performance as the troubled Chris Chambers. This was his star-making performance, and obviously for a good reason. His acting is wonderful in every aspect. There is never a scene where his acting could have been improved. It is that incredible. Not to say the other boys did not do well, because they definitely did, but Phoenix's performance stood out. Due to his surprising death in real life that came all too soon in 1993, I was left at the end of the movie thinking he could have done so many other great things with his talent. At least the world was able to recognize him as such a talented actor while we had the chance.The music in this movie is also something to be recognized as phenomenal. It is filled with classics from the '50s that make the movie that even more unforgettable. I do not believe I have heard better-fitting music for a film ever before in my life. Ben E. King's "Stand by Me" is placed just at the end of the movie, and it all makes perfect sense. The song made the ending that much better. It is truly a beautiful part of the movie.All of themes of friendship are so timeless and relatable no matter what year we are in. The acting is magnificent and is guaranteed to make a lasting impression on you. It will probably bring a tear to your eye, but I think in a good way. And it is really one of those movies you can watch over and over and never fall out of love with."Stand by Me" is easily one of the best films ever made.</fullReview>

Especially for the fact that River Phoenix starred in it.(hot!!) lol. Anyway, it just was a really good movie with wonderful characters and a great plot.

		<fullReview>For starters, I hate oldies. Music earlier than 1970, with a few exceptions like The Beatles, is just crap to me. But, because of this movie, every time I hear the song, "Stand By Me" I just have to listen to it. This has to be one of my favorite movies and will always be one of my favorites movies. Maybe because I, myself, had three really close friends when I was that age. It's now about seven years later, and none of us hang out anymore. I didn't think much of it at first, but after seeing this movie, I realized how much I liked them and how much fun we had. Also, after seeing this movie, I realized how sad it actually made me to know that I may never see them again because we're all going to different colleges. That's how powerful this movie is. And in the end, he realizes they were the best friends he's ever had. The acting and story is absolutely amazing. They really show how good of friends these kids are and how time and different situations in their lives can just tear them apart. I have never cried at a movie, and this is no exception. But it has brought me the closest to it. 10/10 Stephen King is a genius.</fullReview>

Stand By Me is a great film to have under your belt. Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, and Jerry O'Connell work so well together, it's like they've always been friends. And together, with Keifer Sutherland, it makes a fantastic group. Not to mention director Rob Reiner, he knows how to direct, because he has been directed. "all In The Family" wouldn't be the same if it wasn't for Michael "Meathead" Stivick (SP). Anyways, back to Stand By Me. Fantastic. Good for anyone to watch. 10 Stars for this coming-of-age flick!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stand by me is a timeless classic that will never age. Even though the story is very simple: 'Four 12 year-oldish friends go on a 2 day journey searching for a dead body of a boy they know' it is much more than that.First of all, the actors are perfectly cast and one of the reasons this movie works so well is the brilliant acting and amazing chemistry between the four leads: River Phoenix, Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman, and Jerry O'Connell. They do such a genuine and believable job here at such a young age and their charisma and characters immediately suck you in and give you a nostalgic feeling that stays with you long after the credits have rolled.The supporting cast is also terrific. The cobras are hysterical with some of their one-liners, Kiefer Sutherland is amazingly believable as the stereotypical bully, and even John Cusack's small, yet memorable scenes add to this wonderful film.Stand By Me is a funny and nostalgic movie, with some of the best one-liners and memorable scenes that will leave an impression on the viewer. I couldn't help but want to call up my childhood friends and discuss one of the best movies I've seen in years.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive Little Coming of Age Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rob Reiner's direction and a smart screenplay help make "Stand by Me" an impressive little film that over-achieves. The cast is also strong. Will Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, and Jerry O'Connell find out about a young boy who is missing deep in the woods. They are almost certain that the young boy is dead and they want to find the body and become heroes. However, their journey causes them to see "the big picture" and they realize that they are doing the right thing, but for the wrong reasons. Kiefer Sutherland and John Cusack add great supporting turns and Richard Dreyfuss makes an endearing cameo appearance. River Phoenix is best though. He shows great potential at a very young age and this film would lead to more impressive work before his unfortunate death. A nice little film overall. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clichd and Pointless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Four boys go in search of a dead body, but it becomes a journey of discovery about themselves. The premise of the story (based on a King novella) is stupid and generally uninteresting and the execution is clichd. Reiner seems unsure of where he wants to go with the film; it just rambles on pointlessly. There is an irrelevant interlude about a pie-eating contest filled with gross puking scenes. The characters are either stereotypes (the teens) or cartoon-like (the parents and other adults). The big emotional scenes are corny and forced. The framing device, where the story is related in flashbacks, is meant to be poignant but it just falls flat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A memorable childhood experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't read "The Body", the novella this movie was based on, but the film very much impressed me. It's 1959. Gordie Lachance (Wil Wheaton) and his friends Chris Chambers (River Phoenix), Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman), and Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell) are following the story of Ray Brower, a boy who vanished while picking berries. Vern overhears his older brother Billy Tessio (Casey Siemasko) talking about finding Brower's body, so he tells his friends and the four of them decide to go looking for him. Meanwhile Billy tells his friends about Brower's body as well, and the leader of the gang, John "Ace" Merrill (Kiefer Sutherland) decides to search as well. Along the we we learn several things about each of the characters and they learn things about each other. Gordie loves writing stories and telling stories, but is largely ignored by his parents who are grieving the death of Gordie's older brother Denny Lachance (John Cusack), whom Gordie idolized. Chris's family are largely made up of criminals and alcoholics, and thus people see Chris as merely another link in his family's chain. Teddy's dad suffered from fits and rage after returning home after World War 2, and burned both of Teddy's ears. And Vern is constantly teased for his weight and bullied by Billy. Eventually the group finds Brower's body, but then Merrill's gang shows up. After a confrontation, both groups decide to leave without Brower. The child actors are all great, and the characters are so real that I've met someone like each one of them throughout my life (personally, I think I'm like Gordie). Not to mention, the soundtrack is fantastic. I'm listening to Ben E King as I write this now. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say about Stand by Me? It's certainly well-cast with great child actors and the music is fantastic and hits the nostalgia factor. In the end, though, the movie is a missed opportunity that turns into a by-the-numbers coming-of-age flick. While the protagonists sure are fun characters, the gang of antagonists and parents/adults seem a bit wasted and one-dimensional. I get the feeling Stand by Me starts from a kid's point of view, and therefore it makes sense that the people in our young heroes' lives seem a bit black-and-white, but the kids' development follows non sequiturs and therefore seems a bit uneven.My biggest disappointment with the plot involves the lack of development of the kids' coming to terms with their fate in their beat up old town. They seem to realize they are destined to go nowhere, but the film misses an opportunity to drive this point home. Maybe my problem is I wasn't convinced their plight was that bad after all since the secondary characters didn't get the treatment they deserved.I sound like I'm razzing on this film a bit, so I do want to emphasize that the use of the body as a MacGuffin is brilliant and emblematic of the kids' fate, at least emotionally if not literally, if they don't spread their wings and grow into their true selves. For that, I commend the film.Ultimately, the unfulfilled opportunity to make better use of this point makes it hard for me to give Stand by Me a solid recommendation, so it gets a slightly above average grade of 2.5 stars out of 4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This story is that children, Gordie, Chris, Teddy, Vern venture in order to find a dead body. Through this adventure, they make deep friendship and develop as an adult.This film develops by Gordie's flashback. I think the flashback style tell something that we can get in only our childhood. I sometimes felt bore because they just go to adventure. However, I could find innocence, curiosity, invincibility, and mutability peculiar to children. My favorite point of this film is music, for example Lollipop", "Yakety Yak" and "Stand by Me". These soundtracks make film lively. I think nice choice of music.Though this work was made in 1986, it is famous even now. I could understand this film is called a masterpiece. I think it has great ambition and nostalgia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Movie of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I doubt I can add much of anything which hasn't already been said out of the near-600 reviews at the time of my submission, but I will provide my input, anyway; because this is detailed, my comments will contain spoilers.As is stated, Stand By Me depicts a group of four twelve-year-old boys who embark on a weekend-long journey and learn much about themselves and each other along the way. Gordie is book-smart and gifted in writing, but shy and very insecure. Having lost a few months earlier his biggest supporter, his older brother Denny, he is ignored at home and believes the wrong son's life was taken. He seeks solace around the company of the other three boys, especially his best friend, Chris. While Chris is viewed as "the tough guy" on the surface level, we find that he bears much compassion, as well as a soft- spoken disposition in several instances. As the gang's leader, Chris not only serves as the backbone of the group, but also as a father figure to the other boys, especially Gordie; and, he is the group's peacekeeper.&nbsp; He comes from an abusive home, but seems to accept that's just who his father is; however, he also believes that he is doomed to the failure attached to his family name. Even more troubled is the maniacal army brat, Teddy. Although his father may have served in the military, it appears that some of his time in combat may have been exaggerated; however, I don't believe it is fully intentional of Teddy to be deceptive, but rather that he is creating for himself an illusion of what he wishes his father was, or perhaps used to be (the fact that Teddy knew the location of the Back Harlow Road because he and his dad used to go fishing there suggests a greater presence from his father when Teddy was younger). Then we have Vern, who is often clueless and fearful of everything, and a comedic element throughout all of the film.&nbsp; We know nothing about his parents, other than that his mom cleaned out his room.&nbsp; In any case, the overall lack of parental guidance is a core reason why the friendship among all of the boys is so important.Of course the group dynamics, and especially the increasing bond between Chris and Gordie, is the focal point throughout the story.&nbsp; Although it is mainly Chris who delegates the gang's course of action (and at times, Gordie as well), decisions are run by all of the gang (Vern usually being the exception).&nbsp; However, the group must also deal with the bickering and occasional harsh exchanges of words among one another.&nbsp; There is the consistent squabbling between Teddy and Vern, which essentially makes Chris and Gordie act as "parents" in dealing with them.&nbsp; And there are several instances in which Chris and Teddy butt heads and nearly come to blows, but they are quickly able to make peace and put their differences aside when it matters. However, most significant&nbsp; is the friendship between Chris and Gordie.&nbsp; We see from almost the beginning that the two have mutual respect for one another, with Chris being protective of Gordie. While there exists the looming fear of junior high separating both of them, Chris is willing to sacrifice the friendship in order for Gordie to succeed. However, as the story progresses, and as each tearfully opens up to the other and addresses their own personal demons, we find loyalty between the two friends that ultimately guarantees that whatever happens in life will not come between them.The teamwork and brotherhood mentality of the younger gang is a sharp contrast to the antagonists of the story, Ace Merrill and his gang. However, it is Ace who gives out all orders regardless of what anyone else might want; and he alone is truly heartless, as evidenced in the showdown during the climactic scene in which his gang --- including Chris' older brother Eyeball --- become disturbed by his actions.&nbsp; But the harsh discourse between the two gangs also reveals the true loyalty between Chris and Gordie: in the beginning Chris defends Gordie to Ace and is thrown to the ground; then eventually, Gordie stands up to Ace (while Vern and Teddy run), putting his own future safety at risk, but ultimately saving Chris' life.&nbsp;In that showdown scene, we also find Gordie to discover an inner strength just moments after having told Chris that he wished his own life had been taken rather than his brother's; and for Chris, I think he realized that he could indeed choose a better path than his family and especially Ace.&nbsp; This scene, along with the others aforementioned, were undoubtedly the main reasons why Gordie and Chris' friendship thrived throughout their school years while drifting apart from the others; and although life might have gotten in the way after college and they hadn't seen each other for a number of years, the friendship was never lost.And while it's indeed tragic that Chris' life came to an abrupt end, we must remember that he was able to go on to college and live a productive and adult life.&nbsp; Assuming he was around 38 years old when he died, he still lived much longer than his real-life portray-er, River Phoenix.I have loved Stand By Me&nbsp;ever since I first saw it on HBO/Showtime a year after its release and cannot count the hundreds of times I have watched it throughout the years.&nbsp; Although I loved the performances of everyone in the cast, like most everyone else I favored that of River Phoenix the most; his work in this film was what made him become my favorite celebrity.&nbsp; After his passing I was unable to bring myself to watch this story again for a few years, but today I can without reservation state that this is my favorite movie of all time.</fullReview>

For me, it's even get more emotional as Gordie looks a bit like the me : fragile, skinny, soft, dreamy, mournful, anxious, a great imagination to invent stories and definitely attached to his friends. Like him, i was demolished when education separated me from them ! Like him, i like having adventures and i have also covered a corpse (mine was a dead cat in a decrepit hospital for which we got troubles with parents !!!). So King has really a gift to remember this golden time with his words and finally, he could leave the paranormal ! His buddy are all fantastic and their chemistry feels good ! To put it in the late 50s makes it share this mythic time with rock songs (especially the eponymous classic) and perfect nostalgic society ( twin peaks ,  BTF ) and this trip into wild nature is just a fantastic journey that my city slickers soul craves for ! Thus, definitely, the best movie for 1986 forever !</fullReview>

I almost was astonish to gaze the acting of little kids that i momentarily thought they are lot better than the grown up actors in the film. The story depicts the memories of four friends who share their neighbor and schools tangled themselves in an adventure that they will remember for their rest of the lives. It was nearly impossible to handle the film for that long for that age and they did it quite surprisingly. The film was mixture of some sad moments with a kiddish humor and with loads of adventure, Probably the complete description of novel with light summer view of an perfect location to shoot and a very dark story that is being handled in a kids way.</fullReview>

They perfectly captured what a group of teenage boys are really like. The line that the film ends is my favourite and is one of the strongest in the film.

		<shortDescription>Stand by me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1959 in Castle rock, Oregon , after learning that a boy their age had been accidentally killed near their rural homes 4 boys embark on a journey to go see the body. Gordie Lachance (Wil Wheaton), Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell), Chris Chambers (River Phoenix) and Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman) encounter a mean junk man and a marsh full of leeches, town punks led by Ace (Keefer Sutherland) and they also learn more about one another and their very different home lives. Just a lark at first, the boys' adventure evolves into a defining event in their lives. After the death of a friend a writer (Richard Dryfuss), tells that amazing journey and paints the picture of a time of yester year. The strong relationship between Chris and Gordie shows how friendship has no cultural or class boundaries. As the four boys travel on their journey their friendship is tested by spats, crazy behavior, bad childhoods spoken of, and the fear of death when they have a run in with Ace and the crew. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by Stephen King, Stand By Me is classic in the likes of Shawshank Redemption. The camera shots and action shots keeps the audience engaged as the journey continues. Rob Reiner does an excellent job of capturing their youth. Whether it's the care free stroll as they sing, or the gun pointing confrontation with Ace. This film keeps you captivated and on your seats. Once it's over you'll find yourself reminiscing on your childhood and the long lasting friendships you've made and the ones you've lost.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is definitely a classic. It takes you on a journey with 4 young boys to find a missing body. The thing I love most about this film is the characters. As they go on this journey, you see their strengths and weaknesses. You also see their friendship grow and strengthen.One of my favorite scenes in this movie is the train track scene. Its hilarious and intense and beautiful all at once.This is one of those movies where you notice something new about it every time. It was filmed very brilliantly because the director used the captured setting very well. The small beaten down town was clearly not Hollywood, it felt real and relatable.

I also know the Simpsons did a reference to this so the Simpsons brought me to watch this film. Family Guy parodied this too. It was also cool when Gordie used that gun to stop those bullies from killing him and his friends. This was a pretty good film based on the Body by Stephen King anyway. Pretty good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Stand By Me' is An Absolute Standout!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Stand By Me' is told in the form of a memoir, as established writer Gordie Lachance (Richard Dreyfuss), stunned by a local newspaper item about the death of a close friend, sits in his car, remembering back to 1959. Then, in the fullness of late summer, he and three of his friends embarked on an adventure that changed the course of their very carefree existence: a journey deep into the nearby woods to find the body of one of their very own missing classmates. Weeks prior, Ray Brower had disappeared and was presumed dead by authorities; now, armed with a veiled suggestion that his remains rest by a lake near where train tracks cross through the woods, the four hike up to the woodland grave-site to discover the body, bring it back to town and be hailed as heroes by the media.The movie cuts through what might otherwise be perceived as a devastating tragedy with a sense of cheerful displacement; in turn, we find certain nostalgic amusement in the way the young characters converse over embarrassment, implausible fears, the uncertain future, camaraderie and, most importantly, bullying. They also deal with devastating pasts that feel like shadows looming off camera ? beanpole slim Gordie is still devastated by the untimely death of his oldest brother, bespectacled Teddy is abused by his mentally ill father, the no-nonsense leader of the gang Chris lacks a support system and pudgy little Vern is always in the wrong place at the wrong time and often verbalizes his inner paranoia in ways the others find comical. Each is something of a social misfit, subtly played by a phenomenal young cast and in the hands of these four, it makes for a journey thick in sarcasm but laced with an underlying dread that sneaks its way into their upbeat demeanors. They cling to their innocence even as the world around them grows darker, and when the plot insists they confront the gnawing influence of reality head-on, they refuse to be broken by the experience.Director Rob Reiner has a remarkable ear for the rhythms and slang of these boys on the cusp, a keen eye for their bravado. In his effortless handling of the complexity of group dynamics, with its undeclared wars and mercurial alliances, he gracefully blends raucous comedy with intense drama and delivers a film that is as much about the loss of innocence as it is of the getting of wisdom. He cleverly inter-cuts the sobering undercurrent of pathos with frequent dialogue exchanges that are succinct, carefree and sometimes rather amusing. These exchanges become the path through which we empathize with their plight, gain perspective in their approach and, ultimately, find parallels in our own formative years. And because Stand by Me is an adult's recollection of the turning point of his youth, the film very effectively contrasts a boy's consciousness with that of a man's. Dreyfuss' dryly funny narration provides both shrewd comic relief from the juvenile melodramatics and a mature perspective of a child's crisis.Rob Reiner's bucolic, nostalgic drama is suffused with the magic of childhood and rightfully deserves its place in the heart of an entire generation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite Possibly The Best Coming-of Age Movie Ever Made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stand By Me is based on a novella by horror author, Stephen King. Although King is best- known for writing horror novel and short stories, he also has a knack for writing heartfelt dramatic pieces of literature. Enter Stand By Me. At the time, it was the best adaptation of a dramatic work of King and arguably still is. Director Rob Reiner brings a small story into a small-length film with large results.Richard Dreyfuss briefly stars as writer Gordie Lachance who writes a story about the major turning point of his life in the summer of 1959. He narrates the movie from then on. We get to meet and know him and his three best friends very well. Earlier that year, young Gordie's (Will Wheaton) older brother (John Cusack) died in a car accident and his parents have been neglecting him. Gordie's best friend Chris Chambers' (River Phoenix) entire family are low-lives and Chris' self esteem is low because of how often he is associated with them. Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman) is the craziest of the gang who greatly admires his World War II father, despite him almost burning his ear off and being confined to a mental institution. Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell) is overweight and scared of everything, making his an easy target for bullying, especially by his older hoodlum brother Billy (Casey Siemazko).One day, Vern is rummaging for his jar of pennies and overhears Billy and Billy's friend Charlie talking about the whereabouts of sought-after dead body, Ray Brower. Both are scared to tell the authorities because they happened to find the corpse when they dumped a car they stole. Vern tells his three friends and they begin a two-day trek to find the body in hopes of becoming heroes in their town's eyes. Their journey is both hilarious and heartfelt, where the boys discover exactly who they are and create memories that last forever. When they find out Billy and Charlie told their secret to the rest of the members of their gang, the leader, Ace Merrill (Kiefer Sutherland) is determined to find the body too, and Gordie and his friends must use all the loyalty they have to survive.Although a drama, Stand By Me consists of hilarious scenes and moments of dialogue that will make you laugh out loud. There is also excitement created as the boys go along the train tracks and almost become mincemeat. But really, it is the reliability and chemistry that makes Stand By Me such an achievement. For instance, Gordie has a knack for storytelling and Chris persuades him to pursue it. At first, Gordie is strongly against it but becomes a writer himself as an adult. The boys think their small town of just over 1000 people is plenty, but their arrival back makes them realize how much more there is in the world.</fullReview>

I grew up watching this one a few times a year, and still to this day I think it may be one of the best movies ever made. The music is so important in so many of the scenes, and I believe the film's overall value comes from its ability to preserve the ideas of innocence and childhood and friendship, but also from it's use of great American songs that will forever be attached to so many memorable moments throughout the film. Watching this movie is like having the time of your life over and over again and being able to hold onto things that have already been forgotten by our modern social structure.

		<shortDescription>The story of adolescence for just about everyone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mostly, this is a film about bringing up nostalgia in all of us. It's pretty true for most of us, I think, that our most memorable friendships were forged in late elementary school into middle school. They weren't probably our friends for our whole lives, but we remember them because we shared the most awkward point in our lives together. Ace's gang of fellow teenagers is a great example of this, though it isn't shown outright. The group of older troublemakers are not really friends, only sharing a common inability to face up to their own problems as their own individuals. This is contrasted with Gordy's friends who, while they make fun of each other as much as any group of companions, are not too proud to sympathize with each other's problems and help each other.The story is shown through the eyes of Gordy LaChance, who is easily the least likable but also the most relatable of the four main characters. He has his own conflicts and is a character worthy of sympathy, but he's also pretty generic. Then again, that's sort of his purpose. I'm sure that most people felt that they were more like Gordy than any of the other four. You kind of feel for Vern too since we've all been the butt of jokes like he is, though probably not as many as him. Chris generates sympathy as well because you want him to succeed, but know that he likely won't. I've felt for several of my own friends in the same way I felt for Chris. However, I think Chris sees Gordy's success as enough for him; if he can't have it, then Gordy had better have it, kind of like Chucky and Will in Good Will Hunting. Teddy is easily the most fun to watch, at least for me, and it's not surprising to find out that he died pretty young. He doesn't seem to be afraid of anything, which I guess is why I don't know too many people like Teddy. In his retrospective look at his friends, Gordy acknowledges what they do for him much more than what he does for them.The plot is more of a series of events than an actual story. You know that the main goal throughout is to find the dead body and that the characters will eventually get there, but it's not the main thing on your mind while watching it. The audience is meant to be more concerned with what the next obstacle or trial the boys have to face will be. The same goes for the fun moments of the movie like the Mighty Mouse vs. Superman conversation and Gordy's pie-eating contest story.The execution was great without being over-the-top noticeable. The dialogue was realistic, but still got it's points across. The acting was also great from the four kids in the sense that they felt like kids. It pretty much does what Goonies tried to do, but Goonies was made as a kids movie and so made the kids talk like people wish they did, whereas Stand by Me scripts them more closely to how they actually behave.I would recommend this movie to pretty much anyone. It's not the peak of entertainment by any means, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth watching. In terms of appropriate age range, I can safely say that anyone above 13 can handle it. MPAA may say it's for 17+, but your seventh grader will not learn any vocabulary from this that they don't hear every day. If you absolutely need a solid plot to enjoy a story, I would say that should be the only thing holding you back from digitally renting this. Overall Rating: 8.4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had only recently seen this film, though it looks like something I should have been introduced to a long, long time ago. I like heart warming realistic films that revolve around the world of children and teenagers, because they are undeniably relatable (well, this one was, anyways).I discovered this movie a few days ago while surfing tumblr and seeing a quote from this film, and the moment I saw a picture of it, I knew right away that it was totally up my alley. The film isn't nostalgic in the sense that I can place it as a ''memorable movie from sweet childhood'', because, like I had mentioned, I've only recently seen it. The film is nostalgic because it brought me back to how I was as a kid.It brought me back to when I loved getting out of the house and running and biking all over my small town, taking walks in the woods and getting into a bit of trouble with my friend. That's why I have a large amount of appreciation for this film, needless to say that it was packed with heartwarming, and touching moments. This film showcases the sincerity, innocence and loyalty of true childhood friendship. Please watch this film, it's definitely a memorable gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's one of those films that after watching; you can't stop thinking about for days. To cut it short, the cast did a great job on this. The film displays a lot of emotion, which I like. Just like how some horror movies have comedy in, and some comedy have horror in. This had multiple genres that you could squeeze into it's description; the sadness of the dead body - a poor kid who got hit by a train. The humorous jokes and lifestyle of the teens - The love shown to Gordie's deceased brother - and more.The story is different. I liked that the director(s) used children to portray the characters, and that Stephen King used memories of his childhood to piece this film together. It makes the film mean a lot more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rob Reiner know's how to adapt Stephen King's greatest novels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>---SPOILER REVIEW---- As I start to commence into the greatest hits of Stephen King, I can't say I've actually read "The Body" (Novelization of Stand By Me) However I have read Misery, and Rob Reiner obviously knows what he's doing with his source material. Stand By Me is about a journey of four boys of junior high age. What they intended on their journey wasn't the life changing revelations that succumbed in the events of the movies, but simply to find a dead body, bring it in and hopefully attain fame from it. Gordie, Chambers, Teddy and Vern, each fill their own role in the gang. Gordie is the protagonist of the story, and his revelation revolves around the death of his seemingly perfect brother, Denny, who's always supported Gordie no matter the judgment of his father, who's only ever cherished the accomplishments of Denny, while sweeping Gordie under the rug. There is a moment in the middle of the movie where Gordie is having a dream of his brothers funeral. Everyone is looking down at Denny's grave. Gordie's father puts his hand on Gordie's shoulder saying "It should've been you." Now I wasn't sure if this was actually what happened during the funeral, but Gordie wakes up directly after this, explaining to Chris(Chamber) that he didn't cry at his brother's funeral. This is presumably to point out the fact that during the dream, Gordie did not cry during the funeral so this could also mean that his father really did tell him that he'd with Gordie had died instead of Denny. This is portrayed in the movie's great use of dialogue in certain situations such as Gordie and Chamber's heart to heart conversations. Though the dialogue portrayed throughout most of the movie comes off as cheesy and unrealistic in terms of how the youth would speak otherwise, this could have just been dialogue taken from Stephen King's novel. Again, I didn't read the book, and I wasn't born in the 50's. Anyways, I thought the movie was great, and definitely sent an inspiring message to those who aspire to do something great for themselves. These are my basic feelings about the movie and the moments that stuck out to me most. 1,000 words isn't enough for a full review unfortunately.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the 1982 novella "The Body" by Stephen King, this is an excellent coming of age drama, perhaps the best that I have seen, wonderfully directed by Rob Reiner. Of course, King is best known for his horror stories which is why I imagine that the title was changed. If I saw a headline about a film called "The Body" written by Stephen King, this is not the kind of story that would immediately spring to mind and I doubt that I would be alone in that. I have never read the novella so I don't know how much or how little the screenwriters Raynold Gideon and Bruce A. Evans added to it. In any event, the writing and characterisation are superlative. Being 12 to 13 years old is an awkward, difficult phase in everyone's life for reasons that are many and obvious and the film perfectly portrays it from the male perspective. The four boys all seem like real people and the dialogue always seems like real conversation rather than lines in a film. I remember very well doing and saying things along the same lines as Gordie, Chris, Teddy and Vern when I was their age. Of the four characters in question, I probably relate most to Gordie as I was awkward, shy and nerdy at that age, though thankfully I had and have loving, supportive parents rather than emotionally distant, neglectful ones. Since I have never been the bravest soul, I also relate to Vern to some degree. The way that the boys interact is so authentic as well. It's a brilliant and completely realistic depiction of male friendships, both the close and tempestuous varieties, in my experience. I loved the fact that it did not attempt to sanitise anything. It feels like the actual 1950s rather than the film and TV version of the 1950s.Of course, not all of the film's success can be attributed to the writing. If the four boys had been played by horrendous stage school types, the film would not have worth much in spite of how good the script is. However, Rob Reiner had a great eye for casting and River Phoenix, Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell all deliver excellent performances. I don't just mean that they were excellent for child actors. I mean that they were excellent full stop. Wheaton attributes this to the fact that all four of them were essentially the same as the characters that they were playing. This is seen most clearly with Phoenix as the cool, wise beyond his years, intelligent and passionate Chris. Sadly, life imitated art in that both River Phoenix and Chris died young when they could have accomplished so much more. While this was neither his first acting role nor his first film, it brought him widespread attention and started him on the course to a very successful acting career that was cut tragically short. Really, it's so surprise that the other three young actors went on to have good careers in the years that followed with Jerry O'Connell's being the best of the three. Wil Wheaton gives the performance of his life as Gordie, who is grief stricken at the death of his beloved older brother Denny and feels neglected by his parents. His chemistry with River Phoenix hits all the right notes. It's a shame that Wesley Crusher was such an irritant as he could have done great work with a good character and good writing in "Star Trek: The Next Generation". As Teddy, Cory Feldman is suitably irritating for much of the film but, in spite of that, he never fails to be a sympathetic character. He's an understandably angry young boy from a dysfunctional family who has suffered more in 12 years than many people suffer in their whole lives. Vern is perhaps the most normal character and therefore least interesting of the four but Jerry O'Connell, who will always be Quinn Mallory to me, excels in the role as the kindhearted and put upon boy. The film also benefits from a strong supporting cast, particularly Kiefer Sutherland (who, in contrast to my love for his father Donald's acting, I don't usually like) as one of the most frightening film bullies, Casey Siemaszko, John Cusack, Marshall Bell and Bruce Kirby. The always wonderful Richard Dreyfuss was an inspired choice for the adult Gordie. In addition to his perfect casting choices, Rob Reiner's talent as a director is demonstrated by the beautiful way in which the film is shot. He makes great use of the Oregon scenery and other locations throughout the film and I don't think that there is a single shot in the film that does not work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the great Love stories...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I saw the movie, I read the novella (THE BODY, by Stephen King) and was struck by the STYLE of the writing: it reminded me more than a little of a Ray Bradbury story. I enjoyed the story and looked forward to seeing the movie- but what I wasn't prepared for was the Emotional Impact the movie would have on me. When I walked out of the theater, my legs were weak. I went to my car and got in and sat behind the wheel for a long time thinking about the guys I'd grown up with. Most of them were dead or in jail by then (or should've been), but they'd been my FRIENDS and remembering them that evening, I couldn't help but break down. Sure, the movie is stylized and the dialogue retains that "Bradbury" feel, but STAND BY ME is one of those rare movies that (at least for me) sticks with you long after you've seen it. It's hard to watch because of the memories it dredges up, but I still see it whenever I can because sometimes, no matter how much it hurts, it's good to Remember.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun trip back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating-7/10Stand By Me is a movie about childhood imagination and wonder, but also adolescent pranks and humour mixing it all together to create one nostalgic trip for all those who partake. It has its moments of pure fun and even a little bit of laughter plotted here and there but I did feel the film is overrated, or maybe not but in any case I found it to be pretty good and here below is just why so.Look the plot is firm and is enjoyable and the whole reason they go out on there little adventure is truly a fun time and almost thrilling at certain points. I particularly enjoyed the more sweet moments but also level with the funny bits and so some conversations can go from problems at home or school to Your Momma jokes in three seconds. It has a creative ending and a sweet finale, one which should, and I repeat should leave you with quite a little sweet feeling inside if not slightly saddened.The star of the film is truly River Phoenix who commands and also just generally acts better than the rest, at times he even seems to control not only the other characters but the actors themselves. I wasn't too keen on the performance of Will Wheaton who although of course was a young inexperienced actor back then, still didn't have the knack for being the main actor in the story. Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell complete the young boys group and I enjoyed Feldman, annoying character but acted well and he can provide some of the more exciting moments with O'Connell being almost the butt of every single joke.I think Rob Reiner works it well here and he manages to create a piece not only enjoyable but fun, but a kind of fun where it still leaves a bit of emotion to be felt for the people involved. Getting the most out of such a highly acclaimed writers book is not easy I'm guessing and the two writers and Reiner seem to bring this story more or less to life without me feeling "maybe the book is better".It's a sweet bit of fun no denying and I feel it's not just a movie for kids or people who grew up in the time its set in, it also brings a true depth and for it's relatively short running time actually creates a rather slow moving but interesting plot. It isn't new ground whatsoever but with the added bonus of the what the boys are looking for, it means that in the more generic scenes, it remains much more thrilling and mysterious than other films of this type. One particular point is that the plot is not only an adventure along a train track where four guys talk the whole way, they do things and they see things which make it much more enjoyable to us and I can't deny I felt somewhat the same emotion as how the characters felt, a scene involving a bridge with a train track on and Jerry O'Connell come to mind.Overall I felt it to be as I said pretty good and I gave it a 7/10 because although it's nearly a good movie, it just isn't quite there and from what some others have said about seeing this is that it's 10/10, 5 stars etc and I have to disagree. By no means don't see it, it's well worth a look and the acting, writing and directing won't let you down too much plus Richard Dreyfuss is a nice narrator.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Friendship...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Stand by Me" is a movie in which we watch four boys who are best friends trying to find a body of a missing boy. We watch all of these from the eyes of a writer who was one of those kids and after the death of his friend he recounts this trip.I liked this movie because of the plot which I found really good, and the direction of it that it was equally good and made by Rob Reiner. This movie reminded two movies because of its theme. The first movie that it reminded me was the "Sleepers" which I believe has many commons with that one. And the second was the "Mystic River". I also liked very much the interpretation of the little one Wil Wheaton who played as Gordie Lachance and he was simply outstanding in his role, another interpretation that it had to be mentioned is River Phoenix who played as Chris Chambers.Lastly I believe that "Stand by Me" shows us and wants from us to understand how important and strong are the friendships that we had when we were kids. And it wants also to shows us that these friendships can either exist until today or not.</fullReview>

Broadly speaking the movie is a sentimental tale of innocence and adventure featuring four young boys trekking through the backwater of an American town to locate the body of a kid. The only people stopping them are the local thugs.A tragic story, focusing on the plight of the townspeople while the four young kids are all very funny and daring. Found it a bit slow in parts and the ending was a bit of a drag. I felt it could have been more exciting. Other than this a thoroughly good watch for an evening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The coming of age tale to rule them all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stand By Me is an important film for many and it's not at all hard to See why. It's an adaptation of a Stephen King short story, centering on 4 friends who go out on a journey to retrieve a dead body. After watching Stand By Me there's little to no reason to watch any other coming of age film, since this shows all the genre is about in under 90 minutes and leaves you glowing. It manages to get a remarkable amount of material in only 88 minutes. It hasn't really aged at all and there aren't many flaws. SBM proves that child actors don't always deserve the hate, as the cast are very strong throughout- look out for a pre Jack Bauer Keifer Sutherland. All of the characters are well developed and have interesting relationships, and even though you only know them for an hour and half you grow to care about all of them. Rob Reiner directs the film superbly, wringing fine cinematography out of a fairly small drama and creating plenty of exciting and funny moments as well. SBM seems to have it all.The script is one of the best scripts of all time. With amazing opening and closing lines, loads of drama and plenty of emotional sophistication this is an incredibly moving and entertaining picture which has a universal appeal. SBM's plot doesn't feel ludicrous or OTT and it'll speak to everyone, grown ups as well as young people. The 15 certificate is unfortunate in my opinion as it means people the same age as the characters in the film may not be able to watch it, so while the script is great the number of 4 letter words could easily have been reduced. That's the only more obvious flaw of the film, which also doesn't take up much time and is easy to watch. SBM is a very emotional film, but it's also an adventurous and entertaining one that won't fail to touch... well anyone. A great coming of age story overall; one of the best films I've seen all year and one of the most essential films currently on Netflix UK. If you haven't seen it, then see it.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stephen King's 'odd one out'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who's into their horror films cannot have heard of Stephen King. He's written countless creepy books, most of which have been transferred (not always successfully) to film. So, your basic Stephen King film normally has one unseen evil entity making the lives of some sleepy American town a living hell.The we have 'Stand By Me.' It really doesn't fit in with any of his other work. Yes, we have the small American town as a setting, but that's where the similarities end. In fact... the film is pretty hard to describe to someone. It's about four boys who go off to find a dead body they have heard is lying somewhere in the woods. That's about it really. And it's hard for someone who hasn't heard much about it to really get excited by that miniscule plot synopsis.But, believe it or not, it's actually pretty good. Yes, there isn't too much in the way of 'threat.' Not like King's other tales of demons, monsters or the supernatural, always hot on his heroes' heels. Here, much of the charm of the tale is told simply by watching the four boys interact. As any man will know, looking back on his childhood, the temptation to go and see a 'real life' dead body would almost be too tempting to resist. Therefore I for one can identify with their simple motives.Then you have the characters themselves ? a stoic River Phoenix, a bowl-cut haired Will Wheaton, an almost unrecognisably fat Jerry O'Connel and a completely insane Corey Feldman. Every one is completely unique and quite relatable in their own way, so it's hard to pick out a stand out performance.Someone online described it as a 'quiet classic.' I can't really top that description. Just because it probably doesn't sound the most thrilling of adventures, don't let it put you off. It's only an hour and a half long and, packed into its average runtime, is more touching, heartfelt and poignant moments than you'll get in King's entire body of work put together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best coming of age movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw it many years ago, and well worth repeating. Anything Steven King does is Gold! Great coming of age story. A lot of Stephen King's films are hit or miss, but this one is a must own!It is based on a semi-autobiographical novella by Stephen King. While King of course became famous for writing horror stories, this is not a horror story. He tries to capture some of the look and the feel of his childhood in the story, and the director Rob Reiner similarly tried to capture something of the feeling of his own childhood in the film. It could have taken place anywhere in rural or small-town America, but is set in Oregon.anyway,Fabulous movie, has all the right movie making elements to be an all time favorite. The boy actors are memorable and it reflects childhood fears and triumphs perfectly. Highly recommended.and;Great classic movie. Besides river Phoenix what ever happened to all the other actors?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is really touching, honest and moving! This film really does get you thinking about the sort of friends you had at the age of twelve and which one of them was your best friend. This film really stood out to me and really touched my heart. The films stars River Phoenix (Chris) as a boy who is labeled "The bad kid" but I could see that really was not the case at all, I felt that River Phoenix really put a lot of time into his character and he really played his character well and he gave a fantastic, brilliant acting performance. Corey Feldman also put a lot of time into his character and really gave a great acting performance and so did the rest of the cast.The film follows four friends one weekend they go out in search of a dead body and they think how famous they might be when they find this dead body and along the way they show the emotions they might have had bottling up inside them and they realize what being friends really means and standing by one another.I gave this film a 10/10 it really touched my heart as I felt I was actually there with them and the film really makes you feel what the character's are going through. I love the honest the film is in terms of how realistic it was and how they told a story of this touching tale. I totally recommend this film to anyone who loves a good 1980's film it is totally a classic.You have to watch this film it's fantastic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Stand by Me"was shown in the year when I was born. This movie is absolutely amazing. I watched this movie over and over again because I think it reminds me of my experience when I was young. Moreover,it brings back old memories of when I was young. At times in life I feel something and think about something and remember this movie all of a sudden. So when I want to remember the friendships and friends of that time,I watch this movie.This story describes the adventure of boys living in a small town,Castle lock,of Oregon in the 1950s. The main characters are four boys. They each have a traumatic experience. Gordie has an introverted personality and is quite serious too. He has a talent for writing stories. He lost an elder brother in an accident. He is treated coldly by his parents and has an inferiority complex. Chris is a close friend of Gordie. He has a strong sense of justice and is smart. However, his home environment despairs of him badly in the future. Teddy wears big glasses. He longs to join the armed unit in the army,influenced by his father. He respects his father but is abused by his father. Vern is fat and cowardly. They have different personalities and characters but they were good friends.One day,they hear the rumor that a missing boy was dead at the track side at the edge of a town. They go for an adventure in search of the body. The main character finally said. "I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve. Jesus, does anyone." I sympathized with those words. And it left an impression on me.Please watch this movie if you want to remember irreplaceable days of the youth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully done; one of the best Stephen King adaptations.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anchored by four irresistible performances by the youthful leads, "Stand by Me" stands tall as one of the finest films to be derived from a Stephen King story (a novella originally titled "The Body"). It's an emotionally stirring tale of boyhood friendship, at that transitional age before boys start making the journey towards manhood. And in that sense, this has an effectively allegorical quality. If the prospective viewer is anything like this one, it will likely make you long for your lost childhood. The four main characters are well defined and very sympathetic, with most of them having to experience some painful thoughts and ideas.With Gordie (Wil Wheaton), it's the idea that his grieving parents have no love left for him after the death of his older brother Denny (John Cusack, in a cameo). With Chris (River Phoenix), it's the fact that he seemingly has a preordained destiny to end up a no-good type like his father and older brother "Eyeball" (Bradley Gregg). And Teddy (Corey Feldman) lives with an unbalanced, sadistic war veteran father who seriously maimed him at one point.The setting is Oregon, 1960 (in the King-invented town of Castle Rock, which in his fiction is set in Maine). Together with their corpulent, nervous buddy Vern (Jerry O'Connell, in his film debut), the kids set out to search for the body of a kid their age, whom they heard had come to a bad end. Along the way they have assorted adventures: dodging a train, encountering a mean junk yard dog (who's nowhere near as monstrous as legend made him out to be), discovering a pond full of leeches, and being treated to one of storyteller Gordie's yarns (the entire Lardass Hogan episode is hysterical). Eventually, they run afoul of town bully "Ace" Merrill (an amusing Kiefer Sutherland).The on location shooting is excellent, and the film does have a lot of resonance and emotional impact. Some people in the audience may take exception to the cussing (which really isn't all that bad), but director Rob Reiner, working from the script by co-producers Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon, does a fine job of capturing small town America in a simpler time. Both Wheaton and Phoenix have some very impressive moments; backing up the young cast (also including Casey Siemaszko and Gary Riley) are such solid character players as Marshall Bell, Frances Lee McCain, and Bruce Kirby, with Richard Dreyfuss playing Gordie as an adult.Reiner truly was on a roll during this period; 28 years later this remains one of his best efforts.10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Standing!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rob Reiner's "Stand By Me" qualifies as a great movie. The Raynold Gideon and Bruce A. Evans screenplay is thoughtful, introspective, but appropriately melodramatic, with memorable dialogue. Reiner and his writers know when to swerve from comic hijinks to dramatic predicaments. Squeamish spectators who abhor profanity should be prepared for some naughty words. The film benefits from strong casting, with Kiefer Sutherland as a superb villain. The quartet of kids?River Phoenix, Will Wheaton, Corey Feldman, and Jerry O'Connell?are likable enough characters etched with enough quirks to make them interesting. They learn where a dead body--Ray Brower?can be located near a river and take a walk through the woods to get it. Meanwhile, Ace Merrill (Kiefer Sutherland) and his cronies take their cars. Mind you, "Stand By Me" is a coming-of-age story about troubled youth. Gordie Lachance (Will Wheaton) feels guilty about the death of his older brother Denny (John Cusack) who excelled at football. Denny was the apple of his father's eye. During a nightmare, Gordie dreams that his father told him that he should have died. Chris Chambers (River Phoenix) is the never-do-well kid, and his big brother runs with Ace. Reiner doesn't wear out our patience with his skillful adaptation of Stephen King's novella "The Body." Reiner relates his yarn from Gordie's perspective. Like all flashback tales, this one has an older actor (Richard Dreyfuss) reminiscing about his past. The semi-sort of happy ending is both downbeat and solemn. Definitely worth watching with several good scenes, like Ace running a truck off the highway during a chicken race, the railway bridge crossing, and the leech scene in the river with our quartet of heroes, stand out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Elegaic and emotional</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Four lads in their early teens have heard that there is a dead body lying in the woods some miles away and, out of morbid curiosity, go on a camping trip to investigate.Stephen King's novella uses this simple framework to create a work which examines friendship, family, remembrance, bravery, bullying, and a wealth of other things, in a quietly emotional and gently humorous way. And, glory be, Rob Reiner's movie manages to capture all that subtlety while looking gorgeous and featuring wonderful performances from young actors who, for various reasons, mostly never quite fulfilled the potential they showed here.There is, of course, an element of the macabre here - it is Stephen King, after all - but this is incidental: there is far more laughter than horror.This is a quietly excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Childhood Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A childhood classic that still holds up today. Every scene in this film brings up a new memory for my younger days. For every character in the film I image a friend I had growing up and how similar they are to them. The ending is sad, but there are plenty of laughs and good times to be had along the way. The pie eating scene, the leach scene, the dog scene, the dead body scene. I remember talking about all of them for hours with my friend as a kid. Even though we all saw the film we'd stand around or sit around and talk about it and describe it to each other like we'd never seen it before. I have a friend that died and friends that I haven't seen in ages and when I re-watched this movie memories of them ran through my head. It made me sad and happy both at the same time. I don't have kids, but if I did this is a movie I would love to share with them. If you haven't seen it please do and if you have seen it, watch it again because it stands the test of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Little Rascals, they ain't.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A typical, straight-forward coming-of-age story focusing on a group of boys attempting to fulfill their fantasies of coming face-to-face with death by going on a two-day trip to search for the body of a boy from their town who has been missing. While the plot itself meanders around what it actually wants to do before it finally settles down in the last third. Padding out the script through flashbacks, stories told by the characters and cross-cutting with a parallel group of teenage boys.Indeed, the strongest aspects of the film are the young actors and the characterization of each one of them. The four main boys have charming chemistry, each one embodying a different facet of the typical American young boy circa 1959. What is so remarkable about these characters is how the two groups of boys seem to represent the entire spectrum from boyhood to young manhood. Both gangs use adult language, play with adult toys and attempt to paint themselves in a much older light than they actually are. Reiner's use of cross-cutting allows us to compare and contrast how the two groups interact and view themselves. As an audience, it is also fun to see how certain famous faces got their start in the business. Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman, Kiefer Sutherland, John Cusack and of course the immortalized River Phoenix, whose portrayal of the conflicted, parental Chris only began to reveal the marvelous talent he possessed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epoch of our lives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone makes judgmental thoughts about others. Whether we actually care about these prejudices or not is personal, but Stand By Me inspiringly documents that we can transcend the labels on us, and further demonstrates that we should. Four young boys are searching for fun, for adventure, for a memorable experience. Upon hearing the shocking news of the location of a missing boy's body, they set out on a venture to find him and have their pictures in the newspapers. Throughout the journey, they discover a lot more--about themselves and the world--besides the ill-fated boy. This film is extremely nostalgic. Displaying the lives of adventurous and curious boys in the summer, who have been devoid of attention. These four twelve-year-old boys have experienced a great fortune of pain throughout their lives already, and they begin a trek to escape from their past for at least a short while.The whole movie revolves around the theme of friendship and overcoming challenges. We see the various emotions the boys feel, the suffering they undergo, and the will power that they have to be themselves. I truly enjoyed this Stand By Me since it's not your typical film of an adventure through the lands; no, it's an inspirational story of four boys who start the epoch of their lives. We all have personal trials that we go through. It could be the untimely death of a loved one, finding meaning in life, battling depression or just finding a purpose to live. Regardless of the challenges we endure, this film strongly depicts how vastly we transform and learn about ourselves when faced with controversy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gordie recalls his childhood as he reads about Chris Chambers' death in the newspapers. It's 1959 Castlerock Oregon. Childhood friends Gordie Lachance (Wil Wheaton), Chris Chambers (River Phoenix), Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman), and chubby Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell) goes on a quest to see a dead body.Based on a Stephen King story, the Richard Dreyfuss narrations give it that old timey feel. The best thing in the movie are the four kids leads. Wil Wheaton has the geeky role. River Phoenix has the leading man persona. Corey Feldman is the screw up. And Jerry O'Connell was fat. I remember watching this with a friend in the theater. As the eating contest begins, he said 'Are they going to show THAT?' I had no idea what he meant, but he read the book. Let's just say that it's a great scene. This movie continues to be one of the best Stephen King adapted films. The kids are great and there is that lost sense of childhood wonder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nearly The Perfect Growing-Up Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stand By Me is a very touching, heartfelt film that teaches lessons on friendship and growing up. Through bad or good times, friendship holds the key of surviving the harsh realities of life. There are many wonderful examples here in the film that expresses that meaning. When bad or unpredictable things begin to happen to one guy, the rest of the guys bond up and join their comrade against their dilemma. This film is a beautiful tale of friendship and doesn't try to be more. It's well-acted, well-directed, and has one of the better screenplays of films from the 1980's.Rob Reiner's film is about four kids with all their different personalities, are best friends. One day, they decide to take a long hike into the woods to uncover a dead body so they can be famous. While battling nature and a blood-lust gang, they realize the true nature of friendship.The acting is very good and it seems like each actor made this film a bit personal for themselves. Wil Wheaton does a good job as almost the leader of the group despite his insecurities. River Phoenix adds total depth and emotion to prove his character is not the guy people think he is. Jerry O'Connell plays your usual scaredy-cat, but is very convincing. Corey Feldman, still in his childhood prime, plays his crazy character with a good amount of goofiness.Overall, this is a really good, powerful film that ultimately tells the tale of friendship. This film is not only touching, but it's rather funny at times. I love the scene where Wheaton is describing a story involving a fat guy eating lots of pie whom has a good trick up his sleeve. This almost the perfect growing-up film and is one of the best teen films of the 80's. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was such a wonderful film. The thing that impressed on me most of all was River Phoenix. I hadn't realised who it was until the end of the film. I can't believe how engaging and touching he is in this film. I found myself thinking about the friendships I have had in my life and wishing that any of them had been on a par with these guys. I love how the experiences they go through ( especially with the train and standing up to murder Sutherland) bring them together as friends and completely change them.Another thing, I completely didn't realise this was a Stephen king film. I'm really coming to appreciate what a great writer Stephen king is. Superb and heartstrings. And inspirational.</fullReview>

It is told through the point of view of a middle aged man as he recalls a summer childhood memory of his.The film features very strong acting skills, direction and a great screenplay, the movie is based on the popular novel written by Stephen King. We follow the boys as they go on a hunt to find the body a boy who had gone missing earlier in the summer. They come across obstacles such as leeches, trains and finding out who they really are.I would highly recommend this movie for anyone of any age.

		<fullReview>(Reviewed on Anniversary blu-ray) This is a tale that you will never forget, a story of childhood friendships that I am sure allot of people can relate to.I have to first of all point out that the acting in this movie is absolutely terrific! You end up with a feeling of closeness to this band of four friends while at the same time really building a resentment towards the group of older good for nothings(with Kiefer Sutherland playing a fantastic bad guy). River Phoenix, for me, was the most outstanding actor in this movie, at times it was really hard to believe how mature his acting style was.The movie is also shot very well with Rob Reiner doing a brilliant job of shooting every scene so that you are drawn into the action and really feel that you are along with the characters on a great journey both physically and emotionally. The back drop to this whole movie is also visually stunning.Without going too much into the story as to spoil it, you can expect moments of action, suspense, heart warming stories and characters you will fall in love with, this movie does not have a boring moment in it, and even though the ending ties up the story absolutely perfectly I always find myself at the end of this movie wanting it to go on and never end. I also found it made me reflect on my own childhood friends and the adventures I had with them, which was a nice thing for a movie to do.If you have a chance to watch this movie you should not pass it up! Its one you will never forget!</fullReview>

The bond between them is expertly portrayed and never overdone which i found rare. The acting of the four boys is superb and natural for the most part, Reiner did a wonderful job directing them. Speaking as a huge fan this is Phoenix at his pure best. Truly haunting. If you enjoy reminiscing then this is a great movie for you! The spectrum of emotions portrayed and invoked in this movie makes this one of the best to have come out of the eighties... Strike that, THE best.

		<shortDescription>After the death of a friend, a writer tells the story of a journey to find a body that him and his 3 friends went on as a boy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen King's "Stand by Me," is a movie about friendship and the freedom and innocence of adolescence. The main characters in the movie are Gordie Lechance, Chris Chambers, Vern Tessio, and Teddy Duchamp. Each one of them have imperfect lives that perfectly reveal who they are and how they act. Chris Chambers is the hard nosed kid in the friendship. The way that he talks about his father and the fact that he smokes suggests that he lives a hard life and that he is thought of badly by his peers. Gordie Lechance is the leader in the friendship. Gordie struggles with the emotional gap that he cant seem to fill in between him and his parents. You will find out why his parents have gone astray from him once you get later on into the movie. Vern Tessio is the gullible klutz of the group. He is often seen being teased by the other 3 boys. And last but not least Teddy Duchamp. Teddy is the free spirited member of the group that is crazy and likes to take risks. But don't let that fool you, behind all of his smiles and jokes there is a wall of emotion just waiting to cave in. When I watched this movie I felt that there was never a dull moment. I feel that for every part in this movie there is something to be learned. And for that, "Stand by Me," has easily become one of my favorite films and it will be of great benefit to those who watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stand By Me a nostalgic remembrance of a friendship between four twelve year old boys, during a period when they're just young enough to talk about cartoons and be afraid of the dark, and old enough to use cuss words and smoke cigarettes, and their biggest childhood adventure. They all have their own emotional problems and that's what makes their friendship so endearing to the viewer. The plot revolves around Gordie, an adult now with kids of his own, writing about the summer when his group friends found out about the location of a boy's dead body, a boy they all knew. Believing that it's what will bring them at least local fame, they set out to be the first who discover it, in the end competing with a much older gang. Stand by me is one of those movies that, no matter your gender, how old you are or how many times you've already seen it, it moves you. It makes you think of your childhood friends, the ones you haven't seen or heard in a long time and wonder if they think about you too, from time to time. The summers you spent in their company, playing or searching for a grand new adventure or when the adventure found you. This movie has those type of characters that are easily to relate to, even as a grown up. A brilliant masterpiece with heartwarming insights , the ecranisation of Stephen King's novella "The Body" will stand the passing of time because in every generation, there will be people who would find a bit of themselves in it. I give it 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm from Japan and I love this movie.Four young people who are friends with each other set out for adventure in order to look for a missing body.WIll Wheaton plays Gordie Lanchance. He stood out as an actor in stand by me but he has almost only appeared on TV dramas since then. River Phoenix played Chris Chambers. His death, because of taking so many drugs, was surprising. its too bad. Jerry O'connell played Vern Tessio. Since then He has become thin and looks handsome. Kiefer Sutherland plays Ace Merrill. I didn't realize Kiefer Sutherland was in this movie until checking IMDb.This movie is not only funny and exciting but also recalls something like our childhood memories.I think this movie is suitable for men of more than eighteen years old because women don't so much experience such adventures.I hardly watch real life drama movies and I usually don't like such movies. however this film makes me recall my own childhood so I watch it over and over again.This movie contains unique phrases in English. For example Gordie says "piss up a rope" This word is said with resignation. I also like "walking talking Jesus".my favorite expression in the movie is "two for flinching" this expresses a punishment because of getting scared. that is why Vern Tessio is hit by Teddy Duchamp, over and over again.i love this movie i think it is as good a movie as I have ever watched.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stand By Me is one of those movies which in the end leaves you with some tears in your eyes. Its excellent plot and acting makes this movie perfect, although I would not call this the greatest movie ever made I definitely think it deserves a better rating than 8,1. Its another movie where somebody retells a part of his life, usually these kinds of movies can either turn into a disaster or masterpiece. Gordie Lachance played by Wil Wheaton is a boy who lives in a small town, hes in a gang with three others, his best friend Chris Chambers who comes from a bad family, the crazy Teddy Duchamp and the last one in the gang Vern Tessio. All four have some trouble in their families. One day Vern tells the gang about a dead body in a forest outside of town, and they decide to try to find this body. I wont tell you more of the plot, but I can say it is just magnificent, and in the end it just leaves a mark in your heart. The detailed but short plot makes you feel like one of them and makes you wish the movies tragic ending wont end. Its a great masterpiece, as most of the great movies out there Stand By Me is based on Stephen Kings novel The Body.I really recommend this movie to anyone, it is very emotional, it has a great plot combined with the excellent acting. This movie deserves a better rating than it already has.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stand by this one with it's great and irreplaceable acting foursome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stand By Me is one of those films with some really unforgettable moments, a few of them, cherished ones by four young actors who are so impressive in their roles, we're taken aback, by just how good they really are. The most obvious being a young gifted actor who died way young before his time. 10 something, Vern, a younger Jerry O'Connell, a fatty here (yes, the same guy, whose ordinary looks shot up, making him a romeo sort, later on) overhears a conversation about a dead body by some local thugs, while scrounging for cash underneath the porch of his house. He rushes back to tell his friends, and so begins a two day adventure to locate the body of a missing teen. Ideally this movie is one about the joys of friendship, where along the way they encounter adversity, home truths, imaginative stories, while also nearly getting run down by a train, on a tall bridge, that proved quite a hairy moment. And too we had that lake/leech scene, one of them getting inside Jerry's drawers. The fat kid story told in great visual flashback was another of the treats in this fine film, plus bad and abused kid, Teddy, an excellent Feldman, who spits water in Vern's ear. When seeing Phoenix in this, and seeing him in later films, he seemed so different or he had grown up really quick. He's the best buddy of the other kid, Wil Wheaton through which this simple story and those imaginative ones are told. Wheaton's star should of shone brighter when judged by this performance, where he was really the only one who lucked out, later on as an actor. And now to put a rain on their damper, are the thugs in a convertible out to track down the body too, headed by Sutherland, who likes to smash a row of letter boxes with his baseball bat. The film's flow never bores or disappoints, and we learn things we wish we didn't about some of these poor kid's childhoods. Richard Dreyfuss as an older Wheaton adds a nice touch at the start, reminiscing, when reading one of the tabloids involving murdered best friend, Phoenix, while he returns at the end, in front of a computer screen, the author at work. The end where there's a standoff between the two groups again, failed to disappoint. This is a thoroughly enjoyable film. A near perfect film, it's fiftie's period captured beautifully. As a movie lover, it's a film, I urge you to see, if you haven't. Another scene of mention was in the candy store, Wheaton and the older owner, sharing conversation regarding the older and more favorable brother, (John Cusack) who had recently died, Wheaton, the excluded, the centre of blame by his father. It's almost impossible to fault this film of top notch and believable acting, Sutherland, making great on his role as a truly scary thug, threatening with a knife, where the younger group won't back down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid coming of age film but not a masterpiece by any means</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this film to be a quite solid and entertaining product of Hollywood. However, it was certainly not a work of art and neither a masterpiece of drama. Expect a simple story that is well executed in the traditional Hollywood mold but it is far away from being a truly powerful film and a realistic portrayal of childhood. In fact, the kids in the film look more like adults or kids playing adults in a movie, than actual kids. That is a general problem with films portraying children since adults write the script and therefore they make all the characters act and talk like adults.Try watching Miyazaki's Kiki's Delivery Service for a coming of age film featuring 12-13 year old kids in a much more realistic fashion and also in a much more artistically sophisticated fashion as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best coming of age film you will ever see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i first saw the title i mistook it for a romantic film but it is not. It is a coming of age drama. As it is featured in IMDb's top 250 i had a lot expectations from it. And in the end it topped those expectations. It is such a movie which everyone is compelled to like. I've seen this film 25 years after its initial release yet i've liked it so it is fair to say the appeal of this film stands tall to the test of time. Maybe the reason behind is that the main theme of the film is something which everyone relates to. It is Friendship. Maybe because of this reason you always feel deeply engrossed in this tale of friendship. That is why there is not even a single dull moment in the whole movie unlike many other highly acclaimed movies.The story is rather simple maybe way too simple. But it is the execution, the genuine acting of the whole cast makes this movie such a delight to watch. I loved john Cusack who has a supporting role in the movie. His role as Gordon's brother is really well crafted though it is really short. Writing review about this movie and not mentioning River Phoenix would be injustice it is his role as the born leader of the group that gives this simple movie incredible depth.So to summarize the movie is pretty good. Highly recommended and easily re-watchable. You will love every bit of the movie.A very enthusiastic 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say, I really enjoyed this movie. I've watched it so many times now. I can see it being a timeless movie that you could watch over and over without getting bored.This is one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King book in my opinion...and I am a huge fan of Stephen King. He's had many of his books made into movies. Examples would be 'The Shining' and 'Carrie'. It is a great story that is put across very well by some great actors. The late River Phoenix's performance as Chris Chambers was the highlight for me. And of course, Corey Feldman did his character Teddy justice.The story takes place in 1959. It centres around four young friends that set out to find the body of a boy who was killed by a train. We as viewers see their entire journey and are taken along with them. We meet another group of friends, who are not so nice. These 'bullies' are also setting out to find the body, with both groups looking to find fame by recovering the body.This movie reminds us of how important friends are and how friendships can be put to the test. I would definitely recommend this movie. It is a must see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It all happened in the summer of 1959....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gordie Lachance is a writer, who looks back on his preteen days when he and three close friends went on their own adventure to find the body of a kid who had gone missing and presumed dead. The stakes are upped when the bad kids in town are closely tailing - and it becomes a race to see who'll be able to recover the body first.I still get a warm feeling when I watch this movie. It takes me back to when I was a kid and the summers were warm and lasted forever, and the days seemed endless.The film is not only a beautifully acted piece, with one hell of a narrative, it's also the epitome of childhood, and really makes you appreciate ow easy we all had it when we were kids.The conversations were pointless, but fruitful, and we were all adults, just misunderstood, which I'm sure most of us will experience the other end of the spectrum when our children are teens.The four leads are so advanced for their time, and having someone so homely and secure like Dreyfuss doing the narration, is something that makes the film that little bit more genius.Even thought he film is a very heart warming experience, it has a very somber and melancholic streak running through the film. Don't forget the four are looking for a body, one has lost his brother, his idol and ignored by his parents.One is abused by his father, and one has a a father who is locked up.And the films narrator wouldn't have even done this story if he hadn't learnt of his then best friend getting killed.So it's all pretty somber stuff, uplifted by the four kids doing exactly what we all did when we were young. Live life.And I totally agree with one line in the film about time only being long if you count the years.One of the best movies ever.</fullReview>

The acting was great from everyone which you don't usually find out of child actors, River Pheonix and Will Wheaton exspecially gave great performances.This movie is about a Man who tells a story of his past. It begins with 4 young boys in a small town in the 1950s. One day they hear of a dead body in the woods somewhere so they decide to go look for it. At first they are having a goodtime but then they become somewhat obsessed with seeing this corpse.This movie was really good but I truly hate Carl Reiner. This is his only good work ever..I hate his movies and I hate everything he stands for. You should not support fascism or Carl Reiner because thats really all he is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Social Experiment of Stand By Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the film Stand by Me, there are two groups of boys-to-men who are tribal in their relationships. One lead by "Ace" exist to destroy, bully, and inflict pain. The other led by "Chris" exist to find adventure, experience life without authority, and create opportunities to be heroes, even if misguided. Traditionally, as in West Side Story, the two gangs would meet and fight it out, over a woman or an insult. In this film, the two gangs compete for notoriety about discovering a dead kid's body, which is a sign of the times and the culture they live in. Life moved pretty slowly back then, and kids had to use their imaginations. I enjoyed how the film moved very calmly from one event to the next, using kick ass writing and acting instead of special effects to make the film interesting. Usually that combination is only found in independent films, so it's a credit to Rob Reiner and the perfect casting of the young, extremely talented actors, as well as the talented screen writing that this film will remain a classic for all time. River Phoenix stole the film, and established himself as one of the most gifted actors of all time. I thought Will Wheaton was a little stiff, but his fragile doe-eyed looks provided attributes to his character that his acting lacked. Corey Feldman was perfect as the child of a crazed post-traumatic war veteran...all fierce with innocently displaced loyalty to his abusive father. "Vern" was perfect as the nervously chattering fat kid who only wanted to be accepted as part of the group, less complex emotionally, and mostly interested in food. Keifer Sutherland was a little too convincing as the sadistic bully with his eternal sneer and dead eyes. His supportive crew were convincing as "tough guy" followers and wannabe gang members for that period of time. It would have been satisfying to hear what became of "Ace" and his gang in the final narration. I think Richard Dreyfuss was grossly miscast as the adult version of Will Wheaton's character, first of all because there is NO RESEMBLANCE whatsoever. Overall, the film is ageless as evidenced by the fact that my 18 year old son watched it recently and loved it as one of his favorite movies. It must speak to those feelings and emotions young males are reluctant to express openly; and the loyalties that develop between young boys who don't have great relationships with their fathers. Somehow the film is comforting in that way, and for that, it has accomplished the greatness of art imitating life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IMDb Top 250: 177What a sweet film. Even though I was born well after this film was released, the story of growing up and messing around with your friends is timeless- the times before the complications of life take hold.The film follows four childhood friends on their summer trip to find a dead body, and the tolls the trip takes on them and the things they discover about themselves. The quest has many interesting stops, like a junkyard and one famous bridge. I loved the swamp scene.You may not have been those kids who smoked and got into trouble, but one should be able to identify with the boys. Gordon is the worldly, smart one, living in his brother's shadow. Chris is the kid who has a rough family life, the physically mature one who acts as a big brother. Teddy is the crazy one, and Vern... well Vern was the one who you always wanted to shut up. How the hell was that kid your friend? The actors are fantastic. Though I couldn't stand Vern.This film is a classic the moment you start watching it. All the staples of the rural 50's are here: the cars, the slick hair, the music and the lingo. It's fantastic. And then at the end with the skip to the 80's... 30 years is a long time.Essentially, this film wants you to cherish your childhood. Ironically, with all the swearing, you probably won't see it until after that time is done. The memories this film extracts from your brain are vivid. Sweet, sweet nostalgia. Life and death and the coming of age are central to this very touching story. A wonderful film. 8.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Coming-Of-Age Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stand by Me is a coming of age drama film directed by Rob Reiner. Based on the novella The Body by Stephen King, the film takes its title from the Ben E. King song of the same name.It stars Wil Wheaton,River Phoenix,Corey Feldman,Jerry O'Connell and Kiefer Sutherland.The movie is set in Castle Rock,Oregon, over Labor Day weekend in 1959. A quartet of boys, inseparable friends all, set out in search of a dead body that one of the boys overhears his brother talking about. The foursome consists of intellectual Gordie (Wheaton), born leader Chris (Phoenix), emotionally disturbed Teddy (Feldman), and chubby hanger-on Vern (O'Connell). The boys' adventures en route to the elusive body are colored by the personal pressures brought to bear on all of them by the adult world.Stand By Me is a sentimental film that works because of its unsentimental moments -- in particular, its sometimes embarrassingly honest portrayal of what interests boys and how they talk about it.The film was obviously a well-crafted coming-of-age tale.It's as effective today as it was upon its initial release, and the richness of its tapestry, densely woven from human emotions and character interaction, ensure it will never lose that relevance especially on the topic of childhood and the coming-of-age phase that everyone undergoes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this film quite a few times now and i still love it every time i see it. This film awakes something in me, a sweet realization that i'm really lucky to have friends. Maybe i am a little older now, but every time i see this movie, i start remembering all the fun and excitement i went through with my friends, when i was younger. Everything in Stand by me is great. The story is simple and yet excellent, you can really relate to it. Acting is incredible, i can't believe these kids could act so good. Some shots were beautifully filmed, when you can see the woods or the hills or the fields... The unspoiled Mother Earth. I guess this movie is so special because it depicts what friendship really means. What it really represents. It's not the kind of depiction one would expect - i mean, searching for a dead body, wow. But i wouldn't change it for anything. Like i said, having friends is the greatest thing in the world. See this movie and you will now why.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Drama of the 80's Most-Praised Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is worth your interest. I don't care if you are 14 or 13, watch it. This film is about a couple of teens, Gordie(Wil Wheaton), Chris(River Phoenix), Teddy(Corey Feldman), Vern(Jerry O'Connell) who embark on a journey of 30 miles by traveling on foot to look for another teen, whom most recently was deceased. But a challenger, played by Kiefer Sutherland, is also looking, most likely to kill the boys. This movie is an instant classic, with powerful emotional segments, hilarious moments(Lard Butt and the Barf-y Revenge at a Pie Cook-out!), and intense suspense, and to me, I laughed. And, I cried. I apologize for not reviewing this earlier, but unfortunately, I was not born then. But I can say this, I -PRAISE- the actors' performances, and I love that Richard Dreyfuss narrating the story, credited as Gordie as an adult. Amazing acting, which all tears were real, excellent choice of a cast, along with the story. GOD BLESS THIS STORY...Updates: Wil Wheaton: He is currently playing as himself in the critically-acclaimed television series, "The Big Bang Theory", as Sheldon Cooper's former-enemy, now-friend character.River Phoenix: An unfortunate turn of events for River. An accidental drug overdose occurred in 1993 that ended his life. He was 23 years old. The entire cast of this film attended his funeral, including the director. Rest in Peace, River. 1970-1993Corey Feldman: He is with his wife at home, still depressed over Corey Haim's death from 2010. He has now most recently been spotted at the 25th anniversary of this film along with the cast.Jerry O'Connell: He has lost a lot of weight and now looks very different then he did in the movies. He is in any film that is by Castle Rock Pictures, the film's main city, such as a poorly-reviewed "Kangaroo Jack".Kiefer Sutherland: I apologize for this inconvenience for I haven't enough information, except he, later that year of 1986, co-starred with Corey Feldman, once again as an enemy, in the classic cult movie, "The Lost Boys", also stars Corey Haim.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first watched this movie, I was really young and thought this movie was just like all the other movies. It was a while until I found the true meaning of this movie. I love coming-of-age films because they just warm my heart. This movie has such emotions in it that i can barely ever say for any other movie. WONDERFUL cast, WONDERFUL writing, and WONDERFUL directing. I have to say the two people that really stole the show for me was River Phoenix and Kiefer Sutherland. They play their characters so well, and you really sometimes can relate to what they are saying. The chemistry between the two characters is PHENOMENAL. I wouldn't have any body else to play those two characters than the boys who preformed it. They were so young and it was still early in both of their careers. If I hadn't known that up front, I would have said that they had been acting for years. Again, amazing movie and it moved me to tears.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Earlier this afternoon on Channel 5, I had the great pleasure in watching 1980s classic "Stand By Me". It was just as perilous and as adventurous as I expected and I give two thumbs up for this fantastic movie! Want specific words to describe the film; magnificent, powerful, adventurous, sometimes dark, suspenseful, American, touching and full of danger and that's what I love about the whole thing - people living dangerously; anything or anywhere humdrum ain't for me! I like living dangerously but obviously not quite as dangerously as our four leading teen-aged boys who venture forth to find the body of a dead person. I knew one of them was rather a wimp on remembering the back of a DVD cover but I can never remember the cast names as this was my first viewing but I do know that one of those boys was River Phoenix - GOD, was he gorgeous!! - who is no longer with us; dying of a drugs overdose in 1993 at a painful 23 years old.The film runs for almost an hour and a half (100 minutes including commercials on Channel 5) and is certified 15, containing frequent moderate bad language, brief street violence and some strong threat. Sorry kids, you miss out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first thought, this movie looked to be a repeat of The Goonies (another absolutely fabulous movie, I might add) they both starred Corey Feldman, who, in both titles played an eccentric, slightly loopy but fun character. They also both starred a gang going off on an adventure. The Goonies, after treasure, this gang, after a dead body.You have River Phoenix as Chris Chambers, a young teenager from the infamous Chambers family, famed for being criminals &amp; hooligans. He is the brother of "Eyeball" Chambers. Chambers is an amazing character, mainly for the way he could pick on people but chooses to be friendly and always looks for the peaceful way out of things, but is a brave boy.Wil Wheaton plays Gordy, a confused chap who seems sad because his older brother died and his parents dislike his friends and seem to completely forget all about poor Gordy. Vern, played by the talented Jerry O'Connell is a bumbling but funny eleven year old school boy. He's terrified of ghosts and all, but is a great companion during the adventure. He's often the victim to the pranks of Teddy LaChance (Corey Feldman).This movie is probably the only film that I've ever watched that I would absolutely score a perfect ten, sincerely. (Pun intended.) The young cast of boys played their roles with such charisma and passion, I have honestly rarely seen such a splendid act of characters. To me, River Phoenix will forever be Chris Chambers, Wil Wheaton will always be Gordy, etc. The story is stunning. Absolutely. They all go on a journey to find a dead body, a 30 mile walk which takes them two long days. A large trek, I might add. They not only discover what they were looking for in the end, but they truly discovered the meaning of friendship.It was a soul-searching journey for themselves. It was just amazing. You also get to hear the great song "Rollercoaster" by none other than Buck Holly. So, we've got a heart warming cast of characters, engrossing story and, well... Buck Holly. This is the greatest movie that I've ever seen. And the ending was also classy and not cheesy at all."I never had friends again like the ones I had when I was 12. Jesus, does anyone?"That final line just closed the movie for me. I had that butterfly feeling in my stomach and I felt genuinely happy. Watch this movie. Buy it. Rent it. Just see it, at least once. It's an enthralling thrill ride from start to finish that every person should get to watch.I'm just happy that it graced my television screen, even if it was only for an hour and a half.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Body Comes of Age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stand by Me is directed by Rob Reiner and adapted to screenplay by Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon from the Stephen King novella, The Body. It stars Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Connell and Kiefer Sutherland. Music is by Jack Nitzsche and cinematography by Thomas Del Ruth. Four young lads, one journey, one body and friendships never to be forgotten?There are few films able to marry comedy and poignancy with much success. There are even fewer that can do that whilst also being able to sit on the thin line between sappy and sweet. Stand by Me is one such film; a film that richly deserves its place in the top five of lists concerning the greatest coming of age movies ever made. Never preachy and refreshingly honest in its telling, Stand by Me hits all the right buttons to make it work. The cast are uniformly great, notably young Wheaton and Phoenix, the script pings with aware dialogue for the youngsters and the relationship building on the journey for the youngsters smacks of a profane reality rarely seen in cinema. The soundtrack rocks, literally, with period vitality, and when the comedy darts in and out of the drama, it's big on laugh value: including one vomit based story that will forever take some beating. But it's arguably the third act that cements the film as having timeless appeal, for here it gets taut, touching and poignant. The nostalgia is not mawkish and the finale certainly not twee. A film for anyone who was ever twelve years old and needed friends. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stand by Me has stood the test of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the summer of 1959 was coming to a close, Gordie, played by Wil Wheaton, and his three buddies, come to a juncture in their young lives ? that of crossing over the threshold of childhood naivet into that of adolescents and coming of age. Stand by Me is a story of lost innocence and growing up.The opening scene is effectively narrated by Richard Dreyfuss. The narration is a prelude to the crux of the movie ? a flashback to the summer of '59; a simpler times when kids were kids and void of accountability. Use of flashbacks in this movie is a poignant approach that links the beginning to the end.The friends, bound by tumultuous pasts, set out on a two day expedition to find the body of Ray Brower, a kid whose life was cut short by a passing train. The town thugs also want to recover the body of Ray Brower. Ironically, the thugs and younger group of boys are no strangers to each other; in fact, the two sets of brothers harbor hostility toward one another.Throughout the two day journey, Gordie along with Chris Chamber played by River Phoenix, Jerry O'Connell as Vern, and Corey Feldman as Teddy Duchamp, trudge between boyhood and young men. One minute the boys are dragging on cigarettes and the next minute they are pondering over the notion if the Disney character Goofy is a dog. The foursome share their inner most thoughts to their childish antics. Vern announces that cherry Pez would be his choice of "food" if he were only allowed to choose one food to survive on. As the story unfolds, it is the fateful meeting of the two gangs at the side of the tracks that puts friendship, brotherhood, and maturity to the test.The thematic similarity in Stand by Me and that of the 1995 movie Now and Then resonates the familiar subject of coming of age. Within one short summer the lives of these kids changed forever, resulting in personal growth, and the realization that the events of the summer would change their lives forever.The movie Stand by Me is a convincing representation of transitioning from a child to a young adult. Stand by Me has stood the test of time. Viewers can identify with the film and reminisce about their own loss of innocence and the changes in life that are inevitable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been looking forward to watching this film for ages, neither because I'm a hardcore zealot of Stephen King, nor I'm a passionate follower of the director Rob Reiner, to me the selling point wholly lays on River Phoenix, a gone-too-soon film star, from James Dean, Sal Mineo, to River till Heath Ledge, whose early demise inexorably grants them a more iconic perception to the mundane world than their remaining peers (sadly it is never too young to die).The film sufficiently charts the bona fide friendship and love among its four protagonists in a simple but accessible framework, the script precisely captures the intrinsic pulse from children's point-of-view, unfortunately and unavoidably, the film itself has to face the judgement from adult's perspective (no film could limit its audience under pubescence), frequently what these kids are doing is corny and slightly obnoxious, which at any rate, exactly reflects a virtually tangible authenticity.The affiliation among the gang-of-four is firmly portrayed by our talented young cast (with endeavored details), River and Will manifest a over-their-ages interpretation to render their characters a multi-dimensional presence; Corey and Jerry are also worthy of a two thumb up applause; besides that, an extremely young Kiefer Sutherland is the will-sales here, who literally creeps me out and unbelievably makes me like the film less by his excellent performance as the leader of the ruffians (who would imagine he could incarnate as Jack Bauer, the federal agent who saves the world numerous times in the TV series 24). By the way, speaking of Will, I really cannot believe he is the one who plays himself in the Big Bang Theory series, although I am not a Star Trek fan either, but he is undoubtedly unrecognizable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally Saw This and Loved It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the death of a friend, a writer (Richard Dreyfuss) recounts a boyhood journey to find the body of a missing boy.What I find interesting is that Stephen King is known as a horror writer, but his best work is consistently non-horror. His best praise came from "Shawshank Redemption", and even here we see a film far above average.The film is sold by two things: a great cast and great writing. A fat Jerry O'Connell, Kiefer Sutherland, Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman, River Phoenix... that is already an automatic win. But then you have a non-stop run of great one-liners and comebacks that are really memorable. I now know that cool things are "boss", and apparently even in the 1950s people said "douchebag" (which I highly doubt, but I am still shocked in the 1980s that it appeared in a script).The wraparound story is a bit odd, more or less seeming like it was just thrown in there to have an introduction. Although for the first few minutes it seems that a lawyer's death may be important, it really is not at all. But, oh well. Not all life stories are clear-cut and linear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Stand By Me" as childhood's beautiful swan song ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw  Stand By Me , it left me with a weird and wonderful feeling. I laughed at the funny moments, felt sad at the most serious parts, and overall, I enjoyed it. Then, something unexpected and almost magical happened, when the movie ended and started the iconic first notes of BB King's song, some tears betrayed my eyes. And something painful was beating in my heart as if I was mourning an irreplaceable loss, my childhood's ? It's a movie with an unusually short length but the story is full of touching and funny moments exploring the fears and hopes that fill the hearts of twelve-year old boys, through a strange odyssey for a morbid quest -but understandably intriguing object of curiosity for kids- a corpse, whose sensational discovery would make them local celebrities in their small hometown of Castlerock. And the group that will conduct this adventure is composed of four kids on whom each of us can identify. I, personally, had the chance to identify with each of them in a certain way, but especially Gordie for his creativity and handicapping modesty that almost prevented him to believe in his talent. Gordie is the central character and perfectly embodies the doubts that makes the thrills of childhood so sincere, because despite them, we move, and friends play an important part, because we so want to be accepted that we follow them, and learn about courage, or simply ? learn.More than a road movie, "Stand By Me" defines the coming-of-age sub-genre. It's about learning from one experience, and at one very difficult age: twelve. Why, twelve? I guess it's because this age is a sort of life's crossroads where we're mature enough as children to understand that we're getting to tougher times, but child enough in our maturity to prefer friends to girls, to behave like kids, to sing, to play games and tell stories. In an interesting contrast, all the adults in the film have less appealing and more superficial activities, and behave like arrogant bores or cruel bullies. Sure, kids are no all victims, nor angels, even friends tease and fight each other, but they're still friends, and their actions are never badly intentioned. Friendship really means something at twelve, and builds the only strength to overcome the adult adversity.And friendship couldn't have had a better homage thanks to the sincerity of the central relationship: Gordie Lachance, Will Wheaton, and Chris Chambers, River Phoenix, two underestimated kids for opposite reasons. Gordie lives in the shadow of his prematurely dead older brother, a popular and successful athlete with a promising life, and Chris is treated with defiance because his family is not recommendable and his brother Eyeball is a thug and the best friend of the town's biggest bully, Ace, played superbly by Kiefer Sutherland in one of his most memorable villainous roles. Both Gordie and Chris are treated with a poignant disdain that built their friendship with the cement of solidarity. Being underestimated is typical of childhood as it is typical for friendship to be made of weaknesses' similarities. Only a friend can understand you because he usually lives the same fears and injustices as you do and friendship creates this extra strength that makes childhood even more challenging, and exciting.The two other friends Vern Tessio, Jerry O'Connell and Teddy Duchamp, Corey Feldman, act both as comic reliefs and incarnations of some other childhood's range of personalities, one is an adorably coward and naive kid, the other is funny but a bit wacko, we all had friends like that, we might have been one of them ? all in all, the dynamic created by the four protagonists creates a perfect balance between thrills and emotions. The train sequence is unbelievable, the emotional parts, where each one of them will break down to let a part of his soul cry its limitations is a heart-breaking reminder of the very weakness that inhabits childhood before the adult time teaches us how to get though them. The situations are memorable and the adventure so exciting, we easily forget its morbid quest. But in a way, this quest is almost symbolical; it has nothing to do with death, Stephen King wrote a novel about childhood, not death. Death only illustrates kids' natural fascination for the unknown, death as the presence of a constant danger and childhood as a time we learn to overcome our fears and fulfill our dreams. Future is evoked many times, and the revelation of each one's fate of us is sad because it rings true and Chris Chambers got my eyes ready to crack up, right when the ending credits song started.This deserves a mention since even the actor who played Chris, River Phoenix, died leaving behind a life full of promises. It's ironically cruel. Chris, the one, who inspired the story, died for the same reasons and attitude that governed his acts as a kid. Adult times are indeed tougher and the rules of the games change, for the worst. The same death that took Gordie's brother, Ray Brower, Chris Chambers, and the real therefore, saddest one, River Phoenix. It's a movie about life being even more perceptible when we encounter death. And while facing the death of his best friend, the adult Gordie, Stephen King, and Rob Reiner made a time-capsule not just of the late fifties but of an age which talks to the hearts of the inner boy inside us, an age cinematically immortalized through "Stand By Me". And I didn't realize it until the film finished."Stand By Me" is a formidable adventure film, and a touching coming-of-age story revealing the preciousness of childhood and its ruthlessly ephemeral nature. To appreciate the film is to understand, when it's too late, that we won't be kids anymore, and that childhood was finally the most exciting adventure we ever lived ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I won't be afraid"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when I was about the same age as its principle characters. It affected me profoundly and its images have stayed with me ever since. So what is it about this simple tale of four young lads on a two-day hike through the American wilderness that has such power? Well part of the secret of Stand by Me is that very simplicity, a purity and directness in its ideas and presentation, under which lies a burning intelligence.Stand by Me is adapted, like so much of movie output of the last thirty-five years, from a work by Steven King, and it has that author's ability to be idealistic without patronising his audience. The screenplay, expertly written by Bruce Evans and Raynold Gideon has a wonderful brevity to it. Take for example the flashback where Gordy remembers his brother. All we get is a hat, a hug, and a few lines of dialogue, but it sets up a relationship and an emotional strand that resonates for the whole movie. The story runs the gamut of feelings, at turns witty, scary, exciting, poignant, often within the same scene, but all with such careful balance and good taste that each emotional ride complements the others. Through it all, the knowledge that their final destination is the dead body of another kid their own age creates a sense of potential danger and mortality, giving extra bite to everything that happens.This was an early feature for actor-turned-director Rob Reiner. Reiner has an incredibly relaxed approach for someone with so little experience. There are barely any camera movements, and what few there are don't intrude on the action. He does a fairly standard trick of introducing a character with a close-up of what they are doing then panning up to their face, for example the first shot of River Phoenix dealing cards. Some directors will do this in a quite a flashy and stylish manner, but with Reiner the move is so quick and businesslike we barely notice it, although the information will go in all the same. Like in many old classic Westerns, Reiner really emphasises the confines of the town, with walls bordering the shot and items in the foreground, and then contrasts it with the wide, boundless backdrop of the countryside, giving us a sense of joy and freedom once the adventure gets going. This is a modern movie but as John Ford or Raoul Walsh might have directed it.Central to Stand by Me are some of the finest performances by young actors ever put on film. In the case of Wil Wheaton and Jerry O'Connell this is probably still the best job they ever did. The four of them appear completely natural and the rapport between them is clear. Jerry O'Connell is so sincere in his naivety it makes you wonder if he actually didn't realise how daft his character is, although more likely the young lad just had great comic timing. River Phoenix is far and away the best of them, and perhaps he's even a little too good. For someone playing a twelve-year-old, his performance is too professional, too adult. And yet it works, since his larger-than-life presence matches up to Chris's maturity and strength of character. And even at this young age he's absolutely riveting to watch.Stand by Me is a motion picture that speaks deeply to so many viewers, I think because there is a lot of truth and universality to it. But this does not mean it is a work of realism that tries to recreate everyday life in all its banality. Stand by Me is a life experience shown to us only as what sticks in the mind, what makes sense and what has meaning, just like the rosy memory of youth that it depicts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An emotionally effective film. Sincerely as Vern would say.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely does a film make me fall in love with the characters, have sympathy for them, and actually crave to see more out of them. Stand By Me is a must see, endearing film based on the novella by horror author Stephen King. It seems like it would take the direction of a horror movie, or get easily sidetracked, when it takes the route of an extremely interesting drama film. The drama in this movie is realistic fiction about four boys coping with extreme home life troubles, and their only source for hope is in each other.Can you guess why I wanted to see this? Corey Feldman. I wanted to see him in a young role, playing a kid or a teenager. I saw this pop up in the guide, but missed both showings of it. I feel so ashamed, and so much of an idiot, I feel like I owe the movie an extra two watches. I finally found the DVD at a used store and immediately picked it up. Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, and Corey Feldman all as youngsters? Count me in! The plot: Four boys; Gordie, the bookworm from a careless family (Wheaton), Chris, the stereotyped delinquent (Phoenix), Teddy, a boy who's ear was badly burned because of his father (Feldman), and Vern, a chubby, picked on fellow who means nice at heart (O'Connell). All have strict home lives as you can imagine, and when Vern overhears his brother talking about the location of a corpse who has been looked for all over town, he rounds up the gang and they walk to the location of the body.Along the way to try and find the body, the four friends gather more information about each other and uncover more mysteries about their home lives. They are each victims to both physical and emotional abuse. Gordie, whom is a good writer, is ignored at home, and is unappreciated by either parent. Chris' parents are alcoholic and in the nuthouse leaving him to be the subject of an unproven stereotype. Teddy's dad is a violent drunk who nearly caused Teddy to go deaf in one ear by burning it on a stove. And Vern's family is never really revealed, but is expected to be the same sort of deal.The film is narrated by a grown Gordie played by Richard Dreyfuss. His voice adds a nice tone to the film, and adds to the film's creepy and unsettled atmosphere. It's such a unique addition. Plus this film makes me wish I had more friends that I could do activities like this with. That sounds like clich #1213 when writing a review about a group of childhood boys, but I feel like I've missed out and I'm only fourteen. When a film makes you feel old and make you look like you've not done a thing with your life, by showcasing characters who are young and adventurous who are not to far off from your age is a pure accomplishment. What other movie has done that and succeeded as well as this? Without a doubt this is my favorite Stephen King movie adaptation. My favorite was previously Christine, but this takes the cake for being a very emotional and eventful King film. Wil, River, Corey, and Jerry all give their performances of a lifetime in this movie that maybe twenty-four years old, but still is recognized today. It may be one of a kind, but it makes me cry like many.Starring: Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Connell, and Kiefer Sutherland. Directed by: Rob Reiner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film based off a great book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Stand By Me" is probably Rob Reiners masterpiece. Based off the great Stephen King short story, "The Body", it is a tale about youth, growing up, bullies, bad relationships with parents and friendship. The plot is about 4 friends who find out about a teenager who was hit by a train a couple miles down the train-track, and set out to find his dead body. Each kid has family issues. Gordie's (Wil Wheaton) close brother who was loved more than him died in a car crash a year previously and his parents couldn't care less about him. Chris (River Phoenix) has two rebel brothers which gives him an instant bad rep and the fact that the town thinks he stole lunch money from school doesn't help it. Teddy (Corey Feldman) has a mental father who burnt both of his ears off on a stove and Teddy is almost as crazy as him. And Vern (Jerry O'Connell) is the chubby runt-of-the-pack who also has a rebel for a brother. The four characters have great chemistry and give entertaining and funny conversations. The film perfectly captures the environment, expressions and style of the 50's. There are several intense, surprising, funny and sad moments in this great adaptation. It is one of my favorite films.</fullReview>

Stephen King is a nice writer and the screenplay, direction, Acting and every major part of the movie is super fine. It is interesting and emotional.I must say I was missing a superb movie.

		<fullReview>Stand By Me was THE MOVIE through which I became interested in the brilliant actor River Phoenix of which I'm a huge fan for such a long time now. Not only River but also the other young actor's put up a terrific acting performance in this beautiful movie about friendship. Especially the scene where we can see the opposite between the childish Vern and Teddy talking about Mighty Mouse and the mature conversation between Chris and Gordy about their next school. And of course the (very well played by River) crying scene from Chris about the milkmoney is absolutely one to remember. The atmosphere in the movie is very naturally and Rob Reiner can be proud of this impressive masterpiece. I don't know what it is, but though I know Stand By Me from beginning to end, I can see this movie OVER AND OVER AGAIN!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently found "Stand By Me" in a closing Blockbuster and in about a week. Since, I have seen it 7 times, 8 if you count the time I watched the Directors Commentary. Everything is great, the acting, the setting, the train scene, with Vern and Gordie, shoot. Like the way the train looked; and the music throughout the entire movie. Corey Feldmen, River Phoenix, and Keifer Sutherland were all spectacular. My favorite scene is where Teddy goes crazy at the junkyard. When I looked at "Walking the Tracks: The Summer of Stand By Me," Rob Reiner says that Corey Feldmen truly had a lot of anger. I see that every time I watch (witch would be many,many times). Truly an unforgettable movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone that doesn't like this movie should check to see if they still have a soul. Rob Reiner has taken the short story "The Body" by Stephen King and Transformed it into a classic coming of age movie. I was totally blown away after the first time I saw it. You know how a lot of pre-teen movies have always downplayed what its like for kids growing up. They rarely get it right and it usually comes across hokey or insincere. Not here, Stand by me pulled absolutely no punches. The dialog of these kids felt so genuine that it was refreshing. Yes they do curse like sailors at times but that is what makes it so real. The cast is flawless. Will Weaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Connel are perfectly cast in each of their respected roles. My favorite scene is when they cross a stream thinking its shallow but it is really deep. They all fall in and "Vern" says that he told them should have gone the other way. In a complete deadpan "Teddy" asks Vern. "Is it me? Or are you the worlds biggest P----?" LOL! If you have never seen this movie, SEE IT. You wont be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant coming of age story......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stand By Me is directed by Rob Reiner, based on the novella by Stephen King has a screenplay by Raynold Gideon and Bruce A. Evans and features a group of young actors who would go onto much greater fame not long after their appearances in this film.Stand By Me is not only one of the best films of the 80's it's a classic coming of age story.Beginning with a shot of an elder Gordie Lachance(Richard Dreyfuss)in his car remembering his childhood after learning his best friend Chris(now an attorney)has been stabbed to death.We then go back in time to the glorious summer of 1959 in the little town of Castle Rock in Oregon.The younger Gordie(Wil Wheaton)is emotionally fragile after his beloved elder brother(John Cusack)was killed in a car crash a few months before and hangs out a lot with his best friends.There's tough guy Chris Chambers(River Phoenix),excitable Vern Tessio(Jerry O'Connell) and crazy dare devil Teddy Duchamp(Corey Feldman).All the kids have miserable lives at home and relish their time together.When Vern overhears a couple of elder boys saying they have found the dead body of a young local boy who went missing while picking blueberries,they decide to walk up the train tracks to see the body for themselves.However local bully from hell Ace Merrill(Kiefer Sutherland)and his gang are also looking for his body, hoping to get some fame for finding it.And so begins an emotional and painful coming of age for all the boys but most especially for Gordie.Wheaton would go onto find fame as Wesley the son of Chief Medical Officer Dr.Crusher on the hit TV series Star Trek The Next Generation,Phoenix would become a tragic legend starring in a number of hit films and dying aged just 23 in 1993,Sutherland now has a hit series of his own with 24 and Feldman would go on to star in The Goonies.Highlights include a breath taking train dodge, Gordie being approached by a lone deer on the side of the tracks and Chris and Gordie standing up to a knife wielding Ace and his gang. Funny, touching and filled with excellent performances Stand By Me is a beautiful tale of friendship and adventure that's not to be missed..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best (if not the best) coming of age movies of all time. This movie has it all. It has murder mystery. It has misunderstood young men. It has hoodlums. It has flashbacks. And it has cussing cause it's cool. Although none of these actors, with the exception of Kiefer Sutherland, went on to make very major careers, maybe in River Phoenix's case because of his suicide, they all gave very convincing performances. The story was phenomenally captivating.From the start you won't want to stop, it is so much fun. It is a very serious movie, but at the same time it has a lot of well placed humor. All the characters have very distinctive and very likable personalities. The only thing I didn't like was the end where they told us what became of the boys as adults, and said the "bad boy" was going to turn his life around but was stabbed. Stephen King seems to like to kill kids (another example of this is "The Mist" where the father is forced to shoot his own son). This movie is a timeless classic. I will cherish it forever, and will definitely show this to my children. 50/10!</fullReview>

This movie was very pleasing starting with the great characters that couldn't have played there roles any better and story that could relate to anyone.

		<fullReview>Surprisingly, until today, 23 years after its release, I had never seen this film. I've seen many references to it in various TV shows and I've seen many reviews, but it always escaped my attention, until today. I've been off work for a while and decided to try and fit in a film a day for 10 days. Today was the last day and due to family commitments time was a little short, so decided to put this one in the DVD player. I'm really glad I did, it's a little dated, but even so it's a really great film. It's based on a novella called 'The Body' by Stephen King, whose work I admire, and it's set in Oregon in the 1950's.A group of four boys, Gordie Lachance, Chris Chambers, Teddy Duchamp and Vern Tessio hear of the whereabouts of the body of another missing boy, Ray Brower. They decide it would be cool if they went and found the body so they could return it to the family and become heroes. The only problem was it was about thirty miles away along the railway tracks. They arrange with their parents to be away for a night and set off the same day. Gordie is a sensitive type who had lost his big brother, Denny, six months previous. They were close and he missed him. Chris was the leader of the group and he had been in trouble at school for stealing the milk money. Teddy's father had been on the beaches in Normandy and was suffering from shell shock. He had recently turned violent on Teddy and was now in an institution. Vern was overweight and not the brightest of the bunch, but seemed to fit in anyway. As these four set off they are unaware that a rival gang of older boys led by Ace Merrill also have plans to find the body, but these guys have cars and are really mean. I won't say any more, don't want to give too much away.As I said at the beginning, this film looks slightly dated, but I think that's more to do with the quality of the film stock and the fact the soundtrack is in mono. What really struck me was the quality of the acting, truly great performances from all four of the leads, Wil Wheaton as Gordie Lachance, River Phoenix as Chris Chambers, Corey Feldman as Teddy Duchamp and Jerry O'Connell as Vern Tessio. Also an honourable mention must go to Kiefer Sutherland who is quite intimidating as Ace Merrill.Of course there are a lot of fifties songs in the soundtrack, including the title song. It's a bit before my time, but the music fitted the mood really well. Over all it's a really excellent film with some great performances, particularly from Wil Wheaton and River Phoenix. Although slightly dated for technical reasons I highly recommend this one.My score: 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie making at its very best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stand By Me is a simple story told in a very poignant and effective way. The idea of four young boys looking for a dead body seems rather grim, almost like the set up for a macabre, twisted horror story, but this film manages to sway in every way possible from that image. Set in a small town called Castle Rock, which the director Rob Reiner actually adopted as his production company's name following the film, four pre-adolescent boys agree to go on the hunt for the body of a boy they knew of, similar in age, of whom they have overheard has been hit by a train not far from their area. They set off with a sense of triumph in the knowledge that they will be seen as heroes by everyone they know, and find fame and fortune in this discovery, which at twelve, is as believable as anything. However, five minutes into the film and you realise that this is only the surface plot for a deeper and more meaningful coming of age movie which deals with the worries and fears of people that age, picking up on emotions felt at a time where you are just beginning to change from being a child to an adult. The four main characters played by Will Wheaton, Jerry O'Connel, Corey Feldman and River Phoenix, achieve the tight bonds of friendships that they share, and pull off the tougher, more demanding emotional aspects of the film. Most notable of all of these has to be Phoenix's performance. Throughout the entire thing, he stayed true to his passionate, clever and strong character Chris, never missing his mark once. In my opinion, the role was definitely Oscar winner worthy, or at least for a nomination. He manages to portray at heart breaking character, who, because of his family's status, is scape goated. At a climatic part we see his usually cool image broken, and the true damage is shown as he sobs to Gordie(Wheaton), his best friend. The reason that i find this film so easy to watch, and yet not class it as just your average feel good film, is that it touches on so many issues that i felt at that age, and still feel now. That sense of not being good enough, and not belonging properly. It makes you understand that you are not alone in these worries, and it also adds a huge sense of nostalgia to that time of your life when your friends were such a major role of your life, that you would never see yourself not being with them, and yet, somehow, things slip, and friendships fade; a sad reality in life which is also highlighted. The movie was created after being based on Stephen King's novella 'The Body' and grossed an approximate $80 million worldwide, not amazing, but it has grown into a classic, one of those movies that people of any age value, i think one of the most popular movies ever made, it sure is to me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I mean who doesn't totally love this film classic? it's flawless. this is probably one of the best kids films ever made. why? because it doesn't talk down to kids and treat them like morons. sure you don't have to be a kid to love it. i wasn't a kid when i first saw it at the drive-in movies during the 80's. i was twenty something. but it helps to be a kid to truly appreciate what it's saying. i mean this film should be mandatory viewing for kids in the schools. it's an American classic like Huck Finn, under age smoking and swearing and all.what can you say about the acting except that its remarkable. the kids here act better than most adult actors i've seen. that brings us to Corey Feldman. what happened? this kid was so good in this he should have been nominated for best supporting actor for this. you would have thought he would have gone on to be one of the best adult actors in Hollywood. he didn't. can't understand it. i guess too much partying does ruin your brain or something because this kid had amazing potential and he never lived up to it. we know what happened to River Phoenix. and it was really nice to see 'Neverland''s Will Wheaton.this movie is so memorable. just check all the fantastic reviews it has gotten from it's fans. it certainly made a lasting impression on one fourteen year old. this movie deserves it's reputation amongst its audience. too bad mainstream professional film critics ignore it, it's one of contemporary Americana's finest films. first class all the way. if you love this film, i will stand by you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good buddy picture.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do believe the title of the story from which it came was "The Body", they instead named it "Stand by Me". Probably a wise decision as if it was named "The Body" anyone who was familiar with Stephen King, but not this particular story would automatically assume this was a horror movie. No, it is a coming of age type tale, a sort of buddy travel story on a smaller scope than other travel movies as these are kids and while they walk a fair distance they do not really go cross country or anything. The premise of the movie is that four friends are going along the train tracks in search of the body of a boy who was hit by a train I believe. During their travels they have their hardships, breakdowns, and very funny moments as well. The actors are all great, a lot of young talent though looking back now the best one was most likely River Phoenix who passed away I believe shortly after "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade". I also enjoyed his performance in that movie although it was brief and I also enjoyed his performance in an earlier film "Explorers". Wil Wheaton I have not really seen in many movies since, I know he was in "Star Trek: The Next Generation" and I believe he writes for shows too, though I am not 100 percent sure of that. Feldman was also good in this, but he was actually a good actor, I think he just got typecast to much later in life where he and Corey Haim were in a lot of movies together. Both good actors, but I think they probably damaged each others careers by all the films they starred in together in a rather short span of time. This film is good though and I usually like a travel film. There are some issues though as I am just unsure of the gang led by Kiefer Sutherland as they seemed a rather strange addition to the film. I just do not see why they would even bother trying to find the body as if they did I am sure local authorities would probably pin the death on them. Still, Kiefer did a nice job as the sort of villain of the movie. All in all a good movie about kids who while on a trip to find something at the end discover some stuff about themselves and each other.</fullReview>

Chris has such a big brother, Eyeball, who is leader of a gang of older and known as the city's Habit. Chris has also had a negative image so that he, for example, will always be charged in school when something is lost or destroyed. Gordie is the intelligent. His older brother has recently died. His brother was a popular and talented guy and Gordie feel as if his parents, especially his dad, think it should have been Gordie who died instead. They have heard about a dead guy in their age in the wood. The police have not found him yet, the four friends go out and look for him. I like that all four have problems home but when they are together they live like a little " dream world ". The movie is profound and to see their friendship make me happy !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This title is one of a kind. I've never saw a movie more profound than this one.Based on a story by Stephen King, maybe, if not for sure, the best selling author of the 20th century along with Agatha Christie, Stand by me is a drama centered around the lives of 4 boys, who engage in a rescue mission to find the body of a missing boy.The story though apparently a linear, ordinary one, is outstanding in every sense of the word.I haven't notest any flaws whatsoever, because it focuses exclusively on those four boys, and their special relation, a relation based on courage, unity and sincere support, that type of friendship which can survive to everything, which can stand in front of any enemy and never back down.I've seen this movie a long time ago and still remember everything: the bridge scene, which was one of the very best scenes, the scene with the eating contest, an incontestable proof of childhood genuine story-telling, not to mention the leaches from the lake. They where all perfectly balanced, they were all authentic nothing was forced, everything came together perfectly and the result is nonetheless magnificent.The acting was superb. I can not believe how well those little actors did, their interpretation was a key factor in sustaining the unique atmosphere of the group. Gordie, Chriss, Teddy and Vern showed us through motion picture the perfect experience of a true, special bond along with the exemplary story &amp; directing signed Stephen King and Ron Howard.That is why this film is brilliant, because it surpassed any other production based on friendship and loyalty. I was impressed by "Stand by me", just the same as I was by "Band of Brothers" mini-series even tough they share the same values (and should share the same rating), they are extremely different. That is why I believe it deserves no less than a maximum ***** out of ***** (10/10)</fullReview>

The character were all unique in their own way, the acting from the teenagers (some making their screen debuts) were close to fantastic. Stand By Me will be long-lived as on of the finest movies of story-telling and lives up to the standards and execution of Stephen King's original book "The Body". It's sad, its suspenseful at times, its a definite movie for all ages, young or old. Be prepared to witness a powerfully moving story of four teenagers, whose life's changed in 48 hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Body gone Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen King's coming of age story The Body, has been brought to life by Rob Reiner, Raynold Gideon, and Bruce Evans in the spectacular 1986, film, Stand by Me. It stars Wil Wheaton and River Phoenix as best friends in a small 1950's Oregon town. Within this 88 minute masterpiece, you'll experience thrills, chills, laughs, and an unnerving need to throw up. It all starts when a dead body is found on the outskirts of Castle Rock, Oregon. When Chris (Phoenix), Gordon (Wheaton), Teddy (Corey Feldman), and Vern (Jerry O'Connell) hear about this, they decide to go on an epic adventure to find it. All is fun and games until Vern's older brother and his gang of scoundrels go searching for the body as well. With dilemmas like a ruthless game of chicken and a river full of leeches, the two gangs go to all lengths until they meet up and all hell breaks loose. With deep conversations and hilariously immature outbursts, this movie never loses tension and will keep you satisfied to the very end.The movie takes place in Castle Rock, Oregon, and its surrounding counties, in the year 1959. Most of the film is shown on the train tracks in the county, which brought a lot of lighting and setting options to the movie. That, plus the music, camera work, and costumes, give the movie a great 1950's feeling. The mood of the different scenes is normally set by the sound, or lack of it. Such as, when the mood is calm or serious, there is very little noise in the back ground, normally only crickets. The camera work is always still during those moments, which helps keep the tension. Wil Wheaton and River Phoenix, give the strongest and most believable performances as best friends, Gordon and Chris. The two have great chemistry and bring a lot of emotion to the film's story. The two have scenes together, where they talk about their positions in life, death, and the future. In these scenes you can barely believe that they were 12 year old kids, because of the intensity and emotion. Aside from them, Kiefer Sutherland is the best actor in the movie. He is smart, witty, and brings a larger-than-life feeling to his character. Those traits are uncommon, but they are welcome to this bully character.The theme of this movie is painfully obvious. Be a kid when you're a kid, or you will regret it for the rest of your life. In the scenes between Chris and Gordon, they continually talk about this, and by the end of the film, it's obvious that it's the main point. Another good point is made, right near the end of the film, by an adult Gordon. He says that he never had better friends, than the ones he had when he was twelve. That really adds on to the prior theme, of being a kid, because a big part of being a kid is having friends. When this film was released it was not only vastly popular but it gave a real kick start to the directing career of Rob Reiner. Reiner had only previously directed two movies, This is Spinal Tap, and A Sure Thing, both of which were only met by modest success. After this movie, he went on to direct many blockbusters within many genres, such as Misery, A Few Good Men and, The Princess Bride. Since the genres are so vastly different, the only thing that can be said about his films is that he has made one of the greatest contributions to the film industry, of any modern director. For a final note, this film is fantastic and although it is not for everyone, it's like The Basketball Diaries and is important for teenagers to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best Films I've Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stand By Me is the emotional coming-of-age story of four boys who go on an adventure looking for a dead body. Yes, the premise of the movie is kind of grim. But there is a good amount of humor in the film, as well as their is a lot of sad parts. The acting of this film is absolutely superb, and the story is excellent. Rob Reiner really did an awesome job directing this masterpiece, and they chose just the right cast to play the parts, too. This film contains humor, emotion, suspense, and adventure all in 90 minutes, certainly one of the best movies of the 80's.Rated R for language and adult situations.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Characters And Actors Who Play Them Are More Important Than The Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More notable for its characters (and the actors who played them) than for its story, "Stand By Me" is a pretty decent piece of movie-making. Taken from a Stephen King short story called "The Body," the movie is a sort of coming of age story that follows four boyhood friends on a camping trip the summer before they enter Junior High. Their goal: to find the body of a classmate who is presumed dead after going into the woods to pick blueberries. The movie is a flashback. It opens with an author (played by Richard Dreyfuss) reading a newspaper account of a friend who had been stabbed to death, and from his reflections on the incident comes this account of one of their adventures. Dreyfuss continues to do voice-over narration throughout the movie.The story isn't really what most interested me, although it does manage to draw the viewer in with characters that are mostly believable and fairly easy to relate to, all of whom have some issues to deal with, not the least of which is that they all seem to feel stuck in one way or another in this drab little town of Castle Rock, Oregon. What's most interesting though - to me anyway - is the look at some very early work by some very young actors, some of whom became very well known. Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Casey Siemaszko, Corey Feldman, Kiefer Sutherland, John Cusack - they're all in this in the early stages of their acting careers. It's even a fairly early example of Rob Reiner's directing.Essentially it's an entertaining piece of escapism. It's pretty quick, with a running time of less than an hour and a half, and to be honest, even at that there are a few scenes that came across as unnecessary. Overall, though, I'd have to say that this is a winner. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rob Reiner used to make great works and probably if I decide to make my "official" list with my 100 favourites films, This Is Spinal Tap could be there?just like Stand By Me. This gem captures that feels that you only get when you are a kid that feels that you share with your friends. On that level the film is absolutely funny with all the little details that represent the different personalities of the four boys, the four friends Gordie (Will Wheaton), Chris (River Phoenix), Teddy (Corey Feldman) and Vern (Jerry O'Connell). In the beginning of the film Gordie introduce us his friends saying for example that Chris is the leader of their gang and also his best friend but with the journey we are going to know much more about these kids and a fine example can be the reaction after hearing Gordie's story about Lard-Ass, with the most curious reaction being the one of Vern (you will see why), or also a wonderful scene where you see both Gordie and Chris talking about more serious things and suddenly we move to the talk between Teddy and Vern with both talking about mighty mouse and Superman (Teddy: "Superman's a real guy"). It is just an absolute adventure, a total kids adventure, and the "objective" could have been easily another but at the same time going to see a dead body is a perfect way to show kids' big curiosity and also is absolutely funny to watch how they imagine the fact that they can be in the news being again the reaction of Vern the most unique, you know worrying about their hairs. In other level it is moving and sad to see how this little boys are already thinking about problems that are not indicated to be a charge when you have 12 years old or so but are quite common. Of course everything relies upon the family and in the end it is a great family what seems to have Gordie or maybe is better to call him Stephen.The Cast: Definitely we have four unforgettable characters and with that four magnificent performances. Phoenix is great, well everybody is; not long time ago I saw on TV the picture Tomcats with Jerry O'Connell (Stand by Me his screen debut) in the protagonist role and is really funny to see how changed is now, well actually like 6 years ago. Anyway, the support roles include the classic older and crazy bully played by Kiefer Sutherland and with him and Corey Feldman we have two Lost Boys! Also John Cusack makes a little performance as Gordie's brother.Conclusion: A very personal work by Stephen King turned into his favourite film based on one of his works. Stand by Me is the kind of film to enjoy many times; it is nothing less than a masterpiece so if you haven't you must check it!Special Edition DVD: this is a really good presentation, released in the year 2000, and its extras are the commentary of Rob Reiner, Talent files (little information and part of the filmography of the four protagonists, Rob Reiner, Stephen King and Kiefer Sutherland), music video of Stand by Me, trailers of The Karate Kid (John G. Avildsen, 1984) and Fly Away Home (Carroll Ballard, 1996) and the featurette "Walking the tracks: The Summer of Stand by Me"; Definitely a great DVD for any collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stand by me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is always a pleasurable surprise when you come across a gem of a movie ? that too accidentally. This is one of it.It is a story about the memories of a writer (Richard Dreyfuss) of his childhood ? Gordie (Wil Wheaton) along with three other friends ? Chris (River Phoenix), Teddy (Corey Feldman) and Vern (Jerry O'Connell) decide to go in search of a missing boy ? with a suspicion that he might be murdered in the woods. Without informing their parents, they venture into this journey along the railway track walking till the river. The couple of days of their travel present the best part of growing up awkwardness of adolescent age.This is such a beautiful poignant movie, that it lives in your heart much after the movie is over. All the four boys have acted beautifully. There are very few movies that have justified Stephen Kings' novel adaptation, and these one should be surely in the foremost list.Director Rob Reiner, has done a wonderful job in extracting the best out of his crew. The musical score by Jack Nitzche is very good and reminiscence of early 60's.It is sad that one of the four boys ? River Phoenix ? died young due to drug abuse; something similar to what was remained at the end of the movie when the narrator and voice over by the writer ? Richard Dreyfuss talks about the whereabouts of these boys, when grown up.One of the best coming-to-age movies I have seen since long. Highly recommended.(Stars 8 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find it hard to understand why certain people (Mr Benson, you stooge) hate this wonderful wonderful movie. I can identify with all the character which i find hard to find in movies. River Phenoix though. Wow.... Heath Ledger is very similar. A wonderful actor cut down in his prime. Imagine what would have happened if River didn't die! Question for the ages. Everybody puts out here. Wil Wheaton, River of course, Jerry, Corey Feldman even Kiefer (24) Sutherland plays a very nasty bully/rebel. I laughed and laughed when they played drive-by baseball. Rob (Spinal Tap) Reiner directs this perfectly too. Basically we follow 4 young lads on the search for a dead boy. Adapted from Stephen Kings Different Seasons (Which is a book of short stories which also inspired The Shawshank Redemption!!). I find the ending extremely poignant. Chris (Phoenix) a young misunderstood boy ends up as a lawyer and successful but is stabbed and dies. Sad, very sad.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I nearly gave Stand By Me a 10/10 but I come from the school of thought that nothing is perfect, hence I reluctantly made it a 9/10.Stand By Me is one of the movies I watch several times during the year. It always brings a smile to my face as I begin thinking of my own childhood. That is really quite strange because the movie takes place in the early 50's and I was born in '77. That 20+ year difference doesn't seem to have any diminishing effects on this movies ability to relate to boys, young men, or older. I suppose you could call it timeless.As far as mood, Stand By Me is both serious and light-hearted at the same time. The 4 boys (main Characters) laugh a lot as most do, but they also cry and occasionally fight.The music is almost like an additional character. It fits the film perfectly and despite the fact that it's not my preferred listening choice, I can't help but hum or even sing along during the movie. The music seems to propel you back in time and it feels like your on this great adventure with the Characters.The entire cast is huge, and includes many well established actors such as Will Wheaton, Corey Feldman, River Phoenix, Jerry O'Connell, and supporting actors including John Cusack, Richard Dreyfuss, and Kiefer Sutherland. I'm not sure about some of the spelling on the names, so please forgive me if I misspelled any.The one single deterrent in my opinion is that the language is rather strong. All of the boys attempt to be independent and rebellious to some extent and in the absence of parental figures they curse quite often. This won't bother everyone, but I felt the movie would have been just as great without the language, or perhaps with less (mostly in the beginning). It is probably more believable this way however, and i'm sure that was one of the intentions of the director.In conclusion, Stand By Me is over 20 years old now. Most people have seen it, but if you haven't then i'm suggesting it to you now. I'm quite sure you'll enjoy it, especially guys, but everyone should see it once. For those of you who already love this movie, make sure you add it to your home video collection. Enjoy this coming of age movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't let the rating scare you away!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My brother and I saw this movie in our creative writing class (as a character development assignment) and it was so good we bought it. Then we watched it with our 9-year-old sister, and she thought it was boring. Yeah, younger kids might think this movie is boring because there's no violence or "exciting" action in it. But if you're old enough to appreciate it, you'll definitely be sucked in by the plot and the characters. Gordie- the sensitive writer, Chris- the misunderstood peacekeeper and leader, Teddy- the wild, crazy kid who keeps the story interesting, and Vern- the pet who flinches when you punch the air in front of him.This movie is rated R, even though the main characters are 12-year-olds. The reason why is that the F word is used more than twice, actually about 6 times. These kids do swear a lot, but have you ever heard 12-year-old boys talking to each other before?This is now officially my favorite movie. Watch it if your life to be FULFILLED or you'll never forgive yourself!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many years ago I saw "Stand By Me" for the first time. Since then I've seen it a few times and it still has more or less the same effect on me.A group of friends learn about a presumed dead boy who has been missing for several days and was last seen a few miles from their hometown. It doesn't take long or it is decided that this group leaves their homes for the trip of their lives.The movie isn't so much about finding the body of the deceased kid, it also isn't about the trip. It actually is about friendship, growing up and how friendship and people change during certain events in their lives.As they continue on their hiking trip, they have to deal with certain personal issues that everyone encounters in their life. By the end of the film, they haven't physically but mentally grown up because of what they experienced together... as friends.I always have been felt moved by "Stand Be Me" because of what they go trough and their friendship. Because the whole situation is so real, some moments do come over as a bit scary.The ending of the movie is what's most touching. Both his character and eventually himself later in his life share the same fate. This gives the ending of "Stand By Me" a more powerful and emotional meaning.Also seeing Richard Dreyfus as the grown up Gordie LaChance with his kids playing outside is powerful: kids grow up and go their own ways often 'forgetting' their friends. Even though this happens, deep inside them the friendship still goes on forever.For their age, all 4 boys did a superb acting job. I don't think it's easy to find talented actors at that age today.My score for "Stand By Me" is 9 out of 10. Superb acting, writing, directing, (touching) music, etc. If you haven't seen it, you won't regret if you see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seen this film many times and it really brings me back to the days of being young and all the things we got up to. Back in the '80s when there was no mobile phones or computers we all made our own fun with whatever we had. We see in this four young lads going on a long hike up a rail track to look for the dead body of a missing boy. The way the boys relate to each other and the excellent dialog is brilliant and anyone in their 30s would do well to give this a look as they'll really relate to it. Every misdemeanor they cause and the constant slagging matches are so believable. The story is beautifully narrated by Richard Dreyfuss and goes from high to low and is one of the best Stephen King stories made into a movie by far</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Went through a range of emotions with this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is about 4 teen boys who hear about a dead body (it is a body of child who has been missing). They decide they will be the ones to call the police and get the credit for finding the body.The film is also about friendship and how it is not always possible to keep friends from childhood because they can go off in different directions which happens to this group of friends. All they have is each other because they don't have good family lives. Chris's (River Phoenix) father beats him up and the town view his whole family as trouble including him and because of that, he doesn't think he will amount to much. Teddy(Corey Feldman)is severely abused by his father and the town often think of his father as a loony. Gordy's brother died and he is ignored by his parents. His father focused all his attention on Denny, his older son and looked down on his other son's talent for writing. Chris sees Gordy's talent and tells him not to listen to his father that he can be a successful writer.It is a nostalgia piece set in the 50's with a soundtrack that matches, it includes Lollipop by The Chordettes, Great Balls of Fire by Jerry Lee Lewis, Yakety Yak by The Coasters, Rockin' Robin by Bobby Day and Everyday by Buddy Holly. My favourite has to be the title song Stand By Me by Ben E. King.At the end of the journey, something has changed in Chris and Gordy because for the first time they stand up to the bullies lead by Kiefer Sutherland who want to be the ones in the papers and on television. They also decide they will leave the police an anonymous tip as it is the right thing to do.It is a sad film to watch especially when you find out that Chris has died and the manner in which he died. He moved away from the town so he could make something of himself and became a lawyer and ended up dying trying to break up a fight. I wish there had been some commentary on how Gordy's life was after his adventure especially if he ever resolved his issues with his parents or if they continued to ignore him. It is hinted at that he became a writer, he has a child and is a success, judging by the house at the end of the film.It is a shame that River Phoenix died when he did as he was one of the most talented young actors I have ever seen. It is also a shame about Corey Feldman who battled a drug problem in the past but could never go back to the level he was at as a child. Wil Wheaton has succeeded, he is well-known as Wesley Crusher in Star Trek and Kiefer Sutherland has done very well, particular on TV.I like that the film is at a slower, gentler pace, it makes a change from the fast paced action films, this has something important to say about friendship.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding movie; especially amazing acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched this movie when I was around 11 two years ago, and I love it even more every time I watch it. "Stand by Me" is the ultimate story about friendship, and being able to trust and rely on your friends. It's main characters are four twelve year old boys; intelligent, aspiring writer Gordie (Wil Wheaton), the 'tough' leader Chris (River Phoenix), the sensitive 'but trying to hide it' Teddy (Corey Feldman) and Vern (Jerry O'Connell), the wuss of the group.The four friends, who are all facing troubles at home, group together in order to find the body of a 12 year old who was recently hit by a train and killed. However, the bad gang in town is also after the body, and so Gordie and his friends must get there first. The story is told from the perspective of an older Gordie, looking back on his childhood, and takes place over a period of 2 days. They face several adventures along the way, but it turns out that what they realise at the end of the day is how strong friendships can be.My favourite thing in this movie is the friendship between Gordie and his best friend Chris. They're two very different boys, but their friendship is so powerful and strong it is the highlight of the movie. My favourite performance in this whole movie has to be the one by the now late River Phoenix; he is incredibly natural and lights up every scene he is in. He is arguably the best actor of his generation, and would've been one of the big stars of today, had he not died so young. All of the performances, however, contribute to the enormous success that this movie is.I recommend this movie to everyone from the ages of around 11 and upwards. The only reason for it's 15/R, etc, rating is for the frequent use of bad language, especially by the four boys. It is a fantastic, refreshing movie, and reduced me to tears at the end. Very touching, highly recommended. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Stand By Me" is a simple film that is easy to follow. It contains laughs and suspense and also emotions, which are believable. "Stand By Me" is about four 12 year old boys, Gordie (Wil Wheaton), Chris (River Phoenix), Teddy (Corey Feldman) and Vern (Jerry O'Connell), and how they go on an adventure to find a boy. He has been missing for 3 days. At the beginning of the film you find out that an attorney has been killed but only at the end of the film do you realise the significance of the article. Chris Chambers was the attorney and in my opinion the fact that River Phoenix died at 23 adds more emotion to the end of the film. This film is the best film I have seen recently and the soundtrack, including "Stand By Me" by Ben E King, also adds to the 9/10 mark that I have submitted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Four boys wrestle after wading through a river. A discovery of a leech makes the boys strip down to their underwear, ripping the black creatures off. Finally one boy finds a leech in his boxers. He pulls it out with bloodied fingers and faints.Situations like these come up often in Rob Reiner's Stand By Me. The film is told by a grown up Gordie Lachance (Richard Dreyfuss). It is set in the '50s about a gang of boys; a young Gordie Lachance (Wil Wheaton), Chris Chambers (River Phoenix), Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman), and Vern Tessio (Jerry O' Connell). The gang learn that a dead body is in the woods and camp out to find it. However the journey turns into a coming of age story. It focuses on Gordie's life: his feelings about his dead older brother and how he feels like an outsider within the gang. The film contains many exciting and unusual scenes. My personal favourites were Lardass' story and the discovery of the body.The director captures the meaning of being a kid. Also he shows the pains of growing up and accepting what we have to do in later life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my favourite film of all time. The story line helps the viewer envisage the times of when he/she were young, without responsibilities and always looking for adventure. Isn't it weird that everybody seemed to have 4 close friends when they were young and one of these being the most loyal you could wish for. Stand by Me is the epitome of everything that being young represented. The viewer is taken back to when they were young and whilst watching the film they also watch their past through the memories the film forces through, all from the relationship with your best friend to the fact that some friend do just become another face in the hall, even though you grew up and matured together. the whole experience forces you to watch it again and again even though every time it makes you sadder and sadder. its an extremely powerful film with 4 great actors acting superb. just wish there were more like it. 10/10</fullReview>

This was also one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. The acting was surprisingly great and the plot was also great. The movie had actors like the late River Phoenix, Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell. This was a relaxing movie for the family. Then again it is Rated R, due to the plot in going to find a dead body, Coarse Language, Violence and some suggestive content. There is a scene where you see the dead body and the face of the body looks sort of morbid. BUT, this movie was very entertaining in every way. I'm giving this classic a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coming of age in 50's America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stand By Me is one of the best coming of age movies set in a small American town of the 1950's. The period details are excellent and the story of a band of friends about to enter their teens is very well told. Stand By Me is one of four novellas of Stephen King's Different Seasons. The other two that were filmed were Apt Pupil and The Shawshank Redemption. As I recall, Stand By Me is quite faithful to the original story (The Body) which was very well told. I think the direction and the casting are the real coups that make the film such an endearing classic for many.Before seeing Stand By Me for the second time after a decade and a half, I got to see River Phoenix again. Any misconception I had that he was an unjustly famous teenage star who was into sex, drugs and partying has been dispelled. Even at the young age of 15 years, he gives a thoroughly assured performance bringing into play a range of emotions. There is no doubt he would have gone far if his career hadn't ended with a fatal drug overdose. The rest of the cast is routinely excellent as well and the humor is very good, albeit shocking to see the extra-curricular activities and language of pre-pubescent boys from the 1950's - smoking and some foul language.Stand By Me is a very good film for most viewers and I can't understand it being a great film for people who came of age in the 1950's US.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stand by Me is in my opinion the best movie ever made. Not only to will the older generation enjoy this but so can the younger viewers like myself. Wil Wheaton does a fantastic performance as Gordie, both Corey and Jerry are wonderful to watch together. And who could forget the late River Phoenix, As leader of this small gang he leads his friends to see a dead body yet in the end thats not what the movie turns out to be about. Each boy goes through an emotional journey during the movie and as each scene goes by more and more about each of these misfits is revealed. It's certainly a great coming of age movie that all boys will relate to, however that doesn't mean that the girls out there won't love this one- just as much as me.</fullReview>

No, I LOVED it. what an amazing movie. and yes i am a teenager so i'll say it River Pheonix is beyond hot, and i am so sad that he died. but aside from that this movie is great and has become my favorite. the actors are incredible. the 4 boys do an amazing job. Gordie is the sensitive and intelligent boy played so well by Wil Wheaton, Chris is the "bad kid" as he has been labeled but brings the peace when something is wrong played wonderfully by River Pheonix. Teddy is crazy yet sensitive, at least about his dad, played by Corey Feldman (i love the seen where he's standing guard and he wont shut up and let the other boys sleep.) And Vern the scaredy cat of the group played by Jerry O'Connel. Plus an excellent performance by Keifer Sutherland as the very mean and dangerous Ace. This movie has everything, its not too fluffy and soft that only a girl should watch it and its not way too tough that only a boy can watch. Anybody can watch this movie and fall in love with it, like i have. If you have not watched this movie Watch it you wont regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was seen this movie first when I was 12 years old, and I will always remember what was my feeling as soon as this movie came to end, and the song "stand by me" was on the air, along with the credits. I felt then, and I still feeling now, that this is the best movie I ever seen, period.I have never saw such a great movie, with great story, wonderful soundtrack and amazing acting by young actors. Since then, I am considering Rob Reiner as a huge director.If you never watch this movie, you just must: This is really one of the best movies ever. In my opinion, this is the best movie ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched a part of Stand By Me on TV and I liked what I saw so I went and bought the film. SBM is a coming of age film and still is popular after 20 years, even if it was before my time, I loved it and watched it every chance I get. This film stars River Phoenix, Jerry O'Connell, Corey Feldman and Wil Wheaton, as anyone would say, these 4 boys were incredibly talented and really put 101% into their characters and really lived in the film, doing what any young boys would've done at 12-16. They can easily relate to the film because they're not far off from their character's age hence they can act like boys with cussing, smoking and fights.The storyline is true and how they put a meaning into the film about friendship and how people don't have friends like the ones when they were twelve, that sure is true! This is a movie to see before you die, if you choose not to see it, then you're missing out on a classic movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what coming of age movies is all about, and in the best way possible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rob Reiner came this close to a masterpiece only once more ("The Princess Bride")Steven King showed he can write a powerful story without having to scare us silly, and a group of young actors came up with a performance of a life time. In fact some of them were haunted by their roll in this movie straight out of a career. It's one of those magic moments when everything comes together exactly right, growing up pains and the effects death has on life rarely found a better expression in a movie or anywhere else. I could go on and on but I don't think there's any call for this, even if I don't meet the required minimal text. This is a go see movie if there ever was 1.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing, a must see coming of age film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We are all haunted by childhood's end, by the important things we must leave behind on our long and arduous journey into adulthood: the intensity of our loves, fears, and hurts; the talismanic rituals and games; the laughter and bravado; and the deep bonds of friendship. All of these things are explored in this charming coming of age story.Stand by Me is one of the sweetest and most affecting films ever made about the darkness at the edge of town that must be faced before four young boys can move on to the new challenges that junior high school will bring them. This film, adapted by Raynold Gideon and Bruce A. Evans from Stephen King's novella, "The Body," is beautifully written and performed. The Oregan landscape scenery plays a part in en-chancing a lot of the film.The direction by Rob Reiner is amazing. He makes the film so absorbing and beautiful, he certainly knows how to bring a tear the eye, and at the same time laugh along with heart warming scenes.The cast is brilliant, they are one of the most talented bunch of child actors I know. But I must give credit to the late River Phoenix (who plays Chris Chambers), may his talented sole rest in peace.Overall, Stand by Me ranks upon one of my favourite films of all time. With its exceptional 1950s soundtrack, scenery, acting, directing and writing, the film is a touching examination on friendship. A True Classic! 10/10 See It If You Liked: Now and Then and The Breakfast Club</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent coming-of-age movie that will warm your heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stand By Me is a classic film, it is about four boys; Chris Chambers, Gordie Lachance, Teddy Duchamp and Vern Tessio.It's set in the summer of 1959 in a small town in Oregon called Castle Rock. The story starts as a middle-aged man (we soon learn that this is the main character; Gordie looking back at an experience when he was young) tells us: "I was 12 going on 13 the first time I saw a dead human being". This is what the film is about, the four pre-teen boys embark on a journey to find a kid who has been killed by a train as they hope that their discovery will lead to their fame. The characters must travel through fields, forests and even over train tracks to get to their goal. It's not as easy as it seems and in one memorable scene Gordie and Vern almost meet their demise as they scramble across a bridge just as a freight train is passing.Unfortunately, the town's bullies are also out to get to the body for the same reason as the four boys. The bullies and our four boys meet at the end and in a very tense scene (you will have to watch the movie yourself to find out what happens, I'm not telling). But this is not the whole story; in truth it is much more than that. Stand By Me is about friendship and how a single event can change your life forever.Throughout the film we learn more and more about the individual characters, for example: we learn that Gordie is ignored by his parents at home after his older brother had died, Chris and Teddy's Dad's are abusive or just plain deranged and Vern is the awkward kid whom everyone picks on. Though there is a lot of sadness and angst in this film, there are also elements of comedy. The characters are very lovable; you will often understand how they feel regardless if you have been in a situation like the boys.The acting in this movie is absolutely superb, for many of the cast, this was their first film and it does not show. They all look like very experienced actors. They make it ever so much easier to fall in love with every single character.Stand By Me is a film adapted from one of Steven King's novellas; 'The Body'. King has based a lot of the character's adventures on his own childhood in the 1950s. The movie has stayed quite loyal to the film with only minor differences. So if you liked the book then you will definitely like the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie the summer of my 11th year. I am now 30. I have seen this movie 1054 times during that time. I know it word for word.When I first saw the movie, I just loved it because the boys were so cute and the story good. Now, like so many, I look back, just like Gordy, and man I lived it! I had such adventures with the group of friends from that period of my life! I was a tomboy, so most of my friends were guys. The things we did! The stories I can tell! have told. There was Ken, my best friend, Rob, Paul, Andy, Lori, and me.Sadly, like the guys in the movie, over the years we faded away. Lori got married early, Rob became a religious recluse,Andy was in the Marines stationed in Germany last I knew. I saw Paul once years ago,he wasn't the same guy I knew. Then, Ken. Ken was killed in a car accident 2 years ago in January. He was out celebrating anew job with his brother and a friend. I hadn't seen him in three months. I miss him. We had been best friends for 13 years. So when I miss him to much, I watch this movie again. Its my favorite movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not much to say about this, other than its a hilarious movie with many surprises and keeps you on the edge of your seat. It starts out in a fantastic setting, a small quaint town, with a group of four mischievous young boys who are always getting into trouble. As the plot line progresses, they make up an excuse and plan to set off to find a teenagers dead body. They are so interested in finding this boy because he is the same age as the boys. As they set off, many obstacles and great fears are in their way, including the sound of night, leeches and more. Though it is somewhat a horror drama, The laughs are well planned, and not cheesy whatsoever. As the obsession grows, will they give up? And what is the twist ending? Watch the movie and see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stand By Me is an excellent adaption of Steven King's 'The Body'. I have been using it as an extra text for English for my HSC and have found it so useful as it conveys many themes and ideas and the techniques are extremely well utilised. It is well adaptable to any area of study, for me it has been Journeys, Changes and Story Telling.The story is well directed and written and the focuses upon the changing nature of friendships and the trials and tribulations of growing up and maturing have brought about a deeper meaning for the movie as a text. It is a good representation of the 'coming of age' experienced by many of us. The cast of young actors work brilliantly and their acting is deserves great commendation. The characters are well developed and we can see them as they mature and grow up on this journey of self discovery and how their bonds of friendship change as a result of this. This is examined quite well and we see that friendships change, after all, Teddy and Vern become "just faces in the hallway". We also learn that growing up can be hard and sometimes confusing, and finding yourself in a world where you are the forgotten child, may be the hardest thing. Living up to parental expectations, especially after such events that Gordy has experienced would make anyone feel useless and unwanted and a soft spot for him can be developed. I can say I really developed a soft spot for Chris Chambers, as he is labelled as a bad kid and has grown up facing many adversities. He is the glue and the peace maker in their childhood friendship, that all though they act all mature and hard-assed, they are merely innocent children. Vern on the other hand is the catalyst of the story. He provides the reason for the journey and speeds things along, so as not to become long winded. When obstacles are needed to be overcome, he keeps the boys together and even pressures them into certain decisions (eg train bridge). Teddy is a very lonely boy and has a soft spot for his father, although abused by him , and rumoured to have burnt his ear off. Gordy is in awe of him, as his father tried to kill him and he is deeply moved when the junkyard owner calls him a "loony". Gordy is confused because his own father has never really come near him in his life and he doesn't feel anything of his father, maybe even a feeling aversion.I feel the narration is also a very key component of this film. It introduces the time and place of the story and sets the overall tone. It then reappears throughout stages in the text to show the significance of certain events that happen along the way, for example the deer. At the conclusion of the story, it again reappears to help sum up the story and the feelings of the anonymous writer, how he feels that you never have friends like you did when you are twelve years old. It is also by this that he feels you never have the same carefree and innocence that you also once had as a child.Overall this movie is a great movie and I recommend it to anybody who hasn't seen it. It is definitely worth watching, and when you have to pull it apart for school work, it just makes it that much more appealing because you then understand the underlying features of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"It was almost noon when we set out to find the dead body of Ray Brower." So narrates one of four boys, all grown up and having become a successful writer like he always wanted, and now retelling the story of the summer adventure that changes the lives of him and his friends forever.Based on a short story by Stephen King, Stand By Me is Rob Reiner's masterpiece, vaulting him into the Great directors fame. This is a film that projects so much heart that it is impossible to forget over the years. It is extremely well-sewn together, superbly crafting moods mainly through the use of dialogue and sprinkled with nice doses of humour. To carry this dialogue is a perfectly dynamic and dimensional cast of young characters: Corey Feldman, Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix and Jerry O'Connell as the little fat kid (who is now an underwear model and is dating a supermodel. We get it, OK? You're not the little fat kid anymore) that we follow through this epic "Lost Boys"-like adventure.Stand By Me is an engrossing, gloriously entertaining and heartfelt adventure drama in which nothing feels missing or out-of-place and that, more importantly, caters to people of all ages. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm 35 years old--I'm 35 years old? Holy cow--and I just saw this movie. Man, what have I been waiting for? What a GREAT movie! It's only 87 minutes long, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. And I can't believe little Jerry O'Connell. I didn't even recognize him! He looks like the young Doug Heffernan on The King of Queens...who probably wasn't even born when this move was filmed.I don't know how many young boys have this kind of adventure when they're that age, but it's at least fun to think that about. Heck, the only think I really did as a kid was turn on a tractor and drive it at a construction site near my home. I suppose this movie is far fetched--need to remember who wrote the book it's based on--but who knows! But then again, who cares...it's a movie!GREAT movie! Go see it NOW!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my absolute FAVORITE films ever made...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think in all my 14 years that a movie like this has ever touched me so much. I was motivated to see it because I am a huge River Phoenix fan (not those dorky obsessive kind haha) but I got so much more out of it. The acting from these kids was absolutely breathtaking; they each portrayed their characters wonderfully. It was a good start for all of them. Since I am a girl and never really felt the "12 yr old boy friends" I didn't think it would relate to me as much but I was very wrong. The imagery was beautiful and it was somewhat believable. The jokes made me laugh out loud, all alone, in my computer room (I am listening to it behind this window as i type); especially the scene where Gordie shoots the garbage can and the jokes about the peoples "mothers" are hilarious too I make them all the time and I thought it was some new age thing but guess not! This is a 10 star film, no doubt, and completely worth seeing. I liked it more than the Godfather even. The language, even though people have found it too over-the-top, was hilarious. It's hilarious hearing these 12 yr old boys telling each other to f*** their moms because I've heard it all before and it's even funnier on camera. PLEASE WATCH THIS FILM YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!</fullReview>

It has a slow start, but you can't not love it at the end. Everyone could recognize something about themselves in these 4 kids. No matter of you're a boy or a girl. There are some memorable scenes that probably stay with you for a long, long time.This movie is simply about being a kid. After seeing this movie, you will probably miss being a kid for a while. But that's the message I personally think.The acting job of the 4 kids is amazing! Wil Wheaton and River Phoenix did an amazing job. Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell were also outstanding.It's also a movie you could see for like 20 times in one week and you still be excited about it! For children, this movie is just very fun. For teenagers / adults it's still a great movie, because this movie has an interesting message.I give it a 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This profanity-ridden 1986 Hollywood film is based on the novella "The Body" by writer Stephen King. Perhaps it would've been another idiosyncratic Stephen King film had it not been for the excellent directing by Rob Reiner? Stand By Me is good, very good. It should become one of the Hollywood Club's classics, but many of today's generation never heard of it - and that's a shame. The acting is superb. The viewer's emotional involvement with the characters is accomplished with a minimum of dialogue - Rob Reiner wastes no footage here. It's about four 12 year old boys in a small Oregon town, three of whom nearly qualify as misfits by middle class standards, who hear about a dead body and decide to set out on an overnight expedition to find it before anyone else does.The film opens with one of the lads grown into adulthood, Gordie Lachance (played by Richard Dreyfuss) sitting in his car reading a newspaper obituary of one of the other lads "Attorney Christopher Chambers Fatally Stabbed in Restaurant", page C-3, The Oregonian, Wednesday, September 4, 1985. He begins to reminisce about the time they set out to find the dead body - "I was 12 going on 13 the first time I saw a dead human being. It happened in the Summer of 1959, a long time ago".The adult Gordie Lachance played by Richard Dreyfuss becomes the film's narrator as he recounts his childhood adventure. The 1959 adventure begins when Vern Tessio (played by Jerry O'Connell) is under his front porch digging small holes in the hopes of discovering the spot where he had buried a jar full of pennies, overhears his older brother and his friend talking about the Dodge car that they stole, and hears they saw a boy that is probably the one that the news has been broadcasting as missing for last three days. He hears them deduce that Ray Brauer must've been hit by a train when he when off to pick blueberries. Vern runs to his friends hanging out in a treehouse with the news that if they follow the tracks, they can find a body.His friends are Teddy Duchamp (played by Corey Feldman), Gordie Lachance (played by Wil Wheaton), and Chris Chambers (played by River Phoenix). Teddy Duchamp reacts by exclaiming that Ray Brauer was "our age" and they decide to do an overnight 20-mile expedition down the train tracks and locate one of their own fallen pre-teens. They tell their parents that they are doing sleepovers at each other's houses - and in keeping with the cannon-fodder Hoopieville ways of their parents, none of the parents bother to phone the other parents to check any of this out. Many blue-collar working class communities were that way during the 50s, 60s, 70s, and even 80s. Many of those older generations can relate to the film's time period and to the characters' behaviors.As these 4 lads make their way down the train tracks, we learn that three of them are suffering from a problem environment exacerbated by problem parents. Gordie is grieving the death of his older brother 4 months previous, while suffering nightmares in which his father says "It should've been you Gordon". Chris is suffering from low self-esteem resulting from the stigma of being a member of a worthless family headed by an alcoholic gun-keeping father (whose pistol Chris has brought along). Teddy's father was even more abusive than Chris's dad - he was committed to an insane asylum after an abusive attack on Teddy. Teddy, in turn, tells everyone his dad died storming the beach at Normandy on D-Day, while being haunted by the fact that he has a "loonie" for a dad. Vern is the only one of the bunch that is not suffering from some emotional trauma - while the others are cussing away at the absurdities in their lives Vern fondly sings the praises of "cherry-flavored PEZ".These troubled kids represent real kids that had similar problems growing up in Baby Boomer working-class towns and many of the older generations will relate. Today's generation will find it difficult to relate to these boys - they have no cell phones, no hand-held computer games, no rap or hip-hop. But the boys do encounter a junkyard dog with a vicious reputation, a train dodge on a trestle (not by choice), coyotes, leeches, and teen-aged bullies with a knife-wielding ring leader "Ace" (played by Keifer Sutherland). The campfire tale about "Lard Ass" is hilarious.When the boys do find the body, the bullies show up and pull a knife on Chris. Gordie shoots Chris's dad's pistol into the air, then aims it at "Ace" the ringleader. The bullies leave. In the end, the boys decide to anonymously phone in the location of Ray Brauer's body. The prize of finding the body was not as important as was the prize of self-discovery.The adult Gordie played by Richard Dreyfuss concludes by mentioning how though he hadn't seen Chris in 10 years, he will miss him. And this touches on the American male's general inability to make deep friendships beyond childhood. If we don't keep our childhood friends, we're lucky to have even one who we can be as close with as we were when we were young, vulnerable, and bonded together in confronting life's absurdities. Gordie misses Chris; we miss our childhood friends. A very sentimental movie that is unfortunately timebound. Kudos to the Hollywood Gang for this one!</fullReview>

It's a great movie to watch with friends, family, anyone! and I'd recommend it for home, but especially for the cottage. Anyone who was young, or is young would enjoy this movie.

		<shortDescription>The Most Powerful Movie In The World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never in my life have I seen a film like this. At first it seemed unappealing: four 12-year-old boys going to find a dead body. But by the time I was at the end, I was in tears. This is such a beautiful film. It revolves around Gordie Lachance, a sensitive boy who lost his brother and feels unloved and unappreciated by his dad. So when he hears of the body, he and his three friends, Chris Chambers, Teddy Duchamp and Vern Tessio, embark on a long journey down the train tracks to find it. The one scene that drove me to tears and I can never forget is when Gordie breaks down and cries over how his dad hates him and Chris, played beautifully by River Phoenix (may he rest in peace) is there to support him and make him feel good about himself and to be honest I think this film should have had two Oscars. One for Rob Reiner's superb directing and the other for the powerful and influential performance by River Phoenix.</fullReview>

He and Gordie "took" the movie, they gave the movie the strength it has, and the campfire scene, definitely one of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen. I think this is a movie everybody should see, cause, there's so many things we can learn from the movie.PSI never was a River fan, but after watching this, i got intrigued and interested to see who this boy really was.</fullReview>

I could relate to each and every character in the film. Cracking sound track. Probably the best child actors ever in a movie. What a legend river Pheonix would be today if he was still around. i wish i went on that journey! Even now a certain scene which i wont mention brings a tear to my eye. Not many movies have that effect on me. Stand By Me is a roller-coaster of emotions from start to finish! If you haven't seen this film then you must. Youngsters to fuel their imagination and oldies to rekindle some fond and not so fond memories! enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure nostalgia, just goes to show memories never die...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say about this movie? Before watching it, I thought it'd be one of those 'typical' Hollywood movies. Boy, was I wrong. I am 19 years of age and i'm a very deep thinker. I think deeply into everything. It just makes you wonder whatever happens to your primary school friends etc, but it also reminds us...we will never forget the good old glory days.This film typifies what friendship, true love is all about without being shy or worried. These 4 friends embark on a wonderful adventure across their town. In them days, you don't think about anything. You just do it, and little did they know...'they' were the days.No worrying about money, no bills, no love problems, no depression...just pure bliss. Really does remind me of my childhood. This film is just a masterpiece. Maybe i'm not old enough to truly realise the whole nostalgic experience to it but this movie still makes me sad thinking my childhood has gone and I'm about to hit adulthood. I just wish those days would have lasted forever and I never grew up.This film is brilliant. Just makes you wonder and being truly realistic about it, you will know you can never have friends like you did when you were young. You just won't.Never lose the memories, they're the only things that can keep you going! I can go on and on about this, but don't want to because my heart aches. I would literally give anything to go back to them innocent glorious days.Stand By Me, a masterpiece!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Essential teen movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw Stand by me I was 13 years old and straight away it became my favourite film of all time. The film is magnificent and really captures the true aspect of growing up. The plot is very basic, 4 boys, best friends, go on a journey to find the body of a kid their age; along the way we see them deal with their hardships of growing up and the problems they've encountered throughout their lives. Although there's not too much of a story, the acting from the four friends is absolutely spot on, especially River Phoenix's performance.I recommend the film as a must see especially while growing up as it really is the ultimate "coming of age" movie experience. I could also compare the film to real life the way we deal with friends in our lives and so on so if you haven't yet seen it, do so!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was 16 in 1986, not long older than Chris, Gordie, Teddy and Vern.I remember the long hot summers with months off school, Our gang going on expeditions to the park, canals, the local woods or any one of the places we adventured "all which needed miles of rail track to follow" I first watched Stand by me in 1986 and it was good then, because I watched it with the mates I had when I was twelve. Since then I've seen what a revelation it truly is. This film has more than just a story line, it is now also sadly poignant, relating to River Phoenix. Also it comes from the pen of the genius Stephen King. The novella it came from also contained the Shawshank redemption and Apt Pupil both of which became hit films.A film for anyone who has forgotten their roots, or 12 an over.I was going to give 10/10 but how can you judge this film against others as it so unique. so I give it 100,000,000/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Friends stand by friends, no matter what. No matter what the circumstances or afraid they might be, friends stand by friends. The basis of the film Stand by Me is exactly that.Stand by Me is about four middle school friends who spend all of their time together. But when the chubby lovable one Vern (Jerry O'Connell) says, "Do you guys wanna see a dead body?" Vern then proceeds to inform the group about how he overheard his older brother and a friend discussing the whereabouts of a dead body. Now this dead body was a classmate of the boys and they thought that if they were the ones to find the body, then they would be famous. So the boys set out on an two day adventure to find the body.One of the main characters named Gordie Lachance (Wil Wheaton) is the average, younger brother of the star athlete of the town and feels the scrutiny of the town especially by his father after his brother passes. He feels like he means nothing and is unimportant. But this is where friends step in. His best friend, Chris Chambers (River Phoenix), tells him that he is going to be writer and very famous some day. The bond between these two is unbreakable to the end.Stand by Me is a story based off of the novella The Body by Stephen King and is narrated throughout the duration of the story.Rob Riener directed this film and did an amazing job. He brought out the true emotions of these kids. The young boys also displayed a tremendous acting ability and carried this movie to another level. The viewer could really feel the bond and the love between the boys in this story.Overall, Stand by Me was a fantastic film that should be watched by any adolescent. It is a coming of age film and one of the best of its genre. This film is extremely entertaining and highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time i saw Stand By Me on television [ i was thirteen and still am ] it didn't exactly captivate me, but for some reason i felt the need to rent it because i wasn't sure if i saw the whole thing. The second or third time i watched it i got this strange feeling about it and realized i loved it. I feel the same exact feeling when i watch it to this day. I felt a bit guilty not knowing whether i liked the movie itself or just River Phoenix but i came to find that it is a brilliant film and is also very heart warming. The whole plot was unique and i respect both Stephen King and Rob Reiner for displaying a marvelous and beautiful story to the world. I believe that anyone can enjoy a film so truthful and realistic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Last Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Childhood is a time for learning and experiencing the world for the first time. There are rights of passage that create maturity and wisdom. When a child sticks his finger in an electrical socket, they do not do it again. The same thing occurs when faced with death. It is mysterious and frightening. They will do anything to stay away from it.In Rob Reiner's adaptation of Stephen King's novella "The Body" comes a classic coming of age story. Stand By Me is the story of four adolescent boys who venture out of their small Oregon town in search of a boy who has disappeared and feared dead. Only two people know where he really is. When word reaches these boys, the race is on to find him.The leader of this crew is Chris Chambers (River Phoenix), a strong willed individual who carries a bum rap. Gordie Lachance (Will Wheaton) idolized Chris and everything he does. Gordie has been the "other child" at home since his brother died. The headstrong Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman) is the renegade "wild-man" whose war weary father has made a strong impact on, for better and for worse. The last of this "gang" is Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell), the one who found out about the resting place of the lost boy. Vern is slightly overweight and jittery; the tag-a-long friend.Narrated by an older Gordie (Richard Dreyfuss), now a writer, we see the characters through his eyes essentially, even though it isn't just about Gordie, but all of them. Reiner's casting is superb for all four friends and even the older kids. The leader of the older kids is Ace Merrill (Kiefer Sutherland), a dark and menacing character who strikes fear into the hearts of the four boys. It is his presence that makes the boys more determined than ever to find the body before he does The next two days for these boys is filled with obstacles, both on the tough Oregon landscape and in their troubled minds. It seems like they live their entire childhood and adolescent years in a span shorter than 48 hours. Usually a person experiences certain things one at a time over a long period of time. It seems that no matter where these boys go in life, they will never forget those two days when they were no long children, but men.Reiner's interpretation of King's overall theme from "The Body" is one of the best coming of age pieces in cinema history. These four characters are thrown onto a roller coaster of emotions with no brakes. The only way to get off is to find that boy. There is one scene where the boys have a campfire going and they talk about all sorts of things, like what kind of animal Goofy is. Everyone has had a conversation like that about nothing. The only difference here is that although they may be talking or even singing songs, that boy is the only thing on their minds.The entire cast is magnificent. There are really heavy and emotional scenes and for a child actor to convey such strong emotion on the spot is something else. All of their personal anguish has been thrown aside for someone they don't even know. They're kids, all they want to do is find him and go on the news. Over the course of the movie the boys aren't boys anymore. They're overall tone is more serious and their actions are more mature than what they used to be.The power of this movie isn't just the storyline or the characters, but the ability to have each and every audience member look back on their childhood and say 'hey, we used to sing that song' or 'we used to talk about that'. Stand By Me is in a nutshell a movie about growing up. Even though they can't drive or don't have girlfriends, Chris, Gordie, Teddy, and Vern seem to be all the wiser. Death, however scary it may be, can bring out the best and the worst of us.</fullReview>

My favourite actor in the film was River Phoenix, he was amazing. It was a shame he died really. He could have gone on to great things and become one of the worlds most loved actors. Stand by Me is so realistic that it captures you and draws you in. It is a feel good film even though I wish that Chris didn't die in the film, I thought it was a sad way to finish a fantastic film. I hope in the future that another film will be made that is as good as Stand by Me. But I doubt it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film made me cry when I first saw it because in the end of the movie when Gordie mentioned about friends being separated when they go to different colleges, I watched it as in an English lesson 2 months before I left school (How ironic). I also loved the film because of so many characters you can relate to, River Phoenix's acting should have been Oscar nominated at least and the art direction was perfect. The thing that really got me bang on the nail was that i had a lot of similarities to Gordie (especially his low self esteem) and The irony that River Phoenix's character died and the actor is dead for real.In conclusion, Stand By Me is great film and all teenagers who have recently left school should watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching stand by me many moons ago i was instantly hooked. The warmth and humour of each character is just overwhelming at times and the fact that every kid at the age of twelve has friends that could easily fit into the mould of Gordie and the boys.Each boy has its own foreshadowing story and pulls at the audiences heart strings at times. The acting at the beginning of the film is a little raw which i like and it progresses to where River Pheonix becomes the centre stage especially in the final scenes, when standing up to Sutherland's character. The film is helped greatly to the narration of Richard Dryfuss who's voice is filled with such emotion and love and it gives the film that extra depth. This film gives an insight into friendship perfectly and as i'm just becoming an adult it reminds me of what i will miss about being a youngster, this film to me will only get better as i get older. The film has a awesome soundtrack from a decade of innocence and playfulness. If you haven't seen this film yet, where have you been, its a must see.And if you have seen this movie then you will understand that you have been blessed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shawshank, Pulp Fiction and Stand By Me. Some might say that I'm crazy. Fine, uplifting, powerful pictures like The Shawshank Redemption and intense, explosive, powerful movies like Pulp Fiction aren't even to scale with Stand By Me, but SBM is one of the greatest films when you're an 11 year old boy. I first saw this movie sitting at home on AMC. I was blown away. I loved how it reminded me of the stories my dad used to tell me. Shootin' the sh*t with his best friends, getting into trouble. I loved this movie. For instance some awesome scenes: The story, the leeches and the train. When I thought the boys were about to be annihilated(SP?) by the train, I almost started crying. When Gordie pulled the bloodsucker out, I felt his pain, and when Gordie tells the story, I laughed my buns off. I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve. Jesus, does anyone?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, what can I say? This is probably the most classic coming of age story of all times. All the actors act magnificently, especially the two main characters. Magic and nostalgia as never experienced before. Unique, simply unique. A look into the heart and soul of the youth in the 50s. Thanks to Stephen King for the original artwork. I guess anyone who watches Stand By Me is able to identify with the pre-teen quest for adventure and joy. This movie has had a tremendous impact and opened many eyes for the temporary fascination of discovering yourself and the world around you. Never has there been a better and more genuine cast, never has there been a more nostalgic and enchanting realization of growing up in American movie history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original writing of Stephen king, 'The Body' that was transformed into a screenplay by Raynold Gideon and directed by Rob Reiner is a timeless masterpiece. This is a classic coming of age movie that includes drama and adventure. It is about four young friends; Gordie, Chris, Teddy, and Vern, played by River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, Wil Wheaton, and Jerry O'Connell, who set out to find the body of a missing teenager. Yet, this adventure turned out to be much more than a search for a body, but a search for their personal identities and the true meaning of friendship. What they found out about themselves along the way meant so much more than the teen's dead body.This movie seems to portray the typical relationships young boys have. They tease and torment one another, yet when it really matters they have each other's backs. Their wild expedition is reminiscent of those my friends and I would go on when I was a kid. It seems to be as much about exploring the outside world as much as yourself. It also reveals the fact that friends may come and go throughout a lifetime and the different paths they may take once older. This film is relevant to everyone no matter what age, race, or gender. It is extremely worthy of its Academy Award nomination.</fullReview>

I was one of the middle grandchildren for my grandparents, and had a lot of cousins that were substantially older than me, so I did a lot of looking up towards them. Seeing this movie put a lot of things into perspective for me, and looking back on it, it was almost a time when things were much more simple.

		<fullReview>I personally think that "Stand by Me" is such a powerful novel. It really shows the friendship that these four kids had, because now days you really do not get to see kids that age be so close together and caring for each other the way they did. No matter the situation that they would go through, they would always be there for each other. Specially between Gordie and Chris, their bond is very respectful, you see it and it really touches you, they can cry, laugh, be angry etc. and they are not ashamed of it. Everyone did such a great job on putting everything together and making this movie the best oldie. You can not forget about the "bad ones" the wielding hoods, I do not think that anyone else would have done it as good as them, they really did make you listen and that was their job.</fullReview>

This film really does make you want to go back a little bit and be 12 again. I would love to go on an adventure such as this one. My favorite part was probably when they are on the really long bridge and Gordie and Vern are running from the train. There is one thing that I don't understand though. They never talk about Vern's family. Every one else has a really bad relation ship with their dad. Stand By Me truly is one of the best movies, and it seems to have moved everyone in the same way. I have had my friends watch it, and they all feel the same.</fullReview>

This movie is well written, has excellent character actors and is one of my favorite movies. "The Body" is an excellent novella which if you enjoy the film as much as I did, I highly recommend reading it. The transportation of 4 childhood friends from innocence to realizing what happens in the rest of the world is wonderfully captured in this movie. The actors used for the parts were almost as I imagined them whilst reading the novella. Overall if you want to see an excellent film, watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stand by Me is a spectacular movie, indeed. Of course, I was born in 1979 and I remember going to see this at the movie theatres when I was 7 with my dad which my mom wouldn't let me see a R film at all, but I still remember seeing it. I enjoyed watching this movie through the years. It's excellent for teenagers and adults like me. It's actually funny too, Jerry O' Connell was hysterical as the little and nervous fat kid who tries to be very tough and strong. The only kid that brought the movie down was that Gordie kid. He should've not of been in the movie. He was weird and I didn't like him at all. But still a very good movie and I'm trying to buy it on DVD.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely one of my favorites. Even though I grew up in a different time period, I could easily identify with those boys in the film. I find the film truly moving; I'm a man in my 40's, and I've cried in only six movies my entire life, and this one certainly got to me! One of the reasons isn't so much the death of one of the main boys, but because it made me long for that "simpler time" in my own life, and lamenting that yes, no one has friends like they had when they were 12. Or as another writer so aptly put it, "You can't go home again." Maybe not, but "Stand By Me" is the closest you'll come. Another thing I noticed is that, in my opinion, most of Stephen King's works rarely translate well to the screen. This one and "Shawshank Redemption" are probably the the BEST TWO, and they're not even horror stories. Watch them both!</fullReview>

My favourite part in the movie is when Chris Chambers(RP) is breaking down crying his eyes out because of the teacher stealing back the lunch money he was going to return that part just makes you feel that it has happen to you, Gordie Lachance(WW) being the perfect person to tell your feelings too. Excellent. I rate this movie 10/10 its the best movie ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that every guy should watch...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... I do not know what to say My best friend died two years ago and my grief continues.This movie is older than me, I was born in 1987. I bought it in the video store a week ago. As the movie began with the old Gordie sitting in his jeep with the newspaper beside him while two friends passed him by in bicycles, I shed a tear already... my first tear for two years. I need not to further express how this movie touched, or rather, moved me. I believe that this movie shows us who we were years back. It shows the times were genuine friendship linger. Indeed as Gordie told us, we could never have friends like those we had when we were young. Every guy should watch this movie. I believe that this is the first ever "guy-flick", a movie for male audiences that has a heart and content,with no porn. Guys like me can shed a tear without loosing our masculinity while watching this movie. The bond between Gordie and Chris reminds me of the friendship me and my best bud had. the scene where Chris talks to Gordie about junior high and his possible career in writing is my favorite. This movie my second most favorite movie of all time (next to Beauty and the Beast and before A Beautiful Mind), a week has passed by since I bought a copy and I had watched it 10 times. And every time I watch it, I shed a tear and I sing "Stand by Me at the end"....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True reflection of 12yr old relationships</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is in my opinion one of the greatest movies adapted from a book to portray the emotions and camaradery of 4 twelve year old boys. I think most if not all men can reflect on their adolescence and identify with all of the boys. Every man knows and can compare each of the boys in the movie with their friends from that age. The story is timeless. Setting the picture in the late 1950's seems so fitting as the issues dealt with in the movie would have seemed so taboo in those ages. It portrays the journey every boy makes to become a man symbolically in near perfect fashion. Although the boys who acted in this movie were very young their roles were played beautifully. This is a must see movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love this Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie, much to my surprise is based on a Stephen King short story(when i found this out several years ago) This work of art begins with a man in his jeep in a field in deep thought about a friend he found out had died. this leads to thinking of one summer on the 60's where he and 3 friends went on a trip to see a dead body and ended up taking a life changing adventure in which they learn more of themselves and their friends. I love this movie and it touches me for a reason I can't think of the words to describe. I find myself sad at the end, because the movie ends. The acting is great, the directing is great. If your looking for a different type of movie see this one, If it has any wheres near the same effect as it had on me you may find your self changed</fullReview>

I was very surprised and utterly delighted at how good of a job well done the production team had accomplished.Stephen King has always been a favorite of mine. I like his dramatic pieces much better than any of his horror stories. I was glad to see that his story "The Body" was made into a movie. He pumps out orignial stories that dazzle. Don't miss any of his work.In terms of direction, this movie couldn't have been done better. Rob Reiner has a flair for directing. He works well with children, which helped in this case. Doing this movie was a challenge for Mr. Reiner (as said in his commentary). He took a fabulous story that was something dear to him and put it on the screen, and that takes intelligence. There is no doubt in my mind that Rob Reiner had what it takes.As far as acting goes, I couldn't have asked for anything better. This being Jerry O'Connel's first film role, I would have to say he did superb. The late River Phoenix is a phenomenon of an actor and there is no doubt that this was a pinnacle of his acting career. Corey Feldman, as always, delivers an interesting yet entertaining interpretation of his character. Wil Wheaton does an excellent job carrying the torch as the protagonist. Kiefer Sutherland is not without his usual spark in his craft. An amazing performance by all actors.Don't shrug this movie off. Go out and rent it or even buy it. The hour and a half you spend watching it is one you won't regret. Watch this with your friends, you would be surprised at how many refrences you can make in your own experiences with this movie.

		<shortDescription>Teenage dreams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two Steven King stories in my top ten films of all time. The Body (Stand by me) is one and the other is Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption (The Shawshank redemption). That these two films are up there is credit not only to King but to the people who brought them to the screen.Initially it is a shock to realise that Stand by me is a King story...but as you go through it.. you realise just how diverse a writer he is. OK so there is horror (the leeches) but it only takes up a small percentage of what is very much a sweet natured coming of age story. Four boys on a quest (each with their own stories to tell)..it couldn't be simpler...but the intense characterisation that the screenwriter and actors (hold your head high messers Corey Feldman and River Pheonix..plus the rest)give, is so bold that you come to care for the boys and understand the underlying reasons for their quest. The only bad area for me was that Keifer Sutherland seemed to be repeating his bay boy act from "The lost boys" (also look out for an affecting cameo from John Cusack).It also has one of the best last lines in a film ever.All in all this is a great film handled with a light directorial touch...that will strike a cord with anyone who was 12.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Rob Reiner Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On my list of my all-time 50 favorite movies, there is only one director ever who has four films in the 50. It is Rob Reiner. The other three in my "Top 50" are "Misery", "When Harry Met Sally", and "This is Spinal Tap".It's kind of funny because when I was a kid in the late 70's, I grew up watching "All in the Family" and enjoyed Rob's great character "Meathead". Also another funny thing is I'm like the character he played! I'm a Democratic liberal! Not that there is anything wrong with that (to the contrary).Anyway, this film features great performances by all, particularly River Phoenix and Wil Weaton. My favorite scene is a tie between the "Fat Kid" story scene and the dodging the train scene. The film also includes great songs by Buddy Holly and others, and the memorable title song by Ben E. King.Also honorable mention goes to Keifer Sutherland for playing a great hood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best coming of age dramas ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taken from the collection of Short Stories , entitled "Different Seasons",by Stephen King, Stand by Me, or the Body, as is the name of the Novella, is a remarkable story of youth and the problems and fun a childhood holds. Director Rob Reiner has taken this story and adapted it remarkably well. Stephen King's writings do not always translate well to film, one only has to look at some of the horror novels which have become films for proof of this. It seems that King's drama lends itself to film far better than horror. If you want further proof of this, see the Shawshank Redemption, which came from the same collection.The Film stars Wil Wheaton, the late River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, and Jerry O'Connell, with Kiefer Sutherland and Richard Dreyfuss co starring. Set in the 1950's in Castle Rock (where most Stephen King stories seem to be set) the film is probably one of the finest Coming of Age drama's ever made. With Wheaton playing sensitive Gordie LaChance, supported by River Phoenix, in a mature and remarkably self assured performance, this film has set a standard for this genre of films.Four boys set of in search of a corpse, and we follow their journey, their arguments, fears and frustration, as they travel in search of the body of Ray Brower, a teenager who was killed by a train earlier that year. Smoking and swearing as all good young men do, their journey is an eventful one, although maintains a good sense of balance. Wheaton and Phoenix by far and away outshine the rest of the cast, although this is not to say that their performances are weak.Perhaps the main criticism of the film is the amount of swearing, somewhat anachronistic for the time the film is set, although this is a minor quibble.Narrated by Richard Dreyfuss (an elder version of Gordie) the film comes together well, and holds its own as being one of the highest quality coming of age dramas ever made.A fine musical score acompanies the film, and the direction is faultless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Rating:***1/2 out of ****. Stand By Me was a movie I saw when I was younger and I thought it was Very Good. I still think the same about it. It is a story about youth and the adventures we have when were young.Stand By Me mostly works because of the four strong performances by the young actors. Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Connell, and River Phoenix. My favorite performance of those four is River Phoenix, his Chris is a trouble maker but he is loyal to his friends and has a leadership quality about him. Kiefer Sutherland does a solid job in an earlier role. The rest of the cast is also solid. Rob Reiner does a fine job directing the film. The film is very well written. Stand By Me is a very good movie, and while it probably wouldnt make my favorites list, it is definitely worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In some respects, you could call this an antithesis to Good Will Hunting, but it is far deeper than what Damon and Affleck created. Rob Reiner never got better than this, only A Few Good Men came close to his elaboration here.Stephen King is one of modern America's better authors, even better than Mary Higgins Clark (now I've done it) because he knows subtext unlike such junk writers as Tom Clancy and John Grisham. Rob Reiner taps into King's genius and creates a film that is both memorable and understanding of its topic.Coming of age and self-discovery are tough topics to understand and even harder to present. Reiner is not the most artistically sound director, but he uses the camera here to trade in for the emotional impact the four boys suffer in their journey. While their interaction isn't the greatest when describing their personal lives, the script is loaded with enough dialog reminiscent of sixth grade conversations.Some general shortcomings include the use of the bullies. They really aren't needed, the same conclusions reached by the end could have been done with alternative means or symbolism. There is a degree of aloofness that distances the audience at times, but Reiner knows how to control our emotions. Overall, a well made film worth watching for the post-adolescent. In a world where creativity is becoming tied to political affiliation, I am proud to accept this film. Thankfully, it doesn't waste time being preachy. 4 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Friendship Defined</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSWhen someone watches a film, if that film is any good, it'll inspire an emotion in the person and it'll get them to associate, at least in some small way, if the plot can be related to them. "Stand By Me" does this in immense ammounts.In this film, four young 12 year old boys (played majestically by Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell ..... how come the only one of those to not seem to have done anything since is Feldman? Maybe I'm mistaken, but I've seen nothing else with him in), travel on a journey to see a dead body. Throughout our lives, we seem to be obsessed and inquisitive about death and these boys are no different. They travel, experiencing all sorts of adventures (including trains and leaches) and bond with each other in that special way that a lot of us seem to do when we're younger. The adventure is told by Wheaton's now grown up self (played by Richard Dreyfuss) and provides heart ache, a little humour and adventure in one huge bundle.In "Stand By Me" the script is brilliantly written, the young boys are excellent as themselves (especially the late River Phoenix, who I confess to never fully appreciating until this moment) and the film itself has a soundtrack to die for.To summarise, "Stand By Me" is a heartwarming tale which warms the heart and stirs the emotions. This film is a must see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, sweet, dramatic, exciting, touching..I could go on and on.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favourite movies of all time, I could seriously watch this movie over and over again forever and not grow tired of it.** WARNING SOME SPOILERS **The basic premise of this movie is four twelve year old boys going on a two-day trek to locate the body of a kid about their age called Ray Brower. On the way there the boys run into all kinds of obstacles and ultimately learn the importance and strength of their friendship.The four boys are Gordie Lachance (Wil Wheaton), Chris Chambers (River Phoenix), Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman) and Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell). Gordie is the thinker of the group, he's sensitive and smart and is always coming up with a good story or comeback. Chris is the leader of the group, he's tough but he's also the peacemaker. Chris and Gordie are best friends. Teddy is the crazy member of the group, he's always doing crazy dares and is obsessed with the military. Vern is the sweet, kind of chubby kid who the other guys pick on. The four of them together have wonderful chemistry and the acting from each boy is AMAZING. The film kind of rests on the performances of Wheaton and Phoenix and it suceeds largely due to them. The friendship between Gordie and Chris is wonderful and their scenes together are always sweet and honest. I love each and every scene in this movie but in particular I love the scene where Chris shows Gordie the gun and the scenes where Gordie and Chris comfort each other at the campfire and later by Brower's body.My favourite character in this movie, although it's very close, is Gordie Lachance. Gordie is such a sweetie and I find myself empathizing with him the whole way. Gordie often seems to have the worst of it, whether running from a junkyard dog or a train or having to extract a leech from the worst possible place. Chris is my second favourite then Vern and Teddy.The supporting cast is brilliant too, especially Kiefer Sutherland as the menacing hood Ace Merrill. It's weird to watch him in 24 after seeing him play such a different kind of character in Stand By Me. John Cusack also works well in a few short but important scenes as Gordie's recently deceased brother Denny. I thought the scenes between Gordie and Denny were very sweet and also sad considering what happens later. Gordie has always been in his brother's shadow but his brother had also been his close friend and only ally in his house as his parents seem largely unaware of his existence. I was also struck by how much Wheaton and Cusack look like each other, that's some good casting.I could talk about this film forever but mostly I just want to say that this is the BEST SUMMER MOVIE EVER. Everyone should see this movie for the story, the script and the wonderful performances by Wheaton, Phoenix, Feldman and O'Connell. This movie has some of the best lines in any movie I've seen. It's surprising how funny this movie can be at times and how sad and poignant it is at other times.I will love this movie forever, even if it makes me sad at the end due to River Phoenix's tragic early death. I urge everyone to see this movie.10/10 absolutely PERFECT.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just have to say that this movie was and will always be a great movie. Anyone and everyone should see this movie. Even though it is rated R (the only reason would be for language and young kids smoking). Will Wheaten(Gordie), River Phoenix(Chris),Corey Feldman(Teddy) and Jerry O'Connell(Vern) play the four boys who go out on an adventure to find the missing body of a boy. They wish that if they find him they would be sort of famous and looked up at. But as those 4 look for the body, so does the violent teen gang led by Kiefer Sutherland(Ace). In the end it works out. The acting was great! Will and River were excellent as best friends and of course Corey and Jerry played there parts very well. Kiefer was perfect as a gang leader. The perfect movie to learn from and just to love to have in your home!!!!!!!LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie on the Disney channel when I was 11 years old. I was freaked out by the dead boy's body. I have never fogotten that movie. Years later, I picked up this movie to see it again with new eyes and to see it again for River Pheonix. When I was 11, I didn't know who this kid was in the movie. River plays Chris Chambers, probably the most interesting character next to DuChamp's and Ace's. River plays this character well, and so do all of the other actors in their roles. This movie is a classic with little flaws. I love it. See this movie for great drama, characters, jokes, and River Pheonix.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My all time favorite movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Growing up, this was the "family movie" in my house. Meaning, it was a movie I grew up watching over and over again. As I grew older I was able to learn more from it, and this movie transcends so much about life, and about friendship, that the full impact it had on me cannot be realized until now, as I sit here as an adult.No other movie has ever been so honest about the importance of friendship, and the reality of "drifting apart" and the ever present vulnerability of mortality that everyone endures in real life.This is a coming of age movie that defines the genre in my opinion.4 best friends leave on an innocent boyhood quest to achieve heroism, and at least 2 of the boys (Gordon and Chris) learn much about life through eachother and their friends (Vern and Teddy) that they return without their innocence, and see the world around them as much more mature individuals.If you haven't seen this movie, you have been robbed of one of the greatest stories ever told.By far my favorite movie of all time.10/10"7 cents vern?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The outstanding element in "Stand by Me" is the abundantly talented youthful cast.All roles are effectively executed, especially the quartet of kids on their trek along the backwoods of a small Oregon town. Rob Reiner's direction is likewise good, and even small parts are covered by well known actors. A catchy theme song and sharp color photography add to the film's impact. Like many odyssey stories, some liabilities are inherently built into the format, namely, having to constantly invent obstacles along the way to keep dramatic tension alive. These here become somewhat predictable and even tedious, marring otherwise fine story telling. However, the youngsters, headed by River Phoenix and Cory Feldman, certainly are more than adequate, and create an impressive portrait of small town characters. Obviously the film connected with audiences, which responded to this adolescent yarn originally penned by novelist Stephen King.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sorry I ever forgot this movie....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After recently seeing this movie on HBO, I remembered how much I used to love it, I'm sad I ever forgot it. Stand by me is a coming of age story about 4 best friends on a quest to find the body of a dead boy hit by a train. This movie based on the novela "the body" by Steven King, is actualyl pretty faithful to the book and proves you never have friends like those at age 12. The chemistry between the 4 boys is what makes the movie so great they all get along like they're actual best friends, making the plot even more believable. This is a classic movie of the 80's and I reccomend it to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent coming of age movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm absolutely in love with this movie. It is possibly one of the best movies of all time, and will certainly be remembered for years to come. The plot line of this movie is so simple, yet so intriging. The end of the movie leaves you begging for more.To start, the acting in this movie is awesome. Gordie is portrayed by a thirteen year old Wil Wheaton, who is an excellent actor. He portrayed such a strong character that was going through tough times. Jerry O'Connell's character Vern is the fat kid, but has his own strengths and ideas. Teddy is the kid that almost got his entire ear burnt of by his father. Corey Feldman was awesome in this movie (not to mention when he strips, drools). And last but certainly not least is River Phoenix. He is so believable in this part. I cried when he cried. River was such a strong actor, it was incredibly sad when he died. His character Chris is a kid that smokes and has family problems, yet he overcomes them to become a Lawyer.***SPOILER ALERT*** The end of this movie really cofused me. I wasn't sure if Chris and Gordie has something going on as in "I'll see ya." "Not if I see you first." I don't know, I wish it would have made more scence at the end. Oh well. And when Chris died, jeez that was hard.This movie was so sweet, I couldn't wait to watch it again. I reccomend this movie to anyone who loves coming of age movies. I give it a **** out of **** stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfect Movie . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I teach this movie to an enrichment class of middle-schoolers. The R rating is undeserved. Despite "language," etc., there is so much kids can learn from watching this film . . . and the kids I've taught always love it. Below is my review of the movie:In Stand By Me, director Rob Reiner follows four boys on a journey to manhood in Castle Rock, Oregon in the early 1960's. Every step they take on a 20-mile hike to find the dead body of a missing boy brings them ? and the audience ? to a bittersweet understanding of the importance of one's friends in that important moment when you know childhood is ending. The four ? Chris, Gordie, Vern, and Teddy ? are losers by Castle Rock standards. Chris is the younger brother of a local juvenile delinquent and everyone expects he will follow the same sorry path. Teddy's father, a World War II vet, abused him. Vern is, well, fat and dumb, a nowhere kid. As for Gordie, he has smarts, but after the death of his football hero older brother a few months earlier, his parents have no emotion left to spend on their one surviving son. When Vern overhears that his brother, another hoodlum, knows where the body of a missing boy can be found, the boys set out to find the body and ? they hope ? become heroes. But the long trek on the railroad tracks brings other adventures to test them and, more importantly, their connection to each other. At the same time, a gang led by a sneering bully named Ace (Kiefer Sutherland) also decides to find the body and gain glory. Stand By Me puts the boys and the gang on a collision course. What elevates the movie is the tight bond between Chris (River Phoenix) and Gordie (Wil Wheaton). Gordie doesn't belong in this group of born losers. He's smart (he has a talent for writing), and his parents seem normal, even though they are in shock because of older brother Denny's death. Chris too has more promise than Castle Rock prejudice allows him to develop. He is thoughtful, a natural leader, but the town views him as another bad Chambers boy. The movie pivots on the way Gordie's need to get past his parents' rejection of him and Chris' resigned acceptance of his fate becomes a turning point for the two of them. The screenplay establishes the importance of their quest by presenting it in a flashback narrated by the grown-up Gordie reacting to the news that Chris, a local attorney, was killed trying to prevent a robbery at a fast food joint. The older Gordie's memories of that two-day adventure focus attention on its importance in shaping the direction their two lives would take. For Gordie, what happens with his friends on their trip, and especially its outcome, jolted him ? at age 12 ? into maturity. And for his best friend Chris, what the four confront and overcome gives him the courage to get out of the dead-end rut everybody in Castle Rock is pushing him into. Released in 1986, Stand By Me got an R rating mainly for language and scenes showing kids smoking. Younger viewers won't see or hear anything they haven't heard in the schoolyard, and might appreciate the chance to connect with four characters who aren't much different from themselves. Grownups can relate to the backward look at the importance of friendship at that critical moment when a boy starts to become a man. Yet this is a movie girls can enjoy too; it opens a window on a piece of boy life which is usually closed to them. The friends we had when we were 12 are different from the ones we make later on. With luck, they were there for us when we were least sure of who we were, where we were going. Over time, they may fall away, becoming ? like Chris, Vern, and Teddy for Gordie ? guys we pass in the high school hall on our way somewhere else. But moments like the ones captured in Stand By Me crystallize us. Memory can always recapture, often sadly, the way they shine. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dynamic horizon of friendship, loss and memory!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This really does atone for all the films that attempt to compress ideas of friendship, loss, bitterness and isolation together, because no film does it like Stand By Me. This film, although made in 1986 (i say this because of the amazing enhancements in technology in the past decade)chills me, and i cannot help taking a moment after the film's completion to regain a sense of bliss about the world. Because Stand By Me poses many questions about one's self- Who really are my mates? Are they worth living for? Are they worth dying for? And as River Phoenix portrays (brilliant actor) some things in the world are worth risking for, as his character fades into the winds of memory. I cannot help feel a sense of bereavement for River, seven years after the film, his character really does evaporate and it will be ten years this october (2003) since his death. Facing the dawn of youth, this film about four inquisitive kids grasps the inspiration they find in each other to carry on and live for each other- no matter what their parents think of them, they have three other mates that will make them laugh when things are bad, revamp their spirit when all is lost and make them cry because these times cannot last forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing negative about this movie...it's as close to cinematic perfection as they get.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon reading others' reviews, I was happy to see so many positives, but I have to say, I was a bit surprised by some of the negatives. Don't get me wrong, a person is more than entitled to not like a movie...I have no problem with that. But some of the reasons given made very little sense:Bad Acting: I honestly don't know how any person who has seen this movie could make that claim. Every character -from sensitive Gordie, to troubled Teddy, slightly "out of touch" Vern and bad reputation, but peace-making good friend Chris- ALL of them were believable in every way. One thing that struck me about this movie was the incredibly FANTASTIC acting...especially from a group of kids, most of whom were unknown at the time.Unoriginal: This comment made because movies that followed were like Stand By Me. Now that made the least amount of sense. Why is a movie bad and considered unoriginal because movies that came AFTER copied it? Hmmm, "Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery" is it not? And no other movie that tried to follow the "formula" of Stand By Me was able to achieve what this movie did.Wasn't as good as Shawshank: Comparing apples and oranges here. Heck, this isn't even comparing the same FRUIT...other than they're both adapted from Stephen King's works. Aside from that, they are entirely different movies with incredibly different plots and, furthermore, are created by different directors. Not to mention Stand By Me was made 8 years prior...and given the changes in film-making abilities, it's quite amazing how Stand By Me is still visually beautiful without the typical "80's movie feel".Honestly, Stand By Me is a fantastic movie about a time when life is *supposed* to be simpler...while in reality, it rarely ever is "simple". And while adults are struggling with their own demons (Gordie's parents grieving over Denny, Teddy's dad with his psychological problems, and Chris' abusive father), the kids are left to handle their issues on their own; relying only on each other and the friendship they share. It's raw, emotional, and real; while at the same time evoking that sense of childhood nostalgia of care-free summer days spent hanging out with our buddies.Although the plot is described as four friends out to find the body of a dead boy, it really is the exploration of the close-knit friendships of childhood and the acceptance you find within them. Furthermore, it's a journey into self awareness...especially for Chris and Gordie. All of this beautifully portrayed by the young cast.I HIGHLY recommend this movie to anyone...it is absolutely incredible. A SOLID 10 out of 10 stars!</fullReview>

While parts of the story are intense trust me you can leave your teens to watch this,,and they might actually learn something about the world or themselves.Also, I saw a comment about how these kids couldn't act, NOTHING could be farther from the truth I'm sure 95% of the people who saw this movie would have a seizure if they saw that comment. This is probably some of the best acting you'll ever see from kids of this age. A brain tumor is the only possible answer to his observation.Labyrinth,The Princess Bride,The Sandlot,Goonies this movie is right in there, one of the classic movies for any age</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favourite films of all time. This story of a loss of innocence and childhood memories that will live forever is moving, funny and at some points scary. Thats one of the things i love about this film- whilst it shows the tougher side of growing up -(losing loved ones, coping with abuse) it has some very funny moments. This is what makes it so effective- life isnt always doom and gloom when you're a child and the film reflects this. The performances are uniformly excellent, from the 4 superb leads -(in particular the late River Phoenix) to Kiefer Sutherland as a violent teenage bully.**SPOILERS** The fact that Chris is later killed as an adult is made even more tragic by the too-early death of the talented and beautiful River Phoenix. Having read the short story "The Body" that this film is based on, i can say that this is a good adaptation, with some minor changes. This a brilliant coming of age film, with amazing performances and beautiful photography. Don't miss</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stand by Me is relatively simple in terms of the way its shot and its storyline, yet it is an extremely powerful film. I personally don't like to over-analyse films and try to understand all the ins and outs of every detail. But where Stand by Me is concerned I simply enjoyed it very much. I feel that this film is good because it made me look back fondly to times I've spent with friends, certain things we did, certain things we said etc.I can't directly relate to every aspect of the film and the journey it follows, because its set in America, before I was even born for example. But that is one reason why its so good. For me anyway as a boy I experienced relationships and issues a lot like those in stand by Me, watching the film allowed me to enjoy those memories and also share the character's. It is nice when a film allows you to simply enjoy it without needing to analyse certain aspects or points. Stand by Me holds a place in my collection as a film that i will watch time and time again if not for the fact its purely a good solid film but because it created an emotion in me I enjoyed which is that of nostalgia, it records a time in life that a majority of people have experienced and enjoyed. Its that simple!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie That Inspires and Reflects at the same time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie on local TV when I was thirteen, going on fourteen in 1991. Big mistake for me, since the film was edited. I bought on DVD and watched it again. Priceless.Actor/director Rob Reiner takes Stephen King's novella "The Body" and makes it a sweet, nostaglic masterpiece. Four 12-year-old boys go on a two-day trek to find the body of a dead kid to be famous. Instead, they grow up. The performances are memorable and easy to relate to. Wil Wheaton's Gordie is a boy struggling to find his place in the world while dealing with the recent death of his brother (a very young John Cusack); the late River Phoenix's Chris is a hard kid who wants nothing to do with his white trash roots and helps Gordie not to fall the pit of going nowhere. Corey Feldman's Teddy is a mercurial soul, having fantasies of war in order to please his father, a WW2 vet committed to an asylum for nearly burning his left ear off and Jerry O' Connell's Vern is an lovable coward who reminds me of Curley from "The Three Stooges". Don't forget Kiefer Sutherland's performance as Ace, a hard bully to end all hard bullies. I can see why he was picked as Jack Bauer on the hit TV show, "24".What gives the film its soul is Wheaton and Phoenix. I like the former's performance because he reminds me of me, an awkward kid who's anemic in his father's eyes. It (and the film) inspired me to be a writer, and I'm grateful for that. As for Phoenix, not only his performance as Chris was powerful (he should have been nominated for his confession scene about stealing the milk money), his unfortunate death mirrors the character's demise, making the film haunting and brilliant at the same time.Some (like Leonard Maltin) complain that the use of profanity dulls the film because profane words were largely taboo in the 1950s, yet the characters are middle-lower class (like King was before he was famous) and deserve to be honest (See the "Porky's" trilogy and "LA Confidential).Buy, not rent, this movie and watch. And reflect on your childhood. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Isn't it nice when you see a sentimental,feel-good movie.Not a cheesy film,as there are a lot of them around,and it is often easy to mistake one for the other.There are many levels of cheese in Hollywood,and somewhere underneath all of them is Stand by me. The film boasts a hand full of young talents,all of which have later on made other successes in film or television (Wil Wheaton-Star Trek).There are also some slightly older faces such as John Cusack,the insane Keifer Sutherland,and as if they weren't enough,you've got Richard Dreyfuss thrown in as well! The film tells the story of the ups and downs of a two day trip,taken by a group of friends,to find the body of a missing boy.The boys each have their own personal turmoils,taking off the sickly sweet everything-goes-right edge this film could have adopted.Instead,we are treated to heart-warming performances,with a sprinkle of comedy,and killer lines such as "Suck my fat one,you cheap dime-store hood". This is a wonderful film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"stand by me" shows that children are more than capable of understanding, feeling and participating in previously described "adult concepts".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Modern "coming of age" Dramas seem to display notions of people under 15 years of age being innocents, free from corruption and unaware of tensions between associates of different sexes. Then along comes a catalyst in the shape of going to high school, making a new friend etc. and all of a sudden a child becomes an adolescent, free from illusions and aware of adult issues. Usually the "coming of age" drama is focused around these issues; of first noticing the opposite sex, of the discovery of a "generation gap" between the subject/s and their parents/guardians, of the discovery of swearing and drinking and occasionally drugs. The thing I liked about this movie is that it highlights the fact that awareness of these issues does not come exclusively with puberty. The characters in this movie smoke, swear, tell dirty jokes, discuss sex, and hate their parents all before hitting their "Teens". It shows that it is naive to assume that it takes 15 years for a child to realise that there is a "generation gap" existing in their household. It also displays an underlying concept that many children are capable of acheiving personal skills that many adults are incapable of; that is the ability to make decisions and stick to them, the ability to lead a group, the ability to take care of themselves, and the ability to problem solve within a group. This concept, that many children depend on their parents for economic support more than emotional support is an edgy one and one that forces veiwers to redefine their mental image of the "child".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've never before seen a movie that so powerfully stirred my emotions!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read the book Different Seasons (i think that's what its called) by Stephen King and The Body was one of the 4 short stories in it. When I realized that Stand By Me was the movie version of this Stephen King masterpiece I was astounded. Never before have I seen such a great adaption of one of Stephen Kings books. It's one of those great stories about boys on an adventure. This movie displays humor, drama, thrill, and a small dab of creepyness knowing that what the boys are looking for is a dead body. The acting was brilliant. Rob Reiner did an excellent job of casting the characters. River Phoenix's portrayl of a mentally beaten child with depth and incredible caused me to go into a year long obsession with him, learning of his life and death. Wil Wheaton was very sensetive throughout the whole thing and if i didn't know better, i'd say he was naturally like that. Jerry O'connell is a lil goof ball that you have to laugh at throughout the movie and Corey Feldman is just crazy (but in a good way). Kiefer Sutherland's character, Ace, was so different from himself. He's so softspoken and his character was a mean nasty bully, i thought it must have been a diffucult task for him to pull off that character but he did it! I was a little dissapointed that John Cusack had a small part because he's one of my favorite people ever (next to Jim Carrey and River Phoenix)and he's an awesome actor. Stand By Me is a movie to last the ages. My dad watched it, my 22 year old sister used to watch it, and now, being 15, I've been watching it practially every day since I was 13. Although it displays a moderate amount of vulgarity, it's all in fun and Stephen King did an excellent job of portraying just how boys would act in that particular situation.I think I might just be a better person having watching this movie and experiencing something so captivating. The only thing better than this movie would be having River Phoenix alive today to watch his extreme potential blossom even more than when he left this earth. No matter, him and this movie will echo in time forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a beautiful, moving film. Wil Wheaton delivers an innocent and emotional performance, while River Phoenix acts as the tough kid, protecting Wil, suberbly. The story is a sad yet uplifting one, and a melancholy rendition of Ben E King's song Stand By Me, washes over the film. All in all I would thoroughly recommend this movie to those who enjoy tales of friendship, suspense and possibly a good cry. Watch out for Kiefer Sutherland, too, as 'Ace' the vicious gang leader of a group of thugs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stand by Me is a wonderful adaptation of a Stephen King novella. Being an avid King reader, I am very hard on movies based on his novels. Frankly, there's like 7 or 8 good ones out of 40. Stand by Me may be the best.It is wonderfully adapted, and superbly directed by Rob Reiner, one of the best directors around - but what brings this movie to life on the screen is the strength of the child actors.Wil Wheaton plays the central character Gordie LaChance, whom is trying to deal with the death of his older brother (a very young John Cusack - only seen in flashback) and the subsequent effect it has had on his family. His parents have not recovered and pretty much ignore his existence. Gordie journeys with his friends to see a dead body and discovers things about himself, and his friends. It is a very strong performance from Wheaton - easily the best in his career. River Phoenix is exceptional as Chris Chambers, the leader of the quartet of friends. It is a damn shame that River OD'd do early in life, because this guy had talent that was off the charts. Chris is the character that Gordie looks up to and strives to be. Chris is the one that realizes how smart and gifted Gordie is, and tries to make Gordie understand this fact. A fine performance indeed.An unrecognizeable Jerry O'Connell plays Vern Tessio - the whipping boy of the group. He is overweight, and scared most of the time, and endures endless jabs from his friends. O'Connell does a wonderful job being that kid everyone knew - the kid who it was easy to pick on. Its amazing the person that O'Connell has evolved into. But the real shining performance in this movie comes from Corey Feldman as the tortured Teddy DuChamp. Teddy comes from a broken home, where his dad abuses him. He is the wild card of the bunch. His dad treats him like hell and he still sticks up for him. Teddy tries to be the toughest of the group but even he looks up to Chris. Feldman's performance is so amazing to me in this movie - I really thing a supporting actor Oscar nomination shouldn't have been out of the question. Feldman rolls funny, scared, crazy, brave, caring, mean, mature and immature all into one memorable character. Man, I wish someone would give Feldman a decent shot at a reputable movie today - I really think this guy has got talent in him. I refuse to believe he peaked before puberty - but alas, such is the case with a lot of child actors.Also look for a memorable turn from a young and very blonde Kiefer Sutherland (who was the best actor on tv in 2001-2002 as Jack Bauer in "24") as Ace Merrill - the villainous older kid that constantly torments the four boys on their quest to see the body. It's great to see where Sutherland's villanous persona that he's so famous for start. Just a timeless movie that never seems to be dated. I watch this movie today and think it could happen now. Also listen for "Jesus, you're right, what the hell is goofy" - a line that still kills me today.rating - 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to school in a small, Oklahoma town, population 300. Stand By Me WAS parts of my life there. The kids I hung out with were the outcasts, like me. I was about the size of Will Wheaton and treated about the same because I wrote stories and liked to act and paint. We hopped freight trains to the next town then hitch-hiked home. We talked about the same things as these kids. And, we eventually went our separate ways. Watching River Phoenix in this makes me very angry that he choose to ruin his life and destroy that incredible talent. I don't know why people are looking for a 'thriller' when they watch this. If you've really read Stephen King, then you know he's about more than horror. This movie teaches more about true friendship among kids than any movie I know. Parents SHOULD let their kids watch it...language and all. Anyone who still believes kids don't know and use these words is living in the Victorian Era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most classic films of all time. I don't know a single person who hasn't seen this film. And if I should ever come across one, I will generously let them borrow my copy so that they may have the great pleasure of seeing it. Based on the same Stephen King story collection that later gave rise to THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. One of those great 'feel-good' movies. This one really does it, though.Other recommendations would be THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, THE GREEN MILE, THE MAJESTIC, HEARTS IN ATLANTIS, THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE and OCTOBER SKY. All of them have that great thing to them that makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Some people may like this feeling, others not. But, almost every person that I know has seen STAND BY ME and has enjoyed it immensely. Thank you Rob Reiner. The cast includes many great actors (only younger) such as Wil Wheaton (PYTHON), Jerry O'Connel (SCREAM 2), a much younger Keifer Sutherland (A FEW GOOD MEN) and the late River Phoenix. If you want a great movie that will touch your heart and stay with you forever, then see this one. "I wouldn't have missed a minute of it. Not for all the world"......5/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the unforgettable opening line, the viewer immediately knows that this film is going to be more than just a sentimental look back at someone's childhood. The film tells the story of four twelve-year-old boys going on a trip one summer to find the body of a missing boy, unaware that some older boys have a similar plan. Corey Feldman gives the performance of his career, and you'll also spot the late River Phoenix in there as the "leader of our gang". There are some wonderful scenes in "Stand by me", including the heart-racing scene where-in the friends run for their lives over a bridged section of the train track. "Now and Then" (1995) tried to achieve the same kind of atmosphere and strong friendships for girls, but didn't even come close.There is little else to say about this great picture, other than that it stars the finest child actors of the day and will get you thinking about the friends you might of had when you were twelve.Unmissable!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had seen many movies adapted from Stephen King novels and I have never been truly impressed. However, this movie was one of the few out there when it was better than the book it was based on. When I first saw the movie, I was only ten years old and did not fully appreciate it. I re-rented it from Blockbuster because my teacher (who was a Stephen King addict) recommended it. I barely remembered the storyline, and couldn't recall any of the people in it. This was a truly great decision, because this was the best movie I have ever seen. First of all, the plot was incredible. To try to remember the fifties and how the kids of the time really were is a lot of fun. Though I was born in the eighties, I'm a real fifties-addict. But anyway, that was not the most amazing part. The acting was so breathtakingly spectacular I couldn't believe. Watching the movie, I truly believed that these four boys were best friends, that they had known each other for many years, and that Ace really wanted to kill Chris with that knife. I was truly afraid of Kiefer Sutherland's character and the rest of the Cobras gang. I cried when River Phoenix and Wil Wheaton cried. I laughed along with Vern and yelled with Teddy. To watch this movie is to fully understand the true meaning of life - your friendships.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when i was about 11 years old, and it quickly became one of my childhood favourites along with others like the goonies and the sandlot kids. However as a grew older my taste in movies obviously changed. Films like the goonies etc. I now view as kids movies in hindsight. But Stand By ME is still one of the most moving experiences on film, even though i am now nearly 19years old. The acting from the four kids was superb considering there age, particular mention must be made of the late river phoenix, who brought chris chambers to life. The reason the movie is so good is because in ways it reminds us of the way we were at 12 years old. SBM is my alltime favourite, and anyone who hasn't seen this movie I would encourage you to hire it from the video store, you'll be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie introduced me to the works of Stephen King. Before this I had thought he only wrote horror. I saw this movie and I realized he was a much broader author than I had given him credit for.Wil Wheaton should have won an award for his portryal of Gordie LaChance. He genuinely gets into the part and it shows. The scene where he cries and puts his head on River Phoenix's shoulder actually brought tears to my eyes. It's too bad that he didn't do much after he left Star Trek: The Next Generation.All in all I gave this movie a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is such a great film because it really captures what it is like to be a 12 year old kid. Simple storyline that blossoms with nostalgia for the viewer that can relate to the main characters. You can watch this film and remember the feeling that you had when you were with your friends at a young age. The film says it best when the narrator says something to the effect of " I never had friends like the ones I had when I was 12"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best movie ever, fickle as i am, can't beat this one, period.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have not yet seen this movie you must. I think anyone who goes through they're life, especially childhood, without seeing this movie is seriously missing out ona great plot, great quotes, and great acting. The acting is so spectacular that i am inspired to try to become an actress myself. After watching this movie, River Phoenix's death was so much closer to the bone, he could've been larger than life and to me, and i bet lots of others, he already was in his short time on the earth. Wil Wheaton was the most adorable thing in the world in this movie and having seen picture of him today, he hasn't lost that cuteness he had in '86. Corey Feldman, awesome, just great, i wish he would appear in more stuff today, "The Lost Boys" and "Stand By Me" make you love him soo much, he just attaches to you. The characters are so real even if you're a girl, an adult, or a boy with a childhood exactly like this. The characters are so real, so undescribably cool and soooooo well portrayed. The actors are even more lovable because they are close to their characters, Rob Reiner (director of Stand By Me) says you must cast them that way because they have not "developed the craft [of acting]." So they really are like that!! It makes me so happy to know those guys are so real, very comforting in this new world of mondo-commercialization.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sweet and heart-warming tale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A sweet and heart-warming tale, based on a short story by Stephen King that sets its attention on four boys who venture out into the wilderness to find the body of a "supposedly dead" boy who was near their age. Throughout the movie, I was left with the unexpected feeling that those boys and I had something in common despite the differences in time and generation. Besides, there's nothing wrong with the film in any department and the main strengths of the movie are Rob Reiner's smooth direction and the excellent performances of Wil Wheaton and the late River Phoenix as the ones who serve as the heart/soul and leader of the trio. Well, the narration by Richard Dreyfuss deserves some credit, too. "Stand by Me" is one of those movies that doesn't beg you to pay attention, they ask politely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic....thought provoking and tragic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very moving film. Although I didn't read King's book, judging by some of his other book/film adaptations, I'm sure it is superb.I think what affected me most about it was the role of River Phoenix's character, Chris. In a sense the film is prophetic and sheds light on Phoenix's own tortured soul. Phoenix, with his unusual childhood years and excessive lifestyle in later years, gave a strong performance oozing with charisma and style. Granted he was older than the other child actors in the film but there was still something very special about him, both as a human being and an actor. In a scene towards the end of the film, his character is seen fading away, as if into thin air and I can't help but remember his own terrible demise in 1993.If torture of the human soul is a strong theme in the film, we see it again and again. We see Will Wheaton's character haunted by the death of his brother (a cameo by John Cusack) three months before the setting. If Gordie is affected by the death, his parents have been positiviely decimated by it. Yet mostly, Gordie still chooses in his youthful way to focus on the good times he had with his brother. The other two main characters amongst the boys are Vern and Teddy. Vern, played by Jerry O'Connell, gives an amusing performance as the innocent and cuddly youth not yet quite in tune with the sinister goings-on in his environment and the world. Teddy, played by Corey feldman, gave another good performance. Feldman's career has been solid but perhaps uninspiring. Another quality actor I believe but unfortunately things havent gone well for him in recent years. Feldman's character is also somewhat tortured and interesting, a bit like the real thing I suppose. His father in the film is described as a loony but Teddy ferociously tries to defend him, sobbing proudly how he 'stormed the beaches of Normandy' in one memorable scene with the fabled guard dog 'Chopper'. In a sense, Vern and Teddy provide comic relief amidst the haunting and thoughtful atmosphere of the film. Death is an ever present spectre. We are reminded of it with Gordie's brother, of the incident with the train and of the dead body the boys and their older brothers are looking for. Indeed, Vern and Chris's older brothers are nasty and selfish. Kiefer Sutherland gives an impressive and sinister performance as the gang leader seeking fame with the discovery of a dead body. It reminded me of his role in 'the Lost Boys' as the vampire, again adding to the menacing undertones in 'Stand By Me'.Ultimately of course, the boys are confronted with a truly shocking scene but instead of being eternally haunted by it, narrator Richard Dreyfuss presents it to us as merely a step towards growing up, a step in our discovery of life and death and how close we always are to the latter. For a film dominated by 13 and 14 year olds, it is extremely thought provoking, at times hilarious, at times dangerous and ultimately very tragic. And the genuine warmth and brightness of our young heros radiates throughout the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great performances from young cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very enjoyable film with a great script, masterful direction and standout performances from a young cast including some who came to be big stars like River Phoenix, Jerry O'Connel and Kiefer Sutherland. I'll let you discover the story for yourself, but I'll just say that the relationships between the characters are excellently realized and acted, especially that between River Phoenix and Wil Wheaton, who have the great chemistry that is always there in a River Phoenix movie and just makes it so believable that they are best friends. Both of their performances are remarkably deep considering their age (around 16, though their characters are younger). It's probably evident that I am rather fascinated with River Phoenix as i have only recently discovered him, but he deserves every bit of praise he gets as he was extraordinarily talented and had the innate knowledge of how people work that is vital for an actor.Overall, a timeless movie with great performances from a young cast and a nice coming-of-age story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best films ever made, a true "feel good" movie. A movie where "boys will be boys" and being a boy means being with your friends on a weekend adventure and not sitting in front of the tv playing video games. Even though I wouldn't say it's superbly cast, I can't imagine anyone else playing the roles of Teddy, Vern, Chris and Gordie. The supporting cast is just as great, and as you watch this, it's hard to believe that it's adapted from a Stephen King novel. It is definitely not your typical King horror story. I have seen this movies literally hundreds of times (17 times in one week even!) and I will never tire of it. A definite must see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stand By Me...the greatest movie of all time...that about sums it up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw Stand By Me when I was 6 years old. I never reallyunderstood it then, but the story of 4 boys (Chris, Gordie, Teddyand Vern) who go on an adventure to find a dead boy's body justkind of stuck with me. I've seen it a few more times and I know nomatter how many times I see it, I will always love it and NEVER getsick of it. In my opinion it's the best movie ever made. Everythingabout it is amazing. The actors, River Phoenix, Wil Wheaton, JerryO'Connell and Corey Feldman do an amazing job portraying theircharacters. Especially River Phoenix. I think he did the best job ofall. Stand By Me almost makes you feel like you're in the moviebecause it's so realistic. The scenery is beautiful. I love the partwhen they have to cross the bridge of train tracks. There's a verygood view there. Some people may think Stand By Me soundsboring, but there's not one boring scene in the movie. Thedialogue is exceptional and you'll probably want to rewind at somepoint to hear a certain line again. I read the book which the moviewas based on and i was so amazed at how the movie stayed trueto the characters and everything else. I can't say ANYTHING bad about the movie, except the pukescene was very gross. (i hope that's not a spoiler) But i guess itwent well with the story line considering the characters were 412-year-old boys. So, all i can say is if you haven't seen it, you've got to becauseeveryone i know who's seen it, loves it. Sincerely! (quote fromVern!) So go rent it, buy it, or for all i care, go steal it from a friend!just go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Split World of Nostalgia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film reveals the two worlds of nostalgia. The one world is the perfect past that we all have, going back to the family and perhaps inside the womb. The second world is the disturbing world of nostalgia, the memories that comeback to us without our control, the memories that seem to argue against our need to re-member the past. In fact, the whole point of memory might just be to forget. Forget what? What cannot be incorporated into nostalgia. Stand By Me works this way because there is no more nostalgic time in American history than the 50's. It was during this time that post-war affluence and properity had not yet imploded into the cultural strife of the 60's. And it is only at the age of tweleve that the world still seems new enough to inspire revelations--but not so new that the revelations cannot be put in perspective. At twelve a ten mile journey can feel like a journey half-way around the world. At ten this journey would be terrifying, at fourteen ten miles wouldn't be significant. So, at twelve years old the possibility for perfect nostalgia--innocence--and disturbing nostalgia--truth--are both still possible. It is the illusion of the 50's innocence that this film penetrates--by using the sudden flashbacks of Gordon to show how cruel his father--here the "Ozzie" figure really is to him. Who ever thought that the dead body of an unknown boy could stand as a symbol for the truth? But when at the end of the journey the boy is found and dreams of heroism rise up--who will be known as the ones who found the body--Gordon defends the integrity of death to be free of signification--to be free of use value. Of course, it is always the military-minded who use the remembered dead for heroic purposes (usually to kill other people). Let us not forget the "Unknown Soldier." So Gordon is not only confronting the need for heorism, but the type of nostalgia of the state itself to use the dead as a means to justify the use of perfect nostalgia to destroy involuntary memory--what leads to a different story. What Gordon is protecting is nothing less that the truth itself from the forces of nostalgia that want to use the dead body as a vehicle for hero-narratives--"Everybody will know our names if we discover the body!" And, so too, the storyteller is always in danger of being overwhelemed by the seduction of nostalgia--think of how many people love a great old fashion tale! May involuntary memory rock on!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's not much more to say that hasn't already been written over and over in the numerous positive reviews here. Stephen King movies on both the silver screen and the small screen tend to be very poor and tedious, with an ending coming out of left field. "The Langoliers" was enough to make me swear off any King on TV thenceforth. "Stand By Me" was something else altogether. Much more character driven than other King adaptations, with more sincerity and no gore in sight. Excellent casting, a strong if treacly script and settings in the lush forests of Oregon make up for the slightly slow pacing.This is the only King-related work I watched in the theater and liked, and I obviously like it a lot. Watch this at the end of summer to remind yourself of how much you used to enjoy this season, before life became a 12-month a year grind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece (possible spoilers ahead)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** When it was released in 1986, Stand By Me didn't get much attention. However, since it was released on video, it has acquired quite a crowd of fans. Including me. Stand By Me is one of my all-time favorite movies, up there with the grittier, more violent films I usually give masterpiece status, i.e. Midnight Cowboy, Naked, Yi Yi (A one and a two), Pixote and Taxi Driver. Like these classics, Stand By Me gets top marks from me.Based on the Stephen King novella 'The Body', Stand By Me is the coming-of-age story of four twelve going on thirteen-year-old boys who set off into the Oregon woods to find the body of a missing boy their age who they've overheard was killed by a train. Gordie (Wil Wheaton) is the main character who, as an adult (played by Richard Dreyfuss), tells the story. He is the brightest of the bunch, sensitive and emotional. Like his friends, he has family trouble. His older brother Denny died in a jeep accident, and his parents now just ignore him. His father is even openly hostile, considering Gordie, a wannabe writer, to be second-best to football-star Denny. Chris (River Phoenix) is the leader of the gang. He is Gordie's best friend but they are like chalk and cheese. Chris is tough and athletic, whereas Gordie is skinny and thoughtful. Chris comes from a bad family and everyone knows that he'll turn out bad, "including Chris". His brother is Eyeball, a friend of Ace Merrill (Kiefer Sutherland), the local criminal and bully. The Chambers' family is very unpopular in Castle Rock, something that the intelligent Chris is only too aware of. Teddy (Corey Feldman) is the group's psycho. He comes from a loony family, his dad once tried to burn Teddy's ear off. It is generally considered that Teddy won't live to be 20. Yet he is devoted to his dad, who stormed the beaches at Normandie, as he shows by going into a rage when junkyard-owner Milo Pressman calls his father a loony. Vern (Jerry O'Connell) is a scaredy-cat. He's a jolly, roly-poly guy, the butt of many jokes from the others. He is the least serious of the group and his only known family trouble is with his brother, Billy, also one of Ace's goons. Vern is the group clown. In a way he is the most relaxed.Stand By Me's story sounds a bit simple and a bit pointless, yet the search for the boy's body becomes a journey of discovery and growing up for all four boys. Gordie, my favorite character, goes through the greatest changes and hardships. The dead Ray Brower becomes a parallel with Denny, by seeing the body, Gordie is faced with coming to terms with his brother's death and his dad's anger and scorn. That is why he is obsessed with seeing the body, he needs to get a weight of his chest. He also discovers true friendship through Chris, who acts as a sort of father figure for Gordie, convincing him to join the college courses. The closeness the trip puts them in allows them to bond and help each other. Therein lies the true quality of Stand By Me, that whole voyage of discovery part. The same applies to Chris, who opens his heart to Gordie about his need to escape the town that hates him and his whole family. He has obviously been harbouring this feeling for a while. The trip gives him a chance to unload. And Gordie shows him his (Chris') true worth by convincing him to join him on the college courses. Again, they show the meaning of true friendship. Even Teddy shows signs of growing up, despite his conversation with Vern about the difference in strength between Superman and Mighty Mouse. He displays a surprising devotion to his loony father, which may stem from denial, but he seems to realise that he hasn't much chance in life: "I better go before my mom puts me on the 10 Most Wanted List", he says with a rueful, thoughtful smile. He then tries to make his peace with Chris, he's realised the importance of friends. Vern shows less signs of change: at the end, he picks up a penny, harking back to the beginning.That is the real quality of Stand By Me: its intelligent portrayal of friendship and how 4 friends, who start off as just 4 kids, smoking, swearing and goofing about, who overcome hardship through each other and at the end have grown to be more than they were and have learned the true meaning of friendship. There's the line: "We had only been gone two days but the town seemed different, smaller." It resumes the whole message of the film, it shows how the boys have grown. (Warning!! Serious spoiler ahead!!!) And the adult Gordie remembers this friendship when he reads in a newspaper that Chris has died. It prompts him to tell us his story, and although he hadn't seen Chris in 10 years, he still remembers his unique friendship: "I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was 12. Jesus, does anyone?" That is a truly beautiful line that also evokes the true message of Stand By Me.Rob Reiner does a sterling job as director. He does several beautiful shots of the countryside, with the kids appearing in the bottom left-hand corner. Hence, they appear to on some kind of frontier, about to cross into adolescence. The train tracks they follow seem to be a road leading them onwards. Nice filming.The music is great, the retro soundtrack is great, particularly the title song. My favorite element, though, is Jack Nitzsche's instrumental arrangement of the afore-mentioned 'Stand By Me' song. It's beautiful.But it's the acting that's really brilliant. All four boys are terrific, but especially Wil Wheaton and River Phoenix. Phoenix is great as Chris, perfectly portraying Chris' mixed tough-guy/sensitive attitudes and his desire to escape. The campside scene where he breaks down in front of Gordie is stirring because of hom, you want to reach out and hug him. It serves to remind you just how tragic his death really was. I do still prefer Wheaton's performance though. He has a really expressive face and he really gets Gordie's sensitivity and his emotional turmoil across. A love the leeches scene, and the scene where he cries in front of the dead kids body, but these are just two of the many scenes in which he stands out. In no other film have I seen such wonderful acting from kids, except in Empire of the Sun (Christian Bale) and The Cure (Joseph Mazzello and Brad Renfro). The chemistry between the 4 boys, especially Wheaton and Phoenix, is fantastic. And the supporting cast is good as well, especially Kiefer Sutherland.All in all, this is without a doubt the best coming of age movie ever. The acting is great, the direction is perfect and the story is both moving and profound. The ending is really touching, but then so is the rest of the film. It made me really nostalgic for my childhood. 10/10!Uppers: 1)The tremendous acting; 2)Especially, Wheaton and Phoenix; 3)Great score/soundtrack; 4)Reiner's directing; 5)The landscapes; 6)The story and the message; 7)The perfect evocation of friendship; 8)The leeches scene; 9)The campfire scenes (dialogues: "What's goofy?"; Chris' opening up); 10)The discovery of the body scene (Gordie crying); 11)The train scene on the bridge; 12)The confrontation with Ace; 13)The dialogues in general; 14)The junkyard scene. And I could go on for hours! Downers: 1)A microphone manages to slip into view on two occasions (a forgivable error); 2)Nothing else!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stand by me is certainly one of the best films I have ever seen. It's a great film, but not only because it's very dramatic. In fact the story that it tells is a great story, that make a great film. It isn't only the story of four boys who are searching the body of a missing boy, but also an important portrait of a genuinely and authentic friendship in 1950's USA. It bind four boys, all in a very abandoned and pitiable condition. No affect. Only this friendship. So, the boys try to find affect in their friends. All need affect but we see especially Gordie. He's the protagonist, a very sensitive boys, who first had a brother who make him happy, then (now), after the death of his brother, he hasn't anyone except his best friends Chris. Chris is abandoned. He hasn't anyone too except his best friend Gordie. I almost think that the research of the body is only the occasion to tell about this extraordinary genuine friendship. Great performance by the cast, finely choice score and good direction add to this film what make it a film you can't miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great movie! I can remember loving Stand by me when I saw it early in my teen-ages, and 15 years later I find it just as wonderful. It's great acting and directing, and a good story with good characters. This movie is "a must" and possibly the only thing that can make me wish I was 12 years old again. If you have the chance, I suggest you get the dvd release. It has a good featurette and a commentary track by director Rob Reiner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a good film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched this film at 1 o'clock in the morning and even though I was half asleep and not quite with it, i loved it. Could Rob Reiner have found a better cast for this movie.Even john cusack forfils the role of denny with the most amazing performance and we only see him twice.It is a shame about the future of the cast. The most tragic being river who would be one of the most amazing actors even now if he hadnt of died, corey feldman also fell into to drug world never to be seen again, wil wheaten is off doing his star trek conventions because no one see him as anything other than a trekie and the one who has really got us all is jerry o'connell who has gone from cookie eating vern to movie sensation jerry with the help of a diet.No one could of predicted that future at the time of this film coming out and no other film has even come close to SBM apart from (and yes i will compare) Now and Then because it is a film which covers the opposite side of the human species to SBM and gets you thinking about your own life (and a again a brilliant cast and apperance from brendan fraser made N&amp;T almost as good as its comparison)SBM is a must for anyone and if u go away from seeing this without a love for river, may the lord have mercy on your soul!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well this has got to be one of the best films of all time. I can remember seeing this film in my young childhood and loving separate scenes of it, only now have I found this film and re-acquainted myself with its brilliance. Amazing acting, notably from the 4 boys [Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman and Jerry O' Connell]. Who would have thought that Rob Reiner could get such a performance out of these 4 boys?, one at the time (Jerry O' Connell) was only of the age 11! Watch and love this film, it's great because its only 85 minutes long so you can fit it into a afternoon or a bit of spare time. Respect is due to Rob Reiner, Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman, Jerry O' Connell and the late River Phoenix. Buy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie, for the first time, when I was nine years old. Yes, I was too young to get the full scope of things, but in the last decade, I have gotten to know more of what the whole thing was about. Now, whenever I read "The Body" or see this movie, it actually feels like I've lived most of this. Whenever I look back on the last eleven years and all the things that have happened, I can totally relate to what Stephen King was talking about. The line that really stuck with me ( and the one that I've found to be all too true) was, "Friends come in and out of your life like bus-boys in a restaurant). Now to me, truer words have never been spoken. What's most ironic of all, is that many of the friends I've had over the years (who are no longer my friends) I had watched this film with. Anyway, there are some very good comments on this page and I can't even begin to write anything that will compare. I will say that this is my second favorite movie of all time. It never gets old and the impact seems to hit me harder every time. The scene where they uncover Ray Brower's face (and the look in his dead eyes) still gives me goosebumps.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i would firstly like to apologize for the poor quality of my English, and also to express my frustration and regret for not possessing a rich enough vocabulary to convey my feelings towards this film. But anyway. I first saw stand by me when i was- must have been about 10 years old. At the time, those boys in the film were `big boys` to me and i remember how sweetly river phoenix's flawless profile remained in my innocent childhood memory for days after seeing it, and the very surreal sense of loss and grief i felt when my sister gently told me that he was already not with us anymore. I have been watching this film at least once every year since then for 8 years, and although this is such a cliche the more i see it the more I derive. It's like a film that teases out the knots that form in your heart as you get older, and every time i see it i feel so small again, so unspoiled and vulnerable. No other film has the same effect on me, and i won't bother going into detail about exactly whose amazing acting captivates me and how much of a genius Stephen King is- i don't think all that makes for enjoyable reading when coming from people you don't know. Stand By Me is a beautiful work of art that simply flows- flows right into the forgotten and dehydrated part of our hearts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intimate, enlightening journey into the Oregon woods, circa 1959</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Few Good Men" and "When Harry Met Sally..." may present good arguments for the best Rob Reiner film, but I still find myself wandering back to "Stand By Me". Despite its brief length (only an hour and 27 minutes), this is probably one of the most endearing coming-of-age films ever made, and it makes the 1950's seem like fun while still acknowledging the cultural limitations of the time. Set in late summer 1959 in a sleepy town in Oregon, an adult named Gordie tells in flashback the story of when he was 12 years old and first saw a dead body. As the level-headed, sensitive member of his gang, Gordie's pals are tough-guy Chris (as the leader), army-obsessed Teddy (the wild one), and chubby Vern (the picked-on guy). They spend a day-and-a-half traveling through the Oregon woods looking for the body of a local boy their age named Ray Brower who has recently disappeared. They are readily expecting to find his body after being hit by a train, and for discovering his body, they are also expecting generous rewards; replete with cash, TV appearances, and medals.One of the most noble things Reiner did with this film is NOT tarting it up for kids. It is a story for adults about kids, and it appropriately reflects back on how an adult would remember his childhood, rather than how we feel about our adolescence as we experience it. There are no "aww, how cute" jokes abound, yet these kids still engage in typical teenager talk about TV shows, comic books and cartoons and it doesn't ever seem trite. These characters are typical 12 year-olds who like to spit, swear &amp; smoke cigarettes like the older guys do. Not surprisingly, many years later people are still enjoying the sensitive performance of River Phoenix, whose skills as an actor far exceed his age. Although he's playing the tough guy in the group, his gentler moments always seem genuine. It's fair to assume that the Gordie character - an aspiring writer &amp; storyteller, is somewhat based on the author, Stephen King. There are deeper moments in the film when the guys examine their own family life, and they are unpleasant for them all in some way - Chris' father is an abusive alcoholic, Teddy's father an insane war veteran, and Gordie is still mourning the sudden death of his older brother. In particular, Gordie's memories of his brother tell him saddening truths about his father. The soundtrack, a combination of 50's doo-wop &amp; rock, mixes both rarities and popular hits to pleasant effect (this wouldn't of happened if the film were made 10 years later, it would have been some kind of American oldies collection).As the adult Gordie narrating the story in flashback, Richard Dreyfuss gives a solemn voice-over performance. Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Connell, Kiefer Sutherland and a briefly-seen John Cusack also never miss with their performances. A great summation Reiner chose to include in the film is Gordie explaining what happens to everyone in the gang and how his memory led him back to the summer of 1959. Despite the horrible abundance of crap films produced in the 80's, "Stand By Me" still shines, and because it plainly documents the late 1950's so well, it looks as if it may never date.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, okay, I know that this is the second review of Stand by Me I have submitted, but as time has passed since I wrote the last review, this has become one of my top 5 favorite films. It gets better the more times you watch it. River Phoenix is a magnificent actor. He is definitely one of my favorites. I wish I had the skill to act such as he. It is so sad what happened to him though. I love Stand by Me. After you view this great flick, you think differently about friendship, I wish I had the adventures that the four boys had. Stand by Me is an adventure fantasy, but almost everyone can relate to it and understand what the characters were going through. The character development is brilliant, the watcher gets to know and feel for all of the characters in the film. Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Connell, Kiefer Sutherland, John Cusack and Richard Dreyfuss are all stunning. Wow, what a great cast. I thought Now and Then was a good film, but when compared to Stand by Me, it has a long way to go. I am outraged that people consider Now and Then the Stand by Me for girls. I love this film, and am so glad I found a copy on DVD. God bless River Phoenix. A great actor that everyone should look up to and respect!I give Stand by Me a 13 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NOTE TO IMDB: PLEASE DELETE THE PREVIOUS SUBMISSION. THIS SUBMISSION CONTAINS A FACT CORRECTION.-------------------------------------Four boys in rural Oregon trek across the county in search of a dead body. What they find is maturity, friendship, and life. They learn about how short life can be, experiencing their own near-deaths, the death of a stranger, and the death of a relative. Over three days, these four boys learn more about life than most adults do in a lifetime.Most of the events are supposedly based on actual occurrences in the childhood of Steven King. Marvelous acting by Corey Feldman and River Phoenix. Any man who grew up in a rural area will relate to this. An equivalent movie for females is "Now and Then (1995)". I highly recommend both of these movies to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favourite film of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the boys in the film I was 12 going on 13 when I first saw this film. Instantly it became one of my all time favourite films and now having seen it almost a dozen times it still is my favourite. Four twelve year olds (Jerry O'Connell, Will Wheaton, Corey Feldman and River Phoenix) set out to find the dead body of another boy who is lying dead by a set of railway lines in 60's Oregan. As they get closer to finding the body their emotions begin to spill out with the whole idea of getting to the body becoming an obsession. Wonderfully acted by the cast the film is directed superbly by Rob Reiner and when Ben E. King's classic song begins to play at the end you not only want the film not to end but generally feel moved. Stand By Me has something for everyone and is probably the finest example of River Phoenix's acting talent. The supporting performances from Kiefer Sutherland, Richard Dreyfuss and John Cusack are all worth a mention but it is the four youngsters which really shine. Whether they are absolutely perfectly cast or are all genius's is often debated by critics but one thing is for sure and that is Stand By Me is a masterpiece of 80's film. If I were to recommend one film to you this would be it. Better films may have been made but I have yet to see them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute. Like a Babysham commercial. OK, maybe not like a Babysham commercial, but you get my drift?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a start, OK, I had literally nooooo expectations of this small-town, coming-of-age clich fest which seemed to me as original as a school concert rendition of 'Oh Come All Ye Faithful', all though this time with rather more, um, advanced language. But I agreed to see it on the basis that Friends had been rescheduled and heck, it was River Phoenix! What can I say, I'm shallow. I was knocked back, literally. OK, maybe not literally, but as good as. It was, in the words of my father,''a good little film''. The young actors were precocious little brats from what I could see, at first anyway, but they really developed with the plot of the film. River was at his finest, but then that is what I always say. The others seemed like the makings of fine actors. And one of the best parts was the fact that they didn't spend all their time having gross conversations about girls, unlike many twelve year old males I know, but then they aren't exactly River Phoenix so what do you expect?! I thought it was too short, but there were some both funny and moving moments that I treasure. I think I could probably allow myself to watch this movie again. It was cute. Stand By Me is my favourite Phoenix film next to My Own Private Idaho, which I saw extremely illegally but enjoyed immensely. Though this lacks the certain wooden touch of a Keanu Reeves picture (which can actually only be a bad thing) it has nice backdrops, boyish 50s charm through the swearing, and I'm a sucker for this stuff. What can I say? I'm shallow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never met anybody who doesn't like this film. I don't believe there is anyone!! Regardless of those 89 people who voted that it was rubbish. This film is wonderfully cast and definitely does the book(Different seasons, the body, Stephen King) justice which is a change as when literature takes to celluloid it usually manages to get somewhat 'mangled' along the way. However, Rob Reiner captures perfectly the very qualities that made the book so special. This is a film that must be watched by everyone before making a decision. It's too easy to say 'that sounds boring'. as Steven King appropriately states in the book "The most important things are the hardest to say because words diminish them. It's hard to make strangers care about the good things in your life". I'd just like to add at the end of my review, Stand by me beat that timeless classic Top Gun to the number one spot in box office ratings!</fullReview>

The story of 4 best friends and their adventures is acted and directed so well, you almost wish you yourself had those adventures. The 4 young actors are perfectly casted and their acting is incredible for a young child actor. The movie and the actors really deserved more awards than the movie actually got. The script is the only thing that is OK. It has it's memorable quotes but there really is A LOT of swearing for a young 12 year old.

		<fullReview>Stand By Me is without a doubt a spectacular movie. The acting, the writing, the direction: they're all nearly perfect. Even though they're barely teenagers, the film's four leading actors deliver better performances than most people two or three times their age. The script is terrific; it is nothing short of beautiful to see the bond that Gordie, Chris, Teddy, and Vern have and how they support each other. Rob Reiner's direction really pulls everything together so the movie really works well as a whole. The movie is at times hilariously funny, sentimental (but not mushy), suspenseful, and always moving.I've seen this movie almost a half-dozen times, and whenever it ends, I can't help but let my jaw drop, shake my head in wonder, and think, "Wow."(I also think it's hilarious that none of the four leading actors would actually be allowed to _see_ the movie they starred in because it's rated R.)10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truest View of Youth Ever !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How a guy in his forties can remember being twelve this well is a miracle to behold!! The simpler times, the incredibly close ties of youth, the miraculous acting by such young actors - River Phoenix was better than 99% of the adult actors in that year or any other. Plus, the drama is tight. Scenes like the train on the bridge, the dog in the junkyard and the leaches in the swamp all kept the thrills coming while this truly human story stayed true to it's recollections of youth. Even the comedic element was carefully balanced into the mix of movie magic. With the tubby kid as the brunt of most jokes and scenes like the pie-eating contest with "Lardass" starting the biggest barf festival ever, this movie had every element of great entertainment and true art - because it told the truth about the realities of youth; how scary and truly barbaric the bullies of youth are, how incredibly horrible adults can be to kids and how damaging it can be to their self-esteem, and then how amazing it is when kids can surprise everyone and do something nobody expects of them, because they've forgotten about the courage that can be exhibited when children or anyone does the unthinkable because they don't think about or know the consequences that can come from their actions. All and all a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all that I have seen, I believe this movie is by far my most favorite, and has been since I first saw it in 1987. It is a wonderful portrayal of four pre-teen boys who spend the last weekend of summer on an adventure before facing the difficult changes of junior high.By now most everyone has seen this movie so I won't go into detail about the storyline, but I will comment on a couple of my favorite scenes, which hopefully should not serve as spoilers for anyone who might not have seen this yet. One of those that I really like is where Chris (River Phoenix) shares with Gordie (Wil Wheaton) how hard it is to be judged and ridiculed because of the family he comes from. Then later on Gordie in turn shares with Chris how hard it has been still living under the shadow of his popular older brother, who had been killed several months beforehand, and whom Gordie felt his parents loved more. Both scenes displayed compassion and total acceptance of best friends, as well as the insecurities each of them face even at that age.This was a wonderful movie with a mixture of humor and sensitivity, without being downbeat at all. Wonderful performances by all of the cast, especially Wil Wheaton and River Phoenix. My only complaints about this movie are the profanity, which I understand was not quite as prominent in that era; and the fact that I wish it could have been longer. However, as I stated before it is my definite all-time favorite movie.More than anything else, I believe that this movie is a reminder that no matter how far friends may drift apart as they get older, the memories they had shared will always remain in a person's heart.</fullReview>

The plot develops smoothly to show the differences in the character of each boy, and how that affects their relationship. Each personality and character is also satisfactorily developed so we can gain an insight into the boys' thinking and actions.It is really a nostalgic movie for me.

On the way however they learn more about the journey of life, realising that the journey was more important than the destination. This is a brilliant coming of age tale, that is very easy and fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless classic of forgotton youth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that you will watch over and over again. Wil Wheaton plays Gordie LaChance who is trying to get over the death of his older brother, Denny. He feels that his family will never get over his death, so he decides to go on an adventure to find the dead body of a local boy with his friends Chris (River Phoenix), Teddy (Corey Feldman) and Vern (Jerry O'Connell). Along the way they discover more about themselves and there is some good humour thrown in also. The scene in the Junkyard when they think that the owner is saying "sick balls" to Chopper the dog is very funny.I recommend this for all age groups. Everyone will enjoy it. Good soundtrack here too. Look out for a young John Cusack who plays Denny. I give this an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to start by saying that I think that this is the best movie of all time. I'm Wil Wheaton's (Gordie) # 1 fan and have seen most of his movies. This movie is what made me his fan. Not only is this my favorite Wil movie but it's my favorite movie in the world. I would feel the same way if Wil didn't play Gordie, although he did it so well. This movie is about four friends willing to stick up for each other, something you rarely find anymore. This movie is adventurous, dramatic, and funny. River Phoenix and Wil Wheaton put in such great performances. I'm 12 and I know I'll love this movie forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>truly original, spawned many imitators</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Stand By Me' was the first in which four boys set out on a mission of some sort and find out something about themselves some of the imitators include American Pie, Varsity Blues, Road Trip, Detroit Rock City, etc., though none were NEARLY as serious as Stand). Now and Then could have been a great female equivalent, but it was to over-exagerrated and didn't take itself seriously enough. The humor grew out of the drama, which is probably why it appealed to kids the age of the characters so much. Kids like to see kids in drama and comedy, while adults like any kind of drama. That's why it appealed to so many adults, too. If I had to pick any of the four boys in the movie that I relate to the most, it would be Gordie. Even though I think that's the main purpose of his character, he still has my same passion of writing, has made close friends with accused troublemakers, and hell, he looks like me.It's nice to emotionally know that Stephen King's best work doesn't include the spook traits that he's famous for. The same can be said for Shawshank Redemption. I'm sure this also helped boost another man's already-great career: Rob Reiner. 'This is Spinal Tap' told everyone he was original, and 'Stand By Me' proved he was equal in adaptions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stand by Me vs Now &amp; Then</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my second comment on this film. A lot of people have said 'Now and Then' is the female equivalent to this film. It ain't. First off, this movie went as a drama, and succeded. 'Then' went for the whole comedy-drama thing, which, for me, only worked in 'SLC Punk!'. Well, it didn't exactly do so great. Second, this film has real tension. The whole flooding sewer scene and the graveyard scare in 'Then' are nothing compared to the scenes in 'Stand' where Gordie and Vern are being chased by a train on a railroad tracked bridge, or where all four guys are fighting off swamp leeches. Or the parts in 'Then' when the girls confront the Wormer bros. are wimpy compared to the life-threatening confrontation at the end of 'Stand' when Chris comes face-to-face with Ace the greaser. Or the jello-filled balloon attack over the mailbox baseball game. And last, the situation with Christina Ricci and her dead mother. Now I know that losing a close family member, especially a mother, is hard and sad, but I never really feel sympathy for her. Maybe that's because the film never provides us with any flashbacks of them together, or show Ricci getting really emotional in front of her friends. On the other hand, I did feel sorry for Wil Wheaton (Gordie). The flashbacks of him with brother John Cusack show the true love between them, and the baseball cap and the cantine are some of the only things he has left of him. And he does get very emotional in front of River Phoenix (Chris). And, in other ways your sympathy goes out to Chris for coming from a bad home, Corey Feldman (Teddy) for being the victim of a crazy father, and Jerry O' Connell (Vern) for having his innocence abused by the greasers.Sure, there are a lot of similarities between the two films, mostly having to do with the friendships getting intense over a short period of time (in 'Then' it was a summer, while in 'Stand' it was a weekend), but, emotionally and intensely, 'Stand' is the better of the two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie! It is awesome, it's so original and energetic and there is not one dull moment. This movie was only nominated for 1 Oscar: Best Screenplay Adaption. I think: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor(Wil Wheaton) and Best Supporting Actor(River Pheonix). Stand By Me is a drama based on a short story by Stephen King. Although there are alot of very humorous scenes(Lard Ass story, the comb, the conversations around the campfire) there is alot of depth and meaning. The moral of this movie is: You have many friends along the way but none as memorable as when you were a child. Stand By Me is about 4 boys in a small town Oregon called Castle Rock. There's sensitive Gordon, misunderstood Chris, rambunxious Teddy, and scaredy-cat Vern. On the last days of summer the 4 boys go out and search for the body of a missing kid. Along the way the discover about life and each other. There aren't enough stars to rate this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After all these years, "Stand by Me" still remains my favorite movie. Stephen King, one of the best modern writers around, really mapped out a wonderful story. While "coming of age" movies are done far too often, "Stand by Me" has a unique feel that is all it's own. All of the young boys delivered incredible performances, to this day I still get teary eyed.To anyone who hasn't seen "Stand by Me," my advice to you is to hurry out and rent it.

		<fullReview>This movie is on the top of my personal chart and I have so many adjectives for it, that I don't know where to begin. I don't know if king liked this movie, but I think it's perfect, because Rob Reiner doesn't betray the lyricism of the book and put us in a world made of memories of (also our)youth. The actors help him with the outstanding performance by River Phoenix, who shows us that young actors aren't only Macaaulay Cukin' style. "Stand By Me" is like a man who walks on tiptoe: feelings are suggested but not shouted and also an action scene like the one of the rail bridge is made without a videoclip rhythm. And then, it's the story of the friendship, we would have. This movie show us another important thing: The Oscars doesn't guess every time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The surprise hit of 1986 in still one of the all-time greats!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now matter how many times I've seen it, "Stand By Me," for me, will always be one of the greatest. This is a film that perfectly captures what it's like to be in that early adolescent stage when you're too old for toys and too young for practically anything else. After five minutes of watching it, I was seeing myself as a skinny kid back in a small town in upstate New York, hanging with my friends and enjoying that long, languid, lazy Summer to its fullest. And the funny part is, many of my male friends report the same feelings while watching it. A good female equivilant to this film, I think, is the more recent "Now and Then."The acting of the four young protagonists, particularly River Phoenix and Wil Wheaton (Before he got stereotyped as the once-and-future Wesley Crusher), are all good, solid, and believeable. Kiefer Sutherland's Ace Merrill is also a particularly nasty villain, especially in those powerful last scenes. And then there's Ben E. King's title song, which became an even bigger hit in 1986 than 1960 due to this film.In short, "Stand By Me" is more than a good film. It's a tribute to a way of life that many a sentimental adult would give anything to get back for even a few hours, a film that makes one realize, in Thomas Hood's words, that "I'm farther off from Heaven than when I was a boy."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There has never been another coming of age movie quite like this one and chances are there will never be.This movie has it all the best acting, a great plot, great direction and a great soundtrack.I have seen it at least ten times and am not ashamed to admit it. I first saw it as a twelve year old myself but never gave much thought to it. Then as a 16 year old I saw it again and never has a movie taken me *for a ride* with it ever!!I cried every one of River`s tears, laughed with every laugh, stood on my toes to push them to run faster. I felt the fear and the joy of being together with people who matter to you most at that age.It just made me look back to my childhood as a Twelve year old. There is so much in common that it is unbelieveable.The movie makes you realize that yes life was that great and that much fun and that is exactly how *cool* we were as kids. How we used to laugh in the amazingly similar ways, those memories, the stories, the camp fires all floods back. Its the friendships which are formed when you are 12 and the way you live as a 12 year. Stand By Me makes you feel nostalgic and yes the last monologue...I for one know that I never had friends like the ones I did when I was 12.If you can come out seeing this movie not laughing, crying and singing with the characters and not feeling any nostalgia at all you missed out on the best times of life!!I`ll see it again and again...so should everyone.Oh how I wish I could be 12 again!</fullReview>

"Stand By Me" is a coming of age drama about friendships you only have when your 12. It is a memorable, touching film... one you will want to buy and keep forever. I was very saddened when the main characters Gordie, Chris, Teddy and Vern disappeared from the screen. It's a must-see! So buy it, rent it or find a TV listing of it! I believe its going to be on TBS or TNT February 19 (a Saturday)! So, I hope you'll take my advice and check it out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie rocked!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though I'm not a Stephen King fan, but I must confess that I really like this movie and the book, "The Body". I first saw it at a friend's house when it was on network television. It's about four pre-teen boys who were all friends, and they go on the hunt for a dead kid's body. And one of the characters, Gordie was a sensitive boy who wants to see the kid's body and needed closure on his older brother's death. The characters in this movie were very upbeat and likable, though I really didn't like Vern (Jerry O'Connell) too much.  This movie had laughs, tears, and it also made you think, too. The actors in this movie played their parts well, even Keifer Sutherland as the town bully and his gang were great, too! I also miss River Pheonix, too. I didn't have a favorite scene, because I liked every part in this movie! In fact, it's one of my favorites! :)  So, try this flick out whenever you're in the mood for a comedy-drama! </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective without being Melodramatic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Stand By Me," is the best Stephen King film alongside "The Shawshank Redemption." Director Rob Reiner makes the story very touching without pumping unneeded melodrama into the film, which is rare for a dramatic Stephen King adaption. All the young actors perform quite well, especially River Phoenix. (This was the actor's best performance.) The narration works quite well, and the film succedes at being dramatic, funny and haunting (see Gordie's dream) at the same time, without diversion from the story. Finally, as in all King's films, there is an excellent villain. In "Stand By Me" he is Ace Merril. As played by Kiefer Sutherland, Merril's intimidation practically leaps of the screen and punches you in the face, especially at the end.</fullReview>

I love the late River Phoenix more than anything and I know every line of the movie by heart. SBM came out on the same year I was born(1986). This movie has been a part of my life since I was about 6, My older brother rented it for us to watch. I really liked it, my favorite character then was Gordie. Now my tastes have matured, Chris is my long lasting favorite. Ironicly it was around 1993, the time of River's death, that I first saw SBM. This movie is one of the most touching and meaningful movies I've ever seen. River did an outstanding job portraing Chris. One reason I love this movie so much is that I can relate to the characters. The movie makes you laugh, cry, and understand. Every time I watch this movie I catch something new. Stand By Me is the best movie ever and if you havent seen it I suggest you do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best American movie I have ever seen. I can just not see enough of it. Its beautiful scenery and story bring you back to your own childhood. I remember when I was about their age I went to swim with buddies in the mountain creek. I hate to be nostalgic knowing that it is something gone and you can never get it back. I cry every time I see this movie, especially when the two departed at the end. The casting cannot be perfect. They are exactly what they are. I would say this River Phoenix's best acting. There are few good movies like this one that has a lasting effect on you after you watch it. Too bad one of the actors died so young. Imagine they themselves look at this movie 20 years later. I highly recommend this movie. I myself tend to control myself not to see it again in fear of plunging myself again into those nostalgic scenes. One thing I would like to mention that this movie unlike all the formulaic ones with girls and sex shows an intimate or perhaps a little bit subtle hint of male mutual attraction undertone in it. Would you agree? I think this is common among young boys. I would like to hear your opinion.</fullReview>

A film, that without budget, cast or a particualy engaging premice allows the audience a very tangable and personal rememberance. A film that allows the audience to be there - in the true sense of the word. It is the level of engagement that this film brings that makes it truly special - we really do care about the characters, and every childhood setback or adventure has more power than an entire alien invasion, or the earths destruction or even the story of another young boy on a planet far, far away.Stand By Me is one of those rare, low budget gems - low pretentions with high results - and becomes one of the most poinant and moving films in years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie Of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the first time when I was four or five years old. It didn't really mean anything, but I loved the leaches scene and had a huge crush on Gordie. For years I listened to my sister rave about, and when it was on TV this summer, I decided to watch. I have seen it twenty-seven times since then and love it more each time. Before watching it again, I always considered River Phoenix just to be "that one guy who died". After watching old enough to understand the plot and characters, I am now one of the biggest River Phoenix fans. The 'milk money' scene is one that will stay with me until the day I die. It was done so amazingly well, that you can feel yourself sitting beside Chris comforting him, feeling his pain and before you know it, you're sobbing with him. Although I can't reminisce on the times when I was young (I'm only thirteen), I feel that I completely understand, and am living their time. I have friends that I think I will have foreveer, but know that we will eventually drift apart.I also loved it because it was such a fantastic movie with no girl to get in the way. Many movies today rely on romance and sex to sell it. But "Stand By Me" needed no extra help.</fullReview>

When your only care is school and whether or not you were allowed to play with your friends that day. My young life was a cherishable one because of the friendship between four pre-adolescent boys and a movie screen. "Stand By Me" brings such a depth of emotion to a person watching the way the boys, one by one, open their hearts to one another. If you have not seen this movie you have yet to rediscover your forgotten, carefree, childhood days.So grab your old friends and watch it together... just make sure nobody forgets the comb!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me just say that this is the kind of movie that is missed in movies today. River Phoenix by himself is award winning. One of his greatest roles next to My Own Private Idaho.Rob Reiner did an absolutely amazing job explaining the friendships that boys have during their teenage years. It is heart-warming watching these 4 young actors: Wil Wheaton (Gordie Lachance), River Phoenix (Chris Chambers), Corey Feldman (Teddy Duchamp), and Jerry O'Connell (Vern Tessio), take a journey through the woods in search of a dead body, while they spend their two day trip swearing, telling stories, and hitting each other with constant, and hilarious jokes and caps. It is also great that the story can be so entertaining, and with no love interests. It is much more realistic without a girl getting in the middle of the story. Most movies nowadays can't get away without some kind of love interest. So, I applaud that . . . I think most people would.Also, Keifer Sutherland does an amazing job (as usual) being the bad guy (again, as usual). He plays the town hood, Ace Merrill, who makes the boys adventure a living hell. But, in the end, I'm sure you'll find that it all ends up okay.Take my advise, this movie is one to see. If you haven't seen it yet, go and rent it now. I have seen the movie over 30 times, and can tell you, you'll never get sick of it!!</fullReview>

I grew up without a father but was always loved and cared about by my mom and nans (grandmother) so I wanted to cry at the plight of the protagonist, 13-year-old Gordon, who felt ignored by his folks and longed to feel appreciated and cared for, and I also felt sorry for Teddy, disfigured by an abusive father. And I loved the narration by Richard Dreyfuss as The Writer (Gordon as a grown man) and kinda wondered if that's where they got the idea for the TV show THE WONDER YEARS from The movie was xlent, and I read the novellette (By Stephen K., a literary HERO of mine since I was 14!!!!) and it was ALSO xlent. So whatever you do, don't miss this flick!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignore the language</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching my brother record this on the HBO premiere in 1987, and we have watched the same copy since. I love this movie, although we need to get a NEW copy for ourselves.The put-down of foul language is unfortunate. They say it was uncommon for 1950's boys to cuss THAT much.Think about it. Were these four boys really common anyways? They laughed, cried, and had a good time like the rest of us, but these four weren't common. How many junior-highers-to-be set out on a 20-mile hike to look for a dead body? If it WAS so common to do that, they wouldn't have been so hyped up to have their picture in the paper. So I wouldn't compare their rate of cussing to other boys in that time period. The cussing adds a lot to the humor.That's my view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good mix of fun and drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With over 40 reviews posted on this site at the time of this writing, theres not much else to add to everyone elses feelings. Plain and simple this is just a flat out fun movie. Many memorable moments involving leeches, Chopper the dog, the barf-o-rama, and of course the "traaaaaaaaain!!!" All four kids are great in their roles, each with a seperate turn to cry at some point in the film. Although it was odd that the chubby kid (O'Connell), usually the target of criticisms most of the way, only cried because of the near death experience he had, not because of any emotional problem like the others. And despite what some say, I think the foul language used could be possible by real life boys, with my view being it depended on your upbringing. I was one of a quartet who happened to not use those words for fear of being told on, but I've certainly come across younger kids who swear pretty bad, so it all depends. But as far as the film, its certainly a longtime of fave of most.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A beautiful film and an honest one. Only one comment, and this refers to Maltin's Summary: naughty words were just as common among the young in the 1950s as they are today. It's possible Maltin was raised in a sheltered atmosphere or perhaps he's just forgotten, but I remember. These expressions were heard on the playground everyday in my working-class neighborhood. In any event, they're entirely valid within the context of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It brings You Back.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though I wasn't alive during the 1950's, I got a good idea how life was watching Stand By Me, based on the novella of Stephen King. Your friends were everything; you played games together, hiked together, told scary stories, and went on long ventures. While this is true today, you didn't have life's many pleasures such as video games, or computers. Things were different back then...The movie tells the story of four young boys who go on a trek through the Oregon Wilderness in search of a dead body, but find much more than that..The acting you get from the four young boys is incredible, as is the directing by Reiner who stuck to the nitty-gritty of King's story. The movie itself is filled with memorable one-liners (Annette's cleavage), stories (Lard Ass), and scenes (the Leeches).This is the ultimate growing-up movie. We witness the last days of kids being kids, and their moving up to adulthood. But this movie isn't all that sappy. It is humorous, dramatic, up-lifting, and serious.One I would wholly recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me, watching this movie was almost like going back in time. Though I went through puberty in the '60s and this movie was set a bit earlier, I could see myself and my friends clearly. The four leads turned in outstanding performances and director Rob Reiner excelled at presenting authentic characters whose friendships were obviously deeper than their shoulder punching, tough talking and mother-insulting exteriors. The language was a bit too much, I believe, but other than that, Stand By Me stands as a true American film classic.</fullReview>

Since then I've read every book by Stephen King and seen every movie based on one of his novels/short stories. This is the only film that does a Stephen King novel justice. The young actors in this film are brilliant, and after seeing this again recently I feel what a void has been left by the death of River Phoenix. He was truly a great actor and nobody will ever now what he may have accomplished. If you haven't seen this film rent it immediately. If you have, rent it again. It is timeless....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's always fun to watch kids or teenagers venture out on their own with no adults watching over them. They carry a gun and cuss because it's cool. This was a great adventure movie with humor and drama. My favorite parts are when the cars are racing on the wrong side of the road, when Gordie and his friends get leeches all over them, and when they're crossing the train bridge and the train comes. This movie is a lot like Homeward Bound, only with kids. If you like adventure movies, you'll love this film. I give it a 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stand by Me is probably the only Stephen King movie that surpassed the original story. I'm usually not impressed by the movies that result from books in general, but in this case, see the movie. From the cast of young talent to the narration of Richard Dreyfuss, who has the voice of Everyman (or Woman), this movie highlights what it was like to be a kid. I didn't grow up in the time frame of this movie, but I still felt a nostalgia for small-town life in the fifties. If I had to recommend one movie for everyone to see at least once, this would be the movie. And for anyone who thinks this is a movie about kids finding a dead body, think again: instead, this is a movie about kids finding out about themselves and the adults who have made differences, good and bad, in their lives.</fullReview>

This movie has a good mix of comedy and emotion, and I've seen it probably 10 times. The swearing is a bit much at times, but also realistic for the ages of these kids. My favorite story about this movie is when my mother-in-law was down to visit for the first time, and we'd run out of chit-chat to fill in the gaps, so I asked if she wanted to watch a movie. I picked this one, a heart-warming tale about 4 teenage kids, right? I had forgotten about all the swearing and "mother" jokes. Oh well! Definitely a great movie, one of my favorites and one I'm sure to see many more times.</fullReview>

Vern was the fat kid who never quite fitted in but he tried his best, he was constantly picked on by Teddy. Teddy was the son of a loony who burnt teddy`s ear off on the stove, even though he was abused he cared for his father.

Rob Reiner created a masterpiece. I have to congratulate him on the way he scripted this, although it was King's novella. The novella will make me cry, no matter how many times I reread it. To tell you the truth, I copied all of it into a little notebook and when I feel depressed and need to be lifted back up, I pull it out and weep. When I first saw this, River was already dead and I didn't even know who he was. I went to do some research on him in the library and cried when I learned he was gone. I then rented most of his movies, and was only let down with about 2 of them. The explorers was terrible. He was so great though, and his biographies have all made me cry. Best luck to him, where ever he has gone, and I hope everyone else knows how lucky we were to have him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps his best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Stephen King was asked by his publisher to write a 'non-supernatural' book, he initially refused. As he got used to the idea, he wrote a 4-novella's containing masterpiece, including 'Stand by me'. It's a genuine masterpiece telling of early teenager's chains of thoughts and displays realistically the fears, anxieties and all other important issues in 12-year old boy's minds. 'Stand by me' has a fantastic cast of, among others, Kiefer Sutherland and River Phoenix. The original title of the story, 'The body', was renamed 'Stand by me' after the title song, which occurs throughout the whole film in various adaptions and reflects the specific moods of the moment. I have seen this film in a time-span of about 8 years about 10 times. It seems crazy, but it's the truth. The film is perfect in all its aspects: beginning, plot, characters, '2nd level', and even ending (not one of King's strong points).The film contains no gore, blood, monsters or non-realistic elements as we're used to of King, but is, next to 'The Shawshank Redemption', his best movie. The movie definitely earns his spot in the IMDB top-250.</fullReview>

I was about the same age as the characters, and I related to their feelings and emotions. It had parts that made me laugh (the campfire scene), parts that made me cry (the milk money scene) and parts I will never forget ( "I'll see you around." "Not if I see you first."). This movie touched my heart like no other movie has before. It is THE coming-of-age movie. No one has made a better one, and I don't think they ever will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The childhood I wish I had</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one film I own on videotape and am not ashamed to say I watch again and again. It is, as others have said already, a classic.As a fan in general of River Phoenix, I like especially to watch it every year around Halloween (or All Saints' Day, Nov. 1, for which Halloween is the vigil) in commemoration of his untimely death on Oct. 31. The enveloping setting for the film is the recollections of the grown-up writer Gordon LaChance of his close childhood friend, Chris Chambers, on reading in the newspaper of his sudden death. It is especially poignant to watch on the anniversary of the death of the actor who played Chris.I would like to share a very touching and thought-provoking anecdote told by the author of "Lost in Hollywood", a biography of River Phoenix. During the filming of every movie in which he starred, River attached himself closely to someone else involved as a mentor and father figure. In the case of Stand by Me, this role was played by Robert Reiner, the director (who had wisely prepared his four principals before screening with adventure-wilderness-type activities of the same kind, in order to get them to "bond." It worked!)During several takes of the "milk-money" confession scene, River had been unconvincing. Then Reiner asked River to think of a time in his own life when an adult had betrayed him. The result is what we see now-- what turns out to be one of the climactic moments of the film, although perhaps it needn't have been. And the biographer says that when the cameras stopped rolling, River's tears didn't. He kept sobbing and crying uncontrollably, until Reiner comforted him in his arms. Heaven only knows what had happened to River that he was recalling in that scene, but whatever it was was real.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 1986 Rob Reiner classic is ALMOST among my top 5 of all time, but not quite as good as "Forrest Gump", the "Star Wars Trilogy", "Terminator 1&amp;2", "The Blues Brothers", or "Braveheart", but it is unforgettable all the same. Four friends in the 50's go in search of a dead body. On the way there is much laughter of course(mostly contributed by Corey Feldman as crazy Teddy DuChamp and Jerry"Look how thin and good looking I am now"O'Connell as Vern the fat kid) but lots of sadness along the way. Wil Wheaton gives what is probably the most underrated performance of all time as sensitive budding writer Gordy, and River Phoenix has many fine moments as tough guy with bad reputation Chris Chambers. A fine supporting cast includes Richard Dreyfuss(one of my personal favorites), Marshall Bell, John Cusack, Casey Siemaszko(Charlie in "Young Guns"), Kiefer Sutherland, and Dick Durock, the "Swamp Thing" as Bill Travers. The Soundtrack is flawless too(if you look at all of my faves, excluding the "Terminator" flicks, they all have memorable soundtracks) with "Lollipop" By the Chordettes, "Stand By Me" By Ben E. King(the definitive version), "Everyday" By Buddy Holly, and "Great Balls of Fire" By Jerry Lee Lewis(Love that mailbox baseball!) just to mention a few. The tale of Davey Hogan must be one of the most memorably disgusting(funny) scenes in a movie up there with the fat man sequence(or organ donor transplant sequence, take your pick) in "Monty Python's The Meaning of Life"(Not as good as "Monty Python and the Holy Grail".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suck my fat one you cheap dimestore hood.I'm 33 years old and, while I'm not going through some mid-life crisis(I know that I'm still young enough to not moan, groan &amp; bitch about "being an old man"), I seem to be at that point where the "prime of my youth" has passed by and movies like STAND BY ME give me a chance to reflect with fondness of those certain times with my brother as we slipped into the woods behind our house and had little adventures. Based on Stephen King's The Body, STAND BY ME starts with a macabre premise, four childhood friends go on a trek throughout Oregon country in the 50s outside their little town to find the corpse of a local kid missing for quite some time. It's a coming of age piece where these kids are about to enter Junior High, each contending with their own difficulties, mainly with parents who don't love them. Wil Wheaton has parents who are numb, having not recovered from the older son's death in a jeep crash(played by John Cusack, a star quarterback with a potential career squandered in a freak accident)and seem to ignore him. River Phoenix is Wheaton's best friend and confident, a true pal who is his moral center, an ear he desperately needs; Phoenix has a father who is always drunk and everyone considers the kid a hood with no potential later in life(although he would rise above all hurdles and become a lawyer whose fate as an adult would serve as a reminder for a much older Wheaton, portrayed by Richard Dreyfuss who also narrates, of the past while reading a sad newspaper article). Corey Feldman has a father in the "loony bin" and certainly harbors "anger issues", but uses humor as a means to combat what he feels underneath the surface. Jerry O'Connell, the clueless "fat kid", the object of playful ribbing, is the one who overhears his hoodlum brother(part of a wild gang led by the always charismatic Kiefer Sutherland)talking about stumbling across the dead body of the missing boy with another friend, telling the others which instigates the two day trip to find the corpse. STAND BY ME is about that moment in time when friends are at their closest, spending time with each other outside their unfortunate existences in rather unspectacular domestic environments. Real life was just ahead of them, but these two days allow the kids to have all sorts of experiences while apart from the unhappiness and disappointments that everyday brings. I can relate to them as my childhood wasn't exactly roses and dandelions either, but like those four, when I was away with my little brother out in the woods looking for adventure, I could also separate myself from what ailed me. Dreyfuss' narrative voice puts everything into perspective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest movies I think I will ever see,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this film. The summer before 7th grade when I was 12 (I'm 13 now) my mom recorded this movie for me while I was at my grandparents house over the summer. I came home and she's like "watch this, it's one of my favorite movies" (she grew up in the 80'). I watched it and I remember trying to figure out the meaning. I watched it a few more times and realized I fell in love with it!I understood all the characters feelings, about what its like growing up. I love all the characters and love all the things they go through. It just it makes you feel like your there and gives you this wonderful feeling. I hated it when Ace and his stupid gang would pick on them, and I laughed at all the funny scenes. I loved Teddy's laugh, Vern's scared face, Chris's emotion and Gordie's intelligence. Well, I downloaded it onto my iPod and bought the DVD, so I made sure my friends saw it. Of course they all liked it. Me and my friend Jodi were always "skinin it" and me and my younger friend Meghan still dance to "Lollipop". And for some crazy reason I feel the urge to dodge train near where my dad lives. I did read the story to get more background on the characters and what happened after they went home, all I can say is Stephen King is the "King" :) Very good in how he describes adolesnce.I can relate to how Gordie said he never had friends like the ones he did when he was 12. I know that sounds funny since I'm only 13, but I've lost a few friends. My best best friend Jodi moved to the city, and I miss her, we still talk but I doubt if we can ever meet up again. We had some great times together, we did some stupid stuff that got us in trouble but we have memories. My friend Karina is moving next week to the "city", so thats another friend missing from the lunch table.Friends really do come in and out of your life just like busboys at a restaurant... &lt;3</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film based in the 1950's that's a good coming of age story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It had been many years since I had watched "Stand by Me" and after just seeing it again I realized it had been one of my favorites growing up as a kid. Really it's just fabulous a good coming of age story about growing up as when everyone sees they can relate to their childhood of growing up and being with friends and having fun in the summer all along while dealing with acceptance, uncertainty, and just dealing with the journey of life. Rob Reiner who directed does a fine job adapting from Stephen King's novel that's told by a grown adult who's all grown up played by Richard Dreyfuss who tells about the summer of 1959. And when the film flashes back his youth character is played by Wil Wheaton and it tells of his summer journey with his three friends(River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, and Jerry O' Connell)who set across the Oregon landscape of wilderness and timber to search for a dead body of a boy who's been missing. A good turn is given by Kiefer Sutherland who's tough as the local bully. Overall a film of friendship and most important it's about the coming of age and learning thru the experience and journey of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rediscovered the movie, rediscovered me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no plot outline in here, come to think of it this is not even actually a real "review"I was 7 years old when Stand By Me was released. I didn't see it right away. I guess I first saw it when I was around the same age as Gordie, Vern, Chris and Teddy. I remember being impressed at the guys' performances, and almost feeling as if I'd just made 4 new friends after seeing the movie.Little did I yet know how profound an impact this film would have on my life. "Coming of age" for any generation is a difficult and confusing time. Things tempt you this way and that, not all of them positive. Suffice it to say, I gave in to most of the negative temptation. In some ways, Chris (River Phoenix) was the character I most identified with as I saw the movie again as a late-teen. But, I also admitted there was a whole lot of Gordie in me too. And just a little Vern...and perhaps even a touch of Teddy. That's what so great about this movie. I was revisiting old friends. At that time, as the movie ended with Chris fading away, was the first time I was to confront demons controlling my life, and say to myself, "maybe I CAN..." I wasn't strong enough until years later, lost in a haze at some god-forsaken hour of the morning, barely waking to that soft tune that opens the film. Somewhere, a memory triggers and I'm back there, in sunny days with the smell of mown grass in my nostrils, chasing that girl with the ribbons and climbing trees, sitting down in front of a hearth-like family TV and watching Stand By Me all those years ago.To credit a simple film with turning my life around for the better would be melodramatic, and inaccurate, but like it's title, this film has "stood by me" for as long as I can remember. I find myself humming that beautifully soft version of Ben E King's famous song for days after I've watched it.And no, I've never had any friends since, like the ones I had when I was 12.</fullReview>

We saw this film at school, and when the class ended, we had only gotten through half of the movie! I couldn't wait till the following week to see the rest! I was so desperate that i watched every clip ever made about the film on the web, and i read most of the reviews. The characters were so wonderfully acted. Especially River Phoenix, i found the milk-money scene so touching it made me cry...in class! I recommend this movie to everyone. I love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You are 12 years old.You know nothing and are curious about everything.You surround yourself with friends who have that same distinction.You are in those tender years,your last years as a child.It's the best time in a person's life,or at least it should be.This is what Stand By Me represents to me personally.It isn't a story about four particular boys.It's a story about all of us and what we go through in those years.This is an excellent story,brilliantly casted and superbly directed by Rob Reiner.Kiefer Sutherland is profoundly convincing as the chief heavy,and perhaps deserved an Oscar nomination if he didn't receive one.Upon watching the film again for the first time in several years,I found that particular scene where River Phoenix's character,Chris Chambers,fades away as he walks off in the distance particularly sad.Little did we know then that this young man,who was perhaps the best young actor of his generation,would do just that only seven years later,dying tragically at the age of 23.The scene now has a profound sadness to it.Stand By Me is one of the best character studies I have ever seen,and an excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stand By Me would have to be one of the greatest films of all time.I first saw the film when I was about 8 years old(even though I was meant to be sleeping), and even though I didn't understand most of what they were saying I still found it a great film.I rediscovered the film at the ripe old age of ( I'm not joking)12 going on 13. And soon thereafter elected it to be my favorite film of all time.The acting was of a standard I had never seen before. I mean you could really believe that they were real people, not just characters played by actors. Unbelievably talented ones at that. Stand By Me is the kind of film where you can laugh along with the characters, and cry with them to(and cry I'm sure many of you Stand By Me fans did). The kind of film that, each time you watch, you find something you missed the time before. This film reminds you that life is short, and friendships are much shorter. Most of all this film makes you believe in yourself, even though others may not.</fullReview>

His acting was phenomenal! When he broke down and spilled out his emotions I felt his pain.

		<fullReview>Director: Rob Reiner Writer: Raynold Gideon, Bruce A. Evans, Stephen King"F*** writing, I don't want to be a writer. It's stupid, it's a stupid waste of time."F*** writing? Wait, F*CK writing? Wow, such an explicit statement for such a young UN-prodigal son to make. It's a surprise that his tongue isn't full with suds and bubbles, isn't it?Well, Stephen King's outlook on writing may be a little over the top, but at least he shades in the areas of self-criticism. I couldn't put down "The Stand", when I first opened it at age 15. "The Green Mile" serial was also a mainstay in my young paws. But other brands of King have always eluded my attention span. I never got into his shorts, because I was forever caught in the glare of the unworthy mentions such as "It" and "Thinner," amongst other total page flopper's.However, the cast and crew of the turning-of-age film "Stand By Me" must have been just caught in the time-period and all of it's everlasting glory. It's hard to believe that this movie was made in the depths of the 1980's, when throw-back moments may have been high, but more high on cocaine than on the plateau of self-awareness as portrayed in this milestone of modern film-making.You could cry at this movie, and with it, but never figure out why. Thirty laughs practiced for young Corey Feldman, and you wonder why. You'll wonder why, and you'll never figure out who it is that River Phoenix character will remind you of from your own life. But you'll pine out of the miseries that you've experienced, for at least two solid hours, those moments you've left in the distant past, yet so close to your heart.A strange thing, even the young actors of the piece seem to be left-overs from a better, more innocent, and golden era when rock and roll was skittish, time moved so slow it appeared to whiz by at the bat of an eye. You can almost see the horseflies try to land on the camera lens, and in some of the more poignant parts of the film, you almost wish you could see the director's wastebasket filled with Kleenex.Sure, it's an oldie but goo-die, but when the oldies are blaring from your television speakers, no DVD does it better for the amount of nostalgia offered here. I've seen this movie about 20 times, and it simply doesn't get old enough, to make it any easier to stand by and watch the children that we wish we knew and had as friends, wander through life whimsically yet in an education of the mind body and soul. Your heart may thump through their escapades along the train tracks of life, but you won't forget for a second that this is when and where life should have stayed.Guns, cigarettes, booze, dead people, life-threatening situations and suspense, and yet all we are doing is watching a future journalist sling around with his cheerful crew of buddies. Nothing better to do in the summertime, no better lie to make to escape the harsh realities of post-war America and it's constant discrimination and powerful discontent that ran like a leaky water faucet through the seventies.Rob Reiner, hats off, good man. You've created the masterpiece that should be required watching for all middle-grade schoolers of the world. Turn the thinking off, and enjoy one classic that will never be forgotten."Look, you guys can go around if you want to. I'm crossing here. And while you guys are dragging your candy asses across the state and back, I'll be waiting for you on the other side relaxing with my thoughts."STAND BY ME (1986) 10/10Actors: Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Conner, Kiefer SutherlandCinematographer: Thomas Del Ruth Music: Jack Nitzsche Editor: Robert Leighton</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best puberty film to date. A haunting tale of friendship and death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched Stand by Me shortly after my father passed away when I was 9 years old. The film tackles the experience of children having to deal with death for the first time of their lives, and naturally I was sucked into the plot and the character's vivid adventures as they stroll between childhood and puberty. Plus, tell me another film where you get the chance to see so many young talents get together before some elevate to stardom and others fade away? Stand by Me includes young Jerry O'Connell (Sliders), Wil Wheaton (Star Trek: The Next Generation), Kiefer Sutherland (24), the late River Phoenix, 80's child star Corey Feldman (Gremlins, The Goonies), as well as Richard Dreyfuss and John Cusack. Director Rob Reiner's assemble cast tells the story of friendship, childhood and death and stays with you long after you finish watching it.</fullReview>

Be sure and watch the Featurette on the DVD and you will see that this film deeply touched every one who was a part of it.Surprisingly this is a Stephen King story that does not have anything supernatural in it and yet at the end of the movie River Phoenix prophetically disappears as he is walking away into a field.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not going to belabor the point everyone makes about this "genuine" story, how it's true-to-life, all that. Perhaps some people like this kind of life. Perhaps others didn't experience something different, but I, having grown up in two metropolitan cities, find the lives of young people portrayed here, well, empty and reminiscent of other "docu-dramas" like Kids. Indeed, even adults, as portrayed variously by the junk-yarder and his dog, and those at the pie-eating contest, are no more than grown-up teenagers.Why is meth so pervasively destructive in rural counties and states from Kentucky to Kansas? Why are mass shootings disproportionately a suburban/rural phenomenon? I don't won't to cross the line here, but Stand By Me, while undoubtedly poignant and innocent, is deeply unsettling to me, simply because of that which made it great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After having read the short story "The Body" by Stephen King!.I have to say that I feel this film is a very good adaptation of the story.And in some parts improves on the story. The Plot: After his main friend had been killed.Writer Goride Lochance,looks back on a summer in Castle Rock.When he was in his pre-teens.That summer he and three friends (Chris,Teddy and Vern).Who are also helping to support Gordie after his brother sadly died.One day Vern hears his brother and his friends talk about finding a body.The body is of Roy Bower,Who the police have been looking for as a missing person for along time.So Gordie and his friends go on a adventure, and a coming-of-age for all of them. View on the film:The Screenplay: Written by Raynold Gideon and Bruce A.Evans.They make sure the the film moves at a very fast pace. (I feel the short story took a bit to much time to get really going)While most of the flashbacks from the short were taken out,I feel,it makes the movie a lot more easier to know whats happening in the plot.They also make sure to keep the "strong" dialogue scenes from Kings story,while adding really great ones that blend in well with the story ("If Plutos a dog,then whats Goffy?).The only bit that I am unsure about is why the ending was changed,from all of the friends dying,to just one of them.This still has to be,one of the best adaptation of Kings work (wich are usually a bit,lets say "shacky) but this one stands out great.The cast: All of the cast (who were mostly unknown at the time)all work great together,and make you feel that they are really a group of friends.The main part of the film,that you feel the actors brought a lot in and made stronger,is the relationship with Gordie (Wil Wheaton) and Chris (the late River Phoenix),who both in there "breakdown" scenes show great emotion and make the characters more real.The events that happened to Phoenix in real life,makes the ending a lot sadder,then what it was meant to be.Kiefer"24"Suthland,does a really good job in this at playing a very strong,creepy bad guy.(Which is something he used again for The Lost Boys).Direction:Directer Rob Reiner(who would re-team with King,to do Misery),does a really good job at making the setting feel like a very real small town.He also does a really good job at knowing t focus on the people and the story,and not just fill the screen with lots of gore (something that most people get wrong when making a Stephen King story into a film). Final view on the film:The first and still,one of the best book-to-screen movies.And one for anyone who has any great friends will enjoy seeing,or being a fan of Its A Wonderful Life style movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a rare change of pace from his usual nightmarish horror stories, author STEPHEN KING has crafted a well meaning &amp; very heart felt &amp; touching tale, about four boys in the 60's who go looking for the corpse of a dead boy who was hit by a train &amp; killed, but his body never was never found, learning of a reward to anyone who can find the body, four young boys set out in a couple days journey to try &amp; find it &amp; claim the money for themselves, along the way to search for the body, the boys share a bond over that period of time, amidst several adventures that are both humorous &amp; in one scene involving a train, pretty terrifying. I really loved &amp; enjoyed this film, it was so very well written &amp; just one of the kinds of drama's that just does not get made anymore, the actors all had chemistry, their characters were very interesting, the music, dialog, direction &amp; pace was so well done, that you'll want to watch it again, unlike most drama's being made recently, this gives you very young teen characters that you can root for &amp; get behind, you definitely won't be bored with this one, the only down fall I see, is the occasional out burst of profanity, that ruin the film at times (Most of which spews forth from the mouths of the older teen boys that are enemies of the young boys) Highly recommended, don't miss this film! **** stars</fullReview>

I thought the story line was good; maybe because I could identify the four boys with my own childhood at that age before girls came into the picture. The acting was good although at times I missed the dialog &amp; had to reverse the tape to "catch" what the boys said. My only criticism was that expressions were used that were more contemporary than the 50's, and I find it hard to believe that twelve year old living in the early 50's used so many four lettered words.In any case, it is a good film; down to earth; excitement particularly the "train scenes" and a picture of North American Life in the 50's.

Some surprises, at least for me, include: Rob Reiner and Richard Dreyfuss were friends back when they weren't much older than the kids in this movie.Jerry O'Connell was scared to death of Kiefer Sutherland, which was probably on purpose, as Jerry's character was supposed to fear Kiefer's.It was touching to hear the guys talk about River Phoenix, and amazing seeing him alive again in the music video, hamming it up with Wil Wheaton and Ben King.In other words, I enjoyed this very much!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, adapted from a book by Stephen King, is not like most of the horror films you may come to expect from this author. While yes, there is a sense or morbidity, this movie is really more about that moment in your adolescence when everything is changing, yet everything is just right. Stand By Me is about four boys who take a trip to see a dead body, and on the way find themselves growing up. There is just the right mix of boyhood (the fart jokes, the rhyming insults, the play-wrestling) and adulthood. The boys enjoy their time, yet are always looking ahead at school next year and whether their friendships will last. River Pheonix delivers an amazing performance as the kid that no one has faith in, and is one of the best child actors I have ever seen. When I heard that he was dead, I was disappointed; he would've been an even more amazing actor later on. Keifer Sutherland also did well as 'Ace', the bully chasing the four boys. He was sufficiently frightening enough to keep us on our toes throughout the movie. This movie is sweet, with a large dose of nostalgia. You want to remember when you were 12, what it was like. You want the boys to succeed in their future, which seems so uncertain. All in all, the line that really sums it up is the last line of the movie: "I never had friends quite like the ones I had when I was 12 years old. But h***, does anybody?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I enjoyed "Stand By Me", based loosely on Stephen King's childhood recollections, it didn't do anything special for me, other than remind me of my own childhood. Set in 1959, the four boys here are about 12, almost the same age I was in 1959. I, too, had three other friends and we roamed about the neighborhood and the woods, in our own little world mainly absent of grown-up supervision, occasionally getting into small troubles. And, of course, smoking cigarettes pilfered from our parents and using the same type of "salty" language we see in this movie. Very realistic, and very well done. I found the DVD at my local library.SPOILERS. The movie opens in 1985, and we see a lone vehicle on a rural road, inside "writer" Gordie Lachance (Richard Dreyfuss) reads about the death of his old friend Chris and the movie becomes one big flashback to 26 years earlier. The four young friends were Gordie, Chris (River Phoenix), Teddy, and Vern. They were often bullied by the older boys in town, led by "Ace" (Kiefer Sutherland). Chubby Vern is under his porch looking for his own buried treasure of pennies when he overhears his older brother talk about spotting a dead body near the tracks in a remote place. So the boys set out for an adventure, toting camping gear, and head down the tracks. On a trestle bridge, a close call as a train passes. Slugs in the water pool. And finally the body, a boy who had been missing. The older boys show up, and with a gun they brought along, the younger boys chased them off.In many ways that two-day journey changed the way the boys looked at life. We can draw our own conclusions about how the older boys might have taken revenge after everyone was back in town. An interesting story, but a minor movie in my view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the death of one of his friends writer Gordie Lachance (Dreyfuss) recalls an unforgettable summer 26 years ago that involved finding a dead kid. Set in 1959 the story follows four 12 -year old boys Gordie Lachance (Wheaton) , Chris Chambers (Phoenix), Teddy Duchamp (Feldman) and Vern Tessio (O'Connell). They set out on a crazy adventure to find the body of Ray Brower (Luttrell) , four months ago Gordie's brother Denny (Cusack) died in a terrible car accident and this makes Gordie want to find that kid more than anything. What the boys don't know is that a gang of local bad boys including Ace (Sutherland) are also hot on the trail. Now it's a question to see which group will find Ray Brower first. Stand By Me is one of the most poignant films of the 1980's and still remains a favorite today. This film shows how important it is to be there for each other through good times and bad times. 9/10 Stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delightful film that everyone should see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Believe it or not, Stand By Me was written by the king of horror, Stephen King. Stand By Me is a great film that also shows Stephen King can write much more than horror stories. If you want to see some more Stephen King movies that aren't horror you should see The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile.Stand By Me is a delightful and entertaining film. The basic plot is about how four middle school boys decide to go on a trip into the woods to find the body of a missing kid their age. All of the kids have troubles of their own in their life. Throughout their trip into the woods, they encounter many things that they deal with in their own way, and at the end when they encounter the biggest of them all, they realize who they really are inside.The language might be a little bit rough for some younger kids, but I think this is an important and inspirational film that every kid should see. For all of you adults out there, this might remind you of when you were kids, and everyone out there who is a kid should see this and see how it affects you. This is a film that I'll never forget, so maybe you'll feel the same way about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good; one of the best King adaptions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*minor spoilers*It's strange that the best Stephen King films are derived from his non-horror works. For example, "The Shawshank Redemption" has no supernatural elements whatsoever, yet it is almost universally regarded as the best of an otherwise unremarkable group. It's hard to believe that such a fine film originated from a writer whose works spawned such disreputable films such as the lame "Children of the Corn" and the infamous "Maximum Overdrive," which got bad reviews, but it wasn't completely terrible. Director Rob Reiner's acclaimed coming-of-age tale, "Stand by Me," belongs on the admittedly short list of successful King adaptions. Inspired by his novella, "The Body," it demonstrates the bestselling author's skill at creating well-drawn characters, further brought to life by a talented cast and production crew.One might make the mistake of thinking that "Stand by Me" is some ordinary teen melodrama, but the film is more than the sum of its genre conventions. Reiner balances drama, humor, and suspense with ease, never losing us with abrupt shifts in tones. No matter what the scene entails, it never seems forced or jarring. They are all elements in the human drama. There's a masterful setpiece of suspense involving a train, which grabs hold of the viewer and makes one wonder how the characters will escape this particular predicament. Not long after, there's a story-within-a-story, told as a campfire tale about the disgusting outcome of a pie-eating contest. I admit it's pretty gross, but it's something one would expect young boys to discuss with their peers. The ending is another good suspense scene, refreshing in its refusal to wuss out, as similar films are wont to do.The young cast pulls it off with aplomb. In their hands, each character is a fully-rounded human being, not a group of stereotypes. The standout is River Phoenix; even when he was so young, he demonstrated an astounding range, exceeding most performers twice his age. It is a great loss to the acting profession that he has since lost his life to drug abuse. Wil Wheaton has earned a degree of infamy for his portrayal of Wesley Crusher in "Star Trek: The Next Generation," but in this movie he proves that he can act. Corey Feldman faced the challenge of portraying a mentally unbalanced kid, certainly not an easy thing for a child actor to do, but he makes the character completely credible. Jerry O'Connell's character is a bit annoying, but at least he makes him a believable human being. Kiefer Sutherland is burdened with the most thankless role in the film, as a gang leader, but his acting skills temper the shallowness of his character, whose screen time is thankfully limited."Stand by Me" is not a "plot movie," but a character study. It deals with how different personalities interact and conflict, hopefully coming to a better understanding of the fact. This is true even under the most ideal circumstances, but in a life-altering situation, bonds and alliances are seriously put to the test. In this case, the main characters embark on a journey to find a dead body, but given the outcome of the story, I doubt that they would have done so had they known what was going to happen. In the end, they are wiser, but not nearly as happy.*** (out of ****)Released by Columbia Pictures</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another gem for the master of variety.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rob Reiner has only directed twelve movies over sixteen years including one TV movie and they are almost all completely different. From A Few Good Men (1992) to When Harry Met Sally (1989) to Ghosts of Mississippi (1996), he does not seem to concentrate on one movie genre. My favorite Rob Reiner movie is without a doubt A Few Good Men (1992) and now, a close second is Stand By Me (1986) which has absolutely no link or resemblance with his other movies.There is no kid who wouldn't be intrigued at the opportunity of seeing a dead human body. He would be even more intrigued if seeing that dead body involved a two-day trip with your best buddies and sneaking behind your parents' backs. In these kinds of situations, reason seems to escape a child and excitement takes over. This is at the center of the script of the movie. There is a second part which is not as visible at first, but when you come to think of it, it is the most important part of the script. This second part is courage. Courage of accomplishing a dream, courage of facing the truth, and courage of standing by one another. This kind of courage is what allows us to determine which of the four boys is the movie's hero.Four boys, Gordie (Wil Wheaton), Chris (River Phoenix), Teddy (Corey Feldman), and Vern (Jerry O'Connell) decide to go searching for the dead body of a young boy their age named Ray Brower.We find out that Gordie had a brother, Dennis (John Cusack) who was killed in a jeep accident quite recently and was very close to Gordie. In fact, Dennis plays a major part in Gordie's trip. It seems that all four boys have something that allows them to be in a class of their own. Gordie had his brother to whom he looked up to and who loved him. Chris is a kid who comes from a bad family and has inevitably turned out bad as well. He also has an older brother who everyone calls Eyeball (Bradley Gregg) and has become a total bum. Teddy's father was in the second World War and stormed the beach of Normandy, a fact of which Teddy is very proud. But his father turned bad after his return and nearly killed his son by putting his ear to a stove. His father was then sent to a mental institution. Finally, we have Vern. The only standout characteristic Vern has is that he had buried a jar of pennies under his porch and his mother accidentally threw away the map he had drawn for it.So these four kids are somewhat special and get along great. But there is another bunch of kids in the movie. The bad bunch. This bunch includes Chris's big brother Eyeball, Vern's big brother Billy (Casey Siemaszko), his friend Charlie Hogan (Gary Riley), two other guys whose names are unknown to the viewer and finally, a seventh one who turns out to be the gang leader, a kid who everyone calls Ace (Kiefer Sutherland). Apart from being the gang leader, Ace is also the craziest and most dangerous kid in that gang.The important part of the story is how Vern learns about the dead body. As he was looking for his pennies under the porch, he overheard his brother Billy and Charlie discussing how they found the body after having stolen a car and gone for a ride in the woods where the dead boy's body was. However, the two boys finally tell Ace and Eyeball about the body and the whole gang decide to go looking for him to become famous. But the young boys are also in the woods and this is where things get very tricky and almost deadly.The all-star cast is probably the best part of the movie. River Phoenix is probably the one who gives the best performance as Chris Chambers, the young boy who turns out to be, at least in my mind, the movie's hero. A close second in the acting category is Kiefer Sutherland who is absolutely abominable as Ace. There are two great scenes in which Phoenix and Sutherland confront each other showing Chris's gift to be able to stand up for his friends and defend them and Ace's personality which is pretty much to take no crap off anyone and be as big a bully as possible. Reiner's direction is very good as well with his unpredictable camera movements and shots. A great movie all-around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An okay film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when I was a freshman in high school. It kind of reminded of the 1993 movie, "The Sandlot" only it was far more serious than that. It was about four kids who came from dysfunctional families and were out to find a dead body. They came along many obstacles such as trains and mean teenagers. Although I liked this movie, one part I was disgusted with was the scene where Gordy (played by Wil Wheaton)had a leech bite him in the you know where. That must have been pretty painful. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give this movie a 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Affectionate enough tale of four youngsters discovering all kinds of strife and truths, under a canopy of highly delicate comedy and enjoyable characterisation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a point in Rob Reiner's pleasing 1985 film Stand by Me in which the primary characters themselves, in the form of four young boys of around about double figures in age, identify the trip they're all going on as anything but "just a load of fun" or an excuse to "have fun" or that they 'ought' to be having fun. Where the allure of doing something a little rebellious and sneaking off with three friends for a few days so as to visit a yet undiscovered crime scene sounded like a great time prior to taking off, it is only half way through the journeying that the real world out and away from your home does not necessarily adhere to your initial vision. In a certain sense, we feel the same way about the film: an unobtrusive and light hearted comedy about a bunch of boys breaking all the rules and having fun in the process on the surface but something much more beneath that. There is nothing funny about what the four primary child characters go through in Stand by Me, nothing funny about the realities they face nor what it is they both experience and learn as a result of what they do. Like the boys at the soul of the film itself going through what they're going through, the audience themselves are invited to take a step back and really mediate on what it is we truly think about what's transpiring before our eyes.The story of the four boys is narrated to us by a certain Gordie Lachance, the later incarnation of whom is portrayed by Richard Dreyfuss in the then present day 1980s with Wil Wheaton playing the younger version from some thirty years previously. His friends, with whom he lives in a close knit Oregon community in the latter stages of the 1950s, are Chris Chambers (Phoenix); Teddy Duchamp (Feldman) and Vern Tessio (O'Connell), together forming a quartet of really well rounded, engaging characters whom end up in a flurry of situations both before and during the venturing out to a rural zone on the outskirts of town that it has been heard harbours the dead body of another young boy. LaChance sits idly in his vehicle to the side of a country road in the immediate opening, sighing with a tone of regret at a newspaper story detailing the death of someone. A group of kids cycle past him, they garner his attention and ours in that the following track-in on LaChance results in a flashing back to his own childhood which, like the physical manifestation of the boys whom just went by, has indeed passed him by.The set up sees a somewhat bubbled existence within the Oregon town of Castle Rock established to be life's norm. The kids spend most of their spare time in a secluded tree house away from everybody else laughing and joking at each other's expense in-between humbling information usually linked to troubles at home provided by the narrator on each of the other three involved. The sense of the community being closely knitted feels prominent, a scene showing one of the boys in Chris receiving a harmless enough lift from a truck driver to meet up with one of the other boys establishing a worry-free sense of togetherness in this small, enclosed world of your bog-standard adolescent living through crude humour; practical jokes; the coming to terms with home truths which itself comes with an odd sense of alienation from one's parents as well as the threats posed from local bullies.The few or so days they spend out of this enclosed circle of a functioning world that is their home town does not dictate precisely where it is they will all end up in life, but Stand by Me is not a film aiming for expansive frills revolving around somebody's entire life story. Instead, effort has been inserted into detailing what goes on in and around the local area of forestry located on the outskirts of said town and how more immediate attitudes can shift. An amusing short-story to do with Vern's inability to find a jar of money he secretly buried in the dirt under his house's porch acts as the catalyst for the film to revolve around these four kids and their venturing out yonder across train tracks and through the countryside in an attempt to find the dead body of a boy whom was supposedly struck down by a train. His brother Billy (Siemaszko), one of a number of gang dwelling bullies headed by Kiefer Sutherland's Ace Merrill, informs a friend of his of said body with Verne underneath eavesdropping.With win of the info; barely enough supplies to see out the journey; a charming script which allows time for these four to bond and share small talk with each other as well as a young, abundance of energy in tow: the boys set off on a trip which they will remember for as long as they are alive. Reiner has them predominantly stick to some train tracks; their doing so in a bid to eventually guide them to their prize a somewhat iconographic deployed. The tracks below them are representative of the firm, formulated, entrenched arc they're on in both a literal and metaphorical sense in that they can lead only to what they discover in the form of the dead body as well as inside of themselves in relation to the journey itself. There are no deviations, not on the permanently fixed road upon which they tread nor the metaphorical road the four of them have landed themselves on: all paths lead to what discoveries must occur up ahead. Under Reiner's careful, watchful and astute direction combined with a worthy screenplay; Stand by Me stands as a wonderful documenting of four young characters undergoing a rounded process of realisation and hardship.</fullReview>

I live in Australia &amp; i love to get movies on dvd, so i saw a kmart catalogue with this movie on dvd for $14.95, i went crazy over the cheap price for it, so i went to kmart they had about 15 dvds advertised for $14.95 but out of them only Stand By Me was out of stock, so i went to a few more kmarts 4 in total &amp; 2 i called up, so 6 stores didnt have them in stock, then i tried Big W ( another store like kmart ) i tried 3 of their stores, &amp; none of them had it in stock. So i was getting worried that i wont get this on dvd, i decided to call a big w store near the city, which is about an hours drive from my house, &amp; they had 1 in stock, so i go very excited &amp; said could u guys hold it for me, ill be there tomorrow to pick it up, &amp; thats how i got it. When i got it home i watched it that same day. I liked this movie even more than i thought i would, the direction, the acting by the four future stars, &amp; the music through out the whole movie was just amazing. Never have i seen such good acting by amateur youths, Rob Reiner was a very helpful director towards the 4 young stars. I'd give this movie 10/10, its up there in the top 10 movies of all time, &amp; should be seen by every family in the world.A TRUE CLASSIC</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was like that baseball girl, who got thrown out at home. Except there aren't any girls in it except for maybe this waitress who looks like Big Bird and thinks a gun and a cherry bomb are the same thing. These 4 kids want to visit this other kid in a different town, so they make up excuses to leave home and walk around railroad tracks. That other kid's dead though, so it was definitely a good idea to bring a comb.One of the kids is like Crisco. Fat in the can, and digging holes under the porch because you can't buy much food for 7 cents. You get to hear about an even fatter kid who can make people puke on each other, because cartoons can't beat up real guys.I don't really want to think about guys prancing through the woods singing songs about lollipops or sitting around in wet tighty-whiteys yanking bugs off each other. And I definitely wouldn't want anyone Standing By ME if I had to pick giant swamp-roaches out of my undies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stand By Me (1986) was a pedestrian adaptation of the novella THE BODY. The direction by Rob Reiner was real good by the script was bad and it was too white bread for my taste. That's what I liked about the story, anyone could relate to it but when it's milked through by a hack writer and pacified for mainstream audiences it becomes bland and generic. But the acting form the kids was real good and it's watchable but not as great as soon many people make it out to be.STAND BY ME follows the main character Gordie as he relives his long lost childhood. A recent tragedy brings upon long lost memories of his old playmates. We relive that hot summer of 1960 and learn about the main characters and the trials and tribulations of growing up. One day, the summer of their innocence was lost forever when one of their friends tells them some news and takes them on adventure. A long one that re-examines their lives and what lies ahead of them in the future.Not a bad movie and not a classic. But if you're a fan of River Phoenix or his eighties running buddy Corey Feldman then you'll be in heaven. But fans of the book might not be that stoked about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's all so clean here, let's start there. It is a bit like The Goonies, but more internal. It is about four kids on adventure, the destination is a dead body deep in the woods which by discovering, they hope to be the heroes of their small town. It's as clean as old Hollywood, in fact much of the framing reminds me of a 1950's film, which is when the film is taking place. Unlike Spielberg's kids, these smoke and curse, but you still know it for what it is, kids acting kids. The acting is clean, movieish. Its narrative and metaphors are clean as can be.It's a fun watch, but the journey is meant to be more?one of growing up, coming to terms with messy adult life and learning to pick yourself up on the way. It's from a Stephen King story. Reiner and King are effective together, if you liked Princess Bride chances are you will like this?it is all a story a grownup writes probably for his own kids to read.So it's fine the way it is, but somewhat narrow from the adult perspective. It is clean as the stories we construct, but not messy like we remember which is a whole other thing, at root one of the fundamental issues of cinema. How do we remember? In a visual way. What does it mean that we do?It's all there, however. So take out the ending that cleanly separates reality from memory from the fiction about it.It's a journey to a dead kid, inevitable future. At least three of the kids have family issues, foreshadowing damaged lives. And as counterpoint, a gang of teenage punks is on their way to the same place, possible future selves.It's all a daydream, triggered by newspaper news of death and two kids on bikes dashing by on a lazy afternoon.Knowing all this, how would you remember?(What's really potent is knowing how River Phoenix, one of the kids here, sought escape from his own life).</fullReview>

( He may be right to a large extent) And my little sister a lot of people like this movie outside my girlfriend who today on a re-watch probably my 20th watch of this movie in 20 years said it is not her cup of tea but she is only 20 and her favorite films include the likes of Grown Ups so take that what you will.One of the main reasons my dad liked this film was it was an all around fun ride abut kids growing up in the 50s just like him.Corey Feldman, Jerry O Connel, the main character Gordy, the late River Phoenix, And Keifer Suherland all did a great job. Even Cusack who players Gordys late bother did alright in the scenes made for him.A lot of good scenes, quotes, memorable dialogue, a fun adventure that will not soon be forgotten. Top marks for this classic.9-10, do watch it. It is one of those special movies with a great message.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rob Reiner is a great film maker. This first film is a masterwork. Carl Reiner did something right; he sired this fine filmmaker. I could babble for some time about how splendid this movie is. I watched it in 1992, when I was hospitalized for severe depression.My then young nephew liked the film. His dad visiting me recommended it when other patients insisted that I needed to see it. I did.As with all great movies, details count. Top-notch people worked on every aspect of this movie, but you feel Rob Reiner's voice at every moment and in every frame. I cannot think of a single film by Mr. Reiner that I have not enjoyed watching. I like his dad's work as well, even though I am sometimes abrasive in my criticism of his work. The best thing about this film is that it is a terrific story?from good writers but Mr. Reiner makes it work better than any other director I know might have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stephen King gets all the credit!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of Stephen King's novels, it was so important to me to view Stand By Me, a masterpiece both in film and literature. Stephen King is a phenomenal fiction writer and his novels Salem's Lot, It, The Shining, and, of course, Stand By Me, all of them being a film as well, scared the crap out of me while the film I am reviewing now, offered a sense of nostalgia and happiness mixed with a variety of emotions . It has been reported that Stephen King cried after seeing this film because it is the closest adaptation ever to one of his novels and I have to agree to that. Rob Reiner will be remembered as the man who made Stephen King cry and also for making a perfect piece of film making that will be remembered as long as humanity is in existence. The performances from Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, and Jerry O'Connell were the best in the whole film and not one of them I mentioned have ever stepped out of line or have made mistakes. The bad actors were Kiefer Sutherland, his bad boy acting was uncool and uncomfortable, and his whole stupid gang. They looked crap and acted sh*t. Pardon my French! The best character in the film was Vern because his humor, appearance, and his stupidity was enough to set the screen on fire. Hot! Hot! Now look at him, all bone and serious! Yuck! To be honest, I was expecting a boring old-fashioned film that would be in the bottom 100 but, boy, was I wrong. I loved it so much that it belongs in my personal top 100. The other lovely thing about this is the nostalgia it offered and it was one of the reasons why this earned a straight ten from me. I was about nine when I watched this and couldn't understand most of it but three years later after watching it again, I loved it! I could go on forever about how good this movie is and that is exactly what I am going to do. So if you hate long comments, dismiss reading this for any further and goodbye.Four f*cked up kids, who smoke, play poker, talk about pornography and a lot of other things, set out on a adventurous-filled journey after hearing news from a friend about a dead body somewhere outside of Maine. Their journey will be hard and secrets will be out as the foursome go through many hard and dangerous tasks. They think that after finding the body they will be famous and successful but they aren't the only ones who are after the body. A gang of bullies, led by Ace Merrill (Kiefer Sutherland), also find out about the body and it is only a matter of time before one of them reaches it first. And if one of them find it, what will happen next? The story's protagonist is a twelve-year old (I think) kid named Gordie Lachance, whose family is torn apart from his brother unexpected death, and his adventure with friends that changed his lives. His story is important and it sends out a message to everyone: there are no friends like your childhood ones. The film could have not succeed without a bold story like the one in this film. It most certainly would not!Note: SPOILERS FROM HEREON IN!! There are many exciting scenes that contain humor in this film and all of them are wonderful. I still remember the train scene out of the entire movie because it looked so real yet so funny. Vern trying to crawl across the tracks had me in stitches and his chubbiness made it even funnier and I almost screamed as they were going to get hit by the train but thankfully they jumped . Classic Vern! There was another scene where Gordie tells the bunch a story about Larda$$, a fat-A$$ who wanted to get revenge at a pie eating contest by puking on the audience, and that was a classical scene as well. There were some parts in the film which were somewhat disturbing, for instance, when the group have leaches stuck on their bodies after trying to cross a pond but that wasn't disgusting. A leach stuck on Gordie's balls was the disgusting bit and the blood on his hands made more of an effect. The thing that Stephen King is so good in is making fun of his writing, e.g. Gordie says, "F*ck writing. I don't want to be a writer, it's a stupid waste of time!". The film will be incomplete without the 50's soundtrack that made the film more like the date it is set in. The film didn't even win an Oscar, which it should have, but it is a fantastic film nevertheless and will be enjoyed for generations to come!P.S. Do Not rent this but buy it because a film like this deserves to be in every DVD collection and if you have viewed this film once, view it again and again and again. Did I leave out a again? Well that was my review, to read more click my name which is highlighted in BLUE. "Over and Out." 25 January 2010.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit overrated but good, the book was better in my opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stand By Me is a film i have seen a few times now.It was based on the Stephen King novella entitled "The Body", which can be found on his novella collection entitled "Different Seasons"(this also includes the novellas which were later made into the movies "Shawshank Redemption" and "Apt Pupil").The film features Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Connell and Keifer Sutherland.It's a fairly good movie about friendship, but I found it to be a little overrated.It's about these four boys in the 1950's, who go searching for a dead body in the woods during labor day weekend.It's a fairly good film, just not as good as everyone says it is.It's a pretty good movie for kids despite it being Rated R(only for a bit of language and the fact that the kids smoke cigarettes).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stand by Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the success of This Is Spinal Tap, Golden Globe nominated director Rob Reiner (Misery, A Few Good Men) brought out this fantastic coming-of-age drama. Based on a book called "The Body" by Stephen King, this film has Gordie Lachance, or The Writer (Richard Dreyfuss) looking back on his younger days when he and three close friends go on an adventure to find the body of a missing kid, presumed dead. The four characters are all lovable, including leader and best friend Chris Chambers (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade's River Phoenix), Gordie himself (Wil Wheaton), quite smart glasses wearing Teddy Duchamp (The Goonies' Corey Feldman), and large wimpy and simple minded Vern Tessio (Scream 2's Jerry O'Connell). Along the way, they encounter the junk yard owner and his legendary dog Chopper, a speeding train on a bridge they are walking on which they jump from, camp fire chats (including the hilarious Larass barfing story), crossing the lake of leeches, and ultimately, they become closer than they did before, if only it lasted. They are also being followed by older boys, trying to get their first, including hateful leader Ace Merrill (Kiefer Sutherland). Also starring Casey Siemaszko as Billy Tessio, Gary Riley as Charlie Hogan, Bradley Gregg as Eyeball Chambers, Jason Oliver as Vince Desjardins and then quite unknown John Cusack as Denny Lachance. They do eventually find the body, but cover it back up and respect it, and all kids hardly see each other afterwards, even after their close bonds. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. River Phoenix was number 69 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Outstanding</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four boys learn about the adult world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An Adventure That Touches the SoulThe film, 'Stand by Me' is based on a novella called 'The Body', by Stephen King and it was released in 1986. The film is based in the 1950s and is about a group of four children, Gordy, Chris, Vern and Teddy, who are aged around 12 years old, who come from a small town in Oregon, called 'Castle Rock'. The title of the film is eye catching and reaches the inner depth of the film, as the four friends have not had the great start in life and they rely on each other for comfort and support.The film follows the children as they set off on a journey to find the body of a boy called Roy Brower who had gone missing. The journey of the boys is along a train track. They have to overcome various perils on their journey such as leeches, trains and knife waving bullies. During their journey they find a lot out about themselves and each other through their continuous conversations. Another group of boys, who could be described as the 'bad lads' are also on the trail of the dead body and it comes to a competition of who will find the body first.I really liked the authentic 1950s setting of the film. This is because of the ways this was implemented. For example, the boys discuss hitch-hiking, which was probably the norm back then, but not now. I also liked the 1950s cars used and the country and western music. The music though is a very integral ingredient in the overall nature of the film. The song 'Stand by Me', by Ben E King is almost spiritual and heart breaking and adds to the authenticity by making the film seem older than it really is. The film also contains music that the children would have liked at that time such as 'Lollipop' by 'The Chordettes'. Throughout the film there are very specific special effects to build up the suspense such as slow motion and stills. The slow motion is very good at helping the viewer to concentrate on hidden detail such as facial expressions and hand and body movements. Another part of the film I liked was the implementation of the train track. This seems to have a symbolic meaning in the film, which I will discuss later. Also, the use of the track and steam trains makes the film seem more like a western than anything else. The film was over-all very good and could be classified as one of my favourites, but I found the beginning part quite slow, although this part does help the viewer to get to know the personalities of the characters involved, so this may be a good aspect. I also found the excessive vulgar language by the actors quite unnecessary and could not understand why it should be used in a film like this. Although other films have vulgar language and it seems today that it is the norm of any film, which has an age rating of over 12. The film contains four main characters. The narrator, Gordy is the most sensible member of the children. He has lost his older brother, who he had a very close relationship with and his parents are much traumatised. In the film Gordy has a dream about his brother's funeral, where his Father turns to him and says.'That should have been you Gordy'. There is no evidence given by Gordy whether this did actually happen. However, the viewer could believe that this did, due to the continual flashbacks that Gordy has of his bad home life. Another character is Chris, who comes from a bad family and is the leader of the children. He is very protective of Gordy and both of them give each other plenty of advice. Vern is the main source of humour in the film and could be described as the geeky character. Not much comes to light about his home background and he has a sense of humour that his character doesn't know he is using. The final main character is Teddy, who can only be described as a crazy character. He is abused by his Father, who is referred to as a loony. However, he is fiercely loyal to him and will not tolerate any comment made against him. There is also evidence in the film that he might even be slightly suicidal. I really liked the way the actors played their parts and also used their own personalities to enhance the overall attitude of the film. The other group of boys who are also looking for the body would not be liked by the audience, especially their leader who carries a knife as if he is pre-meditating a murder. I would like to say that I really enjoyed the film because of how suggestive it was. There was a difference in opinion between four 12 year old boys and the police. What would be a horrible search by the police is an eye opener and adventure for the four children. The film is a 'coming of age' production and the train track could be described as life that the children are leading or opinion, as they learn the terrors of the adult world. Also the four boys and their 'bad lad' followers are like good and evil, which meet at the end in a final showdown. The film could be described as funny, light-hearted, but ultimately deeply harrowing because of the nature of the plot. Star Rating ? 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here are the flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a beautifully shot, very entertaining movie that everyone should watch at least once. I've given it an 8. It is also a movie which bears absolutely no resemblance to reality on any level. Loads has been said about the wonderful acting (Wheaton's and Sutherland's performances carry the movie), the excellence of the simply told story, the great one-liners, etc, so I declare that this review will focus entirely on what sucks. This is one of the cases where Stephen King, master of the dark side, whose work is sometimes but mostly not outshone by the film adaptions, was more truthful with his version.Nothing very much happens that has any concrete repercussions in this movie - with one exception. Gordie persuades Chris to work hard at school. Chris does and becomes a successful lawyer. Chris dies wretchedly after being stabbed in a restaurant. The movie needn't have branded Gordie as being 'responsible', the point is not that Gordie murders Chris - the point in the original book is that horrendously tragic things have a habit of happening whatever you do. The failure of Gordie's attempt to save his friend is *the* key event of the book - which is why Vern and Ted die in that version. They don't die in the film (the correct decision), but the filmmakers totally glossed over this aspect. As a result, it doesn't remotely feel like Chris's character has died at the end of the film; we never see, say, a photo in the paper, of what he looked like grown up, and there's no sense of loss, because the movie concerns itself entirely with childhood. It would be easy to get heavy handed with this kind of thing (King, in fact, often, goes OTT in his fiction) but really, the movie treats the whole thing with kid gloves. There's no sense of the real darkness and terror of childhood whatsoever.There are a couple of technical problems. The actor playing Ted looks too old when he's got his glasses off (he's was 14, Phoenix was 15). More serious is the cop out with the body itself - the body is not that of a child at all, he looks 15 at the youngest. This seriously reduced the emotional impact of that part of the story for me - the book was subtitled "Fall from innocence". If The Body itself looks as much like an adult as an innocent, what kind of falling happens? The deer scene also bugged me because I read the book first - the deer stands about three feet away from him, for God's sake! Wild animals just don't behave like that, and it wasn't necessary for the scene at all. Less important is the one fairly large plot hole: that, as Ace and co have a car, there's no reason why they couldn't just drive back into town and reveal the location of the body, get the glory, etc, long before the boys walk back. Ultimately, though, this film succeeds in it's mission of appearing to say something deep in as nostalgic a way as possible. Cute children undergoing serious physical and emotional trials is one of the things the cinema was invented to depict (see Night Of The Hunter, E.T., Schindler's List, etc), and Will Wheaton's amazing cuteness is more than up to the job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All It Took Was A Two Day Trek to Search For A Dead Body to Convince Four Friends They Really Were Friends!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!] Our story begins in Castle Rock, Oregon in 1959 where young Gordie LaChance lived with his friends: Chris Chambers, a latch-key tough leader, Teddy DuChamp, a wacky flamboyant youth, and Vern Tessio, the scapegoat of the gang. Everyday these four would meet in their secret treehouse. One afternoon, Vern arrived late and told his friends about something incredible he had just overheard. He was under the porch when he heard local hooligans, Billy Tessio and Charlie Hoagan, talked about a dead body buried deep in the forest of Harlow. Chris, Teddy and Gordie really wanted to see that dead body, so they begin to make preparations for a hike to Harlow. They pack provisions, like sleeping bags, canteens, cigarettes. Chris even swiped his father's .45 magnum. He said it wasn't loaded but Gordie found out otherwise. Chris and Gordie were also accosted by more local hoodlums: Ace Merrill and Eyeball Chambers. Ace steals Gordie's baseball cap which had belonged to Gordie's older brother Denny who died in a car accident several months ago. Since Denny's death, Gordie's folks began acting like even bigger jerks to him than they already were; So the next day the friends set out on their trek. They follow the railroad tracks. They had to get off once because a train was coming. Teddy wanted to dodge it but Chris rescued him just in time. Teddy felt dignity stricken.  They continue along. They have a run-in with a "mean" junkyard dog and the junkyard's very cruel owner. But they just shook it off and continued. As they continued, Teddy and Vern got at each other's throats and Chris and Gordie confiding in each other. Chris convinced Gordie he had real potential. The tracks soon lead them to a wooden tressle over a vast river. They decided to just walk right across it. They watched out for trains. Pretty soon they were half way across when suddenly, they heard a familiar whistle and steam in the distance. A train was coming! Teddy and Chris made it to the other side, but Gordie went back to help Vern. The train was getting closer. They had no choice, so they jumped off the tressel. They survived, luckily, and that night, they sat around a camp fire and smoked cigarettes. Gordie told them all a story he had written. It was about a boy named Davy, nicknamed Lardass. Everybody was so cruel to him because of his weight, but one day he got even. It was at a pie eating contest. Before the contest, Davy drank down a whole bottle of castor oil and ate a raw egg. Well, Davy ate five pies, then stood up and blew chunks, which caused everybody else to blow chunks. Lardass had gotten his revenge. Back to the present, the boys come to a field and decide once again to just take a short cut. They come to a swamp. They decide to ford it...And sink. When they emerge, they have a lethal encounter with leeches. They consider turning back, but Gordie demanded they forge on. Well, they continued sticking to the tracks and soon...They found it. The dead body of young Ray Brower. But also just then, Billy, Charlie, Eyeball and Ace arrive then, seeing as how Billy and Charlie had found the body and then had blabbed about it to Ace and Eyeball. Chris told them to beat it, but Ace drew a knife and was about to kill Chris when Gordie pulled out Chris's gun. Luckily Ace and the hoodlums backed down, but they vowed vengeance. So, the boys decided to just leave the body and make an anonymous call to the sheriff then returned to Castle Rock. They were about to start middle school. After that, they didn't see much of Teddy and Vern. Vern got married in high school and became a fork lift operator. Teddy was rejected by the army and started working odd jobs. As for Chris and Gordie, Chris grew up and was killed by stab wound. Gordie became the writer he always knew he could be--with Chris's encouragement. He never forgot his friends or that wild adventure they had that summer. A very good film! Great performances by those kids. Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell. Kiefer Sutherland from '24' plays Ace. Also in the cast are Richard Dreyfuss and Bruce Kirby. This movie has comedy and great drama. The leeches scene was pretty intense. This movie is more of a drama than a comedy, but it still can be for everyone. If you like this kind of movie. It's about four boys who bond on a trip to find a dead body, the kind we all used to take when we were kids. You remember, don't you? This movie was directed by Rob Reiner (Michael "Meathead" Stivic from All in the Family). Just recently, South Park portrayed Reiner in a fashion I thought was just uncalled for. That was one of the worst episodes! Reiner also directed a wonderful movie called North in 1994. I recommend that one too! For now, I recommend Stand by Me! The best 87 minutes you will ever spend! It's rated R for alot of naughty language!-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The definitive movie for describing life through a twelve year olds eyes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll always say it, but Stephen King's no-horror stories are consistently far better than his horror. This is a shining example of a great story with a great script, that doesn't have an ounce of traditional horror in it. King knows how to write real people, very well. This will always be one of my favourites, it is lacking in a few places, but it is so succinct in others that you can't really complain. It manages to get a harrowing, enjoyable, simple and beautiful story into 90 mins and is riveting to watch. No other movie has captured the essence of being twelve so well. Forget the Goonies or Home Alone or any of that other stuff, this is a kids movie and an adults movie at the same time. It taps into how you miss being twelve, even when your thirteen! The characters are seen at a time just before they lose all innocence; before women come into there lives and change everything. This is a movie that always brings a smile to your face and can be watched time and time again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I can't understand why I haven't written a comment on "Stand by Me" until now, even though I watch it at least once a year. I guess it's difficult to explain why I love this film so much, I've basically grown up with it, I saw it for the first time when I was about ten years old and I have seen it so many times since because it is so good. The story is touching and true and real -- about the kind of friends you have when you are a kid, when those "best friends" are your world. This is without a doubt the best adaptation of a Stephen King story to date (together with The Shawshank Redemption). It's a very engrossing film, very funny, but also very sad. I especially like the two scenes with John Cusack. The four young leads are all brilliant, but ever since I saw it for the first time River Phoenix's performance is the one that has touched me the most. I really don't know how to put my feelings about this film into words so I'll just say: "Stand by Me" is brilliant, if you haven't seen it I feel sorry for you. (9/10)</fullReview>

Although the dialog is corny at times (i.e. "Stop it!"...if you've seen the film, you know what I mean.

		<shortDescription>Pain and pleasure of adolescence captured with unerring accuracy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you were ever a 12-year old boy, especially around the 1950's or '60's, I don't see how you can help but love this movie. For me I was won over when the four youngsters set off on their adventure to find a dead body and broke into the theme song from the old western, 'Have Gun, Will Travel.'No other film I've seen has presented the pain and pleasure of adolescence so vividly. Some of the scenes hit such raw emotional nerves that they make you cringe, not with embarrassment, but with recognition. The friendships depicted between the boys are as intense as any they'll ever have in their lives, although they may only last a year or two more. Director Rob Reiner, working from material provided by a master storyteller, Stephen King, has made a truly touching movie, showing us truths that every viewer will feel in the heart and in the soul.The four young actors at the center of the film (Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell) do a great job of depicting characters that almost everyone can relate to. Kiefer Sutherland is outstanding as a menacing juvenile delinquent who may stir up some nagging memories for anyone who was ever terrorized by a bigger, stronger kid. This is a film Reiner can be proud of and which compares favorably against the very best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as I expected, considering its reputation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Admittedly, this is not a bad movie. Quite the contrary, it's good enough to be reasonably enjoyable. It only wasn't as great as its high reputation suggests.This film is basically about 4 adolescent boys who go on an interesting quest (mostly by foot) to find the body of one of the boys's deceased brother. I gotta admit, it disappointed me a little that their quest was mostly to find a dead body, but the moment I knew it was one of the boys's brother, it made more sense to me. Even though I preferred their quest to be for a different reason, that's not the worst part.What really prevented me from ever seeing this again is the barf sequence. That is disgusting! Couldn't the boy who told that story have told them a different story instead of this crap? I mean, for God's sake! It reminded me of the infamous barf sequence in 'Problem Child 2' (itself an infamous film). The ending is another disillusion: what the boys do with their lives later, how Chris got murdered and the very last scene with a writer and two kids. The very last scene looks artificial - much more like a recent movie and not something from 25 years ago. I also didn't like the character Ace one bit (neither his gang). Pretty much it was these minuses that were a turn off to me, because otherwise it was a good movie although nothing spectacular.The boys's actings were nothing major, but okay. River Phoenix had the best and deepest acting of these 4 boys. He was a talented young actor who left us soon. The fact that his character here dies at the end makes me think of the actor himself because he went to the angels 7 years later.The film's title comes directly from the famous song by Ben E. King but is never once played in the whole movie except in the closing credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best ever adaptation of a Stephen King work ("The Body" from his book "Different Seasons"). In 1959 Maine, 4 12-year-old boys go to find a dead body. It's a 2 day journey and, along the way, one of them Gordy (Will Wheaton), grows and realizes things about himself.Yes, it's a coming of age story, but very well written, directed (in Oregon) and with mostly great performances. Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell are just OK as two of the boys. Wheaton is very good as Gordy and River Phoenix is exceptional as Chris--it's sad that he ODed at such a young age. Also Keifer Sutherland is chilling as the head of a teenage gang. Also John Cusack has a good small role and Richard Dreyfuss narrates the story.This movie perfectly captures what it's like to be a 12 year old boy growing up--the dialogue is just perfect. Some people complained about the excessive profanity in this (it IS R rated), but swearing did exist back in 1959. Well worth seeing.Don't see this on commercial TV: that version edits the language out and renders parts of the film incomprehensible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stephen King grows up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This nostalgic coming-of-age drama, set in rural Oregon during the late 1950s, carries four young boys through a rite of passage which, in effect, equals a confrontation with mortality, after they overhear rumors of a corpse discovered many miles down a railroad track and set off together to locate the body. The strengths and weaknesses of the script are often a direct reflection of its source (a Stephen King novella), with dialogue keenly tuned to the period (who was stronger, Superman or Mighty Mouse?), but overloaded with a superabundance of barf jokes, fart jokes, jerking off jokes, and so forth. It's too bad, because the film is miles above its competition, even with the totally unnecessary voice-over narration (read by Richard Dreyfuss) used to frame the central story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather simple tale of boys becoming men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Stand By Me" tells the story of a journey of discovery as four young boys trek across a state in the Southern U.S. in search of a dead body. Based upon Stephen King's novella "The Body", it has all the ingredients of a classic, but never really hits such heights.We are introduced to the tale and guided through it by Gordon Le Chance (Richard Dreyfuss), one of the boys who has now grown up and is writing about this vivid memory of his childhood. Wil Wheaton plays the young Le Chance, and along with River Phoenix (as Chris Chambers) they form the nucleus of their four man gang. Both of their performances are strong and the movie benefits from this.Though never riveting, Rob Reiner's film is dramatically sound, and comes across as kind of a combination of a boys own adventure and a coming of age film.Entertaining and well photographed, though never as moving nor poignant as perhaps this rather simple movie could have been.Monday, December 20, 1993 - T.V.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the movie on the top 250 list and decided to give it a shot. I was not dismayed but a bit disappointed by the film. I do not think it deserves an 8.1 rating. The thing that does the flick the huge dis-favor is the many loose ends that it has. For instance, what happens with the child's relationship with his father. Or for that matter, nothing of the gang that promises they would never forget and take revenge has been shown. It was a disappointing ending. The acting performances were good, especially Verne. But the films meanders midway with not much happening. It just fails to light up and pick up pace. Some of the scenes though are hilarious, the one in which Verne keeps vigil at night standing out. But it is not a top 250 movie by any stretch of imagination. I would give it a 6 on 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An average film about growing up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stand By Me is a nice little movie, but it seemed average to me. I find it very confusing to see row after row of 10/10 star reviews for it. Ten stars is a pretty large scale to work with and I'm not sure I've seen a 10 star movie ever, because that would be pretty close to perfect. I would rate this film as average, or slightly above, but there are so many deeper and more entertaining films that aren't made as well out there. I'd rather watch something less well made but more entertaining, honestly.When I hear the rare criticism of this movie, it often involves the fact that this movie has very little plot. This is one thing I not only don't mind about the film, but applaud. Clearly, this film is about dialogue and nostalgia and those two aspects serve the coming of age theme the film strives for. A lot doesn't have to happen in a movie for it to be good or entertaining. But the film is mediocre in these important aspects. The re- creation of 1959 small town America comes up short. The looks, the haircuts, the dialogue just don't seem right. Perhaps I lived a sheltered childhood, but these kids would seem mouthy and brazen by today's standards and likely wouldn't exist in 1959. The dialogue feels very modern, as though 1980's style of speaking was flown into 1959 with a time machine. But, perhaps this is a minor flaw to be overlooked in favor of a broader look at the film's themes. I tend to think it is a major flaw because so much power rests on nostalgia, yet the kids seem overly bold to ring true and the time period seems wrong.Aside from the time period feeling fake and the kids seeming too bold and acid-tonged, there is a more general criticism here to be made. The film strives to be something of a general coming of age story that anyone can watch are relate to, but in doing so it becomes bland and generic. The characters seem like clichs with clich problems: we have the sensitive, creative kid who's supportive older brother died, the tough kid with a heart of gold from the wrong side of the tracks, the feisty kid, and the fat dope. These prototypes are supported by Reiner with a heavy fist, when he finds time, sometimes in flashbacks. There is little to no time spent making a broader, more realistic portrait of any human in the movie, no attempt to go beyond archetypes. This makes all the crying and self exploration that occurs during the voyage seem a little empty and dull. As though the audience might forget that this is a coming of age film that leads to these kids becoming adults, we have to suffer through bookends and narration of grown Gordy, played by Richard Dreyfuss, spoon feeding us information with a very fake inflection. The excellent young actors try to save this film's messages and feel, while the bland sentimentality of Dreyfuss' presence seems to drag the film down. In the end, this film is a great forum to see excellent adolescent actors, but the power of their performances is brought down by the contrived feel and lack of depth in their surrounding stories. I found the scenes with crying slightly surreal, because as an audience we aren't given a strong enough feel for these characters and their backgrounds to have enough empathy to feel why they are crying (though we are told very clearly why). Reiner either spends time trying to support his material yet still fails to create a rich character, as in Gordy, or fails to spend any major time fleshing out, as in every one else. The result is a hand at once too light and too heavy. Reiner has done much better films. Slightly above average, 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best adaptation bar none</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is the best adaptation of a Stephen King story ever. It is perfectly cast, wonderfully written and directed brilliantly by Reiner at the top of his game. It shows River Phoenix at his best and only illustrates what a loss he was to the movie business. King is difficult to adapt as a rule because his stories are often based on a supernatural premise which never quite works on film in the way it always works in the books. Stand by Me was a short story (called The Body) in the book Different Seasons, which was my introduction to King and began my love for his writing. It also had Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption as one of the four excellent stories. Kiefer Sutherland also appears in this terrific movie as does Richard Dreyfuss though their parts are small. As an evocation of kid's lives and relationships it is practically perfect, which is a testament to the writing,acting and direction of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This time Rob Reiner helms a great Stephen King story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1986 I was 10 years old, and I watched this movie for the first time. I remember thinking that it was cool to see a dead body on the screen, but that was about it. It's now 14 years later, and I have again watched Stand by Me, and I now understand what the movie is saying. Intensely narrated by Richard Dreyfuss, Stand by Me is a coming of age story for 4 adolescents at the end of their summer vacation before starting junior high school. A very young Jerry O'Connell (Joe's Apartment &amp; Varsity Blues) plays Vern Tessio, the nerdy fat kid that every group of friends has. River Phoenix (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade &amp; Sneakers) plays Chris Chambers, the `leader' of the group who has many problems with his father and is always looking for something adventurous to do. Teddy Duchamp, played vividly by Corey Feldman (Dream a Little Dream &amp; License to Drive), has his own problems with his father, whom tried to burn his ear off for drinking bleach under the kitchen sink. This group of misfits is all bound together by the smartest of the group Gordie Lachance. Wil Wheaton (Star Trek: The Next Generation), in his first starring role and his first movie in over 2 years, masterfully combines fear, excitement and sorrow in this role. Gordie has just recently lost his brother, whom he really loved, in a jeep accident and his parents seem to have never let go, and tend to ignore him now. Before Frank Darabont got a hold of Stephen King's novel ?The Green Mile', Rob Reiner was given the chance to bring King's short story ?The Body' to the big screen. I have never read it, but I do know that Reiner did a fantastic job directing the large body of actors and created a movie experience that should not be missed be any 12 year old, or any adult for that matter.The movie follows the group of kids as the venture to find the dead body of a boy that has been missing for weeks. Vern hears a tip of where the body is, and tells the others who all agree to spend the next couple of days finding it. Throughout the whole trip it seems the 12 year olds do a great deal of growing up mentally, and begin to realize that they wont be together forever. There are some very funny scenes, the pie-eating contest quickly comes to mind, and the film loaded with some great actors early on in their careers. Some great performances by Keifer Sutherland and John Cusack round out the cast. The message I received from this movie is that no matter what happens, your friends will always be there for you, and you should never forget them. I hadn't watched this movie in years; and now that I have, I will most certainly add it to my collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The closest a film has ever come to being perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking back on all my reviews, and all of the movies I've watched during the fourteen years I've been on this planet, I can say that 'Stand by Me' is the only movie I've ever watched that has deserved to be seen only once. It remains one of my all time favorite films, yet I haven't been able to bring myself to watch it a second time, but I have not been able to forget it.The acting is what makes the film hold together, more specifically River Phoenix's performance. The other three leads were also exceptional, as were the lesser characters (including Kiefer Sutherland and newcomer John Cusack), but it was River's performance that really stood out. His performace is a rarity among actors, child or not, in that it doesn't seem the least bit forced, it seems all natural, and that is the one reason this movie is so great. This may be the only major movie I've ever seen where the producers have allowed child actors to command the film, with the adults in much smaller roles.It's 4:30 AM here, and I haven't slept for about 18 hours, so it's a bit hard for me to form ideas in my mind, then remember them long enough to type, so I'm going to keep this as short as possible, so I don't risk making a complete fool out of myself, if that makes any sense.One last thing I wanted to post is a short blurb from a River Phoenix fansite on an.... interesting incident that happened during filming of 'Stand by Me'. This is something new I've never tried doing when posting a comment, so hopefully it won't be rejected by IMDb. Actually, it might be just as well if it is...:Just as the film portrayed four boys passing through adolescence, so it was with the cast members. With sex being just about the only topic of conversation the boys talked to each other about, River became enamoured with an eighteen-year-old family friend who offered to 'initiate him'. No only did his parents give their blessing, but they made the occasion a celebration and pitched a tent in their back garden ready for the event.Next day of course, River arrived on the set with a huge grin from ear to ear, telling not only his three fellow cast members about his adventure but anyone else who happened to be around! River also wrote to Joe&nbsp;Dante, the director of his previous film and now a close friend, a letter that read simply: WELL IT HAPPENED, IT FINALLY HAPPENED."This may be the greatest story of lost virginity I've ever heard," said Rob&nbsp;Reiner. "A very strange experience" was River's description of the event. "She was very patient with me and told me what to do."Unfortunately, River's insatiable curiosity was not limited just to sex. It was during the making of this movie that marked the first time he smoked marijuana. Corey&nbsp;Feldman went into River's room one day to find him getting high. "I had been doing it too," said Feldman, "but it was one of those things where we really didn't want to let each other know what we were doing." Later in his career River was to say, "Stand&nbsp;By&nbsp;Me was a weird time for me as a person. I was going through a lot of doubt, a lot of insecurity. A lot of things like that you go through at fourteen. I was going through puberty and I was hurting real bad."</fullReview>

Another thing I didn't like about this movie is that it's mean spirited. For a film about childhood, it seems to just be interested in countless instances of people hurting, destructing, bullying, etc, other people. Yes, I understand what it's going for/trying to say, but just can't get in to this overdone, pretentious movie that's not evenvery entertaining.

		<shortDescription>Not outstanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The early death of River Phoenix has given his films a posthumous lustre; but 'Stand By Me', though not without merits, is not a great film. It gets some things right: for example, it has the courage to tell a tale of four decidedly pre-pubescent children, and while they do not necessarily make pleasant company, its a relief to see a "rights of passage" film not entirely shaped by a story of first love. But the characters are disappointly archetypal: the sensitive writer, the wise gang leader, the stupid fat kid and the wild one; and the dialogue and story are at times weighed down by the burden of implied significance. Also hard to understand is why the older boys who also appear should be quite so wound up by the film's (much younger) heroes. The low key ending is also undermined by the sentimental wrapping provided by the narrator. Read Roddy Doyle's novel 'Paddy Clarke Ha-ha-ha' for a less heavy handed story of children growing up by stealth.</fullReview>

Daniel Stern is in this too and that guy's a cut-up, he once took a BM at a pool party I threw.Anyway there's no real actors in this for Q man to play off of. No Rembrandt Browns.It's also very disappointing that at no time in the entire overlong two and a half hours of this film did any kind of vortex to another dimension open. No inter-dimensional travel at all. No musical numbers. No Kro-mags. No Wade.This movie is a real boring waste of time. Check out Sliders season five instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie without one authoritative line of dialogue - miss it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A complete waste of time. From the opening to the end, a narrator (it sounds like Richard Dreyfus's voice) utters clich after clich.I could parse it and present several examples but one will suffice since it isn't worth more time than that. When a junk yard owner insults a boy and his friends drag him away he calls for them to come back. For what? This would not and does not happen in real life. The mean old man should laugh. That's how it happens in life and how it should have be written but since the "author" had to present us with the bonding of the boys (saving one from suicide wasn't enough) he couldn't leave "the plan," the plan he no doubt read in his copy of "Screen Writing For Dummies." The author seems to know exactly nothing about people except this: he wants to be a writer. In one pathetic scene (author's massage!) one of the boys suggest he might write about their pathetic little souls if he grows up to write.Why not? There was quite an important event they were witnesses to and, if you can't write about that, what can you write about?... assuming one can write.But this author can't. Still, the movie is something of a miracle. How did someone with such a bad script get the money to make this high-school level fluff? It's one thing to write about childhood but shouldn't the writer grow up first? Shouldn't he, at some point along the way, have learned something that can inform his important event with meaning?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mushy children's movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Easygoing but overrated hokum from Rob Reiner and Stephen King. The dialogue, rich with King's cheerfully vulgar folk idioms, has an undeniable energy, but the actual narrative unfolds like a parody of King's non-horror work. It's a corny, weepy, ostensibly-manly-yet-two-hugs-shy-of-homoerotic piece of mush, and it's so nostalgic for the period you may feel like burning down your local oldies station after watching it. The performances are uneven. Wil Wheaton looks the part as bland, high-waisted little Gordie, but when he's called upon to emote he shows he's not much more than Christmas-pageant material. The young River Phoenix is unusually mannered as Chris, and Teddy just seems like a composite of Corey Feldman characters from other films. Only Jerry O'Connell, as chubby little chatterbox Vern, really convinces. (Sadly, it's perhaps the only time in his career he has done so). Kiefer Sutherland also injects a bit of life in the kind of teen bad*ss part that was his trademark in those days, but he's only one drop of flavor in a barrel of sweet, sweet sap.Reiner's direction is typically unremarkable, and no doubt the film's earnestness and lack of complexity account in part for its enduring popularity. But popularity can't change the fact that `Stand By Me' is nothing more than a children's film (R rating notwithstanding), and anyone approaching it should bear that fact in mind. 5.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, Stand By Me, is a retelling of a novella by my favorite author, Steven King, an one of my favorite stories ever. So, anxiously, I picked up this movie and...Hated it. Oh, I've seen bad movies before, and this was not the worst, but it wasn't a movie I'd come back to. After seeing The Shawshank Redemption, another King novella in the same book, I expected more great things. Alas...I'd like to finsih this by saying that the acting was not bad, but it is mostly just the director' uncanny ability to draw out the best. So, I must give this a 4 out of a possible 10, and pray that people who liked this see Shawshank Redemption and THEN watch it. See the difference!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AWFUL AND TOO OVERRATED !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was disappointed at the end of the film and my wife too. I didnt think that it could end so simply. The story is very thin and lives especially from typical kid stories or adventures. The movie never gets really chilling and also the time till they find the dead body is too long. Too easy and no big surprises when finally the kids found the body. In the whole film there were one or two funny scenes but believe me thats all. I noted this movie from imdb critics and i have to say that they are partly too overrated. Rent it before you decide to buy it. Fortunately I only rent it but you wont miss anything and its better you save the money for another good DVD. For these reasons we gave for the second time a 1/10. The other one was for "Memento".</fullReview>
