		<shortDescription>Another rigged set of reviews and ratings...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't stand when ratings/reviews are rigged in order to get people to watch or buy something. If you look at the 'top 1000 voters' for this movie, which are people who actually watch movies, they give it a 6.9. How in the heck did this get an 8+? (Well - it's because the movie producers were smart and got a bunch of people to review and rate the movie ahead of time...) The acting and writing is dreadful. Story goes absolutely nowhere and is pointless. I was at least hoping the water bed had something to do with anything. But of course, it didn't. Actors look like they're 35 years old, and you want us to believe they're college freshmen? Has the director ever been to a bar before or seen how awkward real people interact with each other at that age? Does the director know that people at bars or at parties are usually drunk, instead of the eloquently speaking, perfectly-dressed people in this movie? Really pointless, waste of a good amount of money to have seen this in theaters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why these choices?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're going to make a movie about Texas college baseball jocks in 1980 (especially jocks on the most successful team on campus), you're obliged to do something to let the audience know WHY those players are the most gentle, open-minded college jocks they have ever, ever seen. It can't just go unexplained, or it beggars belief. The movie is not intended to be a farce, quite clearly.Even the two most aggressive guys (the great batter and the manic pitcher) are ultimately adorably harmless. This is not how it works. Their conflict at a practice without coaches should end in a fistfight when the manic pitcher won't shut up after getting beat. You don't run your mouth at a teammate after getting hit on. The manic pitcher's outburst in the bar should also be far, far uglier, and it should end in a real fight. And the stuff that comes out of their mouths most of the time should be filthy as hell. I am NOT objecting to "gentle comedy" as a genre. I'm objecting to the total lack of appropriate set-up in this one, and the ensuing unbelievability.And I'm not faulting the characters for being horny, drunk 21 year olds (played by mostly 30 year olds, for putatively some good reason, but really because 21 year old actors wouldn't be able to handle the house of cards Linklater has set up here). I don't think that young men are monsters for getting laid and drinking on a free weekend before college. (There are complaints about this movie from some corners of the internet that have "liberal puritan double-standard" written all over them. I am not coming from that corner.) But having played college sports myself, and known other college athletes at the time and since, this is the LEAST awful group of 16 college jocks that I can possibly imagine, and the movie is set in 1980 Texas. They may as well be unicorns.I understand that this is supposed to be a gentle, philosophical comedy, and I have no problem with that in theory. I would definitely watch a movie where a given collection of jocks are great human beings, just out of the sheer creative audacity of seeing where that goes, and the things you can do with genres that depict an idealized world. But I don't want to watch idealized college athletes (or any other group) unless I have some damn reason to know why there aren't horrible human beings in that mix of 16 guys. The answer can't just be "because the genre is gentle, thoughtful comedy". Give me something with a piece of verisimilitude that I can hang onto. 16 golfers at Brown in 2016 have worse people among them than this.So, oddly akin to The Revenant or Boyhood, the movie doesn't work as realism, nor does it work as something heightened; on top of that it has 1-dimensional characters. I don't want to see Acclaimed Director, the movie. Every movie must stand or fall on its own.ULTIMATELY MORE IMPORTANTLY, this weekend-before-college movie (like any slice-of-life type of movie) will sink or swim on the quality of the bits, the moments, the character sketches. If each scene or moment is golden, all is forgiven, and it lives on in the way that The Big Sleep or Shortcuts or Day for Night or The Big Lebowski are great movies. In those, perfect scene-by-scene charm wins the day. Truth through Beauty.But in this particular movie, some of the bits, scenes, characters etc. are very good, while others are wholly bland, vague and threadbare. Could 'philosophizing jocks' get it right some times, and wrong some times, and just have some sophomoric marijuana ideas sometimes- sure, yes, why not? BUT EACH one of those scenes of 'philosophizing jocks' has to be somehow really interesting without feeling overly polished, or phony, or done to death, or otherwise uncharming. It's a pure fancy-footwork kind of storytelling art. And half of the bits/scenes in this movie have two left feet.This is the second movie in a row from Linklater that is not about real life or real people but purports to be, while using facile characters and after-lunch philosophizing. The first, Boyhood, was a full-throttle melodrama with a grand gimmick. This one plays one sport with the equipment of another: College Hump-or-Die movie rules, but with handmade character comedy gear. If you don't see this, let me ask you one question: WHAT is it that makes the main character Jake a SPECIFIC person who hits it off with Beverly, another specific person, besides the genre fulfillment of 'the two sensitive people find each other'?? Nothing. Nothing but Blake Jenner and Zoey Deutch saying the lines with talent. Can you say that about Say Anything, or are those two characters specific as hell, and therefore a response to the High School Hump-or-Die movies, and not just a mutant version of one? Heck, college farce Animal House, the ultimate Hump-or-Die movie, has more to say than this movie does.I'm now positive that Linklater is one director when working with actor/writers Hawke and Delpy, and quite another when he's not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another vanity project from this soft-centred writer/director. A perfectly pleasant, oh-so-normal guy, played effortlessly by Blake Jenner, is our viewpoint as he befriends a bunch of caricatured late adolescents. Mr Normal is not even a thinly disguised version of the writer/director, who evidently saw his younger self as a beacon of sanity in the midst of all that hormone-fuelled excess.The worst part of it is that Linklater has talent as a filmmaker. The piece is competently constructed and shot, and contains a couple of well-written scenes, notably a split-screen phone conversation between Jenner and the movie's only other credible character, played without affectation by Zoey Deutsch. In CABIN IN THE WOODS the equivalent bunch of stereotypes gets ritually slaughtered, a fate I several times wished on the quasi-characters here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everybody Wants Less!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would give it a 1 if I didn't enjoy the music. I started college in the 80's so I know what it was like. This is basically totally about some baseball jocks that are getting together and "male bonding" before classes actually start. With all the positive, and I must say idiotic reviews of the film, my expectations were probably way too high. There are a few moments of chuckles and laughter but if you have zero interest in baseball and aren't a past sport jock, this film is not for you. The background music was right on for the eighties and the party stuff was funny. Other than that, it just gets boring and too long. All the actors are "unknown" types and do fine job acting, but the storyline is a total mess. Is this a comedy or some type of sports, jock film or whatever? Many critics say it is a statement about the 80's and will be appreciated later. TO be appreciated later it needs to better at anything.I am only glad that we didn't pay top dollar to see this one and this is one I will never purchase or look forward to seeing again. I just want less of this crap. If you are determined to see this, wait for cable or broadcast. Not worth anyones money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was put together in an entertaining fashion. Trouble for me is that I'd walk a mile to avoid the kind of people the film is about. Always did, when I was younger, avoid the bullying sexist jock and unless you are enamoured, you may not want some of a film that celebrates them off the Richter scale.There is also the fact that in this Mudville there are only shiny happy people out of Hollywood wardrobe department and there's little resemblance to reality.That shouldn't stop those who want college and youth myths big on All American ball-whacking, drinking, weed-smoking, look-how-crazy-we-all-are high spirits. There will be lots of people who want some of that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exactly what I needed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everybody Wants Some!! was a perfect film for this moment: it consists of little more than a bunch of overly-competitive jocks joking with each other, partying, and trying to get laid over the course of three days before school even starts. It's intelligently written, fun, well-acted, and well-shot. What more could you ask for? Linklater, of course, does it all in a slice of life fashion: the opening of the film doesn't even attempt to describe what's going to happen and the end of the film barely describes what happened beforehand. The movie is almost meditative, and yet continually looking for stimulus in the largest and tiniest things... really whatever kind of stimulus they can get their hands on. Story-wise, it unfolds over almost every part of the era, which is, as far as I could tell, undefined yet seemingly somewhere during the 80s. Each night takes us to a different flavor of the time: disco, punk, you name it... but the genius of the script is that you don't really realize you've been given a tasting menu until you've already eaten everything. It just seems natural when it happens. Everything in this film seems natural, and that's a credit to the director, but also the actors. I imagine casting was the most important part of putting this film together and it seems to have been a success: every actor kills their part. Were they even acting? I have a feeling they were just being themselves. If you want to watch some kids mess around and laugh with them or at them, Everybody Wants Some!! not only is your movie, but probably will be your movie for a long time coming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dazed and Confused Repeat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going in, I knew it would be similar to Dazed and Confused. This was like Fifty Shades of Grey is to Twilight but worse, the plot (if you can call it that) follows its predecessor more closely than Fifty.Like Dazed (which is better btw), it's tough to put your finger on an actual plot. A freshman baseball player shows up to college, interacts with teammates/roommates, has fun, finds a girl. Shenanigans take place. So all you really have is a bit of character development, yet the characters remain relatively static. I have to wonder, Who the heck has been reviewing this flick, paid shills? People that haven't seen Dazed and Confused and think this is unique?Here are some of the characters to expect: Token well balanced protagonist, Token reefer head, Token self-absorbed whack job, Token witty womanizer, Token redneck, Token guy who is too old to be hanging out (same as reefer head), Token black guy, Token uber-competitive leader, Token immature character, Token below-average intellect characterI honestly can't believe they wrote in another character with an age problem--someone must have been a having a creative black void when this came to be. Another thing that didn't evolve since Dazed - misogynistic attitudes. Most of the women are portrayed as easy and air-headed, except the protagonist's love interest who the scriptwriters actually force the character to say is bright (unlike all the other airheads.) This type of portrayal is growing a bit tired. Give the female characters a voice, it would have been so much more interesting, especially given the time frame.Pass on this one. Sure, it's about nothing and you'll leave with a feeling of nothingness. The guys are good looking and witty, their shenanigans are charming albeit not unique, beneath the wit and charm is the stink of douchiness. So what?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nostalgic, maybe, but not funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I cannot compare this to Linklater's previous work "Dazed and Confused", but, a couple of months ago, I saw the trailer, and thought, "Man, this is going to be laugh out loud hysterics". Was I wrong.The movie starts with Jake, the freshman pitcher prospect cruising in a Cutlass 442, not bad for nostalgia (nice to see cars that still have some gusto for real in films).Jake is a pitcher who lives in a frat house with about twelve other ball players who like to party and talk about getting laid, and playing silly pranks on each other.Yes, there is a decent soundtrack starting with "My Sharona" from the Knack that opens the movie, but, the flaw is here: "Urgent" by Foreigner was not released until 1981. Oops! And it seems a tad out of place for a bunch of rough and tumble kids to be singing word for word to a rap song.The title of the movie is misleading "Everybody wants some!" is a Van Halen tune, that was released in 1980, but, we don't get much airplay from hard rock or heavy metal in the sound track. No "Back in Black?" No Judas Priest? No Iron Maiden? This was the pinnacle of New Wave of British Heavy Metal, and Ace of Spades from motorhead was released the same year. Plenty of hard driving rock to really pack a punch to enliven the film a bit.Back to the plot: there really isn't one, except the countdown to the first day of school, where the ball players go from party to party and meet some strange characters along the way.I'd have to say the most interesting character(s) are Detroit, the introverted, hard throwing, paranoid, humorless caricature that is funny for a bit, but isn't fleshed out enough to really meld in.The bearded virgin who is later kicked off the team, is perhaps the most reflective and philosophical character in the entire cast. He talks about the progression of one song on an album while the others get high.Who put Willis from Diff'rent Strokes in the cast? That isn't Todd Bridges, is it? He acted very well to fit in, but I don't see that happening in Texas. And where are the bell bottoms? We only start to get a glimpse of the underground music scene when Jake stumbles upon his long haired jean jacket adorned friend who wants to take the crew to a punk rock concert.As for the pranks, the knuckle challenge between the thin mustachioed fellow and the long haired shorter guy (who wins the challenge) is the funniest bit, but hardly enough to warrant a great belly laugh. It's a sight gag.I looked at the Tomatometer, and it was very good for this film. Uh, what film were THEY watching? Where's Pauline Kael when you need her?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Self-indulgent, boring... nothing you'd expect from Linklater</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a fan of Linklater since Slacker and in film after film he's proved that you do not need a linear plot to create a satisfying and revelatory movie experience. That is, if you have characters that are richly crafted matched with actors giving indelible performances. Sadly (and I do mean that sincerely) "Everybody Wants Some!!" painfully exhibits none of those two saving graces. It's as needless as those two exclamation points in the title and as alluring as running into an old high school friend who wants to drag you to his house and show you old home movies for two hours.I think I understand what Linklater was going for here, but it's still not an excuse for the snoozefest he delivers. I *believe* he was trying for something almost anthropological. That is, studying a very specific type of American male (high-school star jock) in a specific time and place (early '80s Texas) who come to terms with the competitive nature of college (in general, but college sports, specifically). Obviously this comes from Linklater's own experience but that alone doesn't make it interesting.The fact that it shares many similarities with Dazed and Confused is only going to mystify and irritate most people, especially fans of that earlier film, which was a much more involving and true-to-life portrayal than anything you see in this film. If you'll remember, Dazed had an encapsulated version of Everybody Wants Some embedded into it --- namely Pink's (Jason London) disenfranchisement of the whole high-school sports scene. If you look closely at the mostly unknown cast, you'll notice more than a few similarities between the two character line-ups in behaviors and physical appearance. But Dazed is a rich film. The characters were anything but types (and they did not chant "catch phrases" as one reviewer states... the film's fans created those) and each had many dimensions. None (even Ben Affleck's character) were straight heroes or villains. By contrast, Everybody Wants Some's cast of jocks and jock-babes rarely give us anything we don't expect or transcend any of the rampant stereotypes.For long stretches... I mean *LONG*... all you get are continuous party scenes that, while well-directed, still don't deliver anything that will keep your interest. There is little conflict, and nothing but the scantest surface interactions between the cast, none of whom give anything but the most vanilla performances. This isn't the first time Linklater's used a cast of unknowns (Dazed and particularly Slacker were exactly that) but Everybody Wants Some's crew is distinctly lacking in both style and charisma.I don't think I've been as disappointed by any movie this year. And as other reviewers have said, the overwhelming positive critical reception this unstructured mess is receiving is disturbing, to say the least. Yes, Boyhood was amazing on so many levels and easily Linklater's most masterful film, firing on all his strengths. EWS consistently plays to all his weakest.The more I think about it, EWS's aims are closer to Slacker than Dazed. Slacker was just that... a virtual anthropological snapshot of Austin Texas college life circa 1988-1989. Only Slacker's cast continually gave the audience thoughtful, crazy, disturbing, and provoking words and actions. By contrast, EWS is about as soulful as a kegger. A fun time in the moment, but nothing you'll remember after that. And that might be a very good thing.** One footnote: If you have a surround sound set-up, you'll notice this film makes the same mistake as many others recently by putting primary audio in the rear channels, making the party scenes virtually impossible to hear unless you just jack the center channel through the roof. Maybe this is something related to Dolby Atmos. Whatever it is, it's irritating as hell. Nothing sinks a film faster than bad sound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not about a decade - just an amazingly specific character study that takes place over 3 days in 1980</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went because I thought it would be an "80's Dazed and Confused." But it was so not that, so much better than that. I got to tell you about it. Whereas Dazed was a "generalized" version of the 70's (with a bit too much 90's still in the lens), this movie is about a highly specific group of people (college baseball jocks) at a very specific moment in time (3 days before the start of fall semester 1980, which any nerd can tell you is still technically, not to mention stylistically still very much part of the 70's) at a Texas university (presumably UT Austin). Where Dazed featured over-the-top wacky 70's characters who repeated "catch phrases", this movie is about some very real guys dealing with the transition from being the best athlete in their high school to just an average player at the bottom of the heap who has to get used to being humble and proving himself. Trust me. Go to see the movie that proves 12 years of making "Boyhood" has transformed Linklater to an auteur without peer. This movie is so perfectly in tune, light as a feather but with the full weight of an honest character study, played by an ensemble cast very much in tune with one another. Memorable characters for sure, but never overblown and always breathtakingly real. This is an amazing film. And the soundtrack is sheer perfection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I honestly don't know what to think of this movie. I was hoping for so much more. Most of the actors did a good job but Some of the college kids looked like they were 35 years old. The story just stunk. After the fact that dazed and confused was one of my favorite movies I guess I was hoping for something just as good. This movie was beyond bad and something which looks like some high school kids put together. It bounced around so much from topic to topic without actually getting into any of them. I kept waiting and waiting for the movie to get good. Then the credits started rolling and I turned to my girlfriend and said that's it? what the hell did we just watch? I wasted 2 hours that ill never get back on a movie that the best part was the credits at the end. I'm sorry but i'm being honest. Not like a lot of these studio reviews to make you see the movie. Just bad. Very bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of Everybody Wants Some!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without a shadow of a doubt, Richard Linklater is a very distinctive filmmaker. He's the guy who shot 2001's Tape in real time (via a cramped hotel room). He's the dude that made Boyhood (sequential-like) over a twelve year period letting his actors age naturally. Finally, he's responsible for the trippy, A Scanner Darkly (you know, the flick where all human characters are transferred into animation). With Everybody Wants Some!! (my latest review), Linklater trades innovation for nostalgia all the while trying to recapture the magic from his early 1990's masterpiece, Dazed and Confused. The results like your typical screwdriver (a cocktail featured in "Wants Some!!"), are mixed at best.Now you're probably wondering if I'm gonna make comparisons between Everybody Wants Some!! and "Dazed". Guess what, I am. Both films are indeed similar. They are both light on plot (but heavy on the pot), both take place over thirty years ago (the mid-70's and the early 80's respectively), both flicks bring Linklater back to his Texas roots, both involve a kaleidoscopic snapshot of an era, and both are cast with young, little-known actors (who knew McConaughey and Zellweger would make it so big, ha). Here's the difference though: Everybody Wants Some!! doesn't have troupers in it that are as affable, the writing/acting in "Wants Some!!" isn't as sharp as it is in Dazed and Confused, there isn't as much genuine humor as there is in "Dazed", and Ben Affleck's Fred O'Bannion is nowhere to be found (talk about one of the great bullies in cinematic history). In truth, it may be justified but to call Everybody Wants Some!! a poor man's Dazed and Confused, is a little harsh. I mean it does have some veritable moments. So I guess just think of it more as "Dazed's" menial stepchild, "Dazed's" naive little brother, or a dragged out version of "Dazed".The synopsis of "Wants Some!!" (or lack thereof) is told loosely through the eyes of (freshman) college baseball player, Jake (played by newcomer Blake Jenner). You see Jake has three days to kill before fall semester starts. Within the confines of a small Texas university, he meets his teammates in a rundown house right off of campus. From there, chaos ensues with these horndog adolescents integrating Jake while showing him how they party their own, plated asses off. We meet other freshmen on the team, a transferring pitcher who's a couple cards short of a full deck, and a star hitter who can slice a baseball clean through with one swing of an ax (great scene). Granted, we only see the athletes inhabit about fifteen minutes on screen playing America's pastime. The other 100 involves them getting inebriated at a discotheque, a country bar, a punk bar, and various socials near college grounds. I gotta admit, most of the male actors in Everybody Wants Some!! sometimes annoyed me. They tried too hard to be witty and invariably, tried too hard to dazzle the audience. At about the hour and a half mark, their arrogance became totally aromatic. I wanted to plead with them to please just shut up!With a movie title obviously inspired by a Van Halen song (of the same name), "Wants Some!!" is amusing for I guess, its first act. Linklater as expected, gives the film an exceptional sense of time and place. His direction is well assured and his musical soundtrack pounds relentless with great bubble gum and AOR hits. But as hazily effective and authentically relapsed as Everybody Wants Some!! usually is, it still showcases two hours of its college caricatures drinking heavily, smoking the reefer, trying frantically to get laid, and ragging on each other. That gets old fast. "Everybody" in the theater will wonder how much more they can truly take. Rating: 2 and a half stars.Of note: If you choose to take in a viewing of "Wants Some!!", look for the great Kurt Russell's son (Wyatt Russell) and Lea Thompson's daughter (Zoey Deutch) in supporting roles. They are in jest, the most likable people in the movie. Oh and they are literally the spitting image of their parents. This accounts for looks, mannerisms, and overall voice. Also, watch for a scene in which Russell's kid takes some big bong hits and gets all philosophical to the workings of Pink Floyd's "Fearless". I wonder what Snake Plissken would think of that!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite Dazed and Confused</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is Linklater doing a very similar formula to Dazed and Confused. The only difference is that this story is set in the 80's and all of the characters are sport jocks. Dazed and confused is a fantastic movie that talks about high school social system, where most of the characters are outcasts, stoners, etc. The fact that this film is centered around this really popular and successful baseball players, makes the characters less likable. They have no struggle. It specially lacks that sense of realness DC had. The film is also about nothing, in a very oriental/beat generation inspired narrative. But the nothingness in Dazed and Confused is filled with empathy. Even dough I wasn't brought up in the 70's it didn't feel that different from the high school years I experienced. But Everybody Wants Some isn't remarkable in any way in which its spiritual predecessor was. The fake feeling it has through out the entire film is completely evident. Even their clothes are always new. There is no sense that this characters are actually living this era, it just seems fake and ends up failing as a film that tries to capture one point in time (the 80's) and one moment in life (college).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a bit too much of the college jock life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, the movie was realistic and there were a few, sparse moments of tenderness between Jake and his romantic interest, but I was disappointed by the imbalanced focus of this movie. As most college students, then and now, are not hardcore jocks, this is a skewed vision of college life in that era. We get scant input from other groups on campus. Compared to Dazed and Confused, which featured a much broader spectrum of teenage life in the mid 70s, including jocks, budding intellectuals, burn-outs, etc., Everybody Wants Some is mainly focused on college jock life and the pervasive misogyny one might expect. At times insightful, and also humorous, the movie simply observes the lives of its characters. But it pales compared to its predecessor, and the overwhelming emphasis on the misogynistic and competitive sexual exploits of its characters tends to fracture and efface the movie's charms.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.Oh.... here we go! Thrust yourself into the 80's with... Knack, knack.... who's there... "My Sharona"! (pun intended in a special kind of important and beautiful way...just so you know....) Just the music in this one makes it hits some great goals and go for a really strong rate. Nice to hear the tune "Cotton Eye Joe", that were a HUGE hit when the group of Rednex did it. Do you like college film were everything is focused on drinking, sex, exploring a "cool and popular" type of language and stereotypes and acting in the sign of testosterone... watch this. Then I can really recommend this almost at the highest peak. Otherwise... as I feel.... look the other way. Actually, I go as far as; I was so bored I wanted it just to end. I am interested in what purpose Richard Linklater has when making this one. A hot topic (as written before in another review); everybody's name is Jake.Another hot topic; this movie proves the long known fact; to everything, you can use duct tape.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Godd production. Great top notch music that elevates the experience and gives the nostalgic touch to the era. - The actors : Everybody is doing what they were payed for. - The story : Well. If the college life was like this in the early 80's, it is fascinating to watch. Otherwise... I sense the question mark after the word "Why"? - Entertainment : Some entertainment. Beer.... beer... sex.... women...party and party... and a lot of testosterone. Do you like that, this one is really for you... as written before. - Age : 154,2 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 5 Approved. 4 Failed. Lacking in character.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can you say one dimensional? At the end I knew nothing about any of the characters. There was no hero. There was no villain. There was no goal. And what was the countdown to class all about? The media hype implied a soft-core 70's type romp like "Squeeze Play" or "Hots!", but there was none of that. The one set of breasts was nice but really just a tease. The nice girl and the nice guy finally go on a date after bit of impromptu swimming in their underwear and immediately sleep together AND spend the night together. can you say "Tame"? I got a little excited when the bar fight broke out, but when I saw drunk jocks and 80's bouncers not throw a single punch I had to pinch myself. It was reminiscent of "The A-Team"...bombs and guns going off all around, but NOBODY ever got injured. Didn't deliver the advertised sex and violence of the 80's at all. "Dazed and Confused" it was not.Oh yeah! Where was the cocaine? I really want those 117 minutes back!!! I would have given it a negative review if that was an option.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film with no plot, no drama, no conflict, a comedy with no laughs, filled with male characters I couldn't care less about, female characters only there for eye candy and sex, and there's a sappy "Frontiers are where you find them" attempt at philosophy in the final scene. So boring the characters themselves fall asleep at the end. By the way, that was the spoiler.Maybe if you like early 80's music and hair styles, and people in their late 20's and early 30's pretending to be be 10 years younger while wearing shorts there's something for you. Otherwise don't be fooled by all the good reviews this title received. This movie goes nowhere and then the credits roll. "Everybody Wants Some!!" is a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So good ratings in IMDb, i was expecting something great, funny and all... What was that? It gets nowhere... just a bunch of VERY COOL guys they make you follow for 2 hours... Sometimes you find them attaching (barely), a bit funny, but they are pretty much all the same, the very cool guys from college who play very good baseball (you just see a training session at the end of the film) and who can have all the girls they want... and who speak all the time in a cool and smart way... That's VERY little for a two hours film... I really don't know what was the point of that... Looks like a commercial for college life, or something... Not bad, but awfully flat!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a movie centred around a bunch of Baseball players, it does take a bloody long time for them to play baseball. Everybody Wants Some!! is one of those few movies that have zero complication at all, instead being 2 hours of drinking, partying, "the old in and out" and just having a good old time.The film essentially has no story what so ever. A baseball team do conventional teen antics until class begins... That's it. Although Narritively the film goes nowhere particularly it will never bore you as, being young and kinda dumb, the team attend a variety of crazy parties and spend their free time doing all sorts of random activities while talking about philosophical stuff. The film aims to deliver messages about individuality and competitive American masculinity. It's more about what the film is saying rather than what its doing.The unknown ensemble cast was great. Everyone as good as each other and creating extremely believable chemistry and friendship between them all. They bounce off one another throughout the film and the film is centred and lives off them bonding together as a team. The acting allows the film to work.Richard Linklater's film also utilises the nostalgia of the 80's. Sadly, me being born later meant that this nostalgia was lost on me personally, but for anyone whose around 40 this film should have an awe of nostalgia around its time setting, costumes and music soundtrack etc.Overall Everybody Wants Some!! is a well acted and nostalgic movie that doesn't really go anywhere in its narrative story but also delivers meaningful messages you'd expect to see in a coming-of-age teen film. Its like a sort of sequel to Dazed and Confused and Boyhood... That is if Dazed and Confused where in the 80's and if Boyhood was set 30-40 years earlier and picked up immediately where it left off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I decided to view this, I was thinking (hopefully) an 80s version of "Animal House." I got nothing close to that. "Everybody" is a boring tale about boring, pigeon-holed people, who, if they aren't drinking, smoking, or screwing have NOTHING else they would deem worth doing. That might have been okay once upon a time, but after an hour or so, it just gets real tedious and unfunny. A college baseball team, with an average IQ of, oh, 8, get together at their jock-house to smoke dope, womanize, drink to excess, act 13, and try to act bad-ass. Nary a book is cracked, so I guess as long as you could throw a ball back then, you did not have to worry about school that much. Oh, and it must be a requisite that you bed as many women as possible. Another problem I had with this movie was the casting. Too many of the actors looked way too long in the tooth to be playing teenagers. The guy with the mustache looked in his mid-30s. Also, way too many of these guys could actually keep a beat when they danced. Most all guys like this that I was ever around wanted to hunch on the dance floor or at least cop a feel. Twinkle-toes they were not.If your idea of a good time is watching boring guys do boring things, but still get laid, this one's for you. I was not impressed at all by this movie. In fact, it left a very bad taste in my mouth. Rated "R" for constant language, boobs, and simulated sex, I'd rather watch paint dry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I'll start with the positives.THe film isn't 'bad', and the soundtrack is just lights-out. It has a few genuinely funny moments, and the first half is pretty strong.BUT... the film loses steam and focus down the stretch. Blake Jenner, like Wiley Wiggins, appears to be the no-name actor that is the focus of attention, but unlike Wiley in D.A.C., we don't feel for his plight and some of the one-on-one scenes with his girlfriend are real snoozers. Actually it's some of their scenes late in the film that really start sinking this ship right before the lame, capsized ending.Everybody Wants Some is one of the worst kinds of slightly above average films - in that it had potential to be great, and every bit as good as Dazed and Confused. It got lost along the way, and in it's effort to create a 'party' film, it failed miserably in creating a cohesive film with any semblance of a build-up, climax, or send-off.If not for a few great looking and sounding scenes in the first half, and a few funny moments, we'd have a real stinker.58/100The ride into the sunset was a fitting ending to Dazed and Confused. Perhaps this trip is over. It might have made a good baseball movie if it had decided to go more in that direction. The film is competently directed, and will put a smile on your face, but those smiles start to fade and become more forgettable as the film reaches the 7th- inning stretch. It's like the light beer version of Dazed and Confused. When you finish, you wonder why you cared about a fewer calories, and long for the flavor of the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll begin by saying I was hoping for something of a spiritual sequel to Dazed and Confused, which is one of my very favourite "coming of age" type films. I'm also a huge fan of Linklater; Before Sunrise and its sequels are three of my favourite films; I loved School of Rock and Boyhood.So it was with no small amount of anticipation and excitement that I began to watch Everybody Wants Some!! and boy, did it disappoint. It felt false, the guys all seemed to old to be in college, their house and clothing seemed too new; it was trying too hard. In the club they go to early on they sit at tables with drinks on - the tables are spotless, no spilled drinks or condensation. The details in this film are lacking...The only bit I enjoyed a little was the belated romance with the lead (who I didn't like) and the girl from the beginning - but that was too little too late. Really disappointing; I did "want some" but not this....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You how sometimes you are just bored. Nothing to do at all, so you just wander around with people. Well hold on, because someone made a whole movie about this! For some reason set some decades go....Seriously whoever made this movie does not understand how to make a movie. First off you have to have a set up, then a plot, then actual events have to take place, and finally a conclusion. Even children that are forced to write essays, or put on small skits know this! "Once there was a dog that wanted a bowl of food, he looked for it, found it and ate it, the end." See how we set up the main character, gave it a plot, and reached a conclusion? Why I got a head ache was that I was trying to figure out what the hell this movie was about. It's like when you talk to a crazy person. And they babble on and on, until you finally realize, no it's not you that is confused and can't get what they are saying, they are simply insane.So wait who is the main character? This film can't decide. Is it that guy that was in Glee? BUT if he is the main why do we have random scenes that he is not a part of? It almost seems like the actors showed up when they felt like it and they shot whatever they could and pieced it together later. Some of the actors/characters are very absent then appear. What?Also lmao, one of the characters in the film is 'caught' to be 30. LOL umm most of these men look like they can pass for 35. Were they high when they wrote/shot this movie???? I just don't get it it's so sloppy and pointless. WHERE IS THE PLOT!? What is this about???Who cares I don't want another headache. Just avoid this trash. Just a bunch of 25+ guys pretending to be teens, and being bored. Really no plot. That's it....not even kidding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The boys have puerile genital fixations and the girls are reduced to barely-covered primal flesh who exist only to yield to or thwart the male sex drive.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The nostalgia coming of age film portrays the times and events that define a person as they progress through life's rites of passage. They share similarities with the historical bio-pic in trying to capture the look and mood of times gone by but without the historically important people. An example of one that works brilliantly is Richard Linklater's widely acclaimed Boyhood (2014). If you are a fan of that film you will remember the lyrically tender and aesthetically poignant study of a small boy's progression to a college-ready teenager. However, if you expect to find those qualities in Linklater's latest film Everyone Wants Some (2016) you are in for a shock.As far as plot goes, the film looks at a group of young baseball heroes in the three days before collage starts in 1980. The campus dorms are crowded and the city has donated two houses, so there are no real impediments to the boys being boys. The story unfolds through the eyes of ace- pitcher Jake (Blake Jenner) who arrives, settles in, and quickly becomes absorbed into non-stop male-bonding rituals of misogynistic drunken stupidity. The boys have puerile genital fixations and the girls are reduced to barely-covered primal flesh who exist only to yield to or thwart the male sex drive. Late in the film, Jake meets Beverly (Zoey Deutch) and takes tentative steps towards a mutually caring relationship, but this narrative capsule within the film appears to only seek redemption for everything else in it. Alcohol, drugs, and sexual bravado are the binding agents of this male tribe, and when class actually starts we see two of them fall asleep while their professor welcomes them to college.Nostalgia films rely on authenticity, but this film is cast with little known actors around their 30's in roles that require some innocent freshness of 19 year olds. The casting robs the film of authenticity, and in any case, the non-stop debauchery does not resemble anything like what most mature males have stored in their nostalgia files. Perhaps it all depends on where you were and who you mixed with in your formative years. If this is a nostalgic homage to the 1980s, stop and consider the scale of today's sexual violence against women and the endemic sexual discrimination still embedded in all societies. Then join the dots and ask exactly what is being celebrated in this film? As someone who loves film as an artform, I try to find at least something to admire in every film but this time I cannot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Linklater apparently has several themes he can't get out of his head...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had really had high hopes for this film - Dazed and Confused is one of my all-time favorite comedies. The main difference between the two though is that Dazed and Confused has laughs in almost every scene and the characters felt more natural and endearing. That said, I still think this film is worth a view for its nostalgia value which includes the music. Linklater revisits numerous themes and plot lines that were in Dazed and Confused, which would be fine if they were expanded on, but they're not. It's the old stuff, but less entertaining. Apparently, there are only two types of people in Linklater's world - jocks and arty/intelligent people - and rarely, someone who is both. Maybe Linklater considers himself one of these chosen few but someone should tell him that most people are more nuanced and complex than that. Then there's the freshmen vs. the jaded and slick upper classman. Someone must have really hazed Linklater, or he witnessed it. And that's another thing - most of the cast looked 30-35, not 20 - except the girls of course. The other repeats were the jerk who starts a fight over nothing (not funny), the smart coy girl who flirts with and beguiles the likable lead who is neither too macho nor too wimpy, pondering the "best days of their lives" while they're living them, the Matthew McConaghey character who serves as the film's philosophical core and perhaps warning? The good times can't last forever. And lots of partying - which apparently never goes out of style. The film can make you nostalgic even if the 80s weren't your hay day (they weren't mine). And finally Texas - I don't know Linklater's life story but it's clear that the particulars of growing up in Texas left a big impact on him.Overall, the film is mildly entertaining but no Dazed and Confused. I'm still a fan though. Alright, alright, alright...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is good but it doesn't compare to 'Dazed and Confused' and I'm not sure why Linklater thought it was a good idea to market it as a "spiritual sequel" to that movie. 'Everybody Wants Some!!' doesn't have that much in common with 'Dazed.' It's a funny college comedy but not much more than that. The soundtrack is great and there are a number of interesting characters, but it all almost seems like a persiflage or parody of 'Dazed.' This movie certainly lacks the realism of 'Dazed,' which makes the latter movie so brilliant in my opinion. 'Everybody Wants Some!!' is a fine comedy but it's nowhere near the masterpiece that 'Dazed and Confused' is. I think it's pretty much impossible to recreate the brilliance of that movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fitting 'spiritual sequel' to Dazed and Confused</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fresh off the critical success of Boyhood, a coming-of-age project 12 years in the making, writer/director Richard Linklater has returned to the genre he no doubt by now feels entirely comfortable in, the slacker comedy. Dubbed as a 'spiritual sequel' to one of his most beloved movies, Dazed and Confused (1993), Everybody Wants Some!! - a title taken from a Van Halen song - follows a group of baseball jocks in college over the course of 3 days before class, and arguably real life, finally starts.It's Texas, 1980, and freshman and promising pitcher Jake (Blake Jenner) arrives at one of the two decrepit neighbouring houses set aside for the college baseball team, where he is greeted with a mixture of both excited curiosity and suspicious disdain. Finnegan (Glen Powell), Dale (J. Quinton Johnson) and Roper (Ryan Guzman), a few of the older students who welcome Jake and fellow freshman Plummer (Temple Baker) with a bit more warmth, take the new arrivals on a car journey around campus, where they prepare themselves for a few days of booze, drugs, parties, and trying to convince members of the opposite sex to sleep with them.Linklater has a distinct feel for a sense of place. Like Dazed and Confused, he somehow manages to conjure up feelings of nostalgia for viewers who weren't even alive at the time. Having been born in 1984, I sadly wasn't there for the 1976 of Dazed or the 1980 of Everybody Wants Some!!, but the two films feel as if you're watching something made at the time rather than a period piece. Questionable fashion choices and even more questionable facial-hair are all present here, as is the obligatory classic soundtrack. which features an amusing rendition of Rapper's Delight amongst a more rock-based sound. The biggest issue people may have the film is that nothing much happens at all, so Linklater takes a huge gamble in assuming audiences will warm to its hefty ensemble.After all, the bulk of the characters are indistinguishable jocks doing bong hits and offering their unique blend of wisdom for the majority of the film. While this approach may run its course before the credits roll, there is some genuine wisdom to be found here, along with a tinge of sadness. Everybody Wants Some!! is a love letter to that time of your life when you are filled with optimism and the world is yours to explore, and Jake and his friends' journey of discovery and fulfilment is a rite-of-passage experienced by most young men and women. It could also be interpreted as a search for identity as the group wander from their usual disco haunt and try out line-dancing, a punk concert, and a themed costume party set up by performing arts majors, including the auburn-haired girl of Jake's dreams (Zoey Deutch). Call it what you will, but the film's power lies within Linklater's eye for nostalgia, delivering a final shot that captures more feeling than most films struggle to create in 90 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of Dazed and Confused, when I found out about this film I was ecstatic but it just doesn't deliver; I really wanted it to be great but it never really gets there. The characters are mostly forgettable and not even overly likable. At times it seems like a bad copy of Dazed and Confused, with lines like "that's what I'm talking' about" repeated and characters such as the coach (who seems like a carbon copy of the assistant coach from Dazed and Confused) and Finnegan (who seems very much like an attempt to replicate McConaughey's Wooderson). It's set in the 80s but there really isn't an 80s experience here like Dazed and Confused delivered. Dazed and Confused gave us a look at the cars and some of the iconic things about the 70s, as well as experiences that gave the viewer a look at what being a teen in the 70s may have been like, but Everybody Wants Some never really delivers any of that. The performances here aren't bad (with the exception of one character who, to me, seemed like a parody) and it's not a terrible movie, it just lacks the magic of Dazed and Confused and in the end it's really just a flat film that never really gets the viewer excited or delivers. Of course, this is just my opinion and you may really enjoy it, so check it out yourself and form your own opinion because it's at least worth seeing once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Everyone Wants Some" is such an improvement over the last Lassiter film. This one has so much substance, feels almost like a film that was made during the story setting rather than a contemporary production about such period. The faithful attention to detail, mood, and culture of the period is one of its wonders. I'm not sure whether I recognize anyone in the cast, and I believe this helps solidify the overall impact of the movie.We're back to the beginning of the eighties, with its appropriate soundtrack, the stereotypes, the freedom of a time in the lives of men and women who are finding their way into society and have a last opportunity to enjoy themselves as much as possible. There's not much in their minds but their immediate surroundings. Here's a society of baseball jocks, all with a common goal during their time in the university: to succeed in their sports career, and to have fun the rest of the time. Yet, we are witness to diversity from the very beginning. Some of these young men are plain hedonistic, others are followers, and some might never fit in. I found refreshing than even the oddballs fit. There's no excessive dramatics, and in spite of a few references to a possible pregnancy and having a bar fights, the spirits remain light, and the tale of a weekend flows smoothly.So we follow the group to a country bar, to a disco bar, to the field, and the required scenes in the home some of the players share. There's free love, frustrations, learning of some type, admiration, understanding and various situations among the group. By the end of the film, there hasn't been much growth or change. This is just a snapshot of a fun-filled weekend in one of many schools in the country. It could have been me or you, dancing to the beat of the latest song, having a drink, singing, etc.I'm not sure whether contemporary audiences will appreciate a film that shows this period. It's been more than 30 years, and the world has changed quite a bit. These men are fighting over records, and there's not a cell nowhere in sight.

		<shortDescription>Signature Richard Linklater</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I start this review with a warning: this is a Richard Linklater joint. And I'm not talking about mainstream Linklater; the director responsible for the inspired School of Rock (2003) and the middling Bad News Bears (2005) remake. We're in deep youthful good-time meets pseudo-philosophical territory with Everybody Wants Some!! It claims to be the spiritual sequel to Dazed and Confused (1993), a film that mirrors the non-conforming narrative and deep affection for character in Linklater's latest. What sets Everybody Wants Some!! apart and just a sliver above Dazed and Confused is it's tighter focus on camaraderie.The film begins with hotshot high school pitcher Jake (Jenner) driving to college circa 1980. He enters one of the two baseball houses just off campus and first meets the team's ultra-competitive captain McReynolds (Hoechlin) the easy-going Roper (Guzman), Dale (Johnson) the resident cynic (and their only black teammate), the gleeful Finnegan (Powell) and fellow freshman Plummer (Baker). Within a four day period, Jake meets and takes in the various quirks of the rest of his teammates all while attempting to woo a girl living back at the dorms.At first glance, Everybody Wants Some!! sells itself as a good 'ol time college movie in the vain of Animal House (1978). Indeed Jake gets himself into the usual bacchanalian misadventures: smoking weed with team stoner-philosopher Willoughby (Russell), breaking up bar fights started by team hothead Jay (Street) and otherwise ambling into a multitude of parties. Yet beyond all the chaos and stupidity these knuckleheads get themselves into, there's an underlining theme of team bonding and brotherhood. The guys share their thoughts on life, music, booze, identity, and of course baseball. The upperclassmen then take the freshmen under their wings and show them the most important aspect of college life; women.Of course if a good time is all you're expecting then Everybody Wants Some!! is a home run providing laughs, merriment and a killer soundtrack. However, the film doesn't just settle as an updated version of Porky's (1981) it actually has a brain. Teammates such as Willoughby and Finnegan speak with poetry and passion evoking the thoughts of everyone from Voltaire to de Saussure. While not as well-spoken as many of the rest, Jake does get the blue ribbon for most dactylic interpretation of baseball. His teleological relation to the sport and the legend of Sisyphus surely would have made Kiekegaard smile.Of course despite it's high-minded ideals, the film is not without its faults. The most egregious of which is it's casual sexism which, while can be chalked up to "period detail", nevertheless feels just plain gross. Linklater attempts to address this attitude within Jake's arc which begins with him rubbernecking girls and ends with him in a monogamous relationship. Yet with so many conflicting ideas on women in this film all bordering on paternalism, one can't help but think Linklater's broad sweep is just a way to avoid the issue. Sure there's fully developed female characters (okay really just one) but when the picture shows two women in white panties mud- wrestling what are we supposed to be thinking? "wow things were so weird back then," or are we supposed to think, "oh well, boys will be boys."Dreamily and nostalgically making its way through its self-imposed time-limit, Everybody Wants Some!! is a solid film. It casually drops nuggets of wisdom amid a mess of goofy shenanigans that are both funny and charming. The acting across the board is superb with each member of the group having time to shine. Humanistic in its perspective and memorable in its impact, Everybody Wants Some!! is that rare breed of film. One that's both raucous and shrewd.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was cool! Not a movie with high standards, not with famous people, not with a complicated story... just a movie, that is if it was made in the 80s, we would now call it a classic! And that's what a lot of people forget, nostalgia can make a movie better than it was back then.And this movie is made in these times. So people can still do it, only too bad they can't make them about our time... that would be cool, there are still baseball teams, college students, pledges and such.So please if any of the directors is reading this, this is the perfect example of how an easy going movie can be good, enjoying and reach a big crowd.For me this was the perfect summer evening movie, with a beer, enjoying some 20-30 some people trying to make something of their lives, even as a 34 year old, I could still connect with everything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After wanting to see this in the theaters (where it was well reviewed) I finally caught it on DVD. A lot of what I have to say has already been stated by other reviewers...actors too old, flat performances, not an accurate depiction of college jock life, a lot of it feels really rehashed from dazed and confused. But I felt compelled to address the one thing that other reviewers said they liked...the music. I can tell you why folks liked the music...it was portrayed inaccurately for this demographic and this period. Texas jocks were not into devo or Elvis Costello in 1980. They were more likely still listening to Uriah Heep or Bad Company at this point (and I am not hating on Bad Company....just find it inaccurate the type of music jocks who grew up in the 70's would be listening to. Not recommend unless sominex is not doing the trick for you.</fullReview>

He's a thoughtful, emotional writer, and in today's world of blow-em-up, sfx them out and based on comic books its nice to watch a movie that's intended for adults.I honestly felt that I was watching a movie from the late 70s to mid 80s. A fun filled romp with the requisite amount of juvenile delinquency, yet moments of truth and stirring emotions.The only disappointing thing about the movie is, I wanted MORE!!! Please tell me there's going to be a follow up.If you're looking for an entertaining watch, that makes you remember what's good about times gone by I recommend highly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the worse films I've seen. This is coming from someone who likes these genre of films too, I like films like porkies, American pie, road trip. This film doesn't come anywhere near close to any of them. None of the characters are funny in the slightest, none of them are even likable , the acting is poor , the story line is just totally pointless , it's just basically watching these guys drink beer for an hour and a half and talk rubbish. It has no direction what so ever , and the characters are supposed to be in their first year, yet they look 35. What is all that about ? From the high reviews on here I was expecting something good , but there's just nothing , I honestly didn't laugh once throughout the whole movie , I didn't find any part entertaining and I was just battling with myself through the whole thing considering when to turn it off . It's painful to watch, save your time and your intelligence , don't bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Trust me - I'm all about America's high-school/college myths, jocks, nerds, cheer-leaders, weirdos and so on. I grown up in '90s where such movies were flourishing. I even like movies with Freddie Prinz Jr. So, things need to really be bad for me to get this much bored.I haven't reviewed movie in a long time here @IMDb, but this one called for it - its an absolute disaster and it really shifted my perspective of my favorite hobby.What is so essentially wrong with this one? Well - it doesn't have a plot! It revolves around typical characters who play typical roles, but in the almost two hours there's not a single moment where someone has to try for something. Everything seems to come completely effortlessly and easy, no any kind of background character profile, just bunch of dull guys hanging out and you don't get a single idea about any of them. No struggle, no passion, nothing! Movie seems incredible lifeless even in the scenes of party with loud music.I mean, every story needs something to push things to action, even Isaac Newton defined our Universe with his Laws of Action and Reaction. Big Band theory of Universe rely on Explosion(TM) to move things around. Here, we see completely opposite of every logic we know. Not a single bad thing happened here, not even a hiccup! Strangely emotionless movie, with really bad writing, bad "jokes", especially for "comedy". Its gonna leave you with this weird feeling of emptiness and the real world will seem really far away for a second. Even now its hard for me to explain what is so wrong that I hated it. Its just so synthetic, almost seems like it was written by some early version of AI who lacks almost any kind of understanding of what makes world go around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel obligated to mention I didn't finish watching this one. There's no plot or anything. There's like 10 of these Baseball players living in a frat house essentially. They don't get into hi-jinks really. Actually the only hijinks I guess is this 5 minute or so scene of them getting kicked out of a bar because one of them is rude to a bartender. It's chuckle funny but not like break down hilarious and a big "Fight" breaks out but somehow no one throws a punch they just kind of wrestle around until the bar tenders throw them out. Actually now that I think about it most of the film feels like sort of softcore gay porn. Do they make softcore gay porn? I'm not homophobic or anything just describing what I'm seeing it's just a bunch of hot guys talking about their penises, sort bland partying and occasionally a man wrestle breaks out. I could see finishing it if any of the characters had a subplot. I think you're supposed to be following this quiet shy perfect gentlemen jock(cause those exist) whos pursuing this "smart" girl, but that literally just materializes about halfway through. At that point I just stopped caring.This movie is definitely for somebody. I hate to give it a 1 just because its not for me. Gotta go figure out if softcore gay porn exists now. I swear this is it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While hardly coming close to the masterpiece that is my favorite movie of all time: 'Dazed and Confused', the so-called "spiritual sequel" 'Everybody Wants Some!!' truly has managed to come as close as possible to recreating the same feel that the original 1993 film gave me. The movie truly is a party from start to finish, with very little in between. The same can be said for 'Dazed', in a way, and I think that the easiest way to rate 'Everybody' is to talk about the fact that it is a mere step down from its predecessor. While 'Dazed' focused on a variety of high school students, this film has centered on a very specific group of college baseball players. For this reason alone, one might initially think this was Richard Linklater simply manufacturing his favorite memories on screen for no other reason than the fact that he wanted to do it. Some of the characters can come off as jerks if you're not smart enough to see beyond the guise of their dialogue, and especially if you've never belonged to a team like this (which is me). The practice sequence in which the characters are out on the field feels forced?an unneeded block in between the two segments of rock and roll antics. For this reason, it feels harder to connect to the characters. With 'Dazed', I could label characters as people I knew in high school. Incredibly true to real life, it was. Not so here, but a former college sports player might be able to. The characters themselves are less memorable, but have almost more important things to say than anyone ever did in 'Dazed'. The movie is focusing on young adults trying to figure out the world for themselves, and this is especially evident in the dialogue we receive from Glen Powell's Finn and Zoey Deutch's Beverly (though each character seems to see the world in a slightly different light). I think the slight lack of realism in this movie as opposed to the perfect recreation of another era that happened in 'Dazed' is a result of the time we live in. The stars of 'Dazed' were in their twenties; kids who had lived to see the decade which they were portraying. Blake Jenner and the rest? Some of them are barely 80s kids, if that. Perhaps it was some magic touch of Linklater's that has been worn down after producing 'Dazed', but I will say this: it is a great thing that this touch of his has not worn down completely. Otherwise, we would not be able to receive this fine 2-hour escape into a better time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Richard Linklater reigns supreme with his latest offering 'Everybody Wants Some!!'. Right after delivering the masterful Boyhood, Linklater, this time, delivers an anti-plotted tale on the kids of the 1980's. Its all heart &amp; soul!'Everybody Wants Some!!' Synopsis: A group of college baseball players navigate their way through the freedoms and responsibilities of unsupervised adulthood.'Everybody Wants Some!!' celebrates the spirit of being young. Its about knowing the innocence &amp; being free, despite surroundings. Its indeed fun to watch the characters here speak it out, then drink, then get laid &amp; even try to be rebellious. Linklater observed the mood of the 80's himself &amp; hence, the setting as well as the nostalgic feeling, are spot-on!Linklater's Screenplay is winsome, while His Direction, is superb, as ever. Linklater's versatility comes even more on the front with 'Everybody Wants Some!!'. The Performances are Remarkabe too. Blake Jenner is a talent to watch out for. He's very good! Zoey Deutch looks gorgeous &amp; is very natural. Ryan Guzman is first-rate. All the others actors also deliver credibly. On the whole, 'Everybody Wants Some!!' is a good time at the movies. Watch It!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that will make you reminisce about your college life!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been arming myself to hate Everybody Wants Some the moment I saw the trailer. I mean, how can I not? A movie about an ensemble cast of coincidentally handsome bros in early 80's college life that do nothing other than chase women, get wasted, and dick around? In 2016, where multiple douchebag comedies not only did this but did this horribly? And don't get me started on how paranoid anyone can get with discussions about influences or feminism. Yet here I stand, knowing how otherwise profoundly troubling concept, Richard Linklater approach this and ultimately says "yeah, this is dumb and not safe, but it is also fun and small doses of fun is no crime." And I would be damned if it doesn't work! Everybody Wants Some is not only "good", nor only "exceptional" but probably "perfect in what it wants to be"The secret to the film's success, surprisingly, is its simplicity. There's virtually no plot, no conflict (unless if you consider coping chicks is any sort of struggle), or any significant cultural iconography other than a classic rock soundtrack and retro production design. What the film does, however, is simply observe the multitudes of vignettes of males doing male things, like partying, playing home sports, drinking, dancing with girls, more partying, and then some. And yet, it all feels tangible; we feel that we're with these boys and their shenanigans, mostly because it feel reminiscent of my similar experiences. Even though I never smoked weed, picked up girls, or got into fights with dudes in bars, somehow this film transport me in these scenarios in a way that I did, even though I never lived in the 80's. All of this is due to the maestro of social observation Richard Linklater, who might just be making his spiritual successor of Dazed and Confused. The way he frames these trials of masculinity looks so ultra- real that it's barely a movie anymore as much as it is a series of YouTube videos recording real life events. There are themes in this deceptively simple movie, to be sure. Being a movie about college kids, there are some jabs at "the government" among other life lessons like "don't fool around too much". But amidst all this series of masculine horseplay, great soundtrack, the specific direction, and a surprising amount of relatable characters, what stick to me about Everybody Wants Some is the notion of coming to your own and being who you want to be. And what more to support that notion than just to grab a beer and have fun for once in a while. Do not miss this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To live in a time when Richard Linklater is making movies and I get to see them at the cinema is one of the greatest joys of my life, watching a Linklater movie no matter if for the first or the umpteenth time is simply one of the highlights of my life. The master of on-screen emotion and humanity is back with another touching, nostalgic yet at the same time entertaining and funny portrayal of youth and life that once again taught me so much about myself and about the world it is flattering to get such an experience given to you so liberally and endearingly.I can't even start to comprehend how one makes "Before Midnight" then "Boyhood" and then this film, one after the other and still manages to make his voice fresh and new every time, whilst still saying and moving this quality and quantity of commentary and emotion about life. Linklater is a filmmaker that inspires me beyond the cinematic aspect, he fills me with endless wonder with his films and is probably one of the people most responsible for many life choice's and goals I've made.I think Linklater is the best screen writer cinema has ever had, this film just confirmed proved that for me. I find there is no other writer that is able to confer and entertain so much with this kind of realism in dialogue, he makes you forget you are watching a film. There aren't any other filmmakers, both past and contemporary, who manage to have characters talk about the most random stuff and yet make it so interesting and pleasant to watch and the more you hear it, the more you get tuned to it, the better it sounds to the point that every word becomes riveting and illuminating. I guess that it all starts with how Linklater treats his characters, Mark Kermode made a great point in his "Boyhood" review saying "Linklater is the most humanist of directors [...] people say cinema is a voyeuristic medium in which you look at people, and Linklater looks with people". Whilst with all of that I could not possibly agree more, after watching so many films from him I have realized he doesn't just stop looking with people, Linklater takes it to a whole other level where the characters aren't being judged or manipulated in any way, where everybody is celebrated in their own world, he finds this incredible balance of humanity and beauty within the most insignificant moments on the surface, that yet mean so much and thematically bear a sprawling amount of significance. His look at people and their conditions is humble. That's why he makes the best "hangout movies", because every time we get to visit these characters we are in awe with them, we love them so much because we see the inherent beauty about life and people in their every move. The best part is the fact that all of the above is done so unpretentiously and non invasively: eight friends going out to drink a couple of beers and get drunk manages to at the same time be entertaining and funny as hell, build character and pathos to the story and say something about social dynamics, the beauty of friendship and comradely and isn't judgmental to any way of thinking. The party scenes, which by the way are some of the most fun I've had in a theater in a long time are also some of the most thematically rich points the film makes. There's also a brilliant cast to thank for all of this, full of young upcoming actors and unknowns I have to admit that this was even better than "Dazed and Confused", by the end of the movie you manage to recognize and place about twenty different people with the utter most confidence. They start as strangers and when the credits roll they all have become friends you would greet when passing by the street, it is incredible. Moreover, there is a magnificent craft in the staging of it all, as always the non invasive camera with long takes and natural movements is as electrifying as always and the visual cues and ideas spread out around the film are indicative of Linklater's talent as a storyteller. The movie nails it, the feel of comradely and love between friends, the vibe of parties and life in one's twenties, it just gets it perfect and the fact that it is set in the 80s doesn't matter and just further proves Linklater's love for character whom we relate to no matter the setting, this was a blast in every possible way and whilst there are flaws that can be found if one really thinks about them I cannot even care to mention them for how fleeting and insignificant they are in the big picture. I cannot wait to get the privilege to see this again and see what's up next for this incredible director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In advertising among my design friends we call exclamation marks dogs' c?cks I think because they just look rotten.I like that Richard Linklater uses two of them in the title of his Jock movie.It's appropriate as the central focus of it is 16 baseball players looking to put that part of their human anatomy to good and frequent use.As in Boyhood Richard Linklater is light on narrative, big on meaning, and the meaning of this rocking great movie is the three days before term starts when partying on campus for Freshmen, Sophomores, in fact right up to thirty year old ball players, is the actual meaning of life.And partying means pulling.But this is no Animal House or American Pie. Sure it's hilarious in parts, but naturalistically so, not slapstick and not gross out. Just real guys being real funny.Jake, our hero, is the quiet sensitive type, but plays great ball and has joined the fictional University of South Eastern Texas to do just that. The Baseball team is the star sports team of the College and is feted for this. Free drinks in bars is common. Sure, Jake has a degree to see to (history as it happens) but this is incidental.The Jocks he houses with in two, eight-bed, suburban family homes are brutal. Well, they're Jocks. (but actually, scratch the surface and they're all big softies underneath looking out for each other). Nevertheless, no taboo is off limit and any weakness at all is clinically punished amongst the laddish, highly competitive banter.They drink, they blow, they get laid, they drink, they chat up girls, they get laid, they dance (pathetically), they fight (pathetically) and they ride around in cars. Linklater has a documentary style and this is continued in this movie. Here's how it opens pitch perfectly as Jake cruises into town with his gear.Ooh, my little pretty one, my pretty one When you gonna give me some time, Sharona Ooh, you make my motor run, my motor run Got it coming off o' the line, SharonaNever gonna stop, give it up, such a dirty mind I always get it up, for the touch of the younger kind My, my, my, aye-aye, whoa! M-m-m-my SharonaThe soundtrack is chock full of late 70's/80's classics and their word perfect singing along to Rappers Delight by The SugarHill Gang is a highlight.For my money this is a better movie than Boyhood, despite the epicness of his achievement. It's an utter delight from start to finish. Covers every teen clich in history but believably and engagingly.The ensemble cast (led by Blake Jenner from Glee) is outstanding. The period styling impeccable. The script taught and witty.It's near perfect actually. I expect it to win prizes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Richard Linklater just gets me.All his films are about a time and place. They are about living in the moment and in Everybody Wants Some the moment is right before college in the 80s.I wont give you the plot but I will tell you that this smart raunchy funny and endearing comedy about a group of college guys is something to behold. Its a beautiful movie and im still talking about an R Rated Comedy about college baseball players. The humor is real and natural.I know people like these characters.I've joked like this and have had deep conversations like they do in the film. The actors have great chemistry. They can joke and party and yet they can still have philosophical talks about life and what it all means. You follow these characters over the span of 3 days and by the end of the film you just want to follow them throughout the year. The closing scene is just true and wonderful.If I had a weekend like the characters did then I would be doing the same thing. You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it. Its small yet says so much. Also stay till near the end there is a musical number that is pretty great. Everybody wants some!! is one of the best movies of the year!! ***** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie not only captures the 80s perfectly, but it also creates a comedy that has the same spirit as a comedy that would have come out in the 80s. It is lighthearted, and just like Dazed and Confused, it does not rely on plot but of the joy of following these characters in their day-to-day lives (or in this case the first couple days before college classes start). The jokes are not forced, and you just constantly feel giddy throughout the movie, because you feel as though they are genuinely enjoying themselves - and by extension, so is the audience. The outfits are hilarious (men crop tops and short shorts) but still feel authentic to the time and the characters. The movie features many stars in the making, and by doing so, you care more about the characters instead of big actor names. Richard Linklater does it once again in capturing the human spirit, instead of trying to make it event/plot-heavy but instead focus on human spirit and simply having a good time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Everybody Wants Some!!" (2016 release; 116 min.) brings the story of a group of baseball players on a Texas college team. As the movie opens, The Knack's "My Sherona" is blasting away in a guy's car. That turns out to be Jake, an incoming Freshman and pitcher. The big screen reminds us that it is "August 28, 1980, Classes start in 3 days". Jake is getting to know the rest of the Baseball House that he is sharing with seven other guys. When they decide to take a drive and try to pick up girls, one mystery girl informs them she likes the quiet guy in the back (pointing to Jake). At this point we're not even 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this is the latest movie from Texas writer-director Richard Linklater, who most recently brought us the brilliant "Boyhood", and much earlier "Dazed and Confused" (set in high school in 1976). It is an easy case to make that "Everybody Wants Some!!" is a spiritual sequel to that movie. The movie's trailer gave the impression that this is an all-out funny, possibly rowdy college-age coming-of-age, and there certainly is plenty of that. But there is so much more to this movie. I love how Linklater lets the scenes develop with uninterrupted shots that at times go on for minutes. Pay careful attention to what life was like in 1980 (no smart phones, no craft beer, etc.). Linklater was 20 at that time (as was I), and he captures it perfectly. As was the case in "Dazed and Confused", this movie features an ensemble cast that surely contains future stars. I'm pretty sure those will include Brian Jenner (playing the Jake character, and previously best known for his recurring role on the TV show Glee) as well as Zoey Deutsch, in the role of Beverly, the mystery girl I referred to. Deutsch is the daughter of Lea Thompson and the physical resemblance is uncanny (and very easy on the eyes). Last but certainly not least, the film features dozens and dozens of killer tunes from that era, from "My Sherona" in the beginning to the Cars' "Let the Good Times Roll" over the end credits. The scenes in the Sound Machine disco tent are among the many highlights of the movie. Bottom line: I felt like this movie was literally made FOR ME, as I was those guys (setting aside the baseball aspects).The movie opened this weekend on a couple of screens in Greater Cincinnati, and having seen the trailer, I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at turned out t be a private screening, as in: I literally was the only person in the theater. Say what?? I couldn't believe it. I will go see any movie by Richard Linklater simply on the strength of his name and the blind faith in his talent. If you are in the mood for a nostalgic yet very realistic look back at what life was like in late August of 1980, you cannot go wrong with this movie. "Everybody Wants Some!!" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Don't be afraid to let the experience find you." Willoughby (Wyatt Russell) Everybody Wants Some!! is a real comedy, not some reality show knock off about college athletes gone bad. It's 1980, it feels like 1980, and the kids are full of 1980's optimism expressed in their passion for baseball and hot chicks. The "experience" the very high, hippie philosopher Willoughby promotes in the quote above comes for most at college, where new experiences find and transform.The hero is Jake (Blake Jenner), a freshman pitcher joining the rest of the college baseball team in one of their two houses provided off campus, conveniently unsupervised. He represents the youthful idealism of a former high-school star athlete on scholarship at a small south Texas college. Linklater's plot is so charmingly rambling, like his favorite pinball motif, that character development is acceptably absent. With the pastiche of pranks that serve as episodes, seriousness can't prevail anymore than it did in Linklater's classic, Dazed and Confused.The most interesting character has to be Finn (Glen Powell), the ladies' man spouting Linklater aphorisms like the one above. He's a woman-con who nevertheless comes out with thoughts for life amidst his clowning.What makes this film different is that from the beginning these wisecracking jocks know they're not going to be picked up by the pros, but they still talk about that happening with the right realistic attitude. Director Richard Linklater, coming off his Oscar-nominated Boyhood, in which he showed unique insight into a growing boy, now paints a portrait of young men quickly transitioning into men who know what's up.During this coming of age story, the players play at college life with the same gusto they show for their sport, not always scoring but always in pursuit, as if both games were evidence of their right to success, an American characteristic to be sure. Seeing a possible scout painting a house near the playing field, the realization is that he may not be a scout. All everybody can infer is it's good to be ready when any of life's "scouts" should come by.The wit is omnipresent and occasionally brilliant, evidenced by these two insults: dipshitification and fuckwithery?used more than once to put someone down and toughen up at the same time.Amidst Twilight Zone VHS's, Van Halen, and Carl Sagan, Linklater has returned us to 1980). And dare I say it, gives a good name to nostalgia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ground rule double instead of a grand slam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fun movie. To believe director Richard Linklater's "spiritual sequel" to DAZED &amp; CONFUSED, you'd think going to college was a free ticket to girls, beer and nightly all-niters. And hey, it kind of is, right? Except for the classes. And the awkwardness. Or social failings of any kind. I guess those wouldn't have made for such an entertaining movie though.All of that is to say that while EVERYBODY WANTS SOME is fun, it isn't exactly true to life, even while offering an authentic look at 1980- era young adulthood. The characters are a baseball team, conveniently rooming in their own pair of off-campus quasi-frat houses: there's the wide-eyed freshman pitcher, the upperclassmen who love hazing and boozing almost as much as they love balls and strikes, the misfit 30-year old stoner (remember, this is Linklater we're talking about), the p-whipped hick.... you get the picture-- it's essentially an Animal House-style ensemble cast where the audience never gets a chance to tire of any one character in particular. Further, because the writing avoids clichs for the most part, each character gets a few good punchlines, and chances to endear himself to the viewer.And I emphasize HIM-self. Despite the fact that I heard girls chuckling at jokes in the theater, this movie is basically about boys, in college, age 18-22. Lots of scenes about various kinds of male bonding. Others about various forms of competition and/or one- up-man-ship. I wouldn't go so far as to say the movie is sexist, but it's certainly biased towards a male perspective.All of that said, the characters are like-able. The apparent protagonist, a young pitcher by the name of Jake (All-American looking Blake Jenner), arrives a few days before classes at a Texas university to meet his teammates and new (well-stocked) abode. He's a nice kid with lots of talent, a great smile, and a way with girls. Just like all his teammates. Throughout the film, he scores at the disco, entrances young lasses at the C&amp;W bar, slam dances at the punk show, and just generally aces life. He even wins the heart of a young drama student (played by Zoey Deutch) the day before classes start. Talk about an overachiever!His teammates run the gamut from witty/charming (Finnegan, in an effortlessly funny performance by Glen Powell) to jockish (Tyler Hoechlin's McReynolds -- a great baseball name to be sure) to a mixture the two. The weirdest character is probably Jay (Juston Street), an over-compensating, aggro pitcher who constantly brags about his fastball and major-league talent. Still, the team members work well and play off each other, and again Linklater demonstrates his ability to assemble a great cast of mostly unknown actors who not only gel, but come off as fun, likable dudes.The problem is this: there's no real story. Some stuff happens -- mostly fun stuff, to be sure, but I could probably sum up the plot of the movie by saying young, attractive athletes score chicks in a variety of situations pretty easily. Entertaining enough, maybe (especially if you're a hot dude), but compared to DAZED &amp; CONFUSED (or this movie's *real* spiritual partner ANIMAL HOUSE), it comes off a bit one-dimensional. The boys go from one party to the next, making out well pretty much every time -- I kept waiting for the conflict, the consequence, the B part to all the A parts, but it never happened.In truth, the movie felt like one, long first act. I could almost see this as part of some massive cycle where the next installment would be a 90-minute come-down: bad 2nd dates, hangovers, failed classes, losing seasons. Call me cynical, but even college kids have bad days.Or course, I might be expecting too much. This movie takes place in 1980 (and rightly, retains a lot of the 70s in its look/feel), so if you judge its story and characters by the kinds of flicks college kids flocked to back then -- PORKY'S, REVENGE OF THE NERDS, ANIMAL HOUSE -- it comes off as intelligently written with good performances. But even NERDS had conflict. Hell, one of bros at ANIMAL HOUSE partied harder *and* bedded the mayor's wife.Ultimately, I enjoyed this movie. I might even be into a sequel, if it promised a little more character depth, and a story arc that actually, er, arc'd. EVERYBODY WANTS SOME is a good time, and not much more. From a different director that might be enough, but from Linklater, it feels like a ground-rule double instead of a grand slam.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the fun it promised</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Linklater splashed on the scene with Dazed and Confused, a movie that depicted the wild late 1970s from the high school and early college perspective. That movie was a fun romp with iconic characters, enjoyable upon second and third viewings.Everybody Wants Some!! is a non-sequel set in the early 1980s, and instead of a one-night romp, we get a three-day romp that is nothing but a heteronormative beer-fest in search of sex. Yes, everyone on the baseball team is so straight and so attracted to women that they think and talk about women all the time. And the women? They're all straight, too, and while they play coy, they want dudes just as badly.That's not to say the movie isn't fun at times and not without laughs. But Dazed and Confused had a more realistic feel. Everybody Wants Some!! is a puerile fantasy that never goes anywhere meaningful. There's no lessons learned, not even on the first day of school, because we're all too tired to keep our heads up after the meandering weekend mess.The performances are fine for a cast of heretofore relatively unknowns. There are a couple of missteps, but overall these dudes will likely be in other movies, likely about chasing tail.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love that 1980 Dude!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An out-of-town baseball pitcher has been transferred to a baseball team in Texas in 1980. That's the basic premise, besides the guys trying to get some. Richard Linklater's latest film, "Everybody Wants Some!!" is reminiscent of "Dazed and Confused," a film Richard Linklater made of the 1970s time period. I loved that film and, while this may not quite as great, it is just enjoyable. Linklater knows how to create real people and true characterizations. This film has the perfect balance of respect for its characters and the time and place, while, at the same time, parodying the outrageousness of the time's style, mood, and, of course, music. While looking at these people with fond remembrance as someone you could have known in your youth, the film also relishes their flaws in all their wild and wonderful glory. It's corny and wild. They are who they are. They're themselves. The music was of course awesome. All the actors were great in their roles, especially the guy who hates to lose and the guy with the ego who attacked the bartender. The naturalness and camaraderie of the actors make it all come together to make it a fun-filled, laid-back time with pals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One can make the argument that Richard Linklater continues to punch out films that lack an intricate plot or an overarching story, but he never fails at creating likable characters and finding the right actors with lively chemistry on screen.After wrapping up The Before Trilogy in 2013, and the experimental film Boyhood a few years ago, Linklater went back to his roots and decided to make a spiritual sequel to his cult hit, Dazed and Confused. While I'm not sure Everybody Wants Some(!!) will have the likability or longevity that Dazed has, it sure is a memorable watch.Much like Dazed, this film has a relatively unknown cast. Sure you have Supergirl's husband, a TV Superman, Kurt Russell's son, and that one guy from The Walking Dead, but none of them have really proved themselves to be known talents yet. With that said, I dug each and every one of their performances. Sure, Blake Jenner is the main character by screen time, but I felt Linklater did a great job at balancing the funny lines between the cast. It's also worth noting that although the film is about at a baseball team, it's not a baseball movie. This a college film through and through. Yes, Linklater seems to go through the motions of a prototypical college film arc, he floods the bland backdrop with memorable characters and performances. Party scenes are followed by random comedic bits that meanders the plot into a dangerous territory where you could lose interest, but then you remember meandering films is what Linklater does best.I think perhaps Everybody Wants Some plays better as a tribute to Dazed, but that's not to say it's not as endlessly re-watchable. It's full of characters that you will want to hang out with after watching the film. Characters come and go, the plot meanders, but you still have one fun film.+Great characters, great performances+Linklater soundtrack+Re-watchable-Sometimes the plot does meander8.8/10</fullReview>

I'm not going to give you a long paragraph full of fancy words, all I'm going to say is I didn't want to watch this movie and then I did and I wanted more. It was funny, smooth, didn't have your typical boy makes mistake, other boys hate him or girl hates him, they get back together bullshit. It was just simple, nostalgic for a lot of people, entertaining the whole way through and it gave you a sense of brotherhood. It was very realistic and the dialogue was fantastic, just give it a try.

		<fullReview>Everybody Wants Some!!College puts an end to high school factions by categorizing everyone as alcoholic.Case in point, the plastered freshmen in this comedy.While Jake (Blake Jenner) was a big-deal pitcher in high school in college he's just another rookie there to be razzed by his teammates (Ryan Guzman, Temple Baker, Glen Powell, Quinton Johnson).Before classes start up the team takes Jake out on the town with them where they introduce him to college's diverse party scene. Along the way he meets a cute coed (Zoey Deutch).Evoking the nostalgia of going away to school through a cast of eccentric characters that one could encounter in a post-secondary, writer-director Richard Linklater utilizes his green leads to construct a convincing campus where he can insert his subtle lessons about becoming an adult.In fact, college gives you those tools you need to get a job to pay off your student loan.

		<shortDescription>Easy viewing cinema at best, and certainly not among the better ones from Linklater</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been an avid fan of Linklater. I have enjoyed his breakthrough take on the imaginative and the dramatic through movies like 'Waking Life' and the trilogy with Hawke and Delpy. I watched this movie with great expectations and was let down in the same dramatic fashion.The movie is about some baseball players who are about to begin college. The camera follows a freshman Jake partying the weekend before college with his teammates. During the process, he meets a girl with whom he sparks off a dynamic spontaneously. That is pretty much the entire plot. Linklater has had simplistic story-lines before, but this seems more a caricature of happy nostalgia. The characters, unlike his previous movies, remain underdeveloped. The characters did not feel like teenagers. I kept on expecting some gold at the end of the rainbow, but all I was left with was an irritating betrayal.The movie has some good scenes, but it wasn't a good enough 'comedy' (as per its marketed genre) for me to evince laughter. It is not hard to see that this is how Linklater would have wanted his college life to be. However, it is easy viewing cinema at best, and certainly not among the better ones from Linklater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Welcome to the big time boys." Jake (Jenner) has just arrived at college to play baseball. While getting ready for the season to start he begins to get to know his house/teammates. The expectations for the season and school year are high for Jake and his friends. This is exactly what the tag line says it is...a spiritual sequel to Dazed and Confused. The movie really isn't about anything but a group of college kids and what they do before school starts. Baseball, parties, girls, drinking and everything else they can get their hands on. I did like this and enjoyed it quite a bit, but it's no where near the classic that Dazed and Confused is. This is a good one time watch but nothing that I could see over and over. Overall, if you saw Dazed and Confused than you will know what to expect from this movie. Just don't expect it to be as good. Worth seeing once though. I give this a solid B.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More art of conversation from Richard Linklater</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A follow on from the famed Dazed and Confused (1993) Richard Linklater actually states that this is a direct sequel from his film Boyhood (2014) making this possibly a trilogy. This one spending a weekend with a college baseball team at the beginning of the eighties. It's colourful as the eighties was and is full of interesting characters and if there's one thing Linklater does so well, it's the art of conversation. Like his previous works, the Before Sunset trilogy, It's superbly scripted and well performed by the large cast that are notably small names. No big Hollywood pitchers here. The story seems centred around Glee's Blake Jenner character Jake as he becomes a freshman and moves into the baseball house meeting a multitude of strong characters. They're not really stereotypical, just want you might expect to find at a typical US college. Characters like Glen Powell Finn and Tyler Hoechin's Mac form great bases among others like Roper, Jay, Willoughby, Plumber and Dale. The audience gets a fly-on-the-wall perspective of the banter, jesting and points of view between them all. It's like a Softer-core Porky's with Girls, parties, drugs, booze and surprisingly, some baseball. The guys go from bar to bar offering different samples of eighties pop culture accompanied with an awesome soundtrack. It's not going to be everyone cup of tea but for what it is, it's entertaining and doesn't try to be anything spectacular but a good pictorial of a time of that era.

		<shortDescription>Contrary to Appearances Linklater is a Traditional Romantic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's easy to miss about this movie is that like many of Linklater's other works, it's about finding romantic love.In the hookup culture which is already established by 1980 meaningless sex or sex for sex sake is the norm. The girls want to have sex as much as the guys.Jake's quest to find "the one" is common in Linklater movies. It is a major theme in Before Sunrise, it seems to be happening at the end of Boyhood and occurs in Everybody Wants Some as Well. Jake spots Beverley on his first day on campus. Although he has hookup sex immediately afterwards, he cares enough to write his note (quoting poetry and tape flowers to her door).His attraction to Beverley provides part of the tension in the movie. He needs to fit into the norms of his team while at the same time being true to his self and following the call of his heart.The fact that he seeks love is what sets him apart from everyone else on his team and gives him a depth all his teammates are lacking. For me, it is also what sets the movie apart from something like Animal House which many people seem to think it's like.In their night in the water (initiation?) Jake shares that he wrote his admission essay on Sissyphus and how it gives purpose to his life. This fact gives insight into his personality--he is sensitive and thoughtful even if he is also a "jock." It's what allows him to bridge cultures and build a relationship with a theatre major--he is a multi-faceted human being.Near the end of the movie Beverley adds some white short pants to her outfit. Jake, having stayed up all night, may be too tired to notice. But to me it confirms she is no prude. The sex will come, but when it does it will be within the context of romantic love. For all the alcohol, pot and sex in this movie Linklater ironically holds romantic love as a very traditional value.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Richard Linklater is the master of this sort of movie. No intense, clever or unique narrative needed, just a bunch of well rounded characters and some great dialogue. Everybody Wants Some!! is another great example, though it does leave the film feeling a little incidental and pointless.Linklater's writing is key. He creates character through conversation - the way they talk moulds who they are without having to give back story or motivation. This movie has a dozen or so fun, likable college guys who enjoy nothing more than drinking, getting laid, playing baseball and having fun (each with their own traits), and that's all the personality they need.The second thing is casting. Rather than choosing actors based on skill, it feels like they were chosen based on how well they suited their character and got on well with each other, which makes it seem more real.The soundtrack is brilliant too. The music choices bring essential background tone to each scene and are cleverly selected. Kelly's simple but effective camera-work also makes the movie seem more natural, like you're in the room with them, especially with such terrific production design, costumes and cars, etc.A bunch of interesting characters having funny conversations and a great time, Linklater has soaked each frame in nostalgia. Nothing unique or out of the ordinary, but a nice feel-good flick.4/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Instantly engaging, funny, incredibly entertaining and endlessly endearing. This type of film rests entirely on the shoulders of its cast, and this cast more than delivers. They have such great chemistry together and make all of their characters completely real and relatable while still offering the over-the-top laughs that these sorts of individuals could on a daily basis. The film doesn't feel like it's trying at all because the actors feel like they themselves are having the time of their lives. I have no idea how much of it was improvised or not, but it always feels that way from the get-go. The character interactions and dialogue feel organic, which is something that Linklater has always excelled at but for some reason had trouble accomplishing in Boyhood.If there's one tiny nitpick that I have, is that scenes revolving around Beverly were just not as interesting, and that's when the film seemed to try a little harder. I also thought Blake Jenner was fine, but I did find so many of the supporting characters and actors around him to be more interesting. Not sure if that's a reflection on Jenner, or just on the fact that, usually in films like this, the supporting cast does steal the show. Regardless, a fantastic, fantastic film and a definite step up from Linklater's last film. That final scene and shot were absolutely perfect in the most mundanely beautiful way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Totally awesome! Filled with appealing unknown (to me) actors and tons of great period music. Funny as hell and really sweet. I want to watch it a million times.There's a scene where a few of the guys are passing a bong around and in the background is a Pink Floyd song I've always loved but never heard in a movie before. ("Fearless"). How can you not love a movie where a bunch of dudes are passing a bong to Pink Floyd? An offhand line took a beat to sink in but had me guffawing maybe a bit too boisterously once it hit me. One guy hopes the Astros win the World Series that year, and this Philadelphia baseball fan roared! (Look up the 1980 MLB postseason, kids.) It truly is a spiritual sequel to D&amp;C but, since the characters are a bit older, there's a bit of nudity thrown in, which I absolutely approve of.And since the main characters are college baseball teammates, there are many good-looking, athletic men in half shirts and short shorts and jock straps to look at for two hours, if that's your bag. It's totally mine.Some reasons I love contemporary movies set in the seventies and eighties are the costumes and hairstyles. They make the movie that much more entertaining.The female lead is played by Lea Thompson's daughter. Damn I'm getting up there when Lea Thompson has a child old enough to play a college student.When you see this movie, stay through the credits. My favorite D&amp;C callback may be the way the cast is credited, this time to The Cars instead of Foghat. If the best movies become illegal then Everybody Wants Some!! is under arrest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Richard Linklater's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The wait for Richard Linklater's follow-up to the masterpiece that is Boyhood is now over, with the release of his new film, Everybody Wants Some!!. Linklater has found ways multiple times to keep his audience engaged by spending time with the characters in films such as Dazed and Confused and School of Rock, and this film is no exception. The film begins with a montage of a young kid named Jake Bradford (Blake Jenner) on his way to college at Southeast Texas University. He is a pitcher who was a star in high school and we see him move in to the house where his teammates live. Shortly after meeting them, a few of them drive to around, where one of them tries to flirt with a couple of girls moving in, but they both reject the teammate and one of the girls says she likes the quiet one in the back, referring to Jake. The girl is Beverly (Zoey Deutch), a performing arts major. The film takes place in 1980 during the entire weekend before Jake begins his freshman year. Linklater shows the guys being competitive at everything they do at the houses, them partying, having fun, and trying to be grown up. Linklater's direction is fun and focused on the characters, and the script focuses on what it's like to be in college. In an unusual way, Linklater has made this film sort of a sequel to both and . As for performances, Blake Jenner is likable as Jake. He has a calm presence as someone trying to be one of the guys, yet try to start a relationship with the girl he meets. Zoey Deutch is very good here as Beverly, the performing arts major. I enjoyed all of the scenes between Beverly and Jake. All of the actors who play Jake's teammates are fun and entertaining in their own quirky ways. Tyler Hoechlin has come a long way since Road to Perdition, and shows an interesting role here as Glenn McReynolds, a power hitter and team leader who hates pitchers. I think this is one of Richard Linklater's best films, but not his overall best. I still think Boyhood is his best film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fresh off the huge success of 'Boyhood' Richard Linklater has another movie for us. This time we get "the spiritual sequel" to 'Dazed and Confused'. Or the unofficial continuation of 'Boyhood' as others call it. This film is about a couple baseball players living out the final few days before school officially starts. The whole film basically just lets us hang out with these guys and get to know them as our main character does. The interesting part of the movie is how natural it all feels. Although you totally realize that these characters aren't real people, the "story" that involves them feels so natural that it's hard to think of these characters as anything but. This made the film an absolute blast.As soon as you get past your expectations for what kind of movie this should be and just relax with these people it becomes a real good time. You follow them as they belt songs in the car, make DIY water beds, and go to clubs among various other things. Honestly, this movie really did catch me off guard. There isn't anything about this that is remotely "cinematic". There isn't anything conventional or standard about its storytelling. There isn't any through line, character arcs, or villains. It's just college students living their lives. Which really makes this movie difficult to rate or even talk about. You just hang out with these guys for two hours and that's it.Which is the films greatest strength and biggest weakness. It felt very organic and in the moment. Yet nothing was particularly interesting about it. Even the films main character isn't that great. The two characters that I really got attached to were the surprisingly literal Finnegan and &#x200b;difficult to read McRenyonlds. Who really carried the film for me.It may have been because I know people like this or because I want to know people like this. I'm really not sure, but either way they were the ones that drove the "story" along for me. Again, I say "story" because there isn't a story at all. I kept expecting it to take a turn and introduce a love interest or add some kind of conflict and it really doesn't until it's basically over.Which meant that it never had time to build on this in any meaningful way. It just sort of meanders around for a couple of hours deliberately wasting your time. Even though it doesn't. There are a couple of moments where it tries to comment on life and how we shouldn't be afraid of the unknown but this also goes by the wayside. It doesn't introduce this idea until it's to late to be impactful at all.That being said I had a great time wasting two hours of my life. The characters the film offers us are incredibly compelling to watch and are brought to life very well through the collective performances. It's funny, laid back, and feels about as in the moment as a film possibly can be. But that's really all it has to offer. The story is non existent and it doesn't exactly know what to do with itself. But if you put this all together than you have a good way to burn time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sequel to Dazed And Confused</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Everybody Wants Some!!", starring Blake Jenner-Supergirl_tv, Glee_tv; Zoey Deutch-Dirty Grandpa, Vampire Academy, she is also the daughter of Lea Thompson; Tyler Hoechlin-Teen Wolf_tv, Hall Pass and Wyatt Russell-22 Jump Street, Cowboys &amp; Aliens, he is also the son of Kurt Russell &amp; Goldie Hawn.This is a loosely based sequel to the 1993 'Dazed and Confused' and the 2014 'Boyhood', all of which are directed by Richard Linklater. This one takes place in the 1980's and follows Blake as he shows up for college. He is a freshman pitcher on the baseball team and the movie takes place the weekend before classes start. Tyler and Wyatt are fellow players and Zoey is the love interest for Blake. All the players have distinct personalities; one is a stoner, one is a redneck, one is just plain psycho, well, you get the picture. The weekend is filled with everyone getting to know each other; lots of going to clubs of all sorts-rock, country and even punk-lots of drinking, a little bit of the old hazing of the new players and lots of girl chasing. There is an abundance of 1980's music heard throughout the film; I remember hearing The Cars, Pat Benatar, ZZ Top, Pink Floyd, Van Halen, Cheap Trick and many more. As the end credits are just about finished, there is a rap video with members of the cast that is pretty good. If you liked 'Dazed and Confused', you should enjoy this one, too. It's rated "R" for language, drug use and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 57 minutes. I don't know if I would buy it on DVD but it would be a good rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>EVERYBODY WANT SOME !! (2016) **** Blake Jenner, Juston Street, Ryan Guzman, Tyler Hoechlin, Wyatt Russell, Glen Powell, Temple Baker, J. Quinton Johnson, Will Brittain, Zoey Deutch, Austin Amelio , Tanner Kalina, Forrest Vickery. Filmmaker Richard Linklater's kissing cousin sequel of sorts to DAZED AND CONFUSED focuses on another group of young adults in the waning days of summer of 1980 prior to their first day of college with a ragtag team of baseball players feeling out their newfound surroundings, roommates and the opposite sex. Filmed with fun, zeal for the era with one ass-kicking jukebox of '80s nuggets of pop &amp; rock (yes the tile is from a Van Halen song) and an unknown cast that has an ease that pleases. If you didn't grow up then you will totally be enmeshed of the decade and its last greatest generation (yes I said it since I'm part of it!) just having fun. Relax and enjoy the ride, dude!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, if you're over 25, there is a good chance you will not enjoy this movie. When we saw the previews in the theaters, my wife and I thought this movie would need a good review if we were ever going to see it. It looked like a complete loser, but how could it be that bad if it was made by Richard Linklater who made Boyhood that we loved.When the critics' reviews came out, they were almost universally positive with a Metascore of 84, and the IMDb user score was around 8.0 The time was convenient, the theater (Arclight in Bethesda) was our favorite, the Washington Post critic Ann Hornaday (who has lost a lot of my trust) gave it three stars and a good writeup. How could it be that bad? Maybe I should have noticed that nearly 10% of the raters on IMDb gave it a 1.The actors in the film, most of whom are unknowns, did a good job. The filming was very good. But the story, what little there was of one, was a real looser. It centered on the male bonding of a group of baseball scholarship athletes at a college in Texas. It took place during three days before the start of the fall semester in 1980. The first 75% of the film consisted primarily of partying, drinking, trying to hookup, more partying, more drinking, etc. The last 25%, where a real story began to develop, was good.I rate movies on enjoyment. For instance, Horrible Bosses, which got mixed reviews, I gave a 9. It was very enjoyable and I got a lot of laughs from it. I hated Birdman, which had high ratings similar to Everybody Wants Some. I've come to the conclusion that you can't trust the professional critics, and you can't always trust users on IMDb. The question is, can you trust my wife and me who see about 100 movies a year in the theaters. You decide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Spiritual Successor To 'Dazed And Confused' Lives Up To Its Claim</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bursting with fun, flavour &amp; flamboyance from the first frame to the last, the spiritual successor to Richard Linklater's Dazed and Confused finds the affluential filmmaker applying the same formula that made his 1993 coming-of-age comedy an instant classic and is an incredibly refreshing, delightfully amusing, thoroughly entertaining, effortlessly endearing &amp; endlessly nostalgic cinema that's definitely amongst the best films of the year, so far.Set in 1980s Texas, the story of Everybody Wants Some!! follows a college freshman who arrives three days before the start of college and moves into a home that shelters members of the college baseball team. After getting acquainted with the rest of his teammates, he heads out with them for fun and, over the course of the next three days, gets a brief taste of the freedom &amp; adventures that lie ahead of him in the freewheeling, unsupervised &amp; experimental years of college life.Written &amp; directed by Richard Linklater, the film successfully lives up to its "spiritual sequel" claim, for it shares a striking similarity with Dazed and Confused in content, contains equally colourful set of characters, and captures the vibe of its decade with precision. The backdrop may have changed from high-school setting to college campus but the quasi-intellectual pastimes &amp; philosophical ramblings retain the tang of the original, not to mention that it pretty much nails the college subculture of the 1980s.The script embraces its loosely-structured narrative that actually prefers going with the flow rather than having any sense of where it is headed, and even though the free-flowing conversations, randomly-occurring events &amp; pop-culture references may not play any significant role in plot progression, those seemingly unnecessary moments do give each character an identity of their own. What Linklater does here is that he takes his 1993 classic as a template, and carves an original, engaging &amp; invigorating tale on it that works on more levels than one.Production design team does a fabulous job at recreating the college atmosphere of the 1980s and makes sure that the tiniest of details are in sync with the depicted timeline. The fluid camera-work &amp; bright colour palette infuse a vibrant energy of its own, thus further uplifting the experience. Editing is slick, for there isn't a single dull moment in the movie, pacing is steady, and everything unfolds in a streamlined manner. As for the soundtrack, it incorporates songs belonging to its era and they are almost always in tune with the accompanying scenes.Coming to the performances, Everybody Wants Some!! features a terrific cast in Blake Jenner, Glen Powell, Zoey Deutch, Ryan Guzman, Tyler Hoechlin, Will Brittain, Wyatt Russell &amp; others, and each one of them chip in with welcome contribution. However, the best thing about this ensemble is the remarkable chemistry they all share with each other. Every character has an identity of their own and the actors chosen to play these scripted people embrace it wholeheartedly. Jenner does well as the centrepiece of this story but it's Powell who impresses the most.On an overall scale, Everybody Wants Some!! is yet another confidently-directed masterpiece from Richard Linklater that captures the idyllic version of college life in an extremely natural manner and addresses themes that are universal in nature &amp; not generation-specific. Overflowing with booze, babes, baseball, ping pong, narcotics, cologne, moustache, 80s gear, nightclubs, dancing, punk concerts, costume parties, casual sex &amp; much more, Everybody Wants Some!! promises an amazing time to its viewers and delivers it in heavy doses. An instant classic. Strongly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everybody does want some, of this!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's like a lost gem of the 1980sProving that slapstick comedy, hot girls, and stoners are ageless, Dazed and confused director, Richard Linklater created a relateable comedy about male bounding and sets it in the 1980s.A freshmen baseball player experiences the best first three days of college possible.It may look like it came out at the same time as such slapstick comedies as Porky's and Animal House, but just like those screwball comedies, Everybody wants some is timeless.This is bound to be one of those movies that everyone will put on their greatest teen comedies list.Everybody Wants Some is littered with with distinguished and thought out characters and it's a never ending list of them all the way down to those who appear once just for a one-liner. It's impressive when you're doing a movie about jocks who can only think of women and baseball (not in that order). Some of the guys looked a lot alike and yet I could still tell difference between them.It helps that the acting was pretty good as well.It's perfect. It's laugh out loud, it's entertaining and enjoyable, it's done by a serious filmmaker but does not take itself so serious. Just sit back and enjoy your popcorn.Everybody Wants Some!! I want some Too!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Linklater's belated fun follow up to Dazed &amp; Confused</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Linklater writes and directs this (loose) follow-up to his 1993 film Dazed &amp; Confused.This film takes place in late August 1980 and follows a college baseball team in the three days in the run up to the beginning of term.With a great soundtrack working it's way from Disco, Funk, Country &amp; Western, Rock, Punk and Electronica, this was an unexpectedly entertaining film.While Dazed &amp; Confused is a movie with a cult following, I found some of the characters felt like over the top caricatures(not having been to an American High School in the mid 70s, I may be wrong). This was not the case with this film. I'm not trying to say that there weren't the usual Linklater 'freaks', but they felt more grounded in reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Everybody Wants Some!!" gives back a whole lot!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a whole lot of wanting going on as the 1970s ended and the 1980s unfolded, if the music of the time is any indication. The 1980s had more songs with some form of "want" in the title than any other decade in the rock 'n roll era (it IS called The "Me" Decade, after all), but they expressed their wants in different ways. Most songwriters of the late 70s and 80s just came out and said it, for example, wanting candy, a new drug, your love, your sex, for you to want me, to be with you, to stay with you, to do something freaky to you, etc., as well as to be a cowboy, to be your lover, to know what love is, to be your everything, to be startin' somethin', to be free, to rock, to dance (with somebody who loves me) or just wanting to stop. Sometimes, we heard what the singers did NOT want? to live without your love, to go on with you like that, or to be right (if loving you is wrong). Other times, the song asked the listener the question, like whether you wanted to touch me, to hold me, to make love or to hurt me (as in, "really" hurt me). But the thing that "wanting" songs do best is to give a voice to the desires of the masses. Listening to the music of the late 70s and the 80s, you'd learn that "I'm" wanted (dead or alive), girls just wanna have fun, all "she" wants to do is dance (and make romance), kids wanna rock, and "everybody" either wants to rule the world, wants you, or just wants? Some(!!). But, "some" of what?? Oh, THAAAT "some". (I just listened to the Van Halen song again.) That song lends its title (repetitive punctuation and all) to the comedy "Everybody Wants Some!!" (R, 1:57). The film comes from auteur Richard Linklater who directed "Dazed and Confused", "School of Rock", the "Before?" trilogy and the Best Picture nominee "Boyhood" ? and also wrote most of those films. It's the first and last on that list that have the strongest connection with Linklater's 2016 theatrical release. While "Dazed and Confused" followed a group of high school students through their beginning of summer partying on the night of the last day of school in 1976, "Everybody Wants Some!!" focuses on a group of college students getting settled in and enjoying themselves before classes start in the fall of 1980, some of them preparing to start their very first year of college. That means that some of the younger characters in "Dazed" could have appeared in "Everybody". What's more, "Boyhood" follows its central character from the age of 6 to the age of 18 in real time, leading Linklater himself to say that the theme of "Boyhood" is continued in "Everybody", whose poster also calls it the "spiritual successor" to "Dazed and Confused". But, just as not everyone in the 1993 film was dazed or confused, those in the 2016 film want more than "some".The central character is Jake (Blake Jenner), a tall, handsome freshman with a toothy grin and a talent for throwing a baseball. Unlike most brand new college students, when he arrives at his fictional university in western Texas, he moves straight into a house off campus. This house is home to the players of the university's vaunted baseball program, guys who practice all year long (even during the off season) in the hopes of bringing their school a national championship. Jake's housemates come from all over the country, are at different stages in their college careers and are all very different, except that each one is very competitive ? and has personality to spare. Jake shares a room with high-strung country boy Billy Autrey (Will Britain). There are two other freshmen in the house, Alex Brumley and Ty Plummer (Tanner Kalina and Temple Baker), who are nice, but not very bright. These four dudes are introduced to college life by the likes of ace hitter McReynolds (Tyler Hoechlin, looking vaguely like a young Burt Reynolds), pitcher and pseudo-philosopher Finnegan (Glen Powell), pot-head pitcher Willoughby (Wyatt Russell), the very smooth Dale (Quinton Johnson), who's the only minority in the house, the hot-tempered, 1890s-mustachioed Nesbit (Austin Amelio), the lackadaisical Coma (Forrest Vickery) and the nerdy, but self-aggrandizing star pitcher, Jay (Juston Street), who feels that he always has to show how great and tough he is? to his teammates, a bartender, a bouncer, and even an innocent chain-link fence."Everybody Wants Some!!" doesn't have much of a plot, but it's plenty fun anyway. The movie's about adjusting to college life, enjoying the last few days before classes start and? making great memories. There's an ongoing subplot involving Jake getting romantic with a smart and adorable freshman performing arts major named Beverly (Zoey Deutch), but this film isn't about telling a complex story. Like its 1993 predecessor, it's about a moment in time and (especially) its colorful characters. Also like "Dazed and Confused", there aren't many stars in this movie (as big as they get is Ryan Guzman, from the "Step Up" films, in a small role), but several members of this cast likely have bright futures ahead of them. (How many people really knew Milla Jovovich, Adam Goldberg, Renee Zellweger, Ben Affleck, Parker Posey or even Matthew McConaughey in 1993?) The appeal of this film is in its well-crafted nostalgia (if you remember the 80s or ever went away to college), its subtle but important life lessons (if you're the reflective sort), its little bit of romance and sex (if you enjoy loving and being loved), the camaraderie of its cast (if you have friends), its sense of humor (if you like to laugh) and the fun of it all (if you're into that sort of thing). "Everybody Wants Some!!" has some(thing) for everyone but mostly a great time at the movies! "A-"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Linklater!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'EVERYBODY WANTS SOME!!': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Richard Linklater's new nostalgic coming-of-age flick; this one is about a Texas college baseball team, in 1980. Linklater wrote and directed the film, and it's been called a 'spiritual sequel' to his 1993 cult classic 'DAZED AND CONFUSED'. Linklater also considers it a sequel to 'BOYHOOD'; because it picks up at the time, in a young man's life, when that movie left off. The film stars Blake Jenner, Glen Powell, Zoey Deutch, Tyler Hoechlin, Ryan Guzman, Wyatt Russell and Will Brittain. I enjoyed the movie, and think it's classic Linklater!The film is set in 1980 Texas; at an old house, that college baseball players live in (due to the school's dorm facilities being overfilled). It revolves around a new freshman pitcher, named Jake (Jenner), that just moved into the house. He meets his teammates, and parties with them (before school starts). Jake also falls for a female college student, named Beverly (Deutch), that lives nearby. The film has no story, or direction (of any kind); it's also slow- paced (because of this), meandering and long (at nearly 2 hours). Despite all these flaws, I enjoyed it. It's funny, and it has a great 80s/70s nostalgic feel to it; it kind of reminds me of the 80s teen sex comedy flicks that I grew up on. It's definitely not as good as 'DAZED AND CONFUSED', or 'BOYHOOD', but it is an entertaining movie.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHm0V1TOCkg</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply put -- for a fun time, go see this flick. It's an effervescent and irreverent look at college life in the 1980s, as seen from the viewpoint of college baseball athletes in Texas.Everything does happens that you can imagine happening in a campus comedy, but even so, it's always surprising. Richard Linklater is a wonderful filmmaker who has a relaxed and natural way of presenting characters and events.&nbsp; The escapades roll on and keep the audience entertained and often in stitches. The actors are comical in an unforced way, and every scene is cleverly constructed. The net result is that you feel you've enjoyed the company of some startling lunatics having a good time. I bet that even with the rigors of film production that this gang of actors really did enjoy themselves. Clever wit and innovative physical scenes keep your mind hopping.If I could add one thing, it would be a stronger plot. But Linklater is not too fond of traditional notions of plot, I think, so that's OK. Zoey Deutch is so appealing that she deserved more screen time. But that's a small complaint. As I said: go see it and have a fun time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everybody Wants Some!! (2016): Dir: Richard Linklater / Cast: Blake Jenner, Will Britain, Tyler Hoechlin, Wyatt Russell, Austin Amelio: It is stated as Richard Linklater's spiritual sequel to Dazed and Confused, which was set in 1976 last day of classes. Here we have reached the last summer weekend of 1980 before college and the film follows a group of baseball players getting situated in a rundown house. Blake Jenner plays Jake, central character finding his place, embracing his talents, and finding romance. Will Britain plays the cowboy looking Autrey whose accent has him the butt of jokes. Tyler Hoechlin plays star hitter McReynolds whose perfectionist attitude have him flaring in anger when losing a ping pong match against Jake. Still, he demonstrates perfectly that he can sever a baseball with a swing of an axe just by focusing on the pitched ball. Wyatt Russell plays a pot smoking pitcher who invites the boys to his room to get high in the midst of great 1980's nostalgia in the music industry. Austin Amelio steals scenes as hot tempered Nesbit whose awkward nature is on display to everyone but himself. He cannot admit to failure and his temper gets them all kicked out of a nightclub called The Sound Machine. This is a very fun movie full of great 1980's music that should leave viewers reflecting yesteryear when college represented the next stage of progression but as that first day of class becomes a reality they all settle in to rest of the excitement of the weekend's activities. They dream of the days where everybody wanted some but reality is that they have to work for it. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Linklater embraces his inner weird in Everybody Wants Some!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>95% of the time, I would have zero interest in seeing a movie about college baseball players reveling in alcohol and women. Luckily, Everybody Wants Some!! is more than a typical party movie: it's a party movie directed by hangout auteur Richard Linklater, who has already proved his ability to confound dubious review intro statistics and turn deceptively unambitious premises into quietly transcendent cinema.Despite following (basically) the same blueprint as Linklater's 1993 70s shenanigan fest Dazed and Confused, Everybody Wants Some!! never feels derivative. This is largely in part due to Linklater's unparalleled ability to pepper in low-key philosophical musings into effortlessly natural settings. Linklater's latest would perhaps feel more thought-provoking if it wasn't following on the heels of his coming-of-age epic Boyhood, but in the unbridled fun department, Everybody Wants Some!! beats Boyhood by a landslide.The film's exclamation point-riddled title begs the following pair of questions: (1) Is it truly worthy of two exclamation points? (2) Everybody wants some? but of what? Luckily, one is not required to ponder these questions to simply enjoy the experience of the movie, which does in fact warrant a tag team of exclamatory punctuation marks.Within the film's first 15 minutes, a collegiate team of charismatic, booze-swilling athletes attempt to create a makeshift waterbed, nail an in-vehicle sing along to "Rapper's Delight", and engage in verbal jousting against a girl with a typewriter. "We have to meet them at their level!" suggests Finnegan (Glen Powell), the team's fountain of unsolicited wisdom, shortly before being bested.Rest assured, the fun doesn't stop there. The intimate level of realism that allowed Boyhood to resonate with so many is on full display in Everybody Wants Some!! Regardless of their athleticism, Linklater makes his audience feel as if they are actually hanging out with these guys. Each scene so skillfully immerses us into gemlike moments of male bonding that we are made to feel like bona fide teammates.We taste the sweat trickling over our lips as the team dances disco at the Sound Machine, feel the crunch of cracking peanut shells beneath our feet while they saunter across the littered floors of a Texas cowboy bar, and, for better or worse, we even tingle with the painful sting of a no holds barred round of knuckles between two particularly competitive teammates (Tanner Kalina &amp; Austin Amelio).Beyond physical sensations, the conversations between the guys are made to feel so real, that viewers inevitably will be reminded of the social rhythms of the real life conversations that they have had in the past, not to mention the real life emotions that accompanied them. Linklater embeds his audience in these moments to such a degree that even the oft-derided prospect of watching baseball (in this case, a preseason practice) is made to feel as taught as any thriller.All fun aside, the second question remains. What exactly is it that everybody wants some of? The film's freshman protagonist Jake (Blake Jenner) wants to see the girl from Room 307 (Zoey Deutch) before classes start up in a matter of days, while his fellow freshman teammate Plummer (Temple Baker) just wants to find out what classes he should register for in the first place. Jake's roommate Billy (Will Brittain) wants respect from his team instead of getting called "Beuter Perkins" on account of his rural Texas accent and being further harassed for running up the phone bill contacting his back home girlfriend. Jay (Justin Street), one of Jake's upperclassmen teammates, wants fame; his intensity is apparent from the moment Jake notices him fervently squeezing a hand exerciser on the front porch. Jay even claims to be on the radar of pro team scouts due to his alleged 95 mph fast ball.So what is the coveted some of Everybody Wants Some!!? Of course, the answers to such a vague quandary are endless, but by the end of Everybody Wants Some!! I wanted one or two more well- developed female characters (But then again, what do you expect in a movie about an 80s male baseball team?), downloads of every soundtrack cut not already on my iPod, and ultimately, to spend a few more days with a platoon of jocks that I previously believed I could never enjoy spending mere hours with.Grade: A- Reviewed by Ben Pieper on April 10th, 2016</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Richard Linklater's now twenty-five plus years of filmmaking are loosely tied together with his constant desire to explore and observe how, within the confines of society, people connect with each other (or don't). In what he has termed a "spiritual sequel" to his cult classic Dazed and Confused, the filmmaker takes us down memory lane to a college campus as the 1970's devolved into the 1980's.Many of these characters and moments are undoubtedly snatched from Linklater's own experiences as a college baseball player at Sam Houston State (after graduating from Bellaire High School). Linklater knows these guys. Heck, he WAS one of these guys! The cinematic kinship goes beyond Dazed and Confused, and influence can be seen as the follow-up to his Boyhood film, with some flavor from Animal House and a dose of Bull Durham.The film opens with Jake (Blake Jenner) driving his 442 muscle car up to the baseball house while "My Sharona" from The Knack blasts from his car stereo. What follows is a look at the behind the scenes tribal nature of a sports team, and how that blends with the predictable manner in which 18-21 year old boys handle a sudden shot of freedom. Conversation and activities center on three things: baseball, girls, and beer ? with priorities shifting given the circumstances of the moment. What's never missing is the ultra-competitiveness of these individuals raised to be the best. Whether it's nerf basketball in the living room, foosball at the bar, or flicking knuckles, the goal of that point in time is to be better than the other guy ? even a friendly game of ping pong turns hyper-tense as it nears game point.Linklater has assembled a terrific cast that not only succeeds in capturing the time period, but also the essence of the age group. Some of the faces will be familiar, and each character fits nicely into the profile. Tyler Hoechlin (Tom Hanks' son in Road To Perdition) is team captain McReynolds, Wyatt Russell (son of Kurt and Goldie) plays elder statesman and team spiritualist Willoughby, Juston Street (former Longhorn player) plays the jacked-up overly intense freshman pitcher, J Quinton Johnson is the sometimes rational second baseman, and Glen Powell is a real standout as the smooth-talking and philosophical Finnegan ? also a master of pranks. Despite the ever-present quest for girls, Zoey Duetch's Beverly is the only female character with much screen time, and she makes the best of it as a smart, ambitious love interest for young Jake.I've always believed that the music of our youth goes a long way in defining each generation. Linklater seems to agree (the soundtrack is spot on) as this group is bounced between the fading days of disco, the sterile and soulless transition to Urban Cowboy Country music, and the desperate pleas of new edge Punk Rock. Within the 3 days we are with the guys, they take their athlete swagger to each venue type, and even mix in a party thrown by Beverly's "artsy-fartsy" group. Figuring out where one fits is a rite of passage not to be missed.Linklater ensures that our tight knit teammates fill our ears with an endless stream of quips, wise-cracks and put-downs, each designed to register dominance ? if only for the briefest moment. We even get a sequence featuring the ballplayers actually playing ball, and though their tone shits once on the field, the personalities remain evident. In addition to adding "f***withery" to our vocabulary, the production design is brilliant and captivating all by itself. The album and book covers, cars (a Gremlin sighting), stereo equipment and costumes all provide the throwback feel necessary for the film. Though it lacks any real plot, and feels meandering (just like its characters), Linklater provides the best insight yet into the driving forces of young male primates of 1980. It's not always pretty or something of which to be proud, but ? that's what I'm talking about!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spiritual sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Definitely the "spiritual sequel" to Dazed and Confused. This movie was fun which I believe can be mainly attributed to the chemistry between the main cast. This movie made me feel like I was watching The Sandlot group of kids all grown up and on the same team in college. I also liked that you don't need to know anything about baseball to watch this movie about baseball players.The soundtrack is also amazing.Featuring great dialogue and a narrative that is very (almost too) in-the-moment, this is Linklater's new film and his signature style slightly suffering from the post-Boyhood effect.Though hardly a patch on Linklater's decade-defining Dazed and Confused, there's actually enough here in Everybody Wants Some to make us all want to relive the '80s Everybody Wants Some isn't quite the disaster I was expecting (hoping?) it would be. But not entirely a classic, either. Good enough though for a modern audience.Source: http://www.huludb.com/movies/224791-everybody-wants-some</fullReview>
