		<shortDescription>Wow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to see an advanced screening for this film. I had a toss up between two films to see and I chose this one based on the trailer and generally positive reviews (who likes to waste their time with bad movies). Wow.This is one of those rare feats in filmmaking. The cinematography is great, but see this for the acting and the story. Not often has a movie made me cry, laugh, and shout out (aloud mind you) during the films run time. I don't want to spoil much of the story as it becomes obvious early on, what is actually going on. The magnificence of this film is in how the director was able to tackle the difficult subject matter in a way that doesn't leave you feeling like you saw an average thriller/horror movie, but really out it in perspective of the child, which I believe had a humanistic approach. It was amazing. Best movie of 2015, by a long shot and they're were great movies this year. (Im looking at you exmachina) Not only I, but I feel absolutely everyone who left the theater left a better person for what they witnessed. Not often do I come out of the theater with people being more polite than they were upon entering. THAT is the power this movie has, I emerged myself in the experience and I'm glad I did, because "No one is strong alone", certainly not I, and I have a more profound idea of appreciation of my own life and existence til death. I will continue on my quest but I know that I will never forget this landmark film, what it taught me, and how it humbled everyone in the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imagine yourself as a 5 year old child discovering for the first time a brand new world exists outside of your room</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival the film "ROOM" won the People's Choice Award today. It tells a story of a young woman and her five year old son who have been held in captivity in a confined and windowless living space for six years. Brie Larson stars as Ma and her son named Jack is played by Jacob Tremblay who is so believable that you will feel empathetic towards their captivity but relief as to how Ma convinces Jack that their little world is real and is wonderful. As Jack grows he starts to ask questions about their isolated lifestyle and we the audience anticipate that Ma must try and escape with young Jack but how?The story draws similarities to the actual events that were Jaycee Lee Dugard's true life story which occurred on June 10, 1991, in South Lake Tahoe, California. Dugard was 11 years old at the time she was abducted from a street while she was walking from home to a school bus stop and she was held captive for the next 18 years in a concealed back yard in a make shift shed. There is also some resemblance to the kidnapping of Amanda Berry who had a child fathered by her kidnapper Ariel Castro. This film was titled Cleveland Abduction and it was released in 2015. It tells the true story of three girls who were held captive for over 10 years by Ariel Castro in his home with no one aware how close the girls were to their own homes and families.The film Room focuses more on Jack and Ma's awkward adjustment to life outside of their room which was their entire world for the past six years. There is a strong supporting cast including performances such as Joan Allen's role as Jack's loving Grandma and the ever convincing all-star William H Macy as a resistant Grandpa who is having difficulty accepting that his daughter is raising her rapist's son. There are some scenes that are so heartwarming that it will be difficult not to find yourself becoming emotionally involved. In one particular very touching and loving scene, Jack asks his Grandma to cut his long hair so that the strength that he thinks that his shoulder length hair possesses can be transferred over to his sick Ma so she can return home from the hospital. Jack who understandably is initially withdrawn from anyone other than his Ma simply tells his Grandma after she washes and cuts his hair that he loves her. This loving scene between Jack and his Grandma will stay with me forever. Jack and Ma's is a story of isolation, fear, hopelessness versus hope and most importantly a film about redemption and the family bond. Room is deserving of an Oscar nomination for best picture and nominations in a few other categories as well such as best actress, best actor and best director. I give the film a 9.5 out of 10 rating. This film is terrific!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film I've seen in years: indescribable!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know one thing, I will never, ever forget this heartrending, unbelievably-acted 'movie' for the rest of my days. I'm just at a loss for words and struggling to describe how truly powerful and heart-grabbing this story was. I'll go so far as to say that if you don't cry, shed a tear, or feel the urge to weep profusely after (or while) watching Room, you don't have a heart. The mother (Brie Larson) and her son (Jacob Tremblay, 9 years old!) carry this entire movie. The beauty of Room is in its bare rawness, realness and universally relatable nature. What can I say? It tapped into something deep, deep, deep within me and just ripped my heart to shreds and had me in tears; sometimes tears of sadness, and other times tears of heavenly joy. It made me smile at times and even laugh. But most of all, it always had my eyes glued to the screen and my soul enthralled by what I was witnessing. This is one of the best, truly real stories ever told and one of the best uses of cinema I've ever seen. ...Try not to read much/anything about it before going in to see it (and yes, definitely catch it in a theater near you ASAP). Go in and be engrossed and moved (in ways I can't describe) by this experience. 10/10 *Hands down* the best film of 2015, and the single best thing I've seen in years. :')</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A non-traditional thriller with another brilliant turn from Brie Larson but an even better one from Jacob Tremblay.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Room is a harrowing thriller, but not in the traditional sense of the word. It deals with a dark subject matter and the first half of the film can be quite disturbing. Yet director Lenny Abrahamson (Frank) has adapted the best-selling novel with grace and grandeur. Here is a film so artistically unique and deviant, chock full of genuine emotion thanks to two outstanding performances, that isn't afraid to take risks and surprise at every turn.Based on the novel by Emma Donoghue, Room introduces us to Ma and Jack, a mother and son held captive in a garden shed. As we learn more about their captivity, their world becomes clearer and clearer to us. They live by a routine, have names for every object in room, and Ma must be careful as her son grows older and more curious.The film is structured into two halves, and by now it's no spoiler that the second half deals with their readjustment into the outside world, and Jack's first time outside of room. The film is thematically complex, yet never overwhelming. At its core it's about motherhood, but Jack's unique upbringing complicates things.Director Lenny Abrahamson is no stranger to the strange, and with Room he's made a masterpiece of filmmaking. The entire idea of 'room,' the abstract concept of space, is ever-present in the production. In their bubble of room, Ma and Jack are restricted, as evident by Abrahamson's close angles and tight shots. The small space allows for high concept filmmaking, and when they get out of room, it only gets better, with a new color palette and experimental camera angles through Jack's eyes. The entire film is seen through the eyes of this child, and it's genius. What I loved about the book was its focus on Jack and how he adjusts to seeing this new world for the first time, and the movie never loses sight of that.I wrote about the pressure placed on child actors in my review for the incredible Beasts of No Nation, and Jacob Tremblay fits like a glove. Like Abraham Attah, he isn't a child actor, but an actor who just happens to be of a younger age. His wide eyes and expressive thoughts are very believable, and when he sees the outside world for the first time, it's a thing of beauty. Tremblay has brilliant chemistry with Brie Larson, and for one second I never doubted her devotion to him. As Ma faces frustrating upon leaving room, from her parents, doctors, and the media, she never forgets her son Jack, and always puts his wellbeing first. Larson taps into this character, one that undergoes a stunning transformation as she basically lost seven years of her life being locked up. Her performance will blow you away.The best actors are the ones able to transport you into their characters' own universes, no matter how isolated from society they happen to be. Larson, Tremblay, and Joan Allen all have a tremendous range of emotional ability and are able to sell you on their story not just for two hours, but for an entire lifetime. With Room, Abrahamson goes the extra mile with his direction, and director of photography Danny Cohen keeps all eyes on Jack. The film asks us to examine how we view the world and how this viewpoint is shaped by our nurtured upbringing. The result is a breathtaking experience brought to life, one you won't soon forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Insert all 9 &amp; 10 reviews here* I was in awe during the entire film. Lenny Abrahamson &amp; the writing team made sure there was not one dull moment. The addition of "insignificant" characters and plot twists are later realized to be so significant and influential in keeping the film alive throughout its duration. It was the little things that made this story one of the best I've seen in a long time. I experienced an entire palette of emotions all at once and was left in a deep level of curiosity and reflection. Very few films have the power to continue to influence its audience after the credits. Room is endless in the most beautiful way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant movie, but painful to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Room (2015/I) was directed by Lenny Abrahamson. It stars Jacob Tremblay as Jack and Brie Larson as his mother ("Ma")The situation becomes very clear early in the film. Jack and his mother are held captive by a man who has kidnapped her, raped her, impregnated her, and uses her as his sexual slave. Jack and his mother have lived in a small, locked shed, which they call "Room." Jack's mother has lived in "Room" since she was abducted seven years earlier. Jack has lived there for all of his life--five years.By incredible ingenuity, motivated by love, Ma has kept Jack from realizing the horrors of their situation. It's hard to believe that anyone could be so motivated and capable, allowing the boy to believe that his situation is normal, but it works in the film and you accept it.What happens next is pretty well known, but I won't go into it because it might decrease your enjoyment of the movie. It's dramatic, frightening, and, heart-wrenching, all at the same time.Brie Larson does a wonderful job as the mother, and Jacob Tremblay has to be the best child actor we have. He is absolutely brilliant. Director Abrahamson must be an extremely talented man to draw two such great performances from his actors.This is a must-see film, but it's not easy to watch. Even though Room wasn't based on any specific incident, we all know of cases of warped men who have kidnapped and enslaved women. It's hard to think about the lives of those women without becoming depressed. We saw the film at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. Given the claustrophobic atmosphere of the movie, it will work on the small screen as well. Seek it out and watch, but prepare yourself mentally before you begin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tense and compelling film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lenny Abrahamson's Room opens in a 10 x 10 room that has no windows, a locked door, and no light other than that provided by an overhead skylight. Jack (Jacob Tremblay), a slight five-year old boy with hair down to his shoulders wakes up each morning as he has all his life, saying hello to his world. He says hello, not to the sun or the grass outside his front door where he can run and laugh and play but only to the objects which is all his world consists of: the lamp, the sink, the plant, the refrigerator. His only friend is a mouse that he feeds with some pleasure.Not that he lacks for companionship. Ma (Brie Larson) is with him and their endless days consist of cooking, reading, and watching TV where Jack is told that what he sees on the screen is not real, only pretend. All he knows of the world is what he sees in front of his eyes. Old Nick (Sean Bridgers) brings food and other household items but when he comes, Jack has to hide in his wardrobe, out of sight. Ma, we find out, has been kept prisoner and used for sex by the hulking man who comes every night and we know that Jack is a result of his mother's rape. Jack is the focus of the film and we see everything from his point of view, with the help of his sometime narration but we can also get into his mother's mind and feel her pain and live her dreams.There is never any doubt of his mother's love though the obvious strain of keeping herself from crying out every minute is painfully obvious. To Jack, she is the center of his world and his reason for being. When the second half of the film takes a surprising turn and shifts 180 degrees, Jack and Ma are not prepared for what awaits them. Even when an alternative is suggested as possible, he doesn't want to hear anything about a different world with blue sky and rivers and trees. Room is a tense and compelling film in which Brie Larson more than fulfills the brilliance that she showed in Short Term 12 and should make her an Oscar contender. Tremblay is also superb.He lives his character and makes him come alive, even though he is only nine years old. Supporting roles by Joan Allen and William H. Macy also contribute to the film's second half but it is always Larson and Tremblay that carry the day. The film is not mawkish or sentimental even though the soaring score by Stephen Rennicks comes close. While there are has some plot implausibilities, the film is a tribute to the resiliency and the dedicated love of a parent for their child. It is also a teaching experience. Like many who are walled off from each other and think the box they are in is all there is, the film can give us the combination to open the locked door, if we take the risk to turn the key.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't listen to the haters or those that want to chip away at the overall brilliance of 'Room'. What film doesn't have small flaws, they pale into insignificance during the 2 hours of continuous emotional maelstrom that follows. This film wrings every last drop of emotion and drama out of the allotted playtime. Make no mistake, despite short bursts of touching serenity, this films starts up full throttle and doesn't let-up. I can only assume reviewers here scoring this film 8 or less must be Vulcan by birth, or just terminally insensitive. This is a first rate drama with stand out performances all round. Especially from the child protagonist. **Warning** If you have trouble viewing emotionally charged material of a sensitive nature about abuse. You would be well advised not to view this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Harrowing Film with Incredible Performances!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the novel of the same name by Emma Donoghue, 'Room' is a challenging, unsettling, harrowing film, that leaves you disturbed. But that is its sheer power. The Incredible Performances only add to the film's hefty nature.'Room' Synopsis: After five-year-old Jack and his mother escape from the enclosed surroundings that Jack has known his entire life, the boy makes a thrilling discovery: the outside world.'Room' is a disturbing story about bad things that happen to good people. But its also about hope &amp; fighting back. Its shocking to see the protagonist, a child, discover the world along-with his brave mother, who survived a harrowing experience. I was engrossed &amp; often disturbed by the narrative, especially after the son &amp; mother escape. The series of events that follow are so gut-wrenching, I almost broke down.'Room' is masterfully penned by Emma Donoghue herself. The Writing is consistently powerful &amp; the dialogue are realistic to the core. Lenny Abrahamson's Direction is first-class. He has handled this dramatic, unsettling tale with complete flourish. Cinematography is perfectly claustrophobic. Editing is razor-crisp. Art Design is skilfully done.Performance-Wise: Brie Larson &amp; Jacob Tremblay deliver incredible performances. Brie is astounding as the tormented, yet brave protagonist, while Jacob steals the show with a flawless performance. The child does wonders &amp; makes 'Room' unforgettable. Of the supporting cast, Joan Allen &amp; The Always Solid William H. Macy leave a solid mark.On the whole, 'Room' is a must watch! Its certainly unsettling, but its power is undeniable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome film - shame about the trailer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Room, based on the book by Emma Donoghue, starts on young Jack's 5th birthday. He gets a birthday cake from his mother (but no candles); a visit from his father; and a gift, albeit belatedly. This would all be perfectly normal except that all of this takes place within 'Room' - a confined space with only a single skylight for daylight and no means of escape. For the mother, Joy, was abducted as a teen and locked away for sex in the style of the dreadful real-life examples such as that perpetrated by Josef Fritzl in Austria. Jack is the (presumably) unintended result: a boy with no perception of the real world beyond his four single-sided walls and with the staunchly-held view that the things he sees on a flickering TV screen are in 'TV land' and unreal. Will Jack and Joy survive and ever see freedom again? And that's where I'll leave this synopsis, since (if you've been lucky enough to avoid the trailer) there is a tense cat-and-mouse story to unfurl here.This is an absorbing, although slow-moving, film that builds to some truly nail-biting moments. The screenwriter (also Donoghue) and director (Irishman Lenny "Frank" Abrahamson) are to be commended in keeping the story and drama really well-grounded and un-saccharined. Old Nick (Sean Bridgers), the 'evil kidnapper', is not painted as some predictable monster: he is even portrayed to be kind and caring at some warped level. And there is no gratuitous sex: we are in effect seven years into the story and the abnormal is now completely normalised.The film is told primarily from the viewpoint of Jack (Jacob Tremblay) but we also get under the skin of Joy (Brie Larson) and her emotions in trying to mentally deal with her ordeal. Looking at a picture of her with her school friends she bitterly comments that "Nothing happened to them - - they just got on with their lives".The acting is superb. I made the mistake of voting for John Boyega for the BAFTA Rising Star award before seeing this film (you can cast your vote here http://www.bafta.org/film/awards/ee-rising-star-award-in-2016). Not that Boyega isn't great, but Brie Larson really REALLY delivers here. She obviously won't give a hoot if she wins the Best Actress Oscar! And for me, for this award, she shines out in what I would perhaps see as one of this year's weaker Oscar categories. Jacob Tremblay is also exceptional as Jack - and it would be nice (rather than try to compare young performances with adult ones, as per Anna Paquin) if there was a special awards category for actors and actresses under 10. If there was, then Tremblay would storm it! You seriously forget that this is a child acting a part. He is totally connected to the role and these two core performances lock in your belief in the story.Supporting the cast are the ever reliable William H Macy as Joy's mentally tortured father, Joan Allen (Pamela Landy from the "Bourne" films) as her equally distraught mother and Sean Bridgers as the kidnapper.At 2 hours long some of the scenes in the middle of the film made my attention waver a little. But my main criticism is in the trailer and marketing of the film. If ever there was a need for a true 'teaser trailer' this is it. I never know who is responsible for putting trailers together - whether the director has the final say or whether its some nameless marketing bods in the distribution company, but whoever it is they should be taken out and 'given a good talking to' for this travesty. It's like putting all of the twists in films like "The Crying Game", "The Sixth Sense" and "Gone Girl" in their respective trailers. I've gone so far as to create my own One Mann's Movies cut of the trailer, just for you good people, which I have included with my bob-the-movie-man.com version of this review.A leisurely, nuanced and effecting drama, this is not for fans of "Die Hard" or "Fast and Furious" fans. But for everyone else, this should be a must see.Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review. Thanks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This one is gonna stick with me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Room" is an adaption of an internationally best-seller novel written by Irish playwright and novelist, Emma Donoghue. This is her first book to be adapted into a major motion picture and I have to say that it is a rather impressive one. I have not read Emma's novel yet, but I can only guess that this movie sticks to the novel's roots, considering that Emma decided to write the screenplay herself. Room is a story about a women who was kidnapped during her high school years and locked in a shed for 7 years. She was impregnated by her kidnapper in this room and was locked inside with the child. The child grows up and around the age of five is when the movie picks up. Throughout this entire movie we are taken through this story strictly from the Jack's (the child) point of view. Even though this story is experienced through the lens of this child, the story is in no way filtered or gussied up. It is this intimate and raw story about a child and his mother spending a hugely relevant portion of their existence stuck in this dull, dirty and claustrophobia-inducing shed. This shed contained one small window that emits a tiny portion of daylight into the room. To me, this represented a light at the end of the tunnel. Sort of like a tiny glimmer of hope in a deep and dark abyss. Throughout this entire movie, Jack narrates his experiences as he embarks upon the world. Jacob Trembley portrays this character with such a sense of wonder and innocence that every single narration that I hear from this boy is just heartbreaking. Every time Jack takes away something from the world, he takes it in as something new and exciting even if it is scary. They are things that everyone takes for granted everyday: trees, dogs, the sky, etc. You would think that the dramatic climax would be at the beginning when Jack gets out of the tiny room he has been locked in his entire life, but after-wards, this film just drags in one dramatic scene after another in a way that turns this film into one big heartache an experience. I do have say that Jacob Trembley and Allison Brie's performances carry a lot of the weight of this film. Allison gives a very natural and organic performance. You never catch her overacting or being too stiff during any scene in this movie. Jack Trembley gave one of the most, if not the most, impressive performances of the year. Not just because of his age, but because of how well of a dramatic performance that he gives without over or underacting in any of his scenes. He seemed to take his role with a very adult-like seriousness that translated into a lot of the movie's themes of innocence that are chased by the persistent and harsh reality that Jack and his mother are facing. The directing and cinematography in this film are beautiful. The film's intense theme is complimented with a variety of out-of- focus and close up shots that highlight the child's immediate consciousness as he takes the outside world with fresh- eyes. Many of the scenes are also complimented by a beautiful and breathtaking film score composed by the award-winning Stephen Rennicks who has been crafting soundtracks in the indie film world since 1997. Overall, this is a film that I won't be forgetting for the rest of my life. Mainly because it is a film about escaping outside of the room that you have been stuck in your whole life and discovering a world that has been hidden from you. I know that sounds kind of cheesy but this film does it in the most grounded and intense way possible. Not to mention that it is dosed with themes of abandonment, human-kindness, and media exploitation. I don't usually give films a 10/10. As a matter of fact, I could probably count the films this year that I do consider 10s on one hand. The films I consider perfect are life changing in some way or benchmarks in cinematic history. While this film will probably be washed away by the ever expanding ocean that is cinema, it is not a movie that I will be personally ever forgetting. I can't remember watching a film that made me feel so grateful for just being alive.</fullReview>

Really sad when Jack said I don't want to be 5 I want to be 4. Even a 5 year old wants continued happiness in simplicity and in the arms of his only friend his own mother. He wants to be breast fed , he wants to shower with his Ma. He enjoys the only place he knows for his first 5 yrs of his life. There is no chaos from the real person he knows. Ma wants Jack to rescue them from the room. Life outside the room has its' own problems of tears, cries, fights.Excellent writing by Emma Donoghue who wrote the novel and the screenplay. Jacob Tremblay as Jack and Brie Larson as his mother Ma are terrific. Every scene, every dialogue has sincerity. Oscar worthy screenplay. Oscar worthy acting . Joan Allen as Ma's mom and Jack's grandma is perfect grandma, loving, caring, sensitive and excellent. Definite Oscar nominees. Jacob Tremblay , so young and so perfect in every scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie transformed my life, but not for the reasons people might think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually trust RottenTomatoes and IMDb ratings, and while I might watch something that gets a 60% rating or above if the subject interests me, I will usually fall in line with the critics and reviewers on any movie that gets a 97% on RT or such high scores on IMDb. Well, this movie completely shattered my entire belief system, to the point where I find myself without a guiding light for the future.Many better worded reviews on this site have already captured the grievances that I had with this film, but I must write mine out so that I can feel better and move on with my life...It felt like it was 3 hours long. In an unbelievable feat of cinematography, they managed to stretch time so that a 2 hour movie felt like 3. The could have condensed the film into an hour and 20 minutes and I would felt less cheated. Outside of a short plot line, *nothing* happened. And every single thread that could have been interesting to develop was cut short leaving us unsatisfied and wondering. It's a movie about nothing. There was no great insight into the human cause or suffering, no great insight into the psyche of the captor, no details on the parental breakup, no real role given to the very interesting characters of the girl's real father or her mom's new husband. The girl was a b*tch (I mean, that's forgivable given the circumstances), but outside of sympathy for her, it was not entertaining to connect with her on any level. And every single time anything got interesting in the movie the scene ended.The real life is a lot scarier and way more touching than this movie, and unless one lives in a room, turning on the news every day brings a lot more real emotion and watching a poorly constructed movie with a very minimal depth is not that touching. What can we learn from a 5 year old and his view on the world? That could be interesting to see, sure, but even here, the monologues were short and infantile (because what would you expect from a 5 year old?) Jack was no great thinker at a young age. Yes, the world is full of wonder on the outside, whether you're 5 or 85.Perhaps it was a movie for those whose view on life has gotten so complacent that they lost any sense of that wonderment and listening to an annoying 5 year old describe his first experiences in the real world outside of his room brought them to tears because of nostalgia or remembering their own childhood innocence. Clearly, I am one of the few against the world who Loved this movie, so I'll be the first to admit defeat.Now, however, I'm left to scratch my head and re-evaluate my relationship with movie reviews.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to get revenge on a bad movie. I am partially consoled considering I snuck into this theater rather than paying for a ticket. Still, this subversion robbed me of the cathartic argument over my refund with some hapless manager. Room stole two hours of my life, and the only way I am going to get value from that experience is to get the last word. Room has an extremely fertile premise. An unnamed woman (Brie Larson) has been kidnapped and imprisoned in a shed for seven years, five of which she has spent raising her son Jack (Jacob Tremblay). I am unaware how the book navigated this premise, but author and screenwriter Emma Donoghue had a bottomless potential of directions and selected none. The writing is too shallow to be a thought experiment on trauma or a character study. The narrative is too muddled by loose ends to be a simple "feel good" movie. Cult classic The Room had a similar degree of cohesion? yeah okay no it didn't. Poor contractually obligated jokes aside, Room is simply aimless. This child grows up in a 10x10 room surrounded by sexual abuse his entire life and his lone complications are a paleness, shyness, and poor grammar. I have met children with comparable behavior from normal households. Children might be plastic, but no one is going to manage a full swift recovery from being born into this environment. The mother character is better explored, but barely. The strength of this woman while kidnapped is unbelievable, but interesting questions are raised after the escape. Her relationship with her parents, her friends, and dealing with new realties are all introduced and either dropped or solved off screen. This is a device derived from the book where everything is seen through Jack's perspective. But post-escape Jack is just cute and boring, not worth following. His narration of events is insufferable. The conclusion of Room is sickening. The film has the audacity to propose that mother and son will be able to leave this experience behind in the closing moments. This claim is beyond ignorant and well into insulting.For the sake of critical fairness I will mention all the two and a half things I enjoyed. The escape sequence is genuinely thrilling. Putting a child in peril is often a cheap way to manipulate the audience. It worked here, so credit is due. Second, the cinematography in the room itself was surprising. I think most films would have tried for a more claustrophobic. Instead, the dimensions are simply defined and unjudged. The abrupt camera pans while Jack is running from wall to wall brilliantly reflects the mindset of these trapped characters. This place is simultaneously small and their entire world; traversing the room is trivial, but also the greatest possible distance. The one victory achieved by the closing scene is the brief moment perfect perspective when the room is seen from the outside. Finally, the acting was serviceable. It is hard to completely differentiate the awful roles from performances, but the film did dodge some melodrama. The Oscars successfully suckered me into watching Room. I would like to just chuck this movie atop a pile of other examples where the illustrious academy failed. But I am apparently in the minority. There are some aspects of quality filmmaking here, but there is no prize for best drama for housewives. Room took a premise ripe with potential and failed to nurture it with a drop of ingenuity or realism. I was disappointed, and I refuse to believe I am the only one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing abduction plot and subsequent redemption tale doesn't rise above the level of an average Lifetime Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Room is based on the 2010 novel of the same name by the Irish turned Canadian novelist/playwright Emma Donoghue. The film has already garnered accolades from almost all critical quarters with heaps of approbation for its lead actress, Brie Larson. It's a rather uncomplicated story with a plot that is broken up into two distinct parts.For the first 45 minutes or so, a young mother, Joy, and five year old son, Jack, appear trapped in a small room where they've been residing for quite a long time. Eventually it's revealed we're watching a horror story: seven years earlier, when Joy was 17 years old, she was kidnapped by a neighborhood pervert, Old Nick, who has kept her prisoner in a shed next to his house. Old Nick makes what appear to be weekly visits bringing groceries but also rapes Joy whenever he comes over. There's no escape from the room that only has one skylight window since Old Nick is the only one who knows the numbers to the combination lock to enter.Jack is born as a result of Old Nick violating Joy and it's her son that's the only thing keeping her alive. The child does remarkably well despite growing up in such a deprived environment. Joy teaches Jack how to make a birthday cake and he plays with the limited amount of objects found in the room?occasionally Old Nick might bring the boy a present (such as an electric model car). There are of course tensions between mother and son?Joy doesn't react well when Jack throws a tantrum for example.The best part of the picture is the way in which Joy and Jack are rescued from this abominable situation--but unfortunately it's not all that believable. Joy's plan is to have Jack pretend that he's dead and instruct him how to escape from inside a rolled up rug after Old Nick drives away in his pickup to dispose of the "body." The entire escape is predicated on Old Nick's decision not to check to see if Jack is really dead?as the scene plays out, Old Nick inexplicably backs off after Joy screams at him not to look at Jack because (as she explains it to him), she can't stomach the idea of the pervert touching her dead son. The subsequent way in which Jack miraculously escapes from Old Nick's truck and the heart- pounding way in which the police figure out where the little boy came from, make up for the slow-moving turn of events in Act One.The second half of Room does not have the rising tension found in the first. The focus on how all the family members adjust is what the second half of Act Two is all about. Joy returns home to find her mother Nancy divorced from her father Robert, and now married to Leo. There is an underdeveloped subplot involving Robert who is repulsed by the idea that Jack was conceived through rape and that his father was pervert Old Nick. Robert goes home to an out of state residence and his catalog of resentments remain unexplored.A better subplot involves the intrusion of the media upon Joy and the rest of the family. Joy agrees to give an interview to a reporter for money and she asks her painful questions about what went on with Old Nick and whether she made the right decision in raising Jack and depriving him of a normal childhood (the suggestion is made that she could have convinced Old Nick to leave the newborn Jack anonymously at a hospital). Conflict develops between Joy and Nancy and eventually there's the rather predictable trope of Joy attempting suicide. Most critics found Jack's acclimation to his new found world to be touching and cathartic. When he bonds with Leo's dog and a new pal next door, all seems right with the world. And even Joy is seen getting herself together at film's end.So what is one to think of all this? It's a story that I suppose holds one's interest to the end; although the central twist (i.e. the escape), feels contrived. While the young Jacob Tremblay did a fine job playing Jack, his successful adjustment to the outside world feels to me much more schematic than cathartic, as many critics insist. As for Brie Larson, calls for her to win an Oscar for best actress seem misplaced--although her performance is fine given the pedestrian script.In the end, Room rises to the level of an average Lifetime movie, with a few interesting twists and turns here and there but more predictable elements making up the bulk of the overall proceedings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Spectacular and Unmissable!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am giving 'Room' 10 stars, this film is truly amazing and a touching presentation of Emma Donoghue's book 'Room'. They have really stuck to the book which is what I love about this adaptation, there are just so many words to describe this film it is just so hard to put them all together in one review because Room is spectacular and heart wrenching. This film really gives you a point of view from the other side of the story, it is not all about the thriller aspects of how 'Ma' (Brie Larson) has been held captive for years by a horrible man she refers to as 'Old Nick' who in retrospect is a kidnapper and an atrocious man. It looks at the characters sides of the story especially her son Jack who she has whilst captive in Room. He looks at life from a completely different view to his Ma and everybody else in the world that does not exist in Jack's mind. To Jack it is just him and his Ma, he sees no negativity in their situation which is truly beautiful. Not only do I love how they have shown a different perspective of life in Room they have shown the reality of life outside of Room and how the characters cope and react differently, it is unforgettable and truly moving. I just could not fault this remarkable masterpiece.I absolutely adore how this is so carefully written, it is a sensitive subject that is rarely spoken about and I have never looked at these types of stories from the victim's point of view. It is heart breaking to sit and watch this film but at the same time it gives you an insight of the unfortunate people in the world who have to live like this and sometimes their stories do not turn out as well as Ma and Jack's stories, which is a really painful subject and will always have an effect on the world. I would definitely recommend this film to anybody; no matter what genre you are interested in you just have to see this film. It is so brilliant that I would not even know what genre to class it as, there are so many special moments in the film that just cannot be created again they are incredibly unique and the actors play these characters perfectly you just could not have picked actors more perfect then the ones that brought these characters to life.I was left laughing, crying and just smiling throughout all the different memorable scenes in Room. There was not a single moment that I was disinterested; I was left moved and unable to take my eyes of the screen, I really did not want this film to end. But they have made a fantastic adaptation of Room that just cannot be faulted and will be a forever classic that will never grow old. The uniqueness of this film is outstanding and just will not be able to be duplicated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fails To Plumb The Subject's Depth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A poor kissing cousin to "Stockholm, Pennsylvania," "Room" is a backyard shed creating the world's limits to a kidnapped young woman and her by-the-adbductor son.Snatched at seventeen, Joy (Brie Larson) is imprisoned for seven years by a standard, un-dimensional psycho holding the power of life and death over her. (Cross him in the least and there's no electricity or heat.) At the start, Joy's son, Jack (Jacob Tremblay), is angry and semi-feral yet quite content following silly rules in the only world he knows. Their pointless days come to an end when Joy contrives Jack's death forcing the psycho to bury the allegedly dead child. Well-rehearsed, Jack escapes and the dominoes fall leading to their escape to a world that has passed by Joy and one in which Jack has zero knowledge (a first encounter with steps mystifies him).Yellow ribbons and celebrations follow. With opposite effect. Joy's parents have divorced, high school chums have moved on. A formative slice of high school track star Joy's life is missing. Joy's biological dad harshly judges her; mom and daughter fight at the same level of a rebellious teen railing against parental control.Due to his age, Jack is 'plastic', his societal integration much easier. Soon he's knocking around a ball with neighbor kid. But, a reporter's insensitive question causes Joy to break down which leads to a brief institutionalization. And she's released all better.However, the treatment of an inherently dramatic subject matter of abduction and reintegration here falls short. The sunshine and rainbows, feel good ending, while moving, is mawkish. Everyone is healed and the horror of what was lived through for nearly a decade is forgotten. It is also a cheap device when children are wiser than adults. All these problems of the script.The balance of the failure of this film rests squarely on Brie Larson's shoulders. Her portrayal, as others, is at arms length with the character and hit a wall keeping her from connecting with feelings. Many crow her portrayal is spectacular. For her it is. In the annals of effective acting it is middling. Therefore, this is her tour de force - by default."Stockholm, Pennsylvania" took the protagonist's story to a far more logical, satisfying and shocking conclusion. On the base, sensational end of the spectrum, TV's "Cleveland Abduction." Find "Room" between the two. Either a good movie-of-the-week or poor indie sidestepping, and in some ways trivializing, a horrific subject.Watch "Stockholm, Pennsylvania" instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie has some issues with pacing (way too slow for me), annoying hand-held camera and lack of good score that is ESSENTIAL to carry a movie that is slow paced and takes place in a single room.The kid is easily the best part in this movie. He is very good in his role and could have been nominated for a high-ranked award. I also liked Tom McCamus. Very nice low-key role. I thought I knew him from somewhere (and not just because he looks like Lou Reed) - He was in POSSIBLE WORLDS (great movie), got pretty old since then.The movie is slow and simple. I expected a much smarter plot. The lead actress is OK, but I don't think it's Oscar material.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unique story line, moving, and great acting. The kid gives a beautiful and very convincing performance, especially during the more emotional scenes. But after they escape, it's mostly just melodrama where the daughter accuses the Dad of not caring and the mom says the daughter is inconsiderate of her feelings, etc. 2/3 of this film is very reminiscent of some sappy ABC Family drama, like The Fosters. If you are a fan of The Fosters, you might enjoy Room, as the two are equally as boring. I also dislike the way this movie antagonizes journalists and portrays them as close-minded vultures. During the interview, the reporter seems to victim-blame and provoke Brie Larson's character, which is something no professional, ethical reporter would do under that context in real life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant at the beginning but dies down towards the end! 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: I really enjoyed the beginning of this film, when Ma (Brie Larson) and Jack (Jacob Tremblay), were living in a small room with no access to the outside world but the second half of the movie took away the originality that was set at the beginning. The acting is superb from Brie and Jacob and you can't help rooting for them, when they were plotting and executing there escape but it was sad to see how the whole ordeal took its toll on Ma. The way that Jack's character was written, was perfect and for such a young boy, he really did bring realism to his character but I would have liked to have seen more scenes of them in the room, which was the most enjoyable part of the movie. It was amazing to see them make the most out of everything in that little space, including the mouse and the little birthday cake, so it wasn't surprising that it took so long for Jack to adapt to normal life. That wasn't the same case for Ma, who was locked up for 7 years and forced to have sex for food but I have to commend her for bringing up Jack under such abnormal and cruel circumstances. When she eventually came to terms with what she had been through, it was good to see her back with her little boy but I'm sure that it's something that will stick with her, for the rest of her life. Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie and I'm glad that it got all of the recognition that it deserved. Original &amp; Enjoyable!Round-Up: For such a small movie which is based in a little room around 2 characters, it's good that it made such a profit at the box office, and with Brie Larson winning an Oscar and a Golden Globe award for the &nbsp;Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role, it certainly went down well with audiences around the world. Personally, I think that Jacob Tremblay, equally put in a brilliant performance and it's a shame that he didn't get any awards for his amazing contribution. It was also up for an Oscar in the best picture of the year category, along with an director award and screenplay award, so it was a smash hit, in terms of the recognition that it received. The movie was directed by Irish born, Lenny Abrahamson, 49, who also brought you Adam &amp; Paul, Garage, What Richard Did and the extremely strange movie, Frank starring Michael Fasbender. He certainly got the most out of the actors, who all put in emotional and believable performances but he did take his foot off of the gas towards the end.Budget: $13million Worldwide Gross: $35.4millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their dramatic movies starring Brie Larson, Jacob Tremblay, Sean Bridges, Wendy Crewson, Joan Allen, William H. Macy and Matt Gordon. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Room" shares the innocent perspective of a 5 year old named Jack who is led to believe by his mother that life consists of being inside a tiny room forever.I can relate this movie with "Life Is Beautiful" and "Pan's Labyrinth" because in all this titles we see a young human with such an innocent perspective and big imagination that somehow softens the cruel reality by tricking the mind and distorting what is actually happening."Room" also shows the psychology of both of the primary characters after living through a traumatic experience. Jack not being able to walk upstairs since he had never done it before in Room is one example.This movie made me feel grateful about my life because you get to see Jack and his mother happy after all. Torwards the ending of the movie Jack says "since Ma and I don't know what we like, we decided we are going to try everything". That's my favorite part of the movie because it means Jack is finally ready to open himself up and be a part of the big world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Acting, editing lacking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Room (2015)I knew almost nothing about this film going in and I recommend that having watched it. The film is a bit artsy and will bore some audiences and captivate others. Each of the characters are beautifully written and dynamically flawed in one way or another. The film has suspenseful elements and heart strumming ones too. Brie Larson's character deservedly won the Oscar that year, even if Brooklyn was a better film over all. She wore no make up for a majority of the film and relied on her acting to sell the audience her character.Jack played by Jacob Tremblay was impressive. I can't say if he was just a genuinely talented performer or if what happened to Jack had also happened to Jacob. His performance was that convincing.How a major scene happens in the film is because of Amanda Brugels character who I can't remember her characters name. That being said I loved how the movie transitioned from act one to act two because of this Police-woman's actions. You'll know which scene I'm talking about because it's the most suspenseful moment in the film. William H. Macy is in the film and is thrown away immediately to add to the underlying theme that some men can be horrible people, just like Old Nick, played by Sean Bridgers who played Johnny Burns from Deadwood, one of my favorite (canceled before their time) TV shows. Joan Allen play's the main character's mother who takes on the motherly role for a certain reason and does a wonderful job making the audience hold their chest in many emotional moments.Enough with the superb acting. The film has flaws. Mainly direction and storytelling. A film shouldn't take you out of the scene because of boredom or nothing to really take in. Many scenes felt longer than they needed to be. Timing is a problem in the film as it felt like The film felt like it was almost over at the 50 minute mark, then had an hour epilogue.Verdict: Watch if you enjoy drama. I can't recommend this to anyone who enjoys watching the Transformer movies, because this is the polar opposite.</fullReview>

The movie addresses a terrible crime, that unfortunately does go on in the world today, and allows us to get a feel of what the victim goes through-the suffering, the pain, and the eventual recovery. For the 2 hours we are Ma'- A kind person who unfortunately goes through so much undeserving torture and pain!In the same breath we appreciate a beautiful world through the eyes of a pure soul! The director allows us to hate the evil the world has to offer, but also appreciate that there is also so much good and beauty, even in the small things! One of the best films I have seen; it was raw, touching, and painful! Guaranteed to draw emotion out of everyone who sees it! It is definitely a must watch! The videography and music played was also very well done!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Emotional Journey Through The Eyes of a Child</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right from the beginning of this film, the director establishes the theme of the movie by giving us extreme close-ups of Room, and narrating through the eyes of the boy named Jack. Jack takes us through his whole world, giving everything a name, and gives the audience complete view of the space in which Jack and his mother, Joy, live.The points of view used this in this film are quite amazing. When the view is directly from Jack's point of view, you feel as if you are inside him. Especially when he is rolled up in the rug and Nick carries him out of the shed. He is seeing the "world" for the first time, and it makes you feel first as if you cannot breathe, and that you can actually feel the tightness of the rug wrapped around you. Then the awe and wonder that he feels when seeing the sky for the first time as he is lying in the back of the truck, and the sights and the sounds, makes you feel like you are seeing them for the first time. The music adds to this feeling. The awe and wonder is short lived, and replaced with a sudden and powerful fear that comes when Jack jumps out of the truck and Nick comes after him. The film then transitions from being in a very tight, routine driven, small world, into the "real" world, and the rest of the movie deals with how Joy and Jack adjust to this new life.The psychological drama that unfolds during this part of the film is very deep and emotional. The struggles of both Joy and Jack adjusting to living in the world outside of Room become very real through their eyes. The dialog used throughout this second part of the movie is done very well, and the use of the close-up shots draw the audience right into the emotions that the characters are feeling. This is a roller coaster of emotions, from anger, to sadness, to wonder and absolute joy.The acting in this film is absolutely superb. As a child actor, Jacob Tremblay, does an incredible job at conveying his feelings through his facial expressions. I have never seen a child as young as he is with that kind of ability. The relationship between mother and son in this film is intense and deeply moving. The chemistry between Jacob Tremblay and Brie Larson is both believable and touching. In the end, the audience is left with the knowledge that there is much to be learned through the eyes of a child.</fullReview>

I have seen this movie five times already and each time I see it it's like watching it for the first time. I cry and I feel like my whole body feels every emotion Brie Larson conveys through her portrayal of Joy. As for Jacob Tremblay for such a young actor I feel he nails his character Jack on the head perfectly. For anyone who has children you will most definitely get chills watching this film. I believe it was written so well and executed beautifully. The way the story is told and how was absolutely genius. I feel as if its a hard movie to describe to someone without giving away any aspects to the film. Room is a movie that makes you look at things a slight bit different. Makes you questions things you might not normally question. Gives you a contrary perspective on how what may be "normal" on the outside isn't what it seems.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Heartfelt Drama in One Room</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young woman is abducted by a middle-aged man who goes by the name Old Nick and is imprisoned in his backyard shed for six years during which she gives birth to a kid who thinks that the room he grew up in with his mother is the entire universe. But we see none of this. The film opens with the two main characters, Jack (the five-year-old boy brilliantly played by Jacob Tremblay) and his mother (played by the talented Brie Larson) going about their everyday life in the room ? sleeping, eating, exercising, playing, reading? etc. with occasional visits from the mysterious Old Nick. Upon Jack's fifth birthday, the mother decides that it is about time to get them both out of the room.I won't go into the details of the extremely bold scheme and the mother-son heart-wrenching argument scenes, but they finally do it and they make it out of their prison ? a crucial moment that, you might think, will bring about the two characters' happily ever after. However, Room is not a happily ever after story; it is a story about what happens after the happy ending ? a story about transitions. The film is divided exactly into two halves: inside and outside the room, two places that are equally confining for Jack and his mother. In the first part of the film when we are trapped inside with the two, we could feel the sense of confinement in mother's eyes but Jack's giggles and jumping around make us feel that the small room is as big as a playground. When we leave the room ? an overwhelming moment for both of them ? the room's concrete walls are replaced by psychological confinement materialized through personal disappointments and people's judgments.The two main characters are tied by blood but differ drastically in the way they perceive the universe. For the mother, the room is the strange unfamiliar grounds; whereas for Jack, the room is the only universe he has ever known and the outside world is the unfamiliar, intimidating terrain. Despite the change of perspective, the bond mother and Jack share helps them become stronger, reach out to each other and overcome the difficulty of transition. Regardless of the melodramatic undertones, the story shows that it doesn't matter on which side of the wall you're standing because the only walls there are are the ones we build around ourselves and around other people, and that love is the only power that can overcome those walls.The natural chemistry between Larson and Tremblay is phenomenal. Period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Room is an amazing film analyzing the life of a kidnapped mother and son</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Room follows a kidnapped mother and her son who eventually make a complicated, but successful, escape attempt and must deal with life after being released.So, the main reasons I saw this film were because: a) Brie Larson is a great actress, as seen in some other films I've seen recently (namely The Spectacular Now), b) the film looked really intriguing from some clips and such that I saw during the Oscars, and c) it is an Oscar winner, and I'm always intrigued to see these movies. And I gotta say, this movie exceeded my expectations. Much like Spotlight, I didn't expect it to be as good as it was.Let's start with the acting, because that is the best thing about this movie, in my opinion. Brie Larson deserved the Oscar. She did an amazing job portraying a mother trying to protect her son, but also dealing with her own issues stemming from her seven-year imprisonment. It's amazing how well she just blends into her character. After a while, you don't see an actress anymore. You see a struggling mother, barely holding herself together. Part of the reason this works so well is that Jacob Tremblay, who plays her son, also does a fantastic job. From someone who generally doesn't like child actors, because most of the time they suck, I was genuinely surprised that he did such a fantastic job. He was never annoying, and instead, he was one of the biggest pieces that needed to fit, and he did a great job doing so.The other actors and actresses in the film are of lesser importance, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't bring them up. Joan Allen did a great job as Larson's mother, portraying a woman trying to be there for her daughter, but also wanting her to move on. Sean Bridgers is extra disturbing as "Old Jack", aka, the man who has kidnapped the mother. William H. Macy portrays a father trying to keep himself together after so many years, and Tom McCamus does a fantastic job as Allen's new beau, providing for both Larson and her son.The score to this film, done by Stephen Rennicks, was absolutely stunning. He hasn't done many movies, but I hope he gets more work, because he does an excellent job with this movie. It never feels as if he's pandering, trying to get you to cry because of the music alone. It feels exactly like you're in the movie, and how you would feel if music would be playing during pieces of your life. The music only flares during tense and also rewarding sequences, and it always makes you feel even more for the people in the film.The cinematography and direction was great as well. For the first half, it's set simply in a storage shed. It's quite amazing how well you can come up with many different ways to film inside such a small space. Yet, the director Lenny Abrahamson, did a great job with this. The screenplay was also stunning. It really provides the best way for these characters to act and play off of each other. I, sadly, have not read the book yet, but I am almost tempted to go out and buy it right now, as it seems like it would be quite the read.Overall, I'm extremely impressed with Room. The acting, score, direction, cinematography, screenplay - everything absolutely worked. If you haven't seen it for some reason, do so. It's definitely worth your time. But, be sure to bring a few tissues. I'm not one for crying during movies, and yet I almost did here. That's the sign of a fantastic film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was a bit let down with this one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, I don't think it was bad, thought it was ehh , I just wish the filmmaker had done more. Never while in Room did I get the sense of claustrophobia to emphasize just how tiny the area that the characters were in was (which really makes the fact that they actually filmed in that tiny area pretty pointless), or hopelessness, and imprisonment, to highlight the unbelievable amount of time that they've been there; Instead, we are just told this information. In addition, due to not really getting what situation these characters were in, made it really underwhelming when they made their rather fortunate escape; there was no feeling of awe at this, seemingly, new and strange environment (like in Oldboy, The Hurt Locker,and The Descent), and it's clear with the slow-mo, and shots of Jack's (Jacob Tremblay) face that was what they were attempting.Aside from what I'd wish they'd done, there were also some questionable and unfitting music choices throughout, and two scenes: during and immediately following the escape. The two scenes came off as awkward, unrealistic, and contrived; and the acting and characters in these scenes were both bad and annoying.Besides the already mentioned, the acting in this film was good, with Brie Larson being the standout. And though I thought Jacob Tremblay was good, for a kid, I didn't think his performance was amazing or award worthy, like I had heard previous to watching Room. Just because his performance was better than most child performances doesn't mean it's great.I appreciated the way they decided to take the story, and I liked the way Brie's character's struggles were handled, and to be honest, that's it.With all this pessimism, it may be hard to believe that I didn't hate this film, but I didn't; I just thought it was meh. Nothing special, and I won't be seeing it again, though it is watchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The flip side of freedom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 'Room', there are lots of things we don't see. We don't see how the lead character, Joy, is raped by her abductor who keeps her imprisoned for more than five years with her little son Jack. We don't see how she is liberated by the police, after she manages to let her son escape. We don't see what happens to her abductor and rapist.The director doesn't show all these things, because they distract from the theme of this movie: the way mother and son cope with their freedom. The surprising thing about this film is that this freedom turns out to be rather problematic in a lot of ways. Even so much so, that Jack starts to long for the intimacy and the routine of life inside the shed he called Room.The film shows how life in Room is claustrophobic, but also intimate and familiar. There are no unexpected developments in Room, but there is a lot of love between mother and son. Once they escape Room, everything changes. For Jack, who has never known a world outside Room, this is very threatening. He has to share his mother's attention with other people, he has to get used to all sorts of impulses, he has to learn how things like a telephone work.In this film, there is only one major dramatic event: Jack's escape and the subsequent liberation of his mother Joy. The rest of the film is rather uneventful: at first we see Joy and Jack in their daily routine in Room, and afterward we see them cope with all sorts of problems in the house of Joy's parents. Still, the film is almost never boring. The psychological developments make up for the lack of real action. And although there quite some emotional scenes, the director didn't make an outright tearjerker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, this was one of the most critically acclaimed movies of last year. Everyone loved and talked about the performances. When I first saw it, I thought it was good, but after another watch, it doesn't hold up as much. Let me make this clear, I don't think its bad, it just isn't as effective on a second (and most likely third) viewing, and Im a person who believes a great movie can hold up on multiple viewings. Anyways lets get started.Ill start off with the positives. The performances were pretty great. Brie Larson, I can't say anything new about her since everyone has already said how great she was, and I can't disagree with that. Jacob Tremblay was surprisingly good. I say surprisingly since most child actors are known for being terrible, but he was great. Even the actors who weren't in it for very long, like William H Macy, were great. So all around great acting. The script did have its moments, it wasn't amazing, but not bad. I think its good for a first time a writing a screenplay. It had some heavy handed moments, but some subtler moments. My biggest problem is that some of the characters were somewhat clich, but thats really it. Now for the negatives. My biggest problem is that the first third of the movie, the part that takes place in Room, drags on, a lot. It didn't bother me as much on my first watch, but on a second watch it feels like it goes on forever. I know some people found this part very emotional, but I just couldn't get into it. I started to see some of the problems on the second watch, which aren't really major problems, but really bugged me. For instance, the cinematography is kinda bad (which bugs me since i'm a cinematography buff). There were sometimes when the characters got a bit hard to feel for after the first third, I just didn't get invested anymore. Luckily after the first third is over, it does pick up a lot more and gets a lot more interesting, but the other part was just unbearable.So in conclusion, Room isn't bad, its just one of those movies that declines on repeated watch.Final Score: 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Room - Movie Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ma: "You're gonna love it".Jack: "What?".Ma: "The world".Room tells the story of a relationship between a mother and son, as she raises him while confined to a 10x10 room and what happens when they finally get out.Since the 2016 Oscars are on Sunday and I've been lacking quite a bit on seeing as many Oscar contenders from last year. Room was one of those movies, as I've heard nothing but great things about it and how truly unique it is (from what I heard). It was a real shame that I had to wait for a while to get a chance to watch this movie, because it's been a very slow month over here in jolly good England. But after finally seeing the movie after that long wait, I can say that the movie was pretty underwhelming, and that's really disappointing saying that.Brie Larson has been sweeping the award season this year, by taking home: The BAFTA, Golden Globe, Critics Choice award and the SAG award, and it's very deserving. Brie Larson delivered a tremendous performance and she was without a doubt the best part of this movie. I'm so happy that Larson is finally getting noticed since everyone pretty much forgot about "Short Term 12" and her performance in that film that got very unnoticed. Larson shows off her acting skills in this movie and I know for a fact that she will receive an Oscar on Sunday night. She was truly brilliant in this movie and one of her best performance so far.Lenny Abrahamson (director of the movie) brought us the 2014 film "Frank", which I really liked and I couldn't wait to see want he will bring to this movie, and what he brought was somewhat of a mix bag for me. I'm happy for him to get an Oscar nomination, but I didn't find anything that special or groundbreaking when it came to it's directing. Most of it is just copy and past from the book that this movie is based on, so Abrahamson can look on what he's doing. I didn't read the book (and never will) but I've heard a lot of people who did read the book say that the book is better than the movie, and even the author herself said the same thing. The directing isn't anything Oscar worthy, but it's decent directing at best for Abrahamson.The first act of this movie was very strong and it did kept my interest. That's the biggest positive I had for this movie is it's first act.Jacob Tremblay is an unknown star to me and for everyone else, so this is basically he's break out role. I did look up on what Tremblay has been in before and I found out he was in "The Smurfs 2" which wasn't that good. But all that aside, I thought he's performance was alright, nothing outstanding, but nothing terrible. He's better than most kids I've seen in recent movies, but I also have seen better ones as well.Now for the problems: The second act wasn't as strong as the first act. The movie did lose me a couple of times as I became disinterest as it went along.The movie did feel like a sugar-coated version of the book and as I said before I haven't even read the book, but for what I heard from other people, the book is more graphic and dark than the movie. I get this question asked a lot when I say the movie sugar-coated from the book, "Would you rather have graphic scenes of rape from the book", well if that's what the book is suppose to be, then yeah, and it's not because I want to see someone get raped, but if you what me to give a crap about the characters and their struggle to see how their suffered, then the film makers shouldn't have sugar-coated it. I feel like if this movie was handled by a different director, it would have been a much better movie. The movie is basically telling you that there's violence and rape that happened, but there's nothing really graphic about it. The movie tells you to care about things that it never bothers developing and if you are going to make a movie on a subject like that, and pretend that this horrible thing that happened, again, you shouldn't sugar-coat it. Take "12 Years a Slave" as an example: That movie was graphic, brutal, honest and that's what made it an amazing movie, because it took a real life story like slavery that's suppose to make you feel for the character's and makes you look at what their been through and say to yourself "Wow, that was truly awful". Now look at Room, we have a single character and the movie is telling you to feel bad for her and what shes been through, but it didn't show any of it, and it's not like it has to be graphic for the sake of it, but it didn't even try to develop it.Overall Room was very overwhelming and kind of bland. I know a lot of people are going to get mad at me for not loving this movie as they do, but that's just my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Sure If It's Worth All The Praise And The Nominations???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hope the book is better than the movie....SPILOERS ALERT: 1= This story is told n the kids POV at first glance it might not be the best idea, because really this story is all about the mother decent (more on that later) but somehow it works out.2= The camera is sort of shaky and gritty I guess it fits at first for the beginning while they are still held captive in the room. Not only to make you feel like you're in the movie but also to force you to feel what both of them are going through and to also to sit the mood I guess.3=I simply don't get it if the captive mother (Joy) has a knife why wouldn't she just simply use it to force their way out. And why would the captor give his captive victim a knife in the first place, spectrally when clearly she hasn't yet lost all hope? Huh?! No not just a knife but why not just grab an thing to use as a weapon. Even before when she got pregnant, sure she tried once before but why wouldn't she just try again? Again huh? 4= There is a great Mother/Son sit up unfortunately they missed that up, yes at first in the beginning they did have a great relationship but for most of the time they mainly just yell and scream at each other. In addition I just don't get the kid's (Jake's) seemingly erratic mood swings. OK I get it he's frighten in beginning because all he knows is the Room, and now all of sudden his mother is telling him about life outside the Room, but even after when he and his mother were rescued he still remained bratty and having all of these erratic mood swings. I simply just don't get that.5= The night scenes are simply just way too dark to see anything now, I'm not sure if that was the attent or what, but in either case for that simply just cheapens the movie. And this is coming from someone that just sits in his dark room from time to time with little to no light being lighting the room from an outside source. And even that I could still see shapes of objects, but with this movie I don't know what was going even with sound.6= There is a poor sit up of the Kidnapper (old Nick), somehow feel his character just wasn't fleshed out enough.7= I feel the second attempt at escape wasn't will planned out enough, and what I mean by that is that they were so busy planning out the main plain they forgot t plain out the Plain 'B'.8= I just don't have any emonal or any kind of connection towards or against anyone in the film, which is too bad because I love Mother/Child Relationships. And speaking of I'm simply not sure if anyone in this movie is truly likable.9= At times during the movies I feel that it's simply too long. I often find myself thinking during the movie 'This movie is simply too long it should only be a 90min movie. And not a 2hr movie.' 10= However I do feel that there is a lot of plot holes in the movie: What happen to Old Nick. Did the dog ate him? Is Jake home schooled or does go to public school? Etc... but I guess those are just simply 'minor' plot holes.11= The good points: is that I do like almost everything that happens in the Room before the escape. Also I do like the music that went along with the escape. In addition I do also like the descent into depression of Joy (Mother) after when she was rescued. Finally, finally only at the end where the Mother comes back from what we can assume 'getting help' just after trying to kill herself some time after being rescued. They finally, finally show this excellent Mother/Son relationship in some kind of mini montage. All leading up to this neat and interesting ending (which I will not ruin for you).CP: I'm not sure the ending itself is enough to redeem it , but however I am wandering should I have waited to buy?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very average affair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There it is the first movie of the award season which I did not think much of. Don't get me wrong it's a decent but thoroughly average film. The movie starts out promisingly and does a couple of things right, makes no mistakes but does nothing special or extraordinary with the situation. I gave the movie the benefit of the doubt and was hoping the psychological aspects of the film would step up in the second half but it didn't do so, the second half completely changes the situation for worse, there are new problems to deal with and the movie goes about them in it's usual half committed way which was prevalent in first half. The acting is definitely the strong suit of the film, Brie Larson is amazing and I would be OK with her winning the Oscar, though I didn't think much of the film I thought she was great. The kid played by Jacob Tremblay showed amazing depth and variety for a young child. The weakness of the film is direction, it does not capitalizes on it's setting, it has no great scenes and does not visually grab you at anytime (I am not reading a book I am watching a movie), also sometimes Brie Larson's character is quite inconsistent and unrealistic sometimes, she shows very few signs of PTSD, it sometimes feels she was trapped in Room for weeks not seven years, not her fault though, another misstep by the director, along with not capitalizing that Jack maybe better off without Joy (it touches so less on the REAL issues it's infuriating).</fullReview>

There are a lot o movies which exploit much better this idea In the beginning of the movie there is not even a clue what is going on but i guess this is a movie trick used by the director.It's not about the fact that they have not escaped in those years. It's about the fact that the movie,after they escape shows a very little preoccupation for the true situation of the characters,of the inside fight. At least it is a better candidate for the Oscar prize, but it is not a movie which deserves a position in top 250 or to be nominated for Oscars. It is good when you put it besides the big short,spotlight,the revenant,bridge of spies, but come on... I hope Mad max will have a serious chance for winning the prize</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The concept was a good one to take on as there have been a number of high profile abduction cases over the past twenty years or so. But I wasn't totally convinced with the script on this one.It was a good effort in showing the psychological problems and scars that the victims are left with. For me, the best part of the movie was the last 15 minutes - they were the most realistic. And the final narration by the young lad was well written - but a five year old wouldn't be that eloquent. The first half of the story based in the room didn't really work well in my estimation.Despite that, all the major players did a fine job, although I wouldn't say Oscar worthy. I wouldn't recommend people to go the movie theater to see this one - you can wait till it comes round on streaming or a movie channel - or Red Box.</fullReview>

The characters are very well portrayed in their behavior. The set itself makes it feel as though you are trapped with them, and later when they return the room looks so small. You try to recall everything but it still sets a strange distortion like you cant believe they lived in there. But the scene where Jack finally sees the outside and has to escape, had my entire body numb. It gave me the wash of adrenaline like when I was a child and afraid. It absolutely moved me.

		<fullReview>I hesitated seeing this film because I feared it would be another one of those exploitation films, with scene after scene of threat and pain. Considering a woman and her son have been kept for years in a room in a shed by a sociopath, this could have gone down that road, there are certainly elements of this. But this is about survival and hope, neither of which comes without agonizing risk. It's also about how people deal with things for which they have no true appreciation. I refer to two characters. The first is the father of the young woman. He must deal with what he sees as the devil's spawn. The second, a reporter that begins to malign her because she hasn't done what "she" sees as heroic. Her interview made me crawl, but I also thought this is exactly what we do to people who gain celebrity through pain. There is a great deal to be learned from this film, but I fear this is an eternal problem.</fullReview>

Joy Newsome was kidnapped seven years ago by a deranged manic called old nick. During one of those rapes she became Pregnant. And she gave birth to her son Jack. this gives her a reason to go on living. By the time Jack is five Joy has spun a tale of a universe in Room. There are television people magic and Jack doesn't need to want anything. And they Joy plans a dangerous breathtaking escape that frees them. Now the real ordeal begins. coming home. everything has changed. suffering from PSTD and Jack isn't too sure of what to make of all of this. but together they must struggle to find a way out of the darkness and into the light. A stunning film and it hits every rung on the emotional ladder. And most of the credit must go to Bree Larson. Her acting is nothing short of compelling and believing that She really is Joy. A fast tight direction. the director kept a tight rein on it and steers it to where the story needs to go. this just may be one of the greatest films Holly wood has done in the last 35 years.</fullReview>

On one hand, it is certainly one of the must-see movies of 2015, but on the other, you've surely heard the buzz by now, and don't need an IMDb reviewer to tell you. Further, it's a movie you ought to know as little about as possible before watching.I will say that Jacob Tremblay, the actor who played five year old Jack, deserved an Oscar nod. Being that they are always in such close proximity, you can't help but compare the work of Brie Larson with Tremblay. He should have gotten a nomination at least.

		<shortDescription>A heartfelt and moving dramatic tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whereas often movies will chronicle the process of being abducted, Room immediately takes us right into the lives of people who are amidst the misery. This is a poignant, harrowing film that offers a detailed account of the human condition. The essentials of human existence - like emotionality - are wholly dissected in this film. Room certainly succeeds in (believably) doing so and thereby avoids falling into a domain of superficiality where other films depicting difficult subject matter have. Seen through the eyes of an innocent child, we are reminded of the saying ignorance is bliss.Larson was absolutely phenomenal in the lead role, as supported by her deserved Academy Award for Best Actress. She convincingly immersed herself into the psyche of a woman with palpable psychological damage and did so in such an unpretentious and altruistic manner. The tenderness and motherly solicitude she displayed felt extremely genuine and almost made you forget it was a film you were experiencing. In what was a profoundly intricate character portrayal, she really delivered on this one.This was a film that heavily depended on its acting. There was no flashy CGI, no dazzling special effects - just a true-to-life story, credibly depicted. The central performances were superlative and the chemistry Larson and Tremblay showed together was remarkable. Both incredibly humanistic and exercising a compelling charm that is truly touching and hard to not feel for as you watch them evolve. The acute dialogue, the breathtaking cinematography, the excellent supporting actors, the moving score - all executed to perfection. A spectacularly crafted, must-see film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Unique and Groundbreaking Cinema,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Room is a stellar movie with a very well developed plot and a talented cast. It is extremely original, as we follow a kidnapped woman hiding the truth from her son by convincing him that the shed they are trapped in is the whole world. We see the movie from young Jack's perspective, which I think was the right choice, he made the tone more light hearted and heartwarming, taking away from the reality of their situation in a way that feels peaceful, albeit somewhat surreal, as we experience a very unique view on the world. I did think we could have seen more of Joy's father, who is portrayed terrifically by William H. Macy, for only three scenes, they clearly had a complicated relationship and I left wanting to find out more, it is probably established fully in the book. The performances are outstanding, Brie Larson is entirely engrossed in her character in a way that would be frightening for most actors, but she did it without half measures, and the chemistry between her and Jacob Tremblay is absolutely brilliant, it is very tough love, which makes it real. Heartwarming, thrilling and dramatic, Room will leave you experiencing many different emotions, and you will be happy that it did, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama. A loving mother convinces her son that the room they are trapped in is the whole world, until he is old enough to help her plan an escape. Best Performance: Brie Larson</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that feels complete...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: This review contains an overuse of the word "complete." Rarely have I seen a movie that comes together so completely and is without a flaw from beginning to end. I'm struggling to think of a scene or even a shot that was out of sync with the rest of the movie or that needed improvement. Every shot and every scene is written, acted, filmed, directed, scored and edited in such a complete and perfect way that, honestly, it makes most other movies feel and look incomplete. One doesn't have to have a degree in film or even attended film school to enjoy this movie, but it was amazing to see my film class lessons brought to life on the screen (especially when I re-watched the movie). From the way "Room" is written and filmed, to the way it's acted and directed, and to the rises and falls and tensions of the story, the movie uses all those elements to present each shot, each scene and eventually an entire movie that feels complete from beginning to end.As an example, the dinner with Ma, Jack, grandpa, grandma and Leo is full of so much tension and drama and the great William H. Macy gives these subtle looks that say so very much without him saying the actual words. And Ma's/Joy's reaction is equally great not only in this scene, but throughout the movie, in that these little, subtle looks and gestures add up to say so much more than words could ever say. Another example of this 'completeness' comes in what Jack says to some of the objects in the room in the beginning of the movie, and then repeats them in the end, but in the opposite way. What this means is that the writers, cast and crew of this film know exactly what they are doing, know exactly how to do it, and, amazingly, then set out and achieve what they wanted to achieve, which, sadly, is rare in movies and even rarer in real life.So at this point if anyone (including myself) wants to argue my point that this movie is "complete," Webster's defines the word "complete" as "having all the necessary parts; not lacking anything." So in that sense of the word, "Room," to me, is, well, complete!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotional and compelling stuff thanks to the tight focus on well written and performed characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Driven mostly by the initially intriguing concept, this film surprised me by resolving this around this mid-point of the film. Not having read the book or really heard anything specific about the film, it did catch me off guard in a small way, since I had come into the film with the specifics of the situation in mind. The first half of the film does make it more than this though, because I was drawn into a relationship which was emotionally raw and compelling. The film uses the limits of the room really well, focusing on the mother/son relationship and making us care about it while also being horrified by the specifics.The second half of the film manages to maintain that engagement, while flipping the characters in such a way that made the drama work in a much different way, and cast a different light on the first half of the film. It is tough in terms of subject matter, but at the same time it is easy to watch because of how well the film draws you into caring about the lead two characters. A big part of this is how well both Larson and Tremblay delivery; they are organic and natural performances, and are supported equally well by the likes of Allen and Macey. The writing and the performances make it, and in the end the film is a lot of heart and works as a result of this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Both heart-breaking and life-affirming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films are at their best when they uncover a profound truth of humanity. Last year, Inside Out demonstrated this with the role of sadness as an emotion in the human psyche. The Martian is about the role of human resourcefulness in surviving hostile conditions when others have lost hope. And here is Room, an absolutely wonderful film about a mother's love for her child and shielding them from the true horror even when in the most awful of predicaments.It has to be said from the outset that it is not just a Fritzl film. It is not simply an exploitation film though that this clearly there in the background. That is not to say that the first half of the film is easy to watch. However, we are shielded from the worst of it much like how Jack is by his mother. For Ma, Room is a living hell but for Jack, "Room" is his whole world that goes in "every direction, all the way to the end".As the trailer shows, the entire running time is not dedicated to the confines of the room but how the two- particularly Jack- cope in the real world. We see this strange new place often directly through the eyes of the young child and being able to hear his internal monologue was just so cute yet incredibly emotional.The direction from Lenny Abrahamson is simply outstanding and the two central performances from Larson and Tremblay were perfect. As disturbing as it is at times, what a life-affirming film Room is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes I know. It's late. I finally had the opportunity to get this movie out of my way, after hearing good reviews online &amp; friends. Then the movie started, the whole while, it was very compelling for me to fast forward and see what happens. It was slow, slow &amp; slow. But the feeling you get after watching this was really relaxing. And someone you started to form one way or a different connection with the characters played. Love how the movie POV was from the kid only. Brilliant details and overall bit drop of suspense. I felt, there could have been more to the movie. But I guess that's all you could fit in. All in all, good one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know how much I can even tell you about "Room". It is one of the most intense movies that I've ever seen. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay put on two of the most harrowing performances. She definitely deserved her Oscar win. This story of a mother and her son confined to a small space is not like many movies that I've seen before. Surprises pop up at every step. All that I can say is that I hope to see both Larson and Tremblay in more movies, and I hope that Lenny Abrahamson turns out more movies like this one. Very good movie."I'll see you all this comin' fall in the big rock candy mountain." - Harry McClintock</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing short of perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are certain movies which leave you spellbound. Movies that make you ponder upon the reality of life. Room falls into that category.Frankly, I didn't hear of the movie till it was nominated for the Oscars. I saw it after that and "Wow" was the word that I said. So Room is the story of Joy, a girl who was kidnapped at the age of 17 by a guy whom we just know as "Old Nick". During captivity she gets pregnant and has a baby boy named Jack. So Joy has created this fairy tale world for Jack in the room they stay in and anything outside to the room is just Outer space. So when Jack is 5, Joy thinks "Enough is Enough" and she needs to get out. How she plans to get out, forms the pre-interval part of the movie and how Jack and Joy survive once they are released forms the latter half. Bree Larson as Joy has given the performance that would literally give you goosebumps. Her anguish, he jealousy, the disregard for the outside world, each and every emotion is portrayed so brilliantly by Bree that you eventually fall in love with her and empathize with her. Jacob Tremblay as Jack is sheer perfection. Playing such a character at this age is really tough and Jacob has just played it brilliantly. I can not think of anyone else who would have played this character to that perfection. The story, the direction,cinematography everything is top-notch. Room, makes you think, it makes you cry, it squishes your gut and you feel each and every emotion that Bree and Jack experience in the room. With limited background score, Room relies on silence. It's a must watch for every movie goer. I literally took a walk of 2kms after I saw the movie to just imbibe everything that I saw. Sheer Brilliance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No 'Room' For Improvement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every now and then a film will not only effect me emotionally but effect me on how powerful I view and feel the medium of film itself is, Room is one of these films in question, it's just phenomenal and I'm not an individual who gives out fake praise in order to gain views/notoriety.Like me you may have (or did have) preconceptions of what this film would do with its subject material &amp; how it would progress, now throw those preconceptions out the window &amp; glory at what this film has to offer you on a purely human level of storytelling.Now I'm going to begin this review in earnest by stating that yes this film created a truly unexpected emotional reaction from me and despite the premise of the story I also came out the cinema saying that the film gave me a sense of great hope and was uplifting in how individuals/characters can positively react to horrible situations in a completely human and believable way.The story focuses on Brie Larson's 'Ma' character who is a mum to her five year old son 'Jack' played by newcomer Jacob Tremblay who have been imprisoned in a 'Room' for going on five years since Brie Larson had been kidnapped &amp; presumably raped (resulting in Jack) by her captor by her unknown (to the audience) assailant.Brie Larson deservedly won the Best Actress award all across the board with a truly powerfully gut-wrenching and emotional performance, now the performance of then eight year old Jacob Tremblay is something nothing short of phenomenal, the interaction between Larson and Tremblay is mainly where the films storytelling and emotional heft comes from, if you don't believe that mother and son relationship you don't get the truly fantastic film that we end up with.The film plays with your expectations of what this kind of film is expected to do and how it should play out and midway through it it throws you a curve-ball, they actually escape, yes that's right that is what would usually occur in the final act of a film of this type but no now we have to deal with what occurs from the fallout of this situation, suddenly it takes you somewhere you don't get led very often which is what happens next after that kind of event, what is the personal trauma that is taken on by Brie Larson's 'Ma' and Jacob Tremblay's 'Jack' characters? Who has coped best with it? Who is going to cope best with their reintroduction into society (if that's even possible), it's wonderfully done from a psychological point of view and also a pure emotional drama point of view, the reintroduction to family, a family that has been torn apart by the apparent loss of their presumed dead daughter.True credit has to go to the director Lenny Abrahamson and probably more poignantly Emma Donoghue the original novels writer and screenplay writer for the film, she and the director have clearly managed to translate her books tones and emotional message into the medium of film which is no mean feat at all.Numerous times throughout his film I was either close to tears or had a tear or two actual roll down my cheeks and for good reason as they were heartbreaking moments of interactions between Jack and certain individuals.The film is a true triumph of fabulous storytelling, superb performances, emotional heft and a film of the utmost highest quality and is now in the company of being listed as one of my favorite ever films and I can give it no more higher a praise than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful - highly original and incredibly emotional</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A mother, Joy (played by Brie Larson), and her five-year old son, Jack (Jacob Tremblay), are held captive in a one-room shed. She was abducted by a stranger, Nick, and has been there for seven years. Jack was born there and the room is his entire world. Then one day they escape and get to live normal lives. For Jack, the world he now is confronted by is a very foreign place.A wonderful movie: highly original and incredibly emotional. Just the initial plot - a mother and her son imprisoned for several years and how they escape - was original enough but then we have the psychological and emotional implications of returning to society (or, in Jack's case, joining society for the first time), and this takes the plot to another plane. Jack being confronted by and adapting to his new world is wonderfully and very sensitively told. His mother having to deal with all her doubts regarding Jack adapting, and any residual guilt she feels from their time in captivity, is a great, and quite natural, story line too.Great, emotional ending that perfectly ties up the movie.Brie Larson got a Best Actress Oscar for her performance and deserved it. Jacob Tremblay, 8/9 years old at the time, is fantastic as Jack, showing acting skills well beyond his age. Solid performances from a supporting cast that includes Joan Allen and William H Macy.My favourite movie of 2015.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting, powerful, beautifully done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Irish filmmaker Lenny Abrahamson has been making terrific films since 2004. "Adam &amp; Paul", "Garage", "What Richard Did" are all excellent small films, marked by top rate acting and rich characters. With the oddly funny and surreal "Frank", Abrahamson finally started to get some attention here in the states. "Room" may be his strongest film yet -- a vertigo inducing mix of thriller like tension and complex and sometimes disturbing character studies. Again, he gets great performances; from the young and extremely talented Brie Larson, to great old pros like Joan Allen and William H. Macy, to a remarkable performance from a child, Jacob Tremblay, in a seriously difficult and demanding part. I've seen a lot of films, but - even with no blood or gore, and little violence - this was so harrowing it was downright hard to watch at times. But in a way that never felt exploitive, but always in service of bigger themes and ideas. This is a film where knowing too much about the plot can work against the experience, but it's not giving away too much to say at the start we find a mother and child locked in a small room, having evidently been there for the boy's whole 5 years of life. They are scared, thin, holding on the best they can. We slowly come to understand the situation, at the same time getting a fascinating, and often chilling peek into what the world might seem like to a kid who has only lived in one small space. The film is beautifully shot: the ultra-tight closeups, and wide lenses feeding the dizzying and nerve wracking sense of being trapped, and giving the "Room" (a character in itself) a plastic sense of shifting size and shape. The score occasionally seemed a bit much to me - there's plenty of emotion here without needing the music to convince us - but those moments were few, and certainly not enough to seriously hurt the film. It won't be everyone's cup of tea. It's dark, sad, complicated, scary and uncomfortable at times - although, as in life, lighter moments and hope find a way to break through. It's not light entertainment. But it's not like anything I've seen. It made me think, and has haunted me in the days since I've seen it. That's a lot for any film to accomplish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i started watching this film, for the first ten minutes i was not sure whether i can watch this film because of so many obvious things like the level of cruelty and where this film might lead towards but as this film entered into its fifteenth minute it gripped my brain completely and i understood what Brie and Jacob are doing here is not a performance but it's simply magic. They both have captured maximum space of the screen and they both have captured heart of millions. The directional eye is simply breath taking and the script - so simple yet very powerful. A well deserved Oscar to Brie Larson. I believe cinema like this makes this stage very important and appreciable. As a movie maker i must say this film is a milestone in cinematic achievements of all kind and i can simply congratulate each and everyone who were part of the cast &amp; crew of the team and those who have already watched it. For those who are planning to watch it - watch it now because its a perfect ten pointer for the genre of Drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uncomfortable but outstanding - a must see movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually it's hard to rate this one as in most areas it is beyond excellent but to be really critical you could pick holes in the plot. In the end I've compromised at 9/10. I must admit I tried to avoid this movie as I knew it would be a difficult watch, but ended up seeing it as someone else's choice on pay to view TV; I may have lost some of the impact of "being there" that I would have got from the big screen. By now thousands have reviewed the wonderful casting of and acting by the two leads and I concur completely. By five minutes in or less it's impossible to imagine the roles being played by anyone else. And child actor Jacob Tremblay is just astonishing as Jack, who was born in captivity so knows nothing but the claustrophobic world of "room". This really matters in the later stages when he has to cope with the wider world and we are truly drawn into his struggle to adapt and understand. As I always do, I have checked out one or two "hated it" reviews here and worry about some of those critics' ability to empathise, almost to a psychopathic degree. To me, Joy's behaviour is 100% convincing. After so long in captivity and with her child to protect you would absolutely expect her to have constructed a strategy for survival above all else, even if that means taking a submissive role with her captor. It's not like it's just her own life that's on the line if she fights back and fails.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotion Carries This Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen some great dramas and this one rates good on my scale. I imagine the book is much better than the film because the story picks up in this one at the end of 7 years of being stuck living in one room. While references are made in slight bits about how the ordeal for Ma and Jack started, there is very little done to explain how this could have happened for so long. Granted, that is not important to the dramatic part of this film, but it does make the film a leap that might explain why -Old Nick when he does lose Jack just takes off. I really thought he might do something more desperate like go back and harm Ma before the police free her from the room. When I looked at this, the hook is the relationship between Ma and her son Jack. Brie Larson as Ma &amp; Jacob Tremblay (Jack) are outstanding in their roles. Their relationship is key to this drama working. Ma's entire world is being kidnapped when she was 17, raped by old Nick (Sean Bridgers), having a son and then wrapping her entire life on bringing up her son in one room with Old Nick being the jailer and provider for them both. It is an out of whack world which Jack can only see through a skylight for 7 years. Ma totally protects Jack from Old Nick like a mother in the wild protects their young. She teaches him to read, and they do get exposure to the outside world via a television set. Finally, Ma uses her son to finally escape from the room. Then this film goes into the raw emotions and reactions of shock as she and Jack get exposed to the outside world.Many times, Jack is narrating the story as it goes along. Jacob Tremblay's performance is outstanding in all aspects here. Brie Larson is very good but it is the child's view which really carries this film to make the viewer care. It is the emotion which made me interested in the film. It is not a perfect film, but it does pull the viewer in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's surprising this didn't win Best Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films you watch and would instantly think must have won Best Picture at the Oscars - and it's very surprising that this didn't. Room has to be the best films I have seen this year. Everything worked incredibly, from the acting to the cinematography. This is the first film from Lenny Abrahamson (who previously directed Frank in 2014) that I've seen, an honestly I now have an urge to watch the rest of his films; the directing is a major way this film works - Abrahamson blends together an incredible mix of Ma's lament for life and also her extreme happiness for Jack very well, and constantly makes the film go from superbly tense to emotional highs in split instants. There was some very good work from Emma Donoghue (who also wrote the novel) on the script, which was beautifully and delicately written, and in my opinion never had a false note. This film, unlike most, is split into two acts instead of three, both of which last for around 55 minutes. The structure is very tight, and very event seemed very carefully placed and vital to the overall story. This is an incredibly depressing film, which doesn't let go of you for a moment, nor does it ever cease with its emotional highs. The imprisonment of Ma and the general story are very carefully handled. However, perhaps the most impressive aspect of this film is the incredible work from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay, who were both mesmerizing in their own right. Brie Larson portrays Ma's struggles and adaption into the new world very well, and overall convincingly - perhaps one of the most worthy Best Actress wins of all time. Jacob Tremblay is a thing to behold - never before have I seen such an utterly authentic and amazing performance from a child, especially one of just 9 years old. Joan Allen and Tom McCamus both add their own impact on the movie and add great performances, even if this is ultimately Brie and Jacob's movie, who both seem to outshine anything or anyone else.In the end Room is an excellent film that you are sure to never forget, in which Lenny Abrahamson's fantastic directing and the lead actors' performances do justice to the heart-wrenching story.</fullReview>

The acting was gripping and emotional. I honestly can not believe this movie was so engaging. The writer and director literally thought of everything. I think the reason why this film works as well as it does is purely because of the attention to detail. You feel everything the boy does when he sees and understands things for the first time. Another thing that the movie excels in is pacing. For the past 5 or more years it seems like most movies have had pacing problems. This one works well and never rushes or bores you to death. You can write a book about why this movie is so good. It is thought provoking, entertaining and a breath of fresh air in a world full of CGI bullsh!t without plot. I highly recommend this work of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever since Larson won Best Actress for her portrayal in Room, I've wanted to see the movie. And now that I've finally got round to seeing it: heck, did she deserve that award?Room is incredible. The script is raw, honest, unsettling, and brought to gut-wrenching life by brilliant performances from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. Larson and Tremblay embody their characters perfectly and both shine equally; Tremblay sorely deserving an award himself for proving that child actors, too, can be brilliant at what they do. Larson's portrayal of Joy "Ma" is incredibly real and moving, and she clearly involves herself in the role with everything she's got and more. Her whole heart and body is in the woman she portrays, and her chemistry with Tremblay makes them an unforgettable pair. Not only is the film well acted, but it has strong, thought- provoking messages throughout, and there is never a dull moment. The people become real, their struggles become real, and you cannot help but simply appreciate and respect the solid, powerful work of art you are watching. With impressive camera work and additional brilliant performances by the ever reliable Joan Allen and William H Macy, Room's domestic atmosphere and firm establishment in reality makes the film one of the best of 2015. Its real brilliance, however, is due to the stunning work by its two leads. Larson and Tremblay portray a mother and son relationship that cannot fail to tug at your heart-strings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Room": Tour De Force Performances tell a Brutal Story of Survival.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After God's love for us all, a mother's love for her child is the most powerful force in our universe. Never is this inestimable strength more explosively in evidence than in the relentlessly gripping domestic drama "Room".Brie Larson unequivocally earns her Best Actress Oscar as Ma, a young woman who at 17 is kidnapped by a sick fu-- and held as a sex slave in a suburban backyard garden shed for the better part of a decade. During this time she bears a son, Jack (Jacob Tremblay in a stunning and utterly natural performance). For five years this boy believes the "real world" consists only of this 11 x 11 foot prison he and his mom inhabit. Until the day that Ma stuns him with the declaration that there is a vast and diverse existence beyond the four walls of "room". And she hatches a plan that may just lead to at long last freedom from the sinister oppression of the evil incarnate "Old Nick".At this point in the story Director Lenny Abrahamson takes us on the rocky journey experienced by survivors of unspeakable trauma, both from the perspectives of those who lived through the ordeal and those whose lives were devastated in the "not knowing". It is here where Larson and Tremblay, along with the great Joan Allen as Ma's mother, Nancy, and Tom McCamus as her partner in particular, shine with poignant ferocity amidst a consumptive crucible of relief, remorse and regret. And never is there a false note struck among the emotional carnage.As "Room" concludes we find Ma and Jack together gaining at least some measure of closure to the horror that has befallen them. And while it is certainly not a happy ending by any standard, it is nonetheless one of, while admittedly tenuous, hope for the future. And considering what may have been in this oh so sad chronicle, this represents infinitely more than we as an audience could have hoped for at the outset of this deeply moving examination of the triumph of the human spirit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First and foremost, I am not going to bore you by dighting redundant synopses or herrying superficial details, I am just going to cut right to the chase and talk about the raw, at times wlatsome, emotion in which this participial film dabbles and therewith I shall besay to you why this film is so good.It is so good because: "what it begins with, what things appear or happen in the opening shot, I could not tell you (mainly due to the fact that I was awake for about 30 to 35 hours straight at the point in time when I started to watch this film), but despite all of that I can still tell you what I felt, which is incredibly rare. At the beginning of this film, I felt claustrophobic, uncomfortable and a little bit confused, and what is more incredible is that I felt the same exact things at the end of this film. From the very ord to the very end, it span me 360 degrees with such emotional might and main that my head wouldn't stop spinning for quite a considerable throw thereafter. I think this is the best complement I can pay to a film, in that it is something new and fresh, something which the most part of men have never laid eyes upon, a thing completely distinct, but more than that is that unlike thousands of other movies that I have watched in my lifetime this is one of those rare few from which I walked away feeling something very strong for quite some time and that is worth a lot in my humble opinion."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2 great performance and a captivating story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Room" is an American 2-hour movie from last year. The director is Lenny Abramson and writer is Emma Donoghue, who actually adapted her own novel for the screen with this one. Both scored Academy Award nominations for their work with the Best Director slot certainly being the more surprising feat. The movie also got in for Best Picture and won lead actress Brie Larsen an Oscar, just like basically all precursors. Jacob Tremblay, however was the real lead here and it is absolutely ridiculous that he was nominated for so many supporting awards. Voiceovers are usually a good indicator who is in the center of the story and we hear him at the very beginning and end for example. Also there are key scenes where we still find out about him while his mother is out of the picture, such as the successful escape or after his mother tries to commit suicide. But this should not mean that Larson isn't lead. She is as well, but only the second lead despite being credited first.I believed this film delivered on many areas, such as emotion and drama most importantly. The escape inside the carpet was downright thrilling from start to finish until the very moment we realize he succeeded. Butg even the the tension stays high as we do not know what happened to his mother. Did he kill her or not. The consequence of these scenes is also the emotion in here. The moments when Larson's runs towards the car with her son inside is really moving and there are more scenes like that, such as the way they meet the grandparents or also the scene with the boy and the dog towards the end. You will be amazed by these and it is really difficult to hold the tears back.This is a very tragic, yet very uplifting film at the same time, but certainly more of the latter. The scenes early on in the prison do not seem as sad as they really are as we see everything through the eyes of the son. It starts right away inside the shack and I initially thought the woman actually has a mental disorder because of which she won't leave the place and the guy coming occasionally is somebody who provides them with the necessary items in exchange for sexual pleasure. It is seen a lot more as a prison when the action moves outside, which is roughly the entire second half of the film. I personally think that there are a couple scenes that don't add that much really and could have been left out. It is also difficult to say if this film had worked even better if it would have ended with the reunion of the two outside, but I guess it would have been a major (maybe impossible) challenge to make it work for 100 minutes or so. I guess it was best this way. Another flaw I saw with it was the attempted suicide scene I mentioned earlier already. It felt a bit unrealistic drama at this point. Yes it was all too much for her, but she fought for survival for 5 years and then she would do something like that. Of course, the reason was that she had doubts after the reporter asked her why she did not give up on her son inside. But this also would have been her surrender I guess as she certainly would never have gotten outside without him. But yeah, the way the press was depicted in here was generic and standard in a negative way. They could have dealt better with that situation.But despite these criticisms, these almost 120 minutes were a captivating watch and truly flew by. I can see why The Academy turned out to like it that much. Larson and Tremblay shine a lot and it was impossible to say who was better. Okay, I could have done without some parts I mentioned already and also the mother-daughter argument, but these are just minor flaws. In the grand scheme of things, this film worked extraordinarily well and was extremely tense and touching at the same time. I command you to check it out. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

It is by far one of the most amazing films that I saw to be released this past year and one that takes your emotions on a roller-coaster ride that continues even after the credits roll. I sat watching the movie absorbed in the tale it had to tell, angry at times, concerned at others and walking away with a love of life that few films can inspire these days.Most people will know the basic set up of "ROOM" prior to watching it. Based on the novel by Emma Donoghue it tells the story of Ma (Brie Larson) and Jack (Jacob Trembly) who are together in the single setting of a room. Deeper than that is the realization that Ma was kidnapped and held hostage here giving birth to Jack during the years of her captivity. Now the two of them remain prisoners of the rarely seen Old Nick (Sean Bridgers), the man who kidnapped Ma years ago and who abuses her sexually when the mood strikes.For the better part of 40 minutes the movie focuses on how Ma and Jack live together. The movie begins with his 5th birthday and Ma deciding that she needs to find a way to get out or at least get Jack out so he can live a normal life. That a movie can hold your interest in a single setting, a room, without letting go is a testament to how good this movie is.**Spoiler Alert** So if that's all you want to know stop reading now. What happens after those first 40 minutes are so are the most amazing parts. Their escape plan works and Jack finds himself in the world outside. For 5 years the only world he has known was room, an 11x11 room with a skylight in the ceiling. Now he finds the entire outside world before him and is dumbstruck with all that he must absorb before he can escape Old Nick. But escape he does and eventually is reunited with Ma.And here the story goes on a whole different track. The movie now focuses on how not just Jack but how Ma must deal with adapting to the real world as well. While everyone realizes that Jack must learn how to cope with this outside world few comprehend how Ma, 17 when she was abducted, must also relearn what the world is like. She must come to grips with how no one found her. She must deal with how the world looks at Jack, the child of an abductor. She must learn to live with being unable to escape so long ago and it all takes its toll.We witness the world through Jack's eyes most of the time, learning about this new world. He learns that there are many people in this world, including his grandparents. Grandma (Joan Allen) and grandpa (William H. Macy) are now divorced and grandma lives with Leo (Tom McCamus). Shy and withdrawn he must learn to develop trust with them, learn what the world is like and deal with his mother trying to cope as well.The movie grips you by the throat early on and rarely let's go as it progresses from start to finish. The emotional roller-coaster ride I spoke of has you in fear of what will happen to Ma and Jack. It will have you sad watching the terrors that they go through and considering what it must be like to have been held a captive for years. It will encourage anger as you consider what this monster Old Nick has done to the lives of all he touched, his victim and her friends and family. And it will leave you filled with a sense of joy at discovering through the eyes of young Jack exactly what this world has to offer.Larson won the Academy Award this year for best actress and deservedly so. Her performance here is amazing to watch. She moves from strong protector to little girl once again and her character feels she isn't the mother she should be when Jack lets her know that she is. What stuns me is that Trembly, even though he is so young, wasn't nominated at least for supporting actor. His performance is something one would never expect from a child.I'll say again that I can find no way that anyone who watches this film will not be touched in some way. Watching it at home will make it much easier on viewers as those who might cry won't have to worry about who sees them at different times in the film. If the movie doesn't touch you then you have no soul. I now have to see "SPOTLIGHT", the winner for best picture Oscar, just to see if it was better than this movie. Somehow I doubt that it will be but I will be content in knowing that this film was one of the most deserving of the nominations for that title.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect is the best word to describe "Room"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Room is directed by Lenny Abrahamson and stars Brie Larson, Jacob Tremblay, Joan Allen, Sean Bridgers, and William H. Macy. The film is about a woman named Joy "Ma" Newsome who was abducted and held captive in a room for seven years, and her son, Jack who is five years old and has been living inside that particular room his entire life. The film follows their attempt at escaping from that place and as we see through Jack's eyes, his experience of the outside world for the first time in his life. This is definitely at the top of my best movies of the year, simply because it is incredibly done and perfectly portrayed. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay give some of the best performances I've ever seen in my life in any movie what so ever. The kid, Jacob, is phenomenal and surprisingly he carries it all throughout. You'd think that an amazing actress like Brie, and her character would be the center of the movie but that's actually not the case. As she says so in the movie, her kid saves her many times, and that goes to show just how different and amazingly done this movie really is. The director (Lenny Abrahamson) also did a very good job here, as he kept us interested and entertained through the first part of the movie when they're in the room. That is really hard to do, considering that there are not much things to do or a lot of different ways to go about it but this director did it. The music composed by Stephen Rennicks is very touching and gives those very much needed and present emotional moments meaning and heart. I think that one of the main reasons as to why this movie worked so wonderfully well was the screenplay written by the author of the original book that this movie is based upon, Emma Donoghue. More movies should take notice of this and be loyal to the main source because that's the best way to succeed at making an adaptation. I pretty much loved everything about this movie, it was touching, filled with incredible performances, very good cinematography, great directing that conclude to the perfectness that this movie is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The idea of being separated from the world is difficult to manage, but adding the impact of being separated from everything as a child is even more difficult. Learning what makes up the world, from the simplest of things to complex relationships is well illustrated in the movie. Jack, who has been carefully protected by his mother from a monster, is amazing to watch. He has never seen steps, let alone walked up or down them. He has never seen a tree, flowers, birds or people other than on television, which he understands is make believe. But his wide-eyed view of the world as he rides in the back of a pickup truck heightens the desperate efforts made by his loving mother to save him from the horrors of room. Jack has a very different view of room, in which he has been both cradled, protected, and held captive for five years. Once free mother and son begin to accept the world form different view points. As they experience a wide range of feelings: joy, fear, sadness they lean on each other. Slowly, due to the love they share and the support they provide each other, enables them to accept their new world. As the story moves forward, other significant family members are also forced to deal with what has happened to Jack and his mother, Joy. Joy's father is unable to accept Jack's parentage so he abandons the family to return to his world. Joy's mother and step father, who prove to be supportive, are able to gently draw Jack out, introduce him to the larger world, and ultimately restore his mother, who has suffered following their escape. The escape is possible only because a man observes what takes place when Jack jumps from the truck. The police officers responding to the scene illustrate two very different view points of the incident. One officers wants to pass off the situation by calling child services, which would ultimately prevent Joy's rescue. However, the other officer attentively listens to Jack, recognizes the danger his mother is in, and learns where he has been held ultimately enabling Joy's rescue. This illustrating the impact how one simple misstep could change the results. It also illustrates how often adults write off what children try to tell us. Interesting concept for a film-no matter how difficult life is, Jack's well-being is the most important thing in Joy's life. Well done-amazing acting and concept.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie starts of strong and really powerful. The maim characters being in a situation that is completely unimaginable. The actors present this exceptionally well. Jacob Tremblay's performance is amazing for a kid of his age, I have lost count of how many movies that have such average young actors, but this is an outstanding breakthrough for me.This movies is not amazing throughout. Once they are free, it is kind of interesting to see that whole transition, but I believe that it is a wast of half the movie, it starts to drag on without meaning or a definite mission/goal. the second part is just pointless.Overall, this is a movie well made and worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Modern Cinematic Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lenny Abrahamson, the director of this film, is determined to make everyone cry. The viewer will go through a roller-coaster ride of emotions including happiness, eeriness, and sadness. The interaction between "Ma" (Brie Larson) and "Jack" (Jacob Tremblay) is bittersweet. I couldn't help but feel delighted to see the affectionate love they share and show on screen. But at the same time, I couldn't help but feel disturbed by the fact that they were held captive in a shed.The room was evidently small, but the way Jack and Ma played around to keep themselves busy made it look like the biggest and happiest playground in the world. The playground would turn into a disturbing hellish nightmare by night. While Jack was trying to sleep, their captor named "Old Nick" would rape Ma. The actual horrendous activity was not shown on screen. Instead, we see Jack in a closet trying to sleep while we hear the thumping and thudding.Ma and Jack's time in the room contain most of the film's best moments. After Jack escapes and the police find out where Ma was, the film becomes more intriguing. Jack's interaction with the real world kept my attention. From interacting with other people to playing with a dog for the first time, I couldn't help but smile. Although I realize that the third act was longer than it should be, I was still entertained. The film's most uplifting scenes are to be found when Jack experiences the real world.The cinematography was nothing special, but I specifically liked the way they filmed in the room. I felt claustrophobia, which I think was the intent of the cinematographer. Jack's face when he sees the blue open sky for the first time is one of my favorite moments in this movie.The chemistry between Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay was very authentic. I felt the love that they shared for each other and the tense arguing against each other. Brie Larson received numerous accolades for her performance, including an Oscar win. Her performance was raw. From shedding tears, screaming at her movie mom, to her subtle moments with Jacob, she couldn't have done any better. Jacob Tremblay's performance was equally great as Brie's. He was robbed of an Oscar nomination. Nevertheless, he still won numerous awards, including the Canadian Screen Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role, beating the legendary Christopher Plummer. I have never seen a child actor give out such a phenomenal performance ever since Haley Joel Osment in "The Sixth Sense". His facial expressions were surreal and authentic. There was never a scene where I felt that he was just "acting", his performance felt real. Their on-screen chemistry is arguably the best thing about this film.The dialogue between the characters was natural. A very simplistic, but at the same time, powerful screenplay, written by the author of the novel, Emma Donoghue.I have never felt affected by the soundtrack of a film ever since watching the movie "Drive" (2011). The music perfectly portrayed the tone of a scene. From the empowering song, "The Mighty Rio Grande", to the even more empowering song "New End", the soundtrack played a crucial part in this film.This film was a refreshing watch. A true modern cinematic masterpiece. The best movie of 2015.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film in two unequal parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joy has been held captive in a tiny garden shed for 7 long years and is raped every night by her kidnapper. Jack, her 5 year old son, born in captivity, has no concept of the real world outside. His only "contacts" with the external world are a television with often blurred signals and a skylight. Jack is cheerful and finds new ways to amuse himself every day, playing with shadows or a rat that intrudes into their "home". Joy is biding her time, waiting for Jack to grow up so that he can be told the truth. The bond between mother and son in that claustrophobic Room is extraordinary. This is the better half of the film. In the second half, Jack and Joy gain freedom in a rather ingenuous and dramatic way. They have to now come to terms with the real harsh world. As they struggle to cope with their newfound lives, so does the film in keeping pace with their struggles. We can see Joy's pain, but cannot empathize with her. How does fortitude desert her so quickly? This is where the film tends to stumble a bit.Though Brie Larson's "Ma" fetched her an Oscar, it is 10-year old Jacob Tremblay, who stuns you as the 5-year old Jack. It is a portrayal that will haunt long after you have returned to your rooms.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extraordinary movie - and now i have to read the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Emma Donoghue has adapted for the screen her Booker Prize-nominated novel - loosely inspired by some real events - which tells the story of a young woman called (ironically) Joy kidnapped seven years previously and held in a garden shed where five years ago sex with her captor resulted in the birth of her son Jack. It sounds horrific, but in the end it is actually inspiring because it is less about detention and more about relationships - not just between mother and child but between mother and her parents and between child and his grandparents.By the time I caught up with the movie, it had been nominated for four Academy Awards and won one, Best Actress for Brie Larson who, most of the time, appears with no make-up and gaunt. But all the performances are impressive, not least that of young Jacob Tremblay as Jack. The novel is narrated in his words and the film uses his voice-over from time to time which give added poignancy to this remarkable and moving story. Jack is just five and forms a special relationship with a grandparent and I am grandparent to a little one who is just five, so I found the film especially resonant.Irish director Lenny Abrahamson has done brilliantly in conveying the physical confines of the eponymous room and the psychological restraints under which we all operate. I didn't like his previous work "Frank", which I found too weird, but this is a triumph.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To start this off right I must say that Room (2015) is an amazingly well done film! At first when I saw the trailer for Room I was unsure if I'd want to watch it, not that it didn't seem good; I was wondering if it were gonna be one of those very slow drawn out films as Hollywood seems to push out; this wasn't one of those. In Room 2015 they displayed perfect acting, a beautiful, yet thrilling story; the concept of this film was on point in all ways.Room is one of those films that everyone should check out, the way the team put it all together just couldn't have been any better; perfection to say the least. Room (2015) is a film in which will be in our tops for a very long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So finally here is one cinematic experience of a lifetime.It starts in a claustrophobic tone, gradually cheers up and finally ends up in an introspective mood.The basic idea of the movie is how we adjust ourselves in different circumstances.Things can be easy even when the externals are odd.Things can be tough even when everything is a bed of roses.It is up to us and how we cope with the change.And only the brave can fight it back to normalcy.This is what you call a layered plot, interwoven with human emotions like joy, sadness, madness,depression and sense of freedom.Brie Larson as Joy (Ma) is brilliant.Her expressions,change of tone,hysteria,eyes lit up the character and its pleasures and agonies.Deservedly she bagged the coveted Academy Award.Joan Allen as the sensitive grandmother does a brilliant job.But it is the kid Jacod Tremblay who steals the show.He is too brilliant actor for a kid of his age.His narration towards the end of the movie makes your eye moist.The other casts do justice to their small roles.'Room' is a winner all through.</fullReview>

How the director, like a painter on a canvas, keep adding details to their lives.From our narrow point of view, we can appreciate and comprehend how strong and clever this girl is, how thoughtful she has been for shrinking her son's world to just one Room, protecting him from excruciating reality of her kidnapping and daily rape.The movie depicts well the aftermath too, where pressure relief destabilise her mind while the kid, who were none the wiser, can't figure out the reason of his mother's sudden behavioural change.So, for crying it out loud, it's a very pleasant movie with a wonderfully cured psychological part.Enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do what movies ask and remove yourself from your world. There's always "Room" for something Different.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read some of the reviews, as I normally do, for this movie. I too, like others, depend on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes for guidance on movies to watch. In a sea of crappy art films and overdone remakes of old classics. Today's ease of filming anything makes viewing films these days a chore. Maybe that's why all the oldies are rated so high. I saw the rating for "Room" and thought it was worth a go. Sometime during viewing, I glance back at IMDb to get another view of opinions or plots. Although the first ones are usually on par, others tend to have an opposite opinion which their entitled to have. I had to write something on this film because of some of the opinions expressed about their views on the story. It's one thing to have an opposite opinion of someone but, I think it's an injustice to categorize a movies has a "Housewives" story or "Lifetime" quality. This film is waaay beyond that! And I'm a Man in my mid 30's. Movies are our gifts to escape ourselves and take a break to immerse ourselves in someone elses shoes and see things through the eyes of the characters. This story is about an abducted girl who was abducted, raped, and locked in a shed. Her child, only knew for his 5 yrs. of existence what happened in Room. Our job as a viewer is to put ourselves in Jack's place and realize a world he thought was only on television. To cast this experience aside is to belittle our human emotions. I personally felt for both the main characters. To try to comprehend what they are going through,.......this film does better than average to try to begin to convey what it would be like. To try to feel their situation. That's what makes this film so good! I wonder about the world I'm trying to raise my children in knowing how easy it is for some to dismiss our humanity. To care about people, even for just a few moments before going back to reality. This film IS NOT just for housewives and women folk! This is for any human who feels. Who understands what emotions are and how to feel them. Don't let anyone sway you from watching this!! It's a reminder of a sick world and how to come back from the dark into the light</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Half Way To A Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just wanted to add my thoughts here because, as great as some of the movie undeniably was, I felt the balance was all wrong. Once they had escaped, with barely half the running time elapsed, all the tension went out of the film. I was sitting there thinking - okay, so what is going to happen to fill the next fifty minutes? The answer? Pretty much nothing, sadly.Don't get me wrong, the final scene was very moving, but I still got the feeling that the movie peaked during the escape and then just sort of ambled around for the remainder. which is a great shame, because I was really enjoying it up until that point, not least the stunning turn from the young actor playing the kid.I think I understand what the film was trying to achieve in being structured the way that it was, it just didn't work for me personally. I'm actually quite a fan of non-linear plots, and maybe that's something that would have enabled the director to keep building the tension to the very end whilst still showing us the aftermath of the ordeal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Obligatory "the book was better" comment, but I was still very impressed with the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I read the book a few years back, I absolutely couldn't put it down. The story is incredibly powerful and your heart aches for young Jack. The part where he escapes literally had my heart pounding in my throat. It was an overall incredible reading experience, and because the book set such high standards, I didn't expect the movie to be able to top it, as usually happens with movies based on fantastic books. However, "Room" took me by surprise and really impressed me, albeit in different ways.In the book, Jack is the narrator, which was particularly powerful...since the reader is essentially blind and can only know what Jack describes, you largely have the same amount of knowledge about what is going on as he does for the first half of the story, and slowly put two and two together. Not being told what was explicitly going on was a great driving factor in the book, and Jack's escape was one of the most heart-pounding reading experiences in recent memory. I don't necessarily totally fault the movie for not being able to pull off quite the same experience as the story couldn't be told quite the same way in a visual medium, and obviously knowing the story I already knew what happened. However, I would have loved more shots from Jack's point of view in the movie, maybe even completely from his point of view. The richness and blissful ignorance of Jack's world and the interplay between his inner and outer mind was a very important theme decidedly missing from the film.However, one aspect of the film I did enjoy was the second half, post-escape. This part of the book I thought paled a bit in comparison to the first..once the reader 'knew' much more than Jack did the story lost something important, in my opinion (in fact, because of this, I thought the book should have ended with their escape) But in the film you got to explore beyond Jack's eyes and this second half is where this mattered most, for example you got to see a much better view of the implications for Jack's mother (helped in no small part by Brie's powerful performance, whose Oscar was well-deserved), and for the pair of them together as they navigate their freedom together, one learning for the first time and other re-learning. The way they presented this part was powerful and inherently had greater depth without the narratorial confines, and I liked it much more than I did in the book.Overall, although I have to be that annoying person with the obligatory "book was better" comment, I did very much enjoy the film for the reasons stated. It would have been interesting to see it without knowing the story already. I am very glad they brought this beautiful and heart-wrenching story to the big screen - the acting and cinematography was simply superb and young Jacob Tremblay clearly has stardom in his future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A compelling and emotionally engaging examination of a touchy subject</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a sucker for emotional dramas, and even more so if they deal with difficult and/or sensitive subject matter. ROOM is both of those things and does so in a tasteful fashion. I also haven't been so emotionally invested in a film since probably PRISONERS. The story revolves around and Ma (Brie Larson) and Jack (Jacob Tremblay). Ma (whose real name is Joy) was abducted as a teenager and lives in a garden shed, affectionately (or not so, depending on how you interpret it) referred to as 'Room,' with her now-five-year-old son, Jack. When the opportunity arises, Jack escapes and the real meat of the story begins. First off, I was very impressed with performances in the film. Brie Larson does excellent work, but I was even more surprised by Jacob Tremblay. Even though he's quite young, he was able to convey a dramatic range that, although suiting the role in particular, sometimes isn't achieved by older actors. Playing someone who's spent his entire life in captivity, he portrayed the wide-eyed curiosity required as well as the confusion in someone whose perspective on the world is fundamentally changed. There were a number of intense and/or emotional scenes, and he nailed every single one. I also liked how, even though the story deals with women who have been abducted, there was a bit more going on under the surface. Separating the narrative from the obviously horrible situation in which a woman is raped repeatedly, you can see the film also dealing with the psychological effect when a woman has motherhood thrust upon them, the culture shock when someone who has lived in isolation comes into contact with the "real world," etc. There was a lot going on than a simple escape from captivity, in other words. The only issue I could possibly come up with is that the second half of the film doesn't quite live up to the suspenseful first half. Once mother and son are freed, the narrative drive is somewhat lost, or at least goes into a holding pattern for a while. The difference in pacing is noticeable, although I wasn't terribly bothered by it. And, the film wraps up in a satisfying way anyway. All things considered, ROOM is an extremely compelling story that will have some people reaching for a tissue. It has great performances, cinematography, score, etc., and is certainly one of the best films of 2015.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes a Better Movie Than Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Room" is the rare film that improves on the book on which it's based.I had a complicated reaction to the novel. I found the first half actually set in the room to be nearly unbearable. I'm a father of young boys and trying to imagine the scenario set up in the book made me almost physically ill. I'm not sure I could have read the whole thing if the mother and her son had not escaped from their captor, but once they did, I felt like the air went out of the book and everything that happened after was much less compelling.The movie spends much less of its time in the room itself, because what takes pages and pages to describe in the book can be conveyed much more quickly with a few carefully chosen images. Therefore, more of the film takes place on the outside, but the filmmakers do a better job of making that the compelling narrative. The movie becomes a tribute to the resilience and adaptability of children, and captures that feeling parents experience when the world and all it contains once again becomes a wondrous place because they're seeing it through the eyes of their children.Brie Larson won an Oscar for her performance, and while I certainly don't begrudge her the win, I didn't feel that her performance was necessarily the slam-dunk best of the year that her dominance of the awards circuit suggested. The one who amazes in the film is Jacob Tremblay, playing Jack. He carries the film in a way that many adult actors can't manage, and some of the later scenes, especially those with his grandmother (played by a wonderful Joan Allen), quietly reduced me to a quivering mess.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complex and awe-inspiring film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There has perhaps never been a more obvious metaphor in cinema for the loss of childhood innocence and the sudden arrival of the big, scary, grown-up world out there, but Irish director Lenny Abrahamson, who helmed 2014's magnificent Frank, translates Emma Donoghue's internal monologue-heavy novel of the same name with tenderness and care, successfully avoiding sensationalising the horror at its disturbing core. Room is one of the year's most complex and awe-inspiring films.Five year-old Jack (Jacob Tremblay) has never left the place he knows as Room. To him, the tiny shed he has lived his entire life is the whole world, with the pictures on the television screen beamed in from some distant galaxy. He and his devoted mother Joy (Brie Larson) spend every day in a set routine, with Joy using every waking moment to tend to her son and shield him from the terrible situation they're actually in. We come to learn that Joy has been locked in Room for seven years, taken a long time ago by a man she only knows as Old Nick (Deadwood's Sean Bridgers), who routinely re- ups their supplies and rapes Joy while Jack peeks through the cracks of his wardrobe.Larson won an Oscar for her performance here and rightly so. The relationship between Joy and Jack is more than simple mother-and- son, as it comes quickly to light that the boy is the only thing keeping her alive. Still, she struggles with his energy and growing curiosity of things he cannot comprehend, until one day she decides to tell him the truth and plans their escape. Her depression is becoming overwhelming, to the point where she may commit suicide, and then what then for her son? If you're unaware of the plot then don't read any further, for it is the moment Jack finally breaks free, followed shortly after by his mother, when the film moves into different territory altogether - Jack coping with this mind-blowing revelation. There now exists things he has never seen before, such as other people, other places, and the sky.Tremblay is equally as good as Jack with arguably a more complex character. It's appalling that his name was missing from the Academy's line-up, as this is the finest male performance of the year (as lovely as it was to see Leonardo DiCaprio receive his long- overdue award). His experience of this new, massive planet is amplified by some intelligent camera-work from cinematographer Danny Cohen, who films in sparse wide-shots to heighten the scale, and employs intense close- ups during the early scenes in Room to almost offend your sense of space. Yet its the two leads and their natural chemistry that really assist Room in delivering its intended emotional wallop. Whenever they're apart, you feel the tear and their need for each other. This is powerful, intelligent film- making, with a real hint of the greatness that could come from Abrahamson in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a Touching Drama on Desolation and Motherhood......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a best selling novel, "Room" chronicles the story of a lady and her son held captive by a kidnapper, who actually is his biological father, in a shed comprising merely a 10 X 10 room. For the boy, the room is the only world he has known. The only medium he can see outside is the skylight in the room. The story may sound a nerdy fiction; but the film focuses much on the psychological aspects and discovers the story of desolation and motherhood which comes vividly alive on the screen. There are few scenes in which the boy and the mother have screamed to each other which could have been avoided alas they were like the scenes demanding the Oscars. Nevertheless, the film won an Oscar for the best performance by an actress. The film avoids big star cast or sets; but still the film is rich in emotions, performances, and beauty. The film just beautifully portrays the perspective of a five year old boy who doesn't know the world for real except for what his mother has told him or what he has seen in the TV screen. The emotional attachment portrayed between the two is awesome. Brie Larson's performance doesn't yet equal the winning Oscar performances from Julia Roberts or Hilary Swank, but still she appears stunning and well portrays a petrified lady held captive for six years. Few sequences are pretty familiar, but there are certain moments in the film for which you are drawn to it.Rating: 3 stars out of 4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could share all sorts of insights about characters and plot lines and nuances and musical score, anon anon. But the truth is, it had me captivated (no pun intended) from start to finish. I honestly can't describe it, it's just absolutely breathtaking. I wept in pain for the boy, and I wept in pride for the boy, knowing full well this was fiction. The actor who played him (to take nothing at all away from Brie Larson) was absolutely brilliant in this movie.All I can say is what I titled this review: this movie was spectacularly, hauntingly, painfully, stunningly beautiful.Most will probably not find this review helpful. But I'm fine with that. Find a couple hours that you can give this movie your attention, and sit down and immerse yourself. I found it 100% worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some moments in film will always stick with you. Some of them are more bombastic like when Rocky made it to the top of the steps or when ET and Elliot fly past the moon on the bike. Room is a more subtle film and its many moments are more personal but no less memorable. No film has ever pulled such an emotional and physical response from me. Like the graveyard scene in Saving Private Ryan or the end of Toy Story 3, the more you see it the harder it hits you but this film extends that feeling for two hours.Much praise has been given to Brie Larson's career defining performance as Ma and she has deserved every award she's won and if there are any she lost she should've gotten them to. She becomes a mother as a teenager, so unprepared, yet she is everything you want in one. Jack is her everything, gives her life meaning that it previously did not have. It's a subtle performance but one of the most powerful, certainly of recent memory. Consider a scene where a reporter asks if she will ever tell Jack about his father. Her response is flawless. The words tell so much but her face... If you watch this scene with the sound of you may not understand what is happening but you will feel everything you are supposed to feel.What stuns me is how little hardware given to Jacob Tremblay. No child actor in the history of cinema has given a performance half as good as his and like all works of artistic brilliance, I struggle to understand why he is so effecting. Maybe its because he is far too young to understand the weight of what is going on. I think its his eyes, his entire face seems too big for his head, very emotive. Whatever it is, he has me wrapped around his little finger. When he is smiling, I'm tearing up with joy, when he is scared I am sobbing in fear (I've seen this three times and I'm practically dehydrated every time) That is not to say that this film is as easily digestible as ET or Rocky. As its plot would dimply, this film is often dark and it is often disturbing. But this is not the horror film that it so easily could have been (though there is a sequence in the middle that is so intense, i want to call it heart pounding but i can't, my heart stopped cold) in fact this is the most uplifting film since Shawshank. For the payoff to have any emotional impact, you have to put the characters through hell. Ultimately this is a film about survival. Jack survived because he is a child and that is what children do, they adapt. Ma survives too, not because of some inner strength but because of Jack. Watch this film and give your mom a hug</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a pretty good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Room is a pretty good movie. It is based on a novel by Emma Donoghue who also penned the film script. It is the story of a woman who was locked up and sexually abused for 7 years inside a 10 ft. by 10 ft. shed.It is also the story of her 5-year-old son who was born and raised inside the 'room' with no knowledge of the outside world. He assumes that the small television set they watch every day is just 'make believe'.The story is sometimes difficult to watch as we see mother and son play out their daily lives in this room, where the male perpetrator appears at night to have his way with mom while little Jack sleeps in the closet. They are both totally under the control of this evil, sexual pervert and there seems no hope for them.I confess that I was worried that the entire movie would take place in the 'room', as after about 45 minutes I was starting to become tired of watching such unspeakable misery. Fortunately, my concerns were unfounded. Jack manages to escape by pretending he is dead. The cops find Jack and glean enough information from him to work out where the shed is located. The rest, as they say, is history.The final part of the film is devoted to the trials and traumas of Jack and his mom adapting to the real world at the family home of his grandparents.The film handles this sensitively and realistically, although I would certainly take issue with the shocking and invasive questioning by a TV reporter, even though Mom was being paid for the interview. Even in today's sensationalist America, where just about anything goes, an interview like this would never be allowed to happen to such a distressed and traumatised woman ? money or no money.I don't know why, but I could tell that the film was adapted from a book. Some of the events ? such as Jack rolling himself up in a carpet probably works well in a book but less well on screen. It didn't ring true. Maybe I'm nit-picking, as generally speaking, the film works well and holds your attention throughout.Jacob Tremblay, as Jack, acts out of his skin and Brie Larson, as the mother, is also excellent and does everything that could be expected of her in the acting department. But for this reviewer, she wasn't the best actress amongst those nominated this year for an Oscar, even though she won. But there again?I'm probably biased.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Award Season's most rewarding films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With awards season in full swing following Rickey Gervais's hilarious comments at the Golden Globes this past weekend, there's plenty for audiences to seek out at their nearest cinema over the next few weeks. It is, however, entirely possible that a film as small as Room may fail to garner much attention from casual cinema-goers, unable to compete with Leonardo Di Caprio in The Revenant, and Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight. This is nothing short of a tragedy for while those films may appeal to mass audiences thanks to the big names attached to them, Room is without a doubt one of the best films of the 2016 yards season with stellar performances from it's talented, yet small, cast.Opening in the confines of a room which features several household necessities but none of the luxuries, we're introduced to the two characters which we're set to follow during the films two hour runtime. Jack has just turned 5 and having never known anything different, he's content with his surroundings, longing only for a candle which can be placed on top of his birthday cake. His mother, Joy, attempts to maintain a sunny disposition despite her current circumstances, willing to mask her frustration and despair with a smile for the sake of her child. The first few scenes do a fantastic job at setting up the two protagonists, showcasing their daily activities and the bond that the two share. Young Jacob Tremblay provides a voice-over which allows the viewer to see things as he does, describing items and his life in simple terms which match his simple lifestyle, and his performance is nothing short of brilliant from the start, capturing all the innocence of a young boy who doesn't quite understand that his life is far from normal.It's not just Tremblay, however, that delivers an award worthy performance. Brie Larson is note perfect as the weary Joy, displaying a fragile state of mind which is always visible no matter how strong she tries to be for Jack. Her attempts to escape are both desperate and borderline dangerous, but her motivation is always in sight, standing right beside her and calling her name. Larson and Tremblay manage to portray one of the most 'real' on screen relationships in recent memory as a mother and son who have nothing but each other. It's because of this relationship that it's so heartbreaking to see Jack shut in his makeshift wardrobe bed at night as his mother is raped by their captor. So heartbreaking to see Joy's attempts to explain the world to a young boy that has no concept of it, and so heartbreaking to see their reunion following their escape. The feelings of despair continue once they are amongst their family, yet it's still uplifting to see the two characters freed from their confined lifestyle and attempting to find happiness.Though both actors are in fine form from start to finish, it's Larson's performance that carries the film and enables one of it's key themes to be recognised so brilliantly ? how delicate we are as human beings. It's a theme present within every character that appears in some way, shape or form, and one that makes Room a film which will touch many of it's viewers. Whether it be Joy and her despair, her captor and his guilt, or her mother and her grief, each character is delicate and fragile in their own way, allowing the film to become not just a character study of two people, but a much larger body of work which analyses the emotions of a number of individuals.If there is a single flaw to be found within Room, it's in one of these moments that showcases the fragility of the human mind which involves Joy's father. Robert (William H. Macy) refuses to even look at Jack when he and Joy return home, presumably because he is a reminder of the ordeal his daughter has been through at the hands of her captor, having been both conceived and born in the room where she spent the previous 7 years. It's an interesting concept and one which provides conflict within the household when it is presented, unfortunately, it's never revisited or fully realised, instead existing as a passing moment which could have held much more weight. Despite this, it's another shining example of how Room seeks to explore how complex our emotions are and how damaging this can be, regardless of who we are.Awards season is here and while there's many big-hitters in cinemas at this very moment, Room proves to be one of the most rewarding films thanks to stunning performances, interesting concepts, and sensitive themes. Brie Larson may very well be a shoe-in for Best Actress at the Academy Awards following her Golden Globe win, and if there is any justice in the world, both she and Room will receive all the recognition that they so rightly deserve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Claustrophobic, scary and brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Room is the incredible story about Ma, played by Brie Larson, who at 17 years of age, gets abducted and imprisoned in a shed at her perpetrator's house. Now 7 years later, she has the 5 year old boy Jack, played by Jacob Trembley, who lives with her inside the shed. She does everything in her power to make him feel safe. The Irishman Lenny Abrahamson directed this hard and claustrophobic film. The first impression of Room is that the film is rather comfortable. Ma and Jack enjoy each others company and do things that a mother and son usually does. They bake, eat food, celebrate birthdays and watch TV together. After a while as we get more into the story, their relationship changes and becomes more and more tumultuous. Jack by the age of 5, is forced to face and take action against things that no human being ever should have to.Room is really divided in two parts, the first one in captivity and the second one in freedom. The interesting thing that Abrahamson does with this film, is that he in an incredible way asks very daring questions to us. With a life in total captivity, is it possible to feel freedom afterwards? When the safe base a 5 year old has felt his entire life just disappears, what happens then? How does the public react when something like this gets out in the open? Some parts really reminded me of the film Gone Girl where we see in the same way, how the media exploits the suffering the family is going through, only for their own self gain. These moral and psychological questions is the foundation of Room.The best thing about Room is these questions Abrahamson stirs up by not prevaricate, embellish or avoid delicate subjects. He shows it just like it is, no matter how brutal. The second thing that really enhances this film is the amazing acting by both Brie Larson and Jacob Trembley. Their chemistry is truly amazing and Larson even won an Oscar for her performance. If their relationship hadn't felt real, the film wouldn't at all work in the way it did. Room is perhaps one of 2015's most provocative and thought-provoking filmsDavid Lindahl - www.filmografen.se</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The kidnapping, incarceration and rape of children is incredibly difficult to represent authentically on screen. 'Michael' shows how damning the effect can be when genre demands are prioritized over authentic portrayals. The first half of Room offers up a subtly plausible account of how a young woman copes with appeasing her captor in order to avert his gaze from her son. The performances of Brie Larson and an outstanding Jacob Tremblay are crucial here. Jack craves affection but also explores revolt, and the parent-child bond is utterly convincing. Sean Bridgers as the captor Old Nick takes a banality of evil approach: this could be your cousin, your neighbour, your boss. When Jack escapes and Old Nick makes the decision to abandon him in the street, the way he throws the boy down completely conveys the psychopathic nature of the man. The second half of the film, about Ma's difficulty in re-adjusting to society, works less well. Her father is wheeled in then wheeled off in order to make a point about the difficulty of accepting his grandchild. The A-list casting here did not help - a more anonymous face in this role would have given it more of an everyday dark fear appeal. The ending is low-key, but is in its own small way triumphant, a full stop placed right where it was needed. These two characters will go on. They will heal. Thoughtful, mature film-making that stays with you after the curtain closes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this film and the way this tragic but at the same time sweet and hopeful story was told, which is mainly through the eyes and observations of this 5 year old boy Jack, whose view of the world completely changes when he is forced to come to grips with the fact that the world is a much bigger place than what he's known through living in the room. Jack and his mom share a relationship like no other, and it is rare that you see such a strong bond between two people portrayed in such an authentic and delicate way, by two incredible actors Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. These two provide the backbone of the story, their strength, their perseverance and the love they share is what makes the film-goers become so attached to these characters. The details that were put in this story make it so much more than just a story about 2 victims of a psychotic kidnapper that faced immense psychological trauma. For example, the way that Joy uses Alice in wonderland's story to explain to Jack what happened to her and why they were in room, or her facial expression as she looks up at the ceiling and wonders what will be the future of her child if she doesn't do anything to get him out of there. Joy's blank expression as she ponders the journalist's words of whether it would have been better to have asked Old Nick to get him out, shows a tormented soul that is struck with the realisation that she has potentially been a bad mother to the one thing she loves the most and has devoted her life to. The miracle of the story is that little Jack, as afraid and bewildered as he first is by this new world he is forced to enter, becomes the hero of the story and gives his mom his hair, in a way lending her his 'strong' to help her get through her depression. I've been a bad mother to you, Joy tells him and he replies with: You're Ma, ultimately the most important words that a mother could hear. An incredibly touching story involving two superb performances that I know I will be coming back to forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a touching movie. I had to force myself to watch it, as the thought of going through a story about a mother and her son trapped inside a small room for years was too claustrophobic and had too little room (no pun intended) for excitement. But I am glad I watched it. It's a gripping movie. The story of a girl who gets kidnapped and locked in a 10 sqm2 room for 7 years. She gets pregnant and has a son who believes their "room" is the only real thing in the world. When he turns five, she finally tries to explain to him the reality of their lives, and together, they need to find a way to escape. I am not sure whether this movie was anywhere the Oscar nominations or not, but either it is a movie that I hope people will watch. It deserves it.

		<fullReview>It's not everyday a movie can keep you glued to the screen as such. This was a disturbing yet mesmerizing, sorrowful yet breezy, strange yet an innocent tale of a Ma' and Jack that makes you go through a whole expedition of emotions, all in a "garden shed". The voice over of the young boy's thoughts narrated his purity more than his infantile. I might even call it Director Lenny Abrahamson best treasure so far. The casting was impeccable and their performances spoke mountains. My only concern with the movie is that Brie Larson was cited as the lead actor while it was quite eminent of Jacob Tremblay being the lead, hands down. This story testifies how strong hope can be and and how unforgiving hopelessness is. It portrays a mere glimpse of the horrors thousands held captive go through as we speak, just like Jack and his Ma'. It was truly a pleasure watching, keep up the good work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a heartfelt sensation without sensationalising its characterisation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Canada-Irish co-production from Irish director Lenny Abrahamson, the follow-up of his kooky psychodrama FRANK (2014). It wins Brie Larson a coveted Oscar for BEST LEADING ACTRESS, but the real backbone of this bracing indie drama is its 9-year-old child genius Jacob Tremblay.Joy (Larson), is captured by a man she calls Old Nick (Bridgers) 7 years ago, as his sex slave, she is locked inside a room with only a skylight above, and she gives birth to a son named Jack (Tremblay). Now Jack is five years old, he has never been outside the room, and Joy hatches a daring escape plan which puts Jack at the mercy of his luck, but it seems to be their only chance to get out of the living hell.The first hour (before Joy's plan) is entirely shot inside the room, a small shed, Abrahamson has done a phenomenal job to circumvent the claustrophobic setting and elicited an exceptional two- hander between Larson and Tremblay, especially the latter, who is born under such a unique situation, which makes his view of life worlds apart from our common sense and himself a perfect focus point for viewers to scrutinise under the lens of the dramatic sea change soon he is going to experience. Joy's protective strategy works well for a toddler in this extremely unhealthy growing environment (he has to submerge into imagination for companionship, believes everything shown on TV is not real, and the room is their whole world), but when she needs him to assist her in the plan to escape, she must shatter the entire fabrication and tell him what is the real world, here, the clash reaches its boiling point, again, Tremblay is such a godsend to watch, accurately expresses Jack's confusion, denial, fear and maturity from writer Emma Donoghue's taut but rational script.The next hour is less engaging, when Joy and Jack reunite in the outside world, Jack meets his grandmother Nancy (Allen, a fresh welcome to high-quality cinema since she is so overdue for recognition) and grandfather Robert (Macy, a small cameo, but his reunion with Allen as a couple hits the nostalgic sweet spot) for the first time, although they have separated since the missing of Joy, the cognitive knowledge of the real world is a lengthy and time-consuming progress for Jack, but thankfully he has no sequelae of the captivity and it turns out fine for him. It is Joy, who is struggling with depression, anger and guilt, collapses in the real world, Jack becomes her sole strength to overcome her psychological hurdles and there is a brand new life awaits them.ROOM has an all-approaching, soul-touching story at its kernel, burnished with a brilliant cast (the film is unswervingly taking the stance from Jack's viewpoint, which does make Larson's Oscar- winning showcase less reverberating than in SHORT TERM 12, 2013, although Larson's tenacity and mastery of emotions are peerless), and a humble diegetic approach through a child's eye, it adamantly gives rise to a heartfelt sensation without sensationalising its characterisation, a singular accomplish under the belt of Abrahamson and the sterling teamwork.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film not expecting to like it. I am drawn to a different type of film. To say that I was blown away by this film is an understatement. This film is almost indescribable it's so good. This is the kind of film we get when everyone involved is at the top of their game. You can't just credit director Lenny Abrahamson, or screenwriter Emma Donoghue, or stars Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay, or composer Stephen Rennicks solely. This was a team effort. Brie Larson gives the bets acting performance of this decade as Joy/Ma, a mother lost at sea, metaphorically speaking. Jacob Tremblay gives a performance way beyond his years. The Academy made a serious mistake not nominating him for an award. Joan Allen, in what little screen time she has, gives one of, if not the most unappreciated performance of the year. Lenny Abrahmson has been quietly going about his business in Ireland. He certainly shocked most people with this film. His talent is undeniable and the Academy Award nomination was just the reward he warranted. Emma Donoghue's novel and script are both outstanding, and I believe that The Big Short was lucky to win the Adapted Screenplay award. Stephen Rennicks is a complete unknown in the world of film composing. I feel this may change. His work on this film is a revelation. The moment in this film where all the people named above are at their best is when Ma runs to the police car in which Jack is waiting. The slow-motion running is astounding. The music is extremely moving. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are as good as they were for the rest of the film. I don't know why I waited so long to see this film. I regret waiting to watch it and to anyone out there who wants to see the best film of 2015, or the decade, I urge you to stop reading this and go watch it. You will be better for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brie Larson gives an outstanding performance in this tale of a girl abducted, abused, impregnated, and what she had to overcome to keep her son alive. A young woman is abducted and then forced to live in a shed. The shed is soundproof and locked. Her assailant then gets her pregnant and she has the baby. The story begins after the child is now about 5 years old. The mother and son live in this one room shed. The kidnapper only shows up when he wants his way with the mother or brings food and supplies. They are given just the bare minimum to survive. When the abductor starts to see the child as a possible new direction for the abuse, she knows it is time to get the child out before it is too late. The script is well written. I believed every minute of what was going on and how it played out. I hope not to give too much away, but getting out of the "Room" is only half the movie. The other half is filled with deep emotional variances that take you across a broad spectrum of response to the situation. As a final note, a special nod of approval for the lady officer in the movie?very smart!</fullReview>

And that's exactly the case with Room.Child actor Jacob Tremblay stars as the five-year-old Jack, a boy who has spent his entire life enclosed in a single room with his mother. He's never met another person in his life. His only glimpse of the world outside of "Room" is a single skylight. He struggles to comprehend the fact that an entire world exists outside of Room. It's a tricky role for anyone, especially a young actor, to pull off, but Tremblay shines in the role. In fact, he more than just shines. He's out of this world, delivering a performance that feels almost too realistic. He's remarkably natural in such a difficult role. Tremblay may have a small presence in the literal sense, but his screen presence dominates almost every scene he's in. Jacob Tremblay is not just a cute kid (which he is) who was hired just to look cute and say cute things. His performance is one for the history books. But what recognition that Tremblay may have lacked for his role went instead to his almost as worthy co-star, Brie Larson. Larson, an actress whom I only really knew for her extraordinary work in the film Short Term 12 (another indie gem), stars alongside Tremblay as Joy Newsome, or "Ma," as our protagonist knows her. Joy, who was captured by a man known to us only as "Old Nick" at the age of 17, has been kept in that single room for seven years. She's been raped by her captor nearly every night she's been there. And she's had to raise her son all on her own, in one room, for five whole years. Talk about a difficult role to pull off. Yet Brie Larson was a more than perfect choice for the role. Joy is an emotionally tortured and damaged woman. Not only does she obviously suffer from severe depression (cruelly ironic for a character named Joy, don't you think?), but she has had to struggle with pure isolation and damaging abuse for seven long years. Her plight is nearly unimaginable -- yet, apparently, not for Brie Larson. The 26-year-old actress disappears into her pained, conflicted character. Larson exhibits both her character's powerful maternal love and care for her son, and Joy's internal struggle both inside and outside of Room. With two leads like these ones, it's honestly hard to believe that we're watching actors. They make it feel like we're actually watching a mother and her son, and they appear as if they've really been through their characters' ordeal. And a lot of their success has to do with how well they act together. As strong as they each are, I find it hard to believe that this movie could have had one without the other. They play off each other to perfection -- Tremblay follows Larson's each and every word, while Larson keeps up with Tremblay's energy and curiosity. Their chemistry is the core of this movie, and because it's so good, the movie works so damn well. These two outstanding lead actors are mostly to thank for the film's undeniably raw emotional power, but I can't discredit everyone else involved. Emma Donoghue wrote the screenplay as an adaptation of her own novel. I haven't read the novel (yet), but her script here is one of the best this year. The premise she created shows off great imagination and creativity, but perhaps more notably, she writes her characters' transition from Room to the outside world to perfection. It's a wonderful script flawlessly translated onto the screen by director Lenny Abrahamson. Abrahamson does it all in this movie. At one point, he has the entire audience confined into that one claustrophobic space with Joy and Jack. At another, he drives the audience (and Jack) out into the outside world in one of the most intense, powerful sequences I have ever experienced.What else is there to say? The score is magnificent. The cinematography is impressive. The supporting cast is solid. But all of that and more almost feels like an afterthought to all the emotion that this film hits you with. You grow attached to these characters and this story like few others. Room has you laughing and smiling when it's happy, on the edge of your seat and counting your breaths when it's tense and gripping, and on the verge of tears at it's most touching and cathartic. Is it cheap for a movie to rely on its audiences' emotions to be effective? Maybe. But when it does it this well, it's hard to forget.Room may be hard to get through for some. It's dark, it's realistic, and it brings up many questions that some of us may not want to ask ourselves. But from the perspective of an innocent young child, and with the story's emphasis on the unbreakable bond of love shared between mother and son, it's as uplifting and hopeful as a film with this subject matter can be. This story of adjusting to a new world and leaving an old one behind is hard to illustrate for those who have not been fortunate enough to experience yet. It's a tale that's absorbing like nothing else, and, in a way, almost strangely relatable. So if you haven't experienced Jack's incredible story yet, I'll just leave you with this one last quote that only begins to describe this film's message and power -- "You're going to love it," Joy tells her son as she prepares him for escape. "What?" asks Jack, curiously. "The world."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Room got nominated for lots of awards and there were people claiming that it's the best movie of the year. Moving into the movie with this hype, there is almost no way to not get excited.In my opinion the plot is separated into two parts. The first part is really interesting and causes you to think about lots of things, and this results into some more expectations. Pretty much every scene makes sense, until the part that Ma rolls Jack into the carpet. And then, everything goes the opposite way...When Jack goes into the truck, the second part begins. I thought the movie was starting to get really exciting and dramatic, but it never happened. I thought the movie can't be that simple. I even thought Jack was in a dream and everything was just the preview of what will happen. But he wasn't dreaming. The police immediately found out Ma, and the rest of the second part is pretty much boring.Now, i don't know if i'm unemotional or something, but i didn't get the dramatic side of it. I didn't feel what they experienced. The movie is just not good enough to tell it. Not to mention, there are lots of logical errors such as them not thinking about breaking the window. I know that there is a psychological part of it, and actually that's the point that i'm talking about, the movie just doesn't tell it well enough.If Jacob Tremblay wouldn't carry the movie by himself with his absolutely amazing acting, i would definitely give this movie a lower rating and say that it doesn't deserve an Oscar nomination. But he made the movie acceptable, even though i still think it's really overrated.6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thoroughly engrossing, beautifully scripted and exquisitely acted, this movie delivers on every level. Why on earth the young actor, Jacob Tremblay wasn't at least nominated for the Oscar is a mystery. He is spell-binding and completely believable in this role. And the whole movie pretty much centres on him. Brie Larson is perfect as Ma, and the small support cast are spot on. This is not an action packed movie, and it was clearly shot on a shoestring. Not a whole lot happens, but it is perfectly paced. If you have patience, you will be rewarded with a beautiful love story and a stunning character study. Well worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another modern day trend of the plot-less tale. Very pretentious! Oh yeah, in case you didn't know, kids are painfully bad actors!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a movie that is a overrated just a bit, because it isn't a bad movie, rather it just feels like a partially told story. It just ends randomly somewhere near the beginning of the body. It's very pretentious of the movie to feel as though it doesn't have to tell a story or tie up any loose ends because it alludes that there's some deep underlining theme going on that it's tracking instead, when in all actuality it's relatively mundane. Watching/listening to kids act is painful enough let alone making a young kid a lead in a movie. Very ambitious, yet insane to attempt it. At the end of the day you get your typical kid who can't act attempting to act and sound cute. And would you please cut the kids hair already. It was like watching that chick who comes out of the well in the Ring... spoiler - no wonder why the dad wouldn't look at the freaky looking kid. Speaking of which, another story line the show buries. Good news though, they cut the kids hair with about 5 minutes to spare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much more than (just a) Room</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-mild spoilers only- I have started writing this while still listening to the end music.This is not a normal review, this is not a story, these are just my feelings, 5 minutes after the pictures ended, hopelessly put on paper, or in this case, a digital writing box, for others to see and to hopefully relate to.Indelibly Tarkovskian imagery not necessarily in its cinematic pull-off, but in conveying what it wanted to, a compelling and complete story of hurt and recovery.The fact that there are two distinct parts to the whole, and that each one gets about an hour of elaboration, is just a testament to the profoundly empathetic way this story was told. The first hour or so deals with presenting Room, or, Earth, if you will, Jack's' one, that is, as aptly as his mother, the transcendent Brie Larson(Academy-backed affirmation FTW) managed to convey to her son, where distance is nothing more than repeatedly turning at walls, magic is people on TV and outer space is seen through a "skylight". The first ~60 minutes is where all the explaining, planning and escaping take part, and I for one, have to admit, I was left quite disappointed by the suddenness of it all. Truly, only at the end had I realized that the scars that living inside this prison for so many years left on its inhabitants could not be properly conveyed by keeping them stuck there the whole time and cutting to credits once they escaped and boy, was I in for a treat in the last 50 or so minutes of this film.The second part is where all the real magic happens, where we get to understand just how deep the pain is and what shocks Joy and Jack must swim through to breathe the air they breathe.What moved me to write this most is that the true miracles we pass by each day is not our freedom or our health even, mental or otherwise. It is our children. -The real title of this should be changes. The subtle leit-motif first presented by the doctor who took care of them when he said, "it's good that you brought him out while he (his brain) is still plastic" which is medical term for how well it can adapt to change.- We see Joy falling deeper and deeper intro depression while Jack consistently wraps himself around the world around him. He ultimately helps her(win an Oscar) heal with the wonderful magic of childhood, which is when we are open and everything is possible. I did not even like kids before seeing this. Now I can safely say that I understand why my married with kids friends say that children are true gifts from God. If we can do anything with this, we can learn from it. To never yield to our preconceptions, to act in spite of fear, to accept and to grow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why does one of the worst movies created only have 'The' in its title to differentiate itself from this extraordinary spectacle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw that a new trailer for a film called 'Room was released online, i had a shiver cast through my spine, dreading that it wasn't a remake, sequel, or re-release of the 2003 monstrosity that was 'The Room'. How relieved I was to find out it was actually about a mother and sons journey of escaping from the single, enclosed room where they were held captive in and then watching the 5 year-old 'Jack' adapt to the huge world we live in.The main structure of the film splits down into 2 parts; When they're inside 'Room' and when they've escaped. I completely felt for Brie Larsons 'Ma' having to raise a child who's only experiences in life have occurred inside 'Room'. Larsons performance was something that added so much emotional depth to her character as she manages to show the psychological damage 'Old Nick' (her kidnapper) has put her through. The 9 year old Jacob Tremblay added a believable performance from such a young actor who at times you really feel sorrow for. Then, when the riveting escape sequence is over, the film seems moved to its second half; The outside world. For me this felt like a complete shift in the films pass and tone, which I believe was a great decision as it was almost simulating how our protagonists felt when they were welcomed back into society. However, I really feel that, whilst the trailer didn't take anything away from the film for me, it would of been better not to of shown the fact that they became free of 'Room' Great performances from everyone, an deeply emotional tone, and an overall great film to watch.One of the best 2015 had to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Room</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Room is a simple story that will hit you hard. Brie Larson plays a young woman (Ma) who was abducted and has been held captive in 'Room' for 7 years, where she has subsequently given birth to her son Jack. Jack has never been out of Room and knows nothing else. We see how they cope in day to day life in Room, as the captor brings them basic rations every day. Throughout the film it is left to our imagination as to where exactly they are and what is the reason why. Jack believes that the outside world is non existent and anything he sees on TV is not real. Jack is key to their escape so Ma has to explain the situation very carefully to him in order for him to grasp that the outside world is indeed real. The pacing of the film is very good, we pretty much have two halves: the first half starts straight away with the pair in Room, we see them go through many different emotions in their fight for survival. Then they plan the escape (which if you have seen any trailer for the film you will know that they eventually escape anyway so it's not a spoiler). The second half of the film is about both of them adjusting to the outside world. Ma going back to family life and facing struggles as her father can't even look at Jack. Thankfully her mum and mum's boyfriend are much more supportive and really help Jack along the way. The acting is terrific throughout the film which gave it a lot of realism. I do wish that the film had perhaps been a bit more detailed, we could've had another 20-30 minutes which could've explained briefly how the captor took Ma, what exactly happened to him at the end and how he was caught, a few bits of news/interviews detailing the fact that she was missing, search parties for her, was anyone ever suspicious of him etc. And also a bit more of Ma and Jack as he was younger just to get a sense of even more struggle they went through and then perhaps a little segment at the end of him growing up in the world. All in all though it is certainly my favourite film of the Oscar nominees for best picture this year. 9/10 and highly recommended to all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is not much to say about a film like this. No complicated plot lines, no unnecessary character setups, just a well written story, a camera and a crew that understands what is going on.The acting is probably the best i have seen in years, at no point do you get thrown out of the story. Even though one could argue the filmcould be chopped in half, the acting is so consistent up into the tiniest roles, that at no point you feel like this isn't really happening. the emotional arc from the two leads is enormous, and as an audience you are in it the whole way. If Larson is perfect, then for Tremblay we need to invent a completely new word.The story reveals itself gradually, which is always brilliant as it keeps you busy on what exactly is going on. nothing is nicely 'explained' to you. to me this did not feel like a story but like a reality show, with a very grim topic all the way through. This is one of those lonely gems in film and let's hope prizes may rain on these actors, writer and director for their enormous efforts. I hope it won't be missed in the bulk of big budget nonsense we had to sit through this year. Don't hear about this film, go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything you'd expect from a critical darling 'Oscar hopeful'!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'ROOM': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The critically acclaimed dramatic thriller flick; directed by Lenny Abrahamson and written by Emma Donoghue (based on her 2010 novel, of the same name). The film is about a young mother, being held captive in a locked single-room, with her 5-year-old son. The boy has never known life, outside of the room; so his mother creates a complete alternate reality, inside the room for him. It stars Brie Larson and newcomer Jacob Tremblay, as the kidnapped mother and son. It also costars Sean Bridgers, Joan Allen and William H. Macy. The film is predicted to be a likely Oscar contender, come awards time, and it's received almost unanimously positive reviews, from critics. I liked it.Jack (Tremblay) is five-years-old, and he's been locked in a single- room, with his mother Joy (Larson), all of his life. He's never seen the world, outside of the room, and his mother has taught him 'room' is all there is. We later learn that Joy was kidnapped when she was 17, and her captor impregnated her, with Jack, five-years earlier. As Joy becomes even more desperate, to escape, she finally enlists Jack's help, in a dangerous plan. The film is really dark and depressing, but there's also a slight bit of hope (in the darkness). Larson is fantastic in the lead, and Tremblay is also amazing (especially for an actor so young). The movie is very moving, intense and heartbreaking; it's beautifully directed by Abrahamson, and brilliantly written by Donoghue. The film is basically everything you'd expect from a critical darling 'Oscar hopeful'. It's pretty hard to watch though, at times, but it's worth it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/MylbbGyo_MU</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was curious about this film due to many reviews and comments about Brie Larson's performance as well as its Oscars nominations. But I was very disappointed. The film left me indifferent. There was no connection to "Ma". I expected a genius acting by young actress judging by the hype, but it was average... Of course, it is difficult to act if one did not actually live it through and it is quite understandable.The only performance that is worth of nominations, from my point of view, is the one of a little boy. So, all in all it is very puzzling why this film and Brie Larson was even considered for Oscars or any other awards..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never heard about this movie (or the book on which is based) until I got a call from my cousin inviting me to see it. When I heard its name, my first reaction was "is it a horror movie?". And she explained that it wasn't and told me briefly the story. I'll try to tell as little as I can, because I believe one of the reasons this film had such a huge impact on me was precisely my lack of previous knowledge.Jack (Jacob Tremblay), a five-year old boy, lives with his mother Joy (Brie Larson) in a tiny room in precarious conditions. The boy has very long hair, is still breastfed, and sleeps inside the closet. Soon you realize they are not there by option: Joy was kidnapped 7 years before and Jack was born there, inside that room, which he believes to be the only thing that exists in the world. He has absolutely no idea that there is an "outside" behind the door.I had all the possible emotions while watching Room. I was sad, happy, angry, and nervous (almost having a heart attack during an specific scene). Even my cousin was on the edge of her seat and she already knew what was going to happen.Everything in this film is great, starting with the cast. Brie Larson is so perfect with her portrayal of a young woman who has been through such a trauma that I strongly believe she has real chances to be awarded for this role. Her character is so complex and she's able to transmit to us the sadness due to the situation and the happiness for having her son with her. And, of course, the boy! Jacob Tremblay is perfect and you can't help but feel both sorry and sympathetic towards him. He is so genuinely na?ve and oblivious of the bad (and good) things in the world that is impossible not to like him.Full review: http://wp.me/p5Rk4c-fB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Room is not as good as everyone says it is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Room stars Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. It offers Larson her best performance of her career and Tremblay a break out role. While he may not quite get past the whole "kid actor" stereotype he is admittedly better than almost every other child actor out there today. Both of these actors are receiving some serious awards buzz right now, as is this film in general. This may be due to the odd nature of its plot line. A mother and child are stuck inside a room for at least five years of their lives. Trapped inside never once going out to see or experience the world. So, when they get out we watch as this child gets to see everything for the first time.Yes it's an interesting plot that hasn't really been done before but it can't really pull it off. It's odd that it struggles so bad with making this a worthy adaption of the book seeing as the author actually wrote the film. Much like last years 'Gone Girl'. However 'Gone Girl' actually had a good director.The one other film this director had done was 'Frank'. So I had high hopes for this film. Unfortunately, he may have proved to us that he is a one hit wonder. Because this film is not near as good as everyone is saying. This mainly steams from sloppy writing. Writing that would've probably worked in a book format. In that format you are able to show characters thoughts and feelings far easier than in film so you have to write accordingly.But this doesn't happen. This is really the only reason this film fails. But it fails hard. From the first scenes of the film it was pretty clear that not enough thought went into making this a piece of cinema. Characters actions and reactions to everything feel absurdly artificial. Like a cop figuring out where the room they lived in was from one extremely vague sentence. Or how the film seems to pretend like these two had never made one single escape attempt.Literally the second escape they try gets them out. I couldn't help think that they had never actually tried, because the guy didn't even hesitate to buy into their trick. In fact not one person in this film reacts naturally. Everyone was an extreme version of a normal person and it made nearly everyone in the film super unlikable. Especially the main two characters. They did virtually nothing aside from scream at whoever they wanted for no apparent reason. Almost every conversation ended in an annoying screaming match between random people. A screaming match that either made no sense or just made you dislike the characters. So, when these two get out it's hard to legitimately care about them. You don't know anything about them other then the fact that they liked yelling for no reason.'Room' may have strong performances and an interesting idea to back it up but not much else. It has a hard time making you actually care about its characters. No one reacts like a human being but instead yells at each other when ever they feel like they need to. It wastes its best qualities with a limp and lifeless script that fails to appropriately adapt the acclaimed novel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'There are so many things out here. And sometimes it's scary. But that's OK. Because it's still just you and me...'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Emma Donoghue adapted her popular novel ROOM for the screen so we are assured the concept it contains are the original ones from her story of a kidnapped young girl sequestered in a shed, birthing a child by her abductor, and raising that child to accept his environs as real until the two breakout of the shed and encounter the world.Or as the company who created the film states, 'ROOM tells the extraordinary story of Jack (Jacob Tremblay), a spirited 5-year-old who is looked after by his loving and devoted mother Ma (Brie Larson). Like any good mother, Ma dedicates herself to keeping Jack happy and safe, nurturing him with warmth and love and doing typical things like playing games and telling stories. Their life, however, is anything but typical-- they are trapped--confined to a 10-by-10-foot space that Ma has euphemistically named Room. Ma has created a whole universe for Jack within Room, and she will stop at nothing to ensure that, even in this treacherous environment, Jack is able to live a complete and fulfilling life. But as Jack's curiosity about their situation grows, and Ma's resilience reaches its breaking point, they enact a risky plan to escape, ultimately bringing them face-to-face with what may turn out to be the scariest thing yet: the real world.The star of the film is Jacob Tremblay. Brie Larson does a credible turn as Ma and the 'outsiders' ? Ma's parents Joan Allen, William H. Macy and her kidnapper Sean Bridges ? carry their weight. The film is unnecessarily long and that need for editing diminishes the extraordinary impact of Jack as he discovers the real world. If young Canadian actor Jacob Tremblay secures the right agent he could become a very important actor in the future. The story concept is excellent and carries many messages to which we should all pay heed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To start up, I honestly haven't seen such a good movie as this one for a longer time. It is so emotional and heartbreaking watching those two, firstly in Room, then in the real world as well. I found interesting realizing the oscillations in getting used to the whole massive change between a grownup and a child. Freedom is relative, this movie proves it. So is space and boundaries. If you don't know what's on the other side of the wall and don't even know the other side even exists, you feel safe. You don't doubt your freedom at all. Jack felt like everything is happening with a reason, just the way it should be. His imagination made him believe that. It was also quite interesting watching how Jack's thoughts broadened up as time was passing by. I was surprised how well he adapted to new surroundings, unlike his poor mother. She was questioning herself a lot, every single day, got really overwhelmed and I saw her crash coming a few times throughout the movie. It's impossible not to feel sorry for her considering how strong and resilient she stayed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I respect this movie but... "Phoenix" was a date movie compared to this.Awesome acting, effective, grim.I complained to my wife on our way out of the theater and she said: "Oh, the book was darker." You've been warned!Don't go to a theater near a cliff as you may feel like jumping off.I realize neither cinema nor any art form should be all sunshine and flowers; I just want to put a warning label on this one.The cast was great. The production design and cinematography were very effective.If you want to scare your daughter out of ever talking to a stranger, take her to this movie.Ironically, she might go hide in the basement and refuse to come out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This is the story you get"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's the catch-22 with sexual violence: we need to talk about it, but we don't want to. Can you blame us? It's horribly omnipresent in society, but disturbingly easy to largely overlook out of convenience, between those shameful deniers who live in a sunshine-and-rainbow-unicorns world where only consensual sex happens, and those who are all too aware of the tragic rates of sexual assault, but wouldn't mind an understandable break from contemplating its awfulness. Factoring in all those folks, and the poor, article-challenged audiences wandering into the wrong screening carrying spoons and bellowing "YOU'RE TEARING ME APAAAAAAART, LISA!!!", it wouldn't be a surprise to consider Room a hard-sell as a carefree Friday night at the movies. Thankfully, Irish-Canadian author-turned-screenwriter Emma Donoghue has neatly nipped the paradox in the bud by extending the 'only poetry can properly explicate the hidden depths of trauma' maxim to the next level. Room is innately a powerful, necessary, even beautifully moving story of suffering, survival, resilience, and rebuilding. But filtered through the eyes of a child? A masterpiece. Situating five-year old Jack as narrator not only raises the stakes to almost unbearable dimensions - not only must they survive and escape, but Jack must not know - but gives us a far less graphic or painful 'indirect narrator' through which to focalize and make sense of the nuances of his and his Ma, Joy's imprisonment. Director Lenny Abrahamson allows Jack's whimsical boisterousness to shape the film, and the cameras and music mirror his exuberant attention span, bouncing around every corner of the enclosed set with the lilting dance of a surrealist fairy tale. Abrahamson imbues his film with such life that it's easy to empathize with Jack believing Room to be the entirety of existence beyond the fantasies of heaven and TV (and all without any of the tacky, exploitative FX interludes of Peter Jackson's take on The Lovely Bones). There is darkness here as well, even if Jack may not understand the full ramifications of the ominous creaking ensuing from the weekly visits from their grimy caretaker, but his accepting this as part of the fabric of life, in turn, makes it easier for us to bear as well, without lessening the traumatic context in the slightest. In fact, Abrahamson handles the first half of Room with such deft, immaculate precision that we're too busy in survival mode to fully let it all sink in. Cherishing each fleeting scrap of Jack and Ma's happiness, and bemoaning the petty squabbles which infest their relationship, there's almost a palpable feeling of "if we keep it together and hold on, they will too". It's only upon Jack's escape - and I dare you to find a more unbearably tense sequence in recent memory - and immersion into the overstimulating sensory flurry of an outside world he previously disavowed the existence of, that we start to feel release. It's only when we are given threads of hope to cling to - that Jack could bounce back, and actually be okay - that we, like Ma, are permitted to finally break, to let go, to grieve, and to rejoice. Donoghue's piercing, conversational screenplay teases out the ripple effects of Jack and Joy's release with gently unflinching care: the inevitable madhouse of paparazzi attention; Jack has no conception of how to play with toys, and requires sunscreen at all times due to his skin's lack of outdoor exposure; Joy's father, who cannot look at his grandson out of what he represents (wonderful William H. Macy at his most heartbreakingly earnest); her mother and new partner desperately striving for normalcy (the pristinely warm and sturdy Joan Allen and Tom McCamus). And just when we start clawing for a continual crescendo of hope, we're subjected to a talk show host interviewing Joy with a winsome, rage-inducing, abominable lack of tact Harry Potter fans will immediately associate with the similarly despicable Dolores Umbridge. Who knew Donoghue could conjure up a character more hateable than Joy's rapist. But, deft plotting and immaculate directing aside, Room as a triumphant two-hander. Brie Larson, having just closed an awards circuit with a hat-trick of accolades, still manages to exceed expectations with an incomparably brave performance, allowing her to play strong, vibrant, caring and clever, but brittle, frayed, and, essentially, very young - often all with a single look, or defeated slouch. Still, Room is Jack's story, and eight-year old Jacob Tremblay carries the film with an overwhelming talent unseen in almost any of his older contemporaries. There's never a moment of Jack that doesn't feel agonizingly real, and Tremblay's use of eye contact, or avoidance thereof, allows so much of a richer entry point into Jack's soul than even his endearingly shrill voice and fidgety physicality - he plays Jack as fundamentally unshowy and real, and is all the more captivating amidst the absurd circumstances he's surrounded by. It's arguably the most impressive performance of the year, and will unquestionably stand the test of time as one of the most powerful child actor performances ever captured on film. Unassuming and harrowingly stripped-down, hugely emotional, yet never false or saccharine, Room was a quieter entry into the 2015 awards circuit, yet by far the year's most haunting and essential work. It's utterly devastating, and yet, in unexpected ways, also certain to make your world a little brighter. When we, alongside Jack and Joy, say "bye" to Room, it's with a similar mixture of a heavy heart, tears, and unsettling regret that we let go of a world so horrific yet beautiful. Room reminds us to appreciate and cherish what's dear - and where better to start than with such an unforgettably human piece of cinema. -10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartwarming or heartbreaking? You decide.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After finishing the book a mere couple days ago, I went to watch the movie adaptation of Room.On the whole, I was very pleased with what they did with the story even if, as usual, I prefer the book version. Some things just brought more depth and realism to the characters.I felt this especially with Jack's transition to the real world. Whereas in the book the boy felt terrified and in shock for most of the time, in the movie it was almost as if he was just surprised and curious, even if a bit shy. On the other hand, Ma didn't come across as the huge role model as in the book, even selfish at times, which I found very true to such a character's development.Pretty much all the characters were different in one way or the other, which was OK for most except for Old Nick, as I felt he came across as much too humane.At the end of the day, there are so many little details in the book that make the experience so special and something else entirely. Also, there's the fact that it is entirely told by Jack. You see everything through his eyes and even when he is describing something completely ordinary you have to stop and figure out what it is because he describes it in such a different way. That can't really happen in a movie, not to that degree, because you base what you are watching on your own notions. He still narrates it from time to time so you can appreciate it, just not on the same level.Considering all the difficulties involved in bringing this story to the big screen, I feel it was a job very well done and definitely recommend it, whether you have read the book or not. This is not a theme for the faint-hearted and I felt it was handled with respect by the author and now by the director. I am so happy that the author's input was taken in so much account when making this movie. You can tell.The performances were breath-taking. I can't believe a little boy can act like that, even if he was probably 8 or 9 years old at the time. I have to admit I shed a few tears on more than one occasion. This is a heart-warming and heartbreaking story all at once, just like the book's.In a time when it seems so difficult to go to the movies and find something special to watch, this one is definitely a pearl in the middle of the ocean.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Heart-Warming Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't really have any big expectations when going into 'Room' - I initially thought it looked like one of those Oscar bait titles that tries way too hard to be emotionally powerful and becomes an overdone melodrama. However, after seeing a few scenes and realising that it's directed by Lenny Abrahamson (previously having directed the quirky masterpiece known as 'Frank') it intrigued me, and started to look like a lot more than just typical Oscar bait... and thankfully, it was. This is one of those beautiful films that manages to capture the strength of love and the importance of family, as well as reminding us that the less we have, the more we appreciate.'Room' tells the story of a devoted mother's relationship with her five-year-old son, Jack, who has been living in an enclosed 'room' ever since he was born. This is essentially the boy's whole world for the first five years of his life, which immediately establishes the mother as a strong and loving character with the determination to bring up her son properly, providing him with happiness and creativity despite their harsh living conditions. Abrahamson often incorporates tight framing and close-up shots here in order to signify how restricted these characters are in a physical sense, yet how open they are emotionally - making for some genuinely heartfelt interactions. This is where the film succeeds, seeing a realistic relationship between a loving mother and her young son is truly heart-warming, especially if you take their limited surroundings into consideration. Even when the tone switches and tension is built up, realism is still maintained, the characters feel just as engaging, and the overall atmosphere is handled pretty well throughout.Unfortunately, despite how well these interactions work, the focus always leans towards the character of Jack and his perspective of the world, with segments featuring narration from the little boy himself as he adjusts and learns about the real world for the first time. This basically provides us with the typical portrayal of children in films like this - innocent, naive and somewhat cute... and although there isn't anything wrong with the execution of this, it's nowhere near as captivating as the actual relationship between the mother and the son. After a while, the film starts to slightly lose focus in general, by including some drama which felt somewhat forced and unnecessary. However, these are just minor flaws in the grand scheme of things.In terms of cinematography, the film seems to switch between Dogme 95 style filming (handheld/steadicam) and standard static shots, which feels quite inconsistent in terms of style, but works pretty well regarding the atmosphere being conveyed. When it comes to acting, everyone pulled off a magnificent job; Brie Larson winning an Oscar for this role was well-deserved, and although I'm not really a fan of child actors (they can either be great or just really cringe-worthy), I thought Jacob Tremblay was pretty fantastic in his role. All in all, this is a heart-warming story with some phenomenal performances and beautiful sequences that will undoubtedly tug at your heartstrings, which is why I'm giving this film a very strong 8,4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jacob Tremblay was incredible. Despite what age he is, it was one of the best performances I've ever seen. Such range in his performance, and he maintained the innocence that his character holds which was what made this movie so touching, creating moments of joy, amusement and tears. Definitely should have been Oscar-nominated. Jack only knew a life inside one room with one person. Watching how he experienced this whole new world was captivating - opening up to new faces, walking on different surfaces, seeing animals/trees/everything for the first time... I think both actors portray very realistic and believable performances of adjusting to this new life. It's a story of their strong bond, how both give each other strength and courage. It was a very emotional film - I cried several times throughout. It's definitely a film that will stay with you. Beautifully acted. Emotional. A must-see movie. (Remember the tissues!)</fullReview>

WE need to remember how lucky we are? just think of that the next time you're complaining about what ever you're complaining about (same goes for me, I need to stop complaining about the weather situation..). This is not based on a true story thankfully. It's heartbreaking but so good. And the Cast is one of the best I've seen in a while. Brie and Jacob are just amazing, two really great actors, who were meant for this film. Also kind of glad that they didn't focus on showing us all these horrible experiences the mom (brie) has to go through, I mean you know that they're happening, but what we get to see is this strong mom fighting for her and her sons life and It's more from Jacobs point of view which makes it more pleasant to watch. If that makes sense? I can't elevate this film, cast and crew enough. JUST GO watch it already! Words to help describe this film: isolation, escape, heartbreaking, breathtaking, lego, family.I absolutely loved it, a lot because of Brie and Jacob (and who am I kidding- also the compelling story of course)I give it 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A child's impression of captivity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A woman and her child are locked in a room. The child is a boy, though his distracting long hair and feminine features suggest otherwise, and the room is his entire world. Room depicts his perspective as his world changes. Although the movie works on an emotional level without feeling too manipulative, I disliked the scenario and was bothered by the questions it raised. How believable is the main characters' captivity, the extent of their trauma, and their attempts to escape it? I have my doubts, but I think the audience is supposed to be too in awe of their maternal bond to care. I, however, wanted a little more intelligence from the tantrum-prone duo. The mother is saved by a five-year-old with a facile understanding of his environment. Ignorance is bliss, I suppose, but let's not pretend it's lovely or enlightening. One could argue the mother protects her son's purity, but even this seems a matter of luck given her limited control over the situation. I guess I can't abandon my intellect to appreciate a child's innocence, especially when it could have been more effectively preserved by a little adult cleverness.Rating based on five factors, each worth up to two points: Sound: 1.5; Acting/Characterization: 2; Script: 1; Visuals: 1; Concept: 0.5Total: 6</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saddest movie you will see this year. And I'm not talking tear-and- tissue sad, I'm talking bury-a-hole-and-crawl-into-it sad. Beyond words, but let's give it a try.Room?Joy Newsome (Brie Larson) was kidnapped when she was seventeen years old and locked up in a shed, left completely at the mercy of her kidnapper. Two years later she bears a son, called Jack (Jacob Tremblay). Not being able to leave 'Room', as she calls it from then on, Joy decides to raise him in that tiny enclosed space, as if it were the only place in the world. This is the devastating story of a mother and her son; who, for five years, literally only have each other. And how they're able to continue their life after that.Jack's storyI can't even make a joke about this. This might very well be one of the most uncomfortable movies I have ever seen. Especially during the first half; I was constantly cringing and my heart was racing. Which is weird because there is nothing explicit to cringe at nor is there a lot of suspense to get nervous about. Everything about this film excels at telling a story but without showing it. It's something you have to see for yourself because however difficult it is to watch, it is also extremely compelling. The way Jack narrates their lives as a story, talks about items in Room as persons and how they spend their time everyday. But especially how Joy creates a world, within a room, for Jack to grow up in; out of reach for 'Old Nick', as they call him.There is this one scene where all you see is five-year-old Jack, hidden in the wardrobe, listening to the creaking of the bed and just counting. But you know what is happening and the filmmakers even make it look like it's an everyday routine. It's Room's strongest feat, an uneasiness that creeps in and stays for the rest of the film.Of course all of this would amount to nothing without a stellar cast. Brie Larson as Joy Newsome is nothing short of excellent; in between her boundless love and dedication towards Jack, she shows a constant air of frustration, dread and desperation. The film's creators are brutally honest about this too; she's not a saint, she's a mom.The real revelation however was Jacob Tremblay as Jack. Working with child actors is never easy and that goes double for a role like this, but this kid gets it. You don't just feel sorry for him, you feel with him. To the point that Tremblay's character almost feels familiar. Which might sound effed up, considering the situation, but everyone has their 'Room'.ConclusionSeemingly effortless, Room will touch you and Room will hurt you. Director Lenny Abrahamson made a brilliant piece of cinema that is not easy to watch and even harder to forget.How to watch? -surrounded by your loved ones, on any screen Score: 8/10For more reviews go to www.blaudruk.org</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts strong but slowly loses focus as it drifts aimlessly towards the end.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The crime of kidnapping and extended captivity is well known through media exposure that sensationalises the psychological horrors of confinement in claustrophobic spaces. The dependency of some victims on an abusive captor or prison is just one of the many strange twists found in captivity stories. But this one is different because it is narrated through the eyes of five- year old Jack who was born in a fortified shed with only a small overhead skylight visually connected to what is outside his world called Room. His mother was abducted at seventeen and has been a captive for seven years, raising Jack as best she can in a co-dependent relationship that shines beautifully in their small prison. When tormentor Nick loses his job she knows he will not keep them alive, and that's when the slow-paced narrative opens predictably towards a fast world full of frighteningly wonderful sights and sounds and feelings expressed through the naivety of a newborn five-year old.This film would not work without the emotionally intelligent acting of Jacob Tremblay as Jack. Being almost ten and convincingly presenting as half his age is nothing short of remarkable. He describes his new world through wide eyes and lyrical words that capture the exploding space into which he is thrust, and he alone holds this film together. As Ma, Brie Larson's acting fixates on maternal dynamics at the cost of a convincing portrayal of captivity trauma. The scene where Jack and Ma re-visit Room after Nick is caught has all the nonchalance of strolling through a museum, as the story winds down from the highs of a taut psychological thriller to a modest melodrama. It is after all a film that strives for insight, not entertainment, while remaining true to the book upon which it is based. It does this thoughtfully in the first half, but slowly loses focus as it drifts aimlessly towards the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So brilliantly conceived and performed it's almost as if you were viewing a documentary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Emma Donoghue's novel, inspired no doubt by the likes of the Josef Fritzl case in Austria, 2008, has been rewritten by the author herself for the screen. It's a mighty challenging undertaking and benefits to some degree by not being 'based on a true story' even if the inspiration was so obviously horrifically apparent.It tells the tale of a young mother, credited as 'Ma' but actually known as Joy (how ironic) played to Oscar winning standard by Brie Larson and her five year old son, Jack, who was born in captivity some time after Joy was absconded by a man entrapping her with the aid of a sick puppy.Thus begins Joy's nightmare. At some point Jack is conceived at the hands of her rapist jailer, Old Nick, played by Sean Bridgers. (It's a casting that may have given him some personal nightmares because he's not what you could describe as a sympathetic character). It's fair to say that although Ma tolerates Nick's visitations, she has to to protect her child and to be fed, no Stockholm Syndrome has developed.The movie begins on or around Jack's fifth birthday. Jack has never left the room in which he was conceived and into which he entered his insular world. He knows no place other than this, has never experienced any weather (or air even), never played with other children, never been admonished for fear of upsetting a very delicate ecology between him, his mother and the 'room' where they live.Aside from the nightly visitations of Old Nick for the daily rape of his mother he knows no other human being.Ma and Jack have a TV, so Jack has a perverse awareness of the 'world' but it's seen through juddering images and is as real to him as martians are to you and I.But somehow Ma and Jack soldier on.We catch them at the end of Ma's tether. After five years of protecting Jack from the fact that they live in a parallel existence she's decided it's time for the facts of life and so begins a plan to escape. You'll have seen the trailers so you'll know that ultimately the escape bid is successful and so begins the painful psychological process of leaving an almost feral yet totally sheltered existence into a world that's overwhelming.Relationships in the family have moved on in the years since Joy's disappearance. Mum and Dad, although both still alive cope in very different ways. The media go mad for the story, Joy finds the whole thing extremely difficult to cope with and we spend a very moving hour or so watching them come to terms with an existence that's completely alien to Jack and totally overwhelming for Joy. This is a life affirming movie. It's directed with great skill and sensitivity by Lenny Abrahamson and in Brie Larson and five year old Jacob Tremblay we can pretty much believe that this is not fiction but very real reality.A remarkable film that deserves all the awards that are about to come its way.Deep respect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing, Disturbing, Haunting Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Room deserves to receive Best Picture this year. Hands down Room deserves to win. Forget The Revenant, which is an absurdly violent study in male macho-masculinity with only one woman character for a split second who is being raped.Room is a profoundly deep film told from the perspective of both a young woman and her child born unto her in captivity via being a hostage sex slave. The film tells much of the story from the eyes of an innocent 5 year old who knows only this Room and his Ma. The young woman does an amazing job holding it together to take care of her young child. It is a story of human survival, motherly love and the ultimate strength and goodness of (most) people.There are so many layers to this movie. I felt for everyone. The story of the young woman (Brie Larson) is rather downplayed. There was so much more to tell about her - how did she endure the nightly (or near nightly rapes), how did she give birth by herself in this Room, how did she manage on so many levels? I also felt for her parents, it would be hard to accept this child, the child born from rape and forced impregnation. She was a 17 year old, a little girl, the last time her parents saw her, now she is a woman with a child born from these circumstances.The perspective of the child is fascinating. Never having seen "the world." Knowing only his Ma. So innocent.This movie is disturbing and haunting. I left the theater thinking about it off and on for the next several days. Thinking through all the complexity of what she (Ma / Brie Larson) went through and her parents and all sorts of things.Somehow, for such a horrific subject, the film manages to bring out the positive in how hard a woman can fight for survival, how strong she can be to take care of her child. It is an amazing film. It's heavy and heartbreaking but it's also beautiful.It deserves all the awards!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily One of the Best Movies of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie with some excitement. The trailers didn't make it out to be that great of a movie (originality-wise), but the ratings said otherwise. I am happy to say that this movie surpassed all my expectations and then some. The plot of Room is one that we've seen before. While it's not horribly original, it's presented much differently than you'd expect. It's more mature than others, and much more personal. The idea of someone living their life away from society and suddenly being exposed to it again is typically used in a more comedic or 'big picture' way. Room deals with the transition in a much more personal way, and it makes way more sense. The characters spend most of their time indoors, dealing with the new problems of living outside of a single 10 by 10 foot room, and there still feels like there's a reason for it. It really is quite a beautiful story, despite how unhappy that it can be. The characters are brilliant, and the obvious driving force of the movie. Considering for the first hour or so we've only been exposed to three people you really get to know them well. But what are great characters without great actors to portray them? Luckily, Brie Larson as Ma and Jacob Tremblay as Jack are both fantastic. For a child actor Tremblay is phenomenal, and really sells his character. Larson is fantastic too, playing a single mother who's not exactly in the best shape. Everyone else is great too, but the two main protagonists stand out the most. The first thing I noticed about this movie was the realism. From the opening to the end, everything felt real. Emotionally, it was real (I've already stated that), but it was also visually real. The characters looked real. At the beginning of the movie Ma has a bit of acne, and that really stood out to me. Finally, a movie where people don't have make-up coating their face so that they appeal more to the audience. Brie Larson looked her part, she had acne, bags under her eyes, bad hair. She didn't look like she was trying to impress anybody, which is because she wasn't. This is something that I don't think I've ever seen in a movie, where people look bad and it's never part of the story or addressed or anything, and it really adds the level of immersiveness in the film. This movie is very emotional. And I don't mean that there's just some climatic sad part at the end, it's spread out. Throughout the movie I felt myself on the brink of tears, and that was with resistance. It brought me closer to crying than any other movie that I've ever seen. Overall Room is absolutely amazing. It's one of the few movies I've seen where not a thing about it has bothered me. I found no flaw in this movie, making it easily one of the best movies of 2015, if not the best movie of 2015. It's realistic and unique, something that so many movies seem to lack. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone, whether your interested or not.</fullReview>

In fact, Lifetime did a more interesting version of the story recently. The lead performances are forgettable. At no point in watching these characters did I feel like I was watching a special performance. The mother's performance was muted. There was no emotion in her. I felt the like the son was cookie-cut out of the "Michelle" from "Full House" role. We are supposed to think to ourselves, "Oh isn't he cute as a button," "doesn't he say the funniest things you ever heard" and "isn't he so aware of his situation and who he is." Suspense never builds. The movie ultimately is long and boring. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Room was tedious from the very beginning. And then it got more tedious. And then it kept on going. And though I waited for something to happen, it didn't. Then something did happen, and I thought, "Oh, joy. It's finally over." But alas, it wasn't over. It kept going. And going. And going.Though I had one or two moments where I thought it was cute or interesting, that's not enough to fill out a 2-hour movie. The kid was annoying, the mom was forgettable, the circumstances held no true sense of danger or tension, the aftermath was boring and trite. It might've worked as a 15-minute short film, but good lord, after sitting through it, I felt as though *I* had been trapped in a tiny room for 7 years.I honestly don't understand what people are seeing in this film. There is truly nothing of worth there. Avoid, unless you enjoy things like waiting in line for hours or going over your taxes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although brutal at times, credit has to be given to The entire cast of Room for churning out one of the Masterpieces of this generation. Brie Larson has done a career defining role who i firmly Believe deserves every award this season but the ultimate acting "masterclass" at such a tender age has to be the kid playing her son. Imagine discovering whole world again right from the Beginning like you did when you were a kid. Remember the first time you saw a dog ? The First time you saw trees ? The first time you made a friend ? The first time you left your mom ? This movie shows subtleness of mom- child relationship in such a beautiful way that it Forced even a heartless beast like me cry. The movie never drags, is unapologetically intense Cinematography makes you feel like a 5 year Old again. The direction is immaculate and Script is powerful. Probably one of the best movies of 2015 ! Must watch :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well that was a waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Typically you expect dramatic productions to have some sort of resolution, a satisfying denouement or if nothing else at least some intriguing moments with characters, dialogue and scenery that capture the imagination.Room offers none of that, relying wholly on two main conceits to carry the entire weight of the story. Beyond the first act this film is interminably dull and by the end of it I found myself thinking "what the f**k was that it".While it avoids being offensively bad, Room is still not an enjoyable watch. Best avoided.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Toilet. Wardrobe. Bed. Bath. Chair One. Chair Two. I have deliberately left out pronouns because that is the way 5 year old Jack refers to the items in his tiny world, all he has ever known, a single room he occupies with his young mother who was snatched on her way home from school as a teenager 7 years ago and has been imprisoned in 'Room' ever since. 'Ma' has managed to bring Jack up in this bizarre environment in as healthy a way as she can, she has obviously taught him to read and write with the limited resources in 'Room', she makes a game of exercise, with Jack giggling and running from one end of 'Room' to the other. Her captor put a small TV in 'Room' at some point, and Jack sees all the things on it as a great fantasy. There is nothing outside of 'Room' to Jack. Jack and Ma make a birthday cake for Jack's 5th birthday, but he wonders why there are no candles on it. Every evening 'Old Nick', which is the name Ma and Jack have given her captor, visits 'Room' and rapes her. We see this through Jack's eyes from the slats of the wardrobe he sleeps in. This film is not afraid to ask a lot of its audience. Jack has temper tantrums and Ma has 'gone days' when she doesn't manage to get out of bed. On 'gone days' Jack entertains himself, just like on the outside world. There are short bursts of narration from Jack telling us what he understands of his existence. For reasons I would rather allow you to discover for yourself, Ma decides that it is time for quite risky attempts for her and Jack to escape from 'Room', so she starts to plant ideas in Jack's head about the outside world, she points out a leaf that falls on the skylight and Jack says 'but it's not green like on TV'. Ma hatches a plan for them to escape but crucial to her idea is Jack pretending to be ill. She coaches him on what he must do to convince Old Nick that he must go to a hospital. This first attempt at freedom fails, so she comes up with another plan. She coaches Jack again, and in a sequence of agonising suspense, Jack does get away. I'm giving nothing away telling you all this, because this is the point at which the film really spreads its wings (this much has been suggested in the trailers). The early scenes, although beautifully played, are merely set up for what follows. Ma's relationship with her own parents and a devoted family friend, Jack's discovery of everything outside of 'Room' and his growing fondness for his grandmother (the sublime and criminally underrated Joan Allen). Ma's father (William H Macy) cannot bring himself to look at Jack and we are not told why, which feels right. We don't need to be bashed over the head with what he is thinking. The questions raised are emotionally complex, staggering. What of the power of unconditional love a child has for it's mother? Ma questions her ability as a parent and Jack's response is simply 'But you're Ma'. How do we come to accept the point at which a child no longer completely depends on us as parents? Why do we find it so difficult to reconcile feelings of being trapped and tormented in our minds when we are physically free? It is so refreshing to see a film that doesn't make announcements about what it wants to say or signpost it's big moments. They just happen. I am loathe to point out any particular scene in a film which unfolds so fluidly but there are two, you will know them when they come, where I dare you, DARE YOU, not to be an emotional wreck. I am normally pretty good at keeping myself together when I go to the cinema, but when the credits rolled here I had to rush to a toilet to compose myself before I left the building. The great film critic Roger Ebert once said 'It's not what a movie is about, it's how it is about it'. This film's director, Lenny Abrahamson, understands this completely. I could describe every single scene and divulge every plot detail and I truly believe doing so would not make seeing it any less meaningful. The film is that good. The balance of subtlety and poignancy is perfect. The music is incidental and subtle, the camera angles, particularly in the early cramped scenes, are largely from Jack's point of view, to great effect. This film even goes to the trouble of managing the viewer's suspension of disbelief by paying heed to the fact that Jack would not have been exposed to normal bacteria having been holed up in a small room for so long.Ma is played by Brie Larson in a performance of such astonishing power and naturalism that I am reminded of Charlize Theron in 'Monster' and Meryl Streep in 'Sophie's Choice'. The Academy has nominated four other actresses for the Oscar out of nothing more than politeness this year.Jack is played by a child actor called Jacob Tremblay. A child actor depends greatly on their director and co-actors. I can only assume that during the filming of 'Room', he was nurtured and guided with great love and care, and I am amazed that he has not become the second youngest person to be nominated for an Oscar.Joan Allen and William H Macy, who played parents together before in 'Pleasantville', are both excellent here.Out of IMDBs top 250 films, I have seen 135 and rated four of them 10 stars. If 'Room' ever makes it into IMDBs top 250, it will be my fifth 10 star film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Room, in my opinion an incredibly moving story of the relationship between a young Son, 5 years old, and a Mother living in, for the Mother, dreadfully stressful conditions. The acting in this movie, by the principals, was superb, and I was totally stunned by the performance of Jacob Tremblay as the Son; this show would be well worth seeing if for nothing more than to see Jacob's performance. While likenesses of the circumstances depicted in the film have come to light in the real world in recent years, one feels that the Director may well have touched very close to the emotions and feelings of the victims in such situations I enjoyed to the utmost everything about the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw Room finally. Saw it because it had Oscar nominations and did not really read about it before I went to see it. So I was lost watching it first. I tried to understand why this woman and the child were so poor and lived in a room which was bedroom, bathroom and kitchen and living room and never seemed to go out. Slowly it dawned on me that they were held captive by Old Nick and that the child had never seen the outside world, but knew television and some books and stories told by his mother. I was fascinated. Somehow the film succeeded in making me identify with every character in that movie. I tried to imagine what I would have done or thought if I would have been the mother, the child, Old Nick, the grandmother and grandfather, the partner of the grandmother . I loved the movie. I loved the performances. I loved how it make me think and feel and imagine living in a world reduced to a room . I loved the art the two captives were creating and the love they had for each other. Some people obviously find this movie boring, I was captivated from beginning to end. Awestruck really.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the searing novel by Emma Donaghue, "Room" is a movie both disturbing and compelling. For five-year-old Jack (amazing Jacob Tremblay), Room is his home, a 11 x 11 foot shed where he was born, after his teenaged mom (Brie Larson, in her Academy Award winning role)?was kidnapped, imprisoned and sexually assaulted daily by Old Nick.Told from the little boy's point-of-view, Jack seems unaware that Room is a prison. For Jack it is his home, a seemingly safe haven filled with all he knows and with the security of the only parent he knows. Jack's world is exclusively his Ma and Room. They share a bed, toilet, bathtub, and old television. The only window is a small skylight. In this sealed environment, Ma heroically tries to shelter Jack from their circumstances: telling stories, creating toys from egg shells, and weaving imagination into their daily routine. Room seems normal for Jack since he knows nothing else. Read my entire review at: unhealedwound.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>-Room is a 2015 Canadian-British-Irish drama film directed by Lenny Abrahamson and written by Emma Donoghue, based on her novel of the same name. The film stars Brie Larson, Jacob Tremblay, Joan Allen, Sean Bridgers, and William H. Macy. Held captive for seven years in an enclosed space, a woman (Larson) and her 5-year-old son (Tremblay) finally gain their freedom, allowing the boy to experience the outside world for the first time.-Room premiered at the Telluride Film Festival on September 4, 2015 and had a limited release in the United States on October 16, 2015. It was nominated for four Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director for Abrahamson, Best Actress for Larson, and Best Adapted Screenplay for Donoghue. Larson also won several awards, including the Academy Award, BAFTA Award, Critic's Choice Award, Golden Globe Award, Independent Spirit Award, and the Screen Actors Guild Award.--Critical reception: -Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 94%, based on 229 reviews, with an average rating of 8.5/10. The site's critical consensus states, "Led by incredible work from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay, Room makes for an unforgettably harrowing ? and undeniably rewarding ? experience." Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 86 out of 100, based on reviews from 43 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".-Eric Kohn of Indiewire stated, "Brie Larson and newcomer Jacob Tremblay('s)... textured performances turn outrageous circumstances into a tense and surprisingly credible survival tale."

		<fullReview>RoomTo catch child abductors, the police should be staking out Home Depot's sex-dungeon department.Unfortunately, the captor's enclosure in this drama was preexisting.Raised by his mother, Joy (Brie Larson), in a backyard shed belonging to the man who abducted her when she was a teenager, five-year-old Jack (Jacob Tremblay) is completely unaware of life beyond the room where she and he are imprisoned.After a successful escape, the two try to acclimate to outside life. This includes reconciling with Joy's now-divorced parents (Joan Allen, William H. Macy) and dealing with the media's victim shaming.The most frightening yet life-affirming films in years, this character-driven adaption of the novel will resonate with views, not only for its brave performances, but also for Jack's alien-like viewpoint of the world we take for granted.Ironically, the shut-ins discovered that everyone in the outside world was being held captive in a virtual prison.

		<fullReview>As a child as a result of a situation like Jack I can relate. The story is powerful, emotional, and heartwarming. At its depth it's a simple story of a moms love for her son, and the bond that they share. A story that will always stand the test of time.&nbsp;Jack (Jacob Trembly) gives us an amazing performance. Kid actors are hard to come by. And good ones are rare, and ones where the entire story revolves around one is next to impossible. Jacob does an amazing job as this kid who has no clue what the world is. Most kids can do an OK job at acting a kid. But he is ten, he is obviously past this age. But it's never a time they remember, so they have nothing to draw from. That's what makes this performance impeccable, it's genuine creativity at its absolute.&nbsp;Ma (Bri Larson) is outstanding. The only flaws I would have are just nitpicking. There were some lines I didn't like how they were delivered. But I'm not a Mom, I'm. It Ma, maybe that's how she talks. The movie did a great job of putting us in the situation.I love the changing perspective. With seems focused on Ma, and others just From jack. We get a carousel point of view that flows well.&nbsp;My one major complaint about this movie is it has a pretty cookie cutter ending. It was a predictable ending and one that brought a close that was to easy. This is the same ending as the book. But I wished the author and director came up with a new ending. But it doesn't stop me form giving it a perfect score. I love this movie, I love these characters, and I can't to watch their stir again.</fullReview>

I became frustrated during certain scenes; I felt like I was right there with the characters. I knew how the characters felt. I understood where their emotions were coming from, it's all very powerful, tragic, and sad#6. During the course of the movie, I felt moments of sadness, sorrow, and joy#7 My eyes were glued to the screen during the entire run timeNegatives:#1. William H. Macy doesn't get enough screen timeHonestly, I have nothing bad to say about this movie.A child never truly understands the world around them. It's the parents responsibility to nurture their children. Most people are products of their environment. Learning always starts at home. What is the right way and what is the wrong way of things. People only do what they think is the right thing. Others may not see things the same way as others. It all boils down to a persons perspective. In my opinion, don't try and hide your children from the world, because eventually the world will find them. You can protect your children and keep them away from things that you believe are unsafe, there's nothing wrong with that, however, make sure that you explain both sides of the coin thoroughly. As I say, a child's mind is a terrible thing to waste. Children are our future, their fragile, and their full of life. Don't poison or destroy their minds because it may affect them mentally in the future. I truly believe that children are more in touch with humanity than adults are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this on BluRay at home. First-rate picture and sound.This movie can't really be commented on without the SPOILERS so anyone reading this before seeing "Room" might want to defer.The movie is roughly divided into two halves, the first half with the mom and son in the small 11X11 room with only a skylight, no windows, where they have been together for almost 5 years. The captor brings them food and supplies, he has sex with her regularly, with the boy in a closet. The boy still nurses, no doubt as a natural form of birth-control. We witness the boy's 5th birthday.The second half examines the trauma of someone seeing the outside world for the first time after studying about it from books, drawings and TV images. Encountering people, encountering wide open spaces. Plus the trauma of a young woman returning to her real world and family after perhaps the most trying ordeal a young girl can go through, kidnapped as a teenager, kept in a storage shed, having a baby, raising that baby to a little boy.Brie Larson is Joy, known by the little boy only as Ma. She won the Best Actress Oscar for her performance. Jacob Tremblay, who was probably 7 during filming, is Jack just turning 5. The book and then movie were clearly inspired by the several news stories over the recent past where something similar happened in real life. It is fiction but still a very interesting examination of how that situation might play out.</fullReview>

It was so so good too good for the second half in my opinion too good for the second half to reach that height again. The second was maybe a little bit slower but the story was so great that it is so much enjoyable. This movie was beautiful not like The Revenant (2015) beautiful but it was indie beautiful. Well done Brie Larson you got the Oscar and you are great. Jacob Tremblay blew it out if the park. They had so much chemistry to each other. My problem though is the second half.

		<shortDescription>'Room' effectively transports viewers into its characters' shoes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although less commercially driven, "Room" is to 2015 as "Gone Girl" was to 2014: An acclaimed film based on an acclaimed book adapted for the screen by the author that takes the viewer into deep, psychologically troubling places. Obviously, "Gone Girl" is a mystery thriller with a creepy darkness to it, while "Room" is more of a trauma study, but both stories also center on fictional characters at the center of a huge media story.Jack (Jacob Tremblay) lives in 'Room' with his Ma (Brie Larson). 'Room' is all Jack has ever known, but after his fifth birthday, his mom decides to try explaining to him the truth ? there is a world outside of 'Room' and they need to get out. Writer Emma Donoghue gives us this story through Jack's eyes as much as possible, and director Lenny Abrahamson ("Frank") does an excellent job flowing back and forth between Jack's idealistic view of 'Room' and the dark, terrifying real-world circumstances of it, and he continues this balance of perspectives in the film's very different post-'Room' second half.That's where Larson comes in in a very complicated role, because there's a tangible separation between the viewer and Ma, the adult who has endured this trauma. In most cases, she would be the easier character to relate to, but this is Jack's story. Larson has to communicate an absolute roller coaster of emotions without the film focusing a ton of attention on her. She succeeds in being easy to relate to despite our lack of knowledge and insight into her character, outside of the fact that she's undergone an unfathomable trauma.Tremblay doesn't give one of those child performances for the ages, but his job as Jack is to evoke the child within all of us because he's a child narrator/main character in a story for adults. He acts with incredible authenticity, creating a connection with the audience so effortlessly.Creating a connection that puts you in the shoes of the characters is far and away what "Room" does best. From the performances to the two-act story structure, Abrahamson works hard to envelop you, to provide a sense of claustrophobia, and then rip it all away, leaving you with a mixture of mental and emotional poignancy. Suddenly you start looking at characters and situations with a refreshed emotional perspective.This effect compensates a bit for the lack of an especially compelling narrative in the second act (although one sequence in the film is absolutely heart-stopping). Eventually, plot sort of gives way to study and observation as we are left to sift through the emotional aftermath and watch these characters cope."Room" is in the very least a showcase of several emerging talents in front of and behind the camera, all of whom have big careers ahead of them. There's a lot of great talent making great choices in this film, and though lots of other independent films are equally worthy of acclaim, it's nice to see something like "Room" get some major recognition.~Steven CThanks for reading!

You know that you have something special when everyone is telling you that you movie is good and unique. The only movie i would relate it to as analogy- may be The Road. This picture is all about a struggle that mother and her child have vs cruel and constantly changing world. It is not actually about the abduction, it is more about growing up and adjusting to new world. For both mother and child. Despite the extreme circumstances of this story, it leaves you asking yourself are you really ever ready for pressure of raising a child? Dramaturgy here is maybe the best I have ever seen. Astonishing work on psychology and writing it into a simple but impressive form. Also incredible actors performance. You will shed a fair amount of tears but it will leave you with a good feeling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From womb to Room to tombLast week we saw the Oscar nominated film, Room, whose star Brie Larson won best female actor. On its surface, it is obviously a story of trauma, rescue, and recovery. A teen-ager in high school, Brie (Ma) is kidnapped and held prisoner in a backyard shed. After two years, she gives birth to a child (Jack) fathered by her captor/rapist. She raises him for five years, keeping him safe from her kidnapper, and creates for Jack a belief in a world no bigger than the small area contained within the shed's four walls, lit by a small skylight above. Seven years after her capture, Brie and Jack get free and the second half of the movie is their difficult integration into a new/old world of family and society.I read the book a couple of years ago when it appeared on the Booker Prize list, but the movie clarified for me central images and themes I missed earlier. Room is, in fact, a contemporary retelling of Plato's "allegory of the cave" and illustrates, as well, the process of spiritual awakening from life to death to rebirth.Plato's uses the allegory to describe the depths of illusion and fear that keep individuals clinging to their ignorance of reality. A group of people are chained in the cave facing inward toward its wall. Behind them is a fire. In front of them, but behind a curtain, other people go back and forth carrying sticks with objects upon them that cast shadows upon the wall.The prisoners mistake those moving images as reality, as Ma tells Jack the characters on television are actually as flat and unreal as they appear on the screen. To protect him, the only world she reveals to him is the one they jointly create within the shed.Even when a prisoner is forced into the world outside the cave, he resists opening his eyes. When he finally does he cannot accept the objects in the sunlit world as real. Similarly, Jack does not believe his mother when she first reveals to him the existence of a real world he has never seen. Essentially, to make their escape, he must have faith not only in her, but in an unseen reality outside Room.Jack's awakening or better yet his illumination is preceded by symbolic death. Acting as if he is dead, he is wrapped in a carpet/shroud and placed in a truck bed to cross into the next world. Peering through the end of the red carpet, we can imagine Jack sees the strange sky and light as an infant perceives what lies outside the birth canal.As in Plato's allegory, Jack has difficulty trusting the new people and objects in his environment and expresses a wish to return to Room. Wearing a face mask against possible infection and sunglasses, Jack has difficulty negotiating the stairs that take him from one to another level of his new reality.Jack's mother, however, did an extraordinary job within Room maintaining his capacity for attachment, love, and curiosity. He shows interest and empathy, for example, toward Mouse when he appears in Room.Jack eventually begins a process toward individuation. His mother finally rejects his wish to nurse and he accepts this. And when Ma begins to experience the expected obstacles toward recovery following the initial euphoria of rescue, he gives her a portion of his newly cut 5 year old hair to as a restorative sacrifice and symbolic offering of help.Gradually with the help of the love and wisdom of his grandmother and the patient tutelage of her companion, Leo, and Leo's dog, Jack is led further from Room and the unconsciousness of his prior relation to Ma. Jack is now, as Joseph Campbell would have it, a hero.I write this piece not simply for the intellectual pleasure it provides me, but for its parallel to what is possible for us. From the loss of the first taken for granted world of Ma when she was a teen, and for Jack the loss of Room, the only world he has known, we can see ourselves having to adjust multiple times to the changes wrought by the progression of chronic illness . And if Jack and Ma can adapt and even flourish in each strange and ever new world, so perhaps can we. And, of course, we miss our former world, as Jack does Room, but then, as with Plato's freed prisoner, we turn toward the light.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Given the disturbing premise of "Room", I was expecting emotional intensity, a fairly static plot, and a generally dark tone, so I was surprised to find this movie to be an engagingly-told story of resiliency.Both Brie Larson and Jacob Trembley are outstanding. Playing mother and son, their characters and relationship are completely convincing, and while the story starts fairly quietly (perhaps to reflect Joy's and Jack's captivity), the story gains intensity as Joy realizes the need to escape, and prepares Jack to help in the attempt.This is a story about trauma, survival, and resiliency, told very quietly and carefully. I marvel at films that find the significance in the everyday, without having to warp it for dramatic effect. "Room" achieves it beautifully.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>so well done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that I wanted to see and at the same time knew it would be hard to watch. And it was. The acting by Ma and Jack is so realistic and has been rewarded so many times for Brie Larsen. Jacob Trembley deserves more awards but I look forward to seeing this young man again and again. To put a story of a woman who is kidnapped at 17, and has a child, and finds a way to get him out of the Room - on the screen could not have been easy. The ability of Ma to keep Jack curious, to teach him, and protect him - to well presented. The script is so good. You are presented the aftermath of the events and they are presented with such probable truth. To go back to a world that is different that you had at 17 and then a 5 yr. old being able to experience it for the first time - well done. I am glad I saw it - wish I had seen it when it first can out - but will never forget this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solidly Executed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(spoilers) Directed with competence and subtlety by Lenny Abrahamson, "Room" is winning direction with good score and great acting from leads, especially Jacob Tremblay (young Jack). The claustrophobia of the first 45 min wears a bit, but the filmmakers redeem themselves with an excellent 2nd half of adaptation and re-circulation into society. Camera angles, brightness, and blurriness, including sound muffling are all masterfully distorted and adjusted to impart the strange distress the boy gets put through when transitioning. The dialog is not far-fetched or pandering. Indeed, the movie was very good, adapted from the novel with the same author creating the screenplay as well. 7.5/10 (recommended)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Work of art with breathtaking performances from both Larson and Tremblay!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the first moment I started watching this film, it caught my full attention. The story line is so powerful and vulnerable at the same time I couldn't help but thinking this is one of the best films I've seen in the last year or two. What I found most enchanting personally was the connection Ma' and Jack had throughout the entire film. The world Ma' had created for Jack to grow into despite her own tragic fate was beyond words. But what really broke me is the second part of the film, when both are free and out in the real world again. That's when emotions start hitting Ma' the way they should all those years she stayed strong for Jack in Room. The suicide attempt for me was the peak of the story! The chemistry between Brie and Jacob on and off set is undeniable. The two of them created something so strong, and pure and sincere, I think that was the main reason this film got so far, and people got so stunned. I recommend it for anyone who is up to an emotional, powerful experience. MAGNIFICENT FILM FOLKS!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Evocative Filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lenny Abrahamson's Room is poignant. Room is evocative. Room is devastatingly beautiful. There is a magic in creating a world in a child's perspective. To capture and display the innocence, the purity, the sheer amount of confusing vastness of the world is no mean feat. Writer Emma Donoghue, who is also the writer of the book that the film is based upon, and director Lenny Abrahamson manage to do just that.The film starts with the pair of mother and son, Joy and Jack, played by Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay living their lives while scrapping for resources yet finding solace in each other's company, in a room. That is right. In a single room (which later revealed to be a garden shed with a skylight as the only source of sun). The reason behind this ordeal revealed to be that Joy had been abducted by person referred only as 'Old Nick'. Old Nick kept Joy and Jack, who is his biological son, sans any means of communication with the outside world and had them live a life devoid of any hope to go back to the world.Without revealing much about what happens next in the film, it can be said that what follows is one of the heart-wrenching and heart-warming story about love, innocence and those little joys of the world that we often overlook. There is a slight tonal shift in the second half as the tension of escape and sweetness of the love between mother and son gets replaced with Joy facing the reality of the world. But the change is in coherence with the story and that helped in underlining the difficulty both protagonists, especially Joy, is facing in their new world. Even without reading the book, I must say that the screenplay immensely helped in establishing the dichotomy of the emotions that the protagonists went through. Lenny Abrahamson's direction complemented that aforementioned dichotomy. The first act was shot quite meticulously in the closed room, thus providing a sense of foreboding and an urge for escape.Although bolstered by a good support cast the film largely centers around the mother, played by Brie Larson and the son, played by Jacob Tremblay. Brie Larson, whose hitherto best performance perhaps had been in the largely underrated 2013 film Short Term 12, churned out a superlative and breathtaking performance as the mother. The role was a delight for an actor of her capability and she made the character her own. Restrained and gritty while being captive in the room and yet lovingly playing with her son; Vulnerable and fragile, being captive of her own thoughts and insecurities, while trying to get her son attuned to the big world; Brie Larson shines throughout her role.But, the film would not have been so pure, so emotional, so magical without the brilliant performance of Jacob Tremblay, as the 5 year old. It is one of the finest performances from a child I have ever seen. The fear of the task her mother asked, then the taste of freedom, then again the intimidation of the vast world that had hitherto been unknown to him. We feel everything through the wondrous performance of Jacob Tremblay and he genuinely smiled in the film when seeing a 'real' dog for the first time, it becomes difficult to hold tears back.At this point, it would not be fair if Stephen Rennick's score is not mentioned. The music, with the appropriate usage, bolstered the scenes and helped the film in taking the audience for the ride.Room is a film that would provide its audiences a perspective that we often ignore; and for this very reason it is a film that should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first steps of two prisoners at the end of their odyssey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got curious about this after I heard about Larson's Oscar for the role. The story is well told and intimately enveloped ? both inside the room, as they cope and survive, and outside, as they adjust to a normalized life ? and it has its moment of prisoner poetry, but it keeps it light on the drama strings as it filters the heaviness of psychological anguish through the prism of a 5-yr old boy. This could be seen as properly measured, of course, and preferable to most viewers, but I'd expect a more incisive and explorative recount, with all the squalor and darkness such abuse and rehabilitation would entail, before the opening to a new life. One also wonders about the missed chances of making enough noise to be noticed, and I spotted an obvious stylistic error in the camera vehicle's shadow as it follows the captor's truck. The kid was pretty good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The year 2015 was probably the biggest year for movies ever. There were so many amazing movies that were released in 2015, and Room tops them all. I would go as far to say the Room is the greatest movie ever made, in my opinion at least.First of all, the acting was absolutely amazing all the way around, especially Brie Larson as Ma and Jacob Tremblay as Jack. Brie Larson gave one of the best performances by an actress that I have ever seen and in return took home the Oscar for Best Actress. At only 9 years old, even Jacob Tremblay gave an amazing performance. I honestly think he should have at least been nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor, despite his age. Overall, I don't think the movie could have been cast any better than it was.Throughout the whole two hours of this movie, I was glued to my TV. There are very few movies that have ever had my attention like Room did. No other movie has made me feel so sad, happy, stressed, and relieved all at once. In fact, before watching Room, I had never in my life cried over a movie or TV show, but that changed when I watched Room.If you have not seen this movie yet then I highly recommend that you do. However, I would suggest that you do not watch the trailer because I feel the trailer gives away too much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was breathtaking. I wouldn't have been surprised if the movie had been just about the time spent in Room with an escape finale (the typical on this subject), but being able to get a glimpse of life outside hell from more than one perspective, made the movie complete. I've read the reviews that said the movie is about nothing. It's true. It's about nothing but inner struggle, nothing but constant moving on, nothing but parental worries&amp;strategies&amp;love, nothing but inner conflicts, nothing but life. So it's not the movie that lacks depth, you just need your own personal depth to relate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's one of those movies you'll like or dislike a lot ;) I understand how some people find it boring or shallow, with such an emotionally charged topic - one easily slips into the expectation of some deep psychological character's plot/revile or action scenes... It is not that kind of the movie. Also, that's why I like it so much ;) The director choose to give us only vague guidelines about the core events, through little everyday interactions of the two main characters: a mother and her son. For those hungry for more, sometimes you'll get bits and pieces of kid's internal monologues, interpretations of things happening... But as far as the mother's character concerning - it's reduced to a minimalist, somewhat 'live stream' point of view, not even a documentary one, cause that one would insert at least some of her reasoning, points of view. We get none, just her actions and those are all about dealing with her son's reactions. It's a tricky little world, just a tiny little Room; yet left wide open, for us to imagine her emotions and thoughts about it all... I love it. You may not. You may wanna the whole story served here and now, with all the clever plots and intellectual conversations and drawn emotions. Or maybe you'll just love it for what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily One of the Best Films of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Room is directed by Lenny Abrahamson and is the story of a woman named Joy (Brie Larson), who was kidnapped and imprisoned in a woodshed for 7 years. While living there, she had a son named Jack (Jacob Tremblay), who sees their "house" in a different perspective than that of his mother. Jack has never seen the outside world, and believes that there is nothing beyond their room; just outer space. This film follows the two as they plan a daring escape, and have to face something much bigger than their room; the world.To start, the Academy was smart to nominate Room for best picture. This movie is a masterpiece. It's one of the best films of the year, and it's very close to being the best. Room, while being a different story, is amazing. The plot and dialogue is absolutely perfect. There's no a thing wrong with the plot (no holes), and nothing wrong with the dialogue, either. The directing was also amazing. The way the directing makes a tiny room seem as big as the universe is fantastic.The acting was definitely the best part about the entire movie, and that's saying something. Jacob Tremblay is only 9 years old, and delivered one of the best child actor performances in cinema history. I honestly think this kid will land many more roles, and continue to give us even performances, just like this one, or maybe even better, though that doesn't seem possible. Brie Larson also does great in her role. She plays a conflicted woman, going through something she doesn't understand astoundingly. Every line that she gives is truly astonishing.Now, although the movie's great, there are a couple negatives. They are nitpicky, yes, but they're negatives. The first one is that of William H. Macy's performance as Joy's father. Not only is the performance pretty bad, the character isn't the greatest either. Macy's character is not ready at all to handle the return of his daughter, let alone that she has a son. Luckily, this character is only in the film for 10 minutes or so.The only other negative is that the film moves a bit slow, mostly in the second act. The first act can drag a little, but the second act moves pretty slowly. The second act takes place after Jack and "Ma" escape, and their getting home and used to life in the world. This seems to take much longer than it really is, and that slows the movie down a little. However, it's not enough to make the movie bad, or even not amazing. Not nearly enough.Overall, Room is one of the best films of the year, and it definitely deserves an A, or a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confined Space, but Broad Perspective!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes living in enclosed space able your mind to open up to wider thoughts. The whole film is from the perspective of 5 years old boy Jack, who'd been living whole his life in an enclosed room since he had born. It is when, as the film progresses, he starts comparing his previous life in enclosed imaginative world in the room than to the open real world. His little comparisons will blow up your mind. The tale about unconditional love of mother and son &amp; how they balance each other, is one of fewer films which should be watched as little knowing about it before. And, the film gonna stay with you for long.Acted top-notch by both the leads. Brie Larson brilliantly played the mother with a heart of cotton. Jacob Tremblay will just steal your heart with his ease. The most wonderful thing about the film is that how the director have chosen it to be shot, mostly with the eyes of the little boy. Trust me sometimes you'll just feel in the seat of that boy. Without been preachy &amp; forcing any ready-made thoughts on you, the film forces to think and let you feel about many of things. Some moments in the film are so soulful that if you didn't have shed your tears during that, you'd probably lost your heart somewhere, better start searching before it's too late. It is just personal opinion that the director should have showed or conveyed more through the mouth &amp; heart of Jack, may be I was craving for more thoughts.I think this movie will be experienced differently by every individual depending on how he/she feels the emotions, the bond, the world. The true fact is, there's too much to learn from the character of Jack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Triumphant filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Room is directed by Lenny Abrahamson (Frank, Garage) and stars Brie Larson, Jacob Tremblay, Sean Bridgers, Joan Allen &amp; William H. Macy. Based on the best-selling novel; Room explores how 5-year-old Jack copes with the huge world surrounding him after escaping the 10-by-10 foot enclosure that kept he and his mother captive his entire life. With tour de force performances by both Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay, this psychological drama triumphs in a story of survival, hope and the unbinding love between mother and son. With award season in full swing, Room has captured audiences around the world, with its small and subtle storytelling and gargantuan directorial vision. The attention this film has gained is so vast and wonderful to see, focusing on the performances of our two on-screen protagonists. I'm truly glad to see Larson taking the Oscar for best actress and Tremblay for the AFCA breakthrough artist. Both are equally magnificent as their chemistry flows beautifully throughout the 128 minute running-length of the film.After seeing Abrahamson's directional efforts in 'Frank' and hearing that he was sitting back in the directors chair for Room, I knew I had to see it. His work is highly regarded as some of the best Irish cinema around. I can safely say, I agree. Truly enduring work, and the pacing never holds up even for a few moments.Stephen Rennicks pairs up with Abrahamson yet again with their fifth collaboration and it sounds incredible. The soft guitar melodies play slowly and gently under the performances and perfectly portray the mood and themes of this film, then as the drama and tension increases, a structured string movement thickens the emotional core. I'd love to see the two connecting again sometime in the future. I have very little to say that would be derivative of the overall feature and because of this, I have to say I'm very happy with the experience I have had with this film. I think Abrahamson is an ingenious director and really strives to be different.My verdict; Room is a film that everyone should watch and take note of. A simple idea can go a long way. This is substantial proof of that. Room, 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When making a world out of a room seems easier than making room in the world...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since I've been following the Award season, I was wondering what was exactly about this 'Jacob Tremblay' kid. I had never heard about him, but the more awards nominations he got, the more pictures of "Room" I was discovering, the more intriguing that skinny pale-looking child with unusually long hair was, especially that movie snapshot of his stunned look crossing as you could tell he was witnessing something of hypnotic beauty.First, I thought Tremblay was portraying some kind of autistic kid, then the story of a mother and her child trapped in a room made me expect a movie about confinement, and the ability of creating a world out of a horrible situation. And the kid looked strange enough to make me believe that he was victim of a condition forcing him to be isolated. Lenny Abrahamson's "Room" was the kind of film that is surrounded by an aura of mystery, but that alone wouldn't have been enough without the whole awards-buzz, so like many others, I saw it to see what was good about it.At first, I was disrupted by the whole voice-over narration, I wasn't really ready for some abstraction ? la "Tree of Life", and I wished the kid wouldn't be too strange, even within the story's strangeness. But doubts immediately vanished, Jack was a normal kid who loved to play, to please his mother Joy, played by Brie Larson, to be told that he's grown up, to write, to draw, except that everything he does, and been doing since he was born, took place in that small shed, whose only door to the world is a skylight. And as the story goes, we get the circumstances of their presence there, especially when there's a sort of figure named Old Nick who's the only known outsider.The film echoes many news items about women or kids who've been abducted for years and years, being raped and having children with their own captor, the kind of stories that make you wonder how can anyone survive from such conditions. It's the mark of great films not to answer questions directly but to make you answering them on your own. Jack, unlike Joy, doesn't know what he missed and the whole world, as far as he's concerned is the room and whatever is in the room is real. A mouse is real, a spoon or a kitchen sink or a wardrobe are called by 'mister' or 'mrs' but whatever appears in that box named TV is made of pictures and can't count as real. And as far as humanity goes, there's him, his mother and Old Nick, played by Sean Bridgers.Jack can't be unhappy or his unhappiness is limited to his world. However, his mother spent only 7 years of her life there; she not only knows what she's missing but she knows damn well what Jack is missing. And if Jacob Tremblay deserves the praise for his performance, there's something in Larson's acting that cuts straight to the heart. She is devastated but she must hide it,, the presence of Jack is the only thing that keeps her alive, otherwise, she would have killed herself. Jack is her skylight. But there comes a point where enough is enough, and for his own good, she can't let Jack drown in a fantasy-world that might eventually destroy him. This is a story of a mother's responsibility, and she's got to stop pretending and get her son out of there.She first thinks of faking illness so Nick can take Jack to the hospital but instead of that, Nick goes outside to buy antibiotics. She then teaches Jack how to play dead, so she can wraps him under a carpet and ask Nick to 'bury' him, this is where Jack must free himself. They say even a frail mother can increase tenfold her strength if her child is in danger, the same goes when Nick wants to check the body. Joy learned how to fake emotions, but now, she has to make it 'Oscar-worthy' so that Nick is convinced not only to take the body but not to bury him in the garden and take him on his truck. Joy keeps her head on the carpet not to let anything betray her nervousness, and the plan works. I guess there's a justice if Larson wins the Oscar if only for that scene where she gave her best acting in order to forever stop acting after that, the climax of her room years of pretension.And a lesser film would have made it the real 'climax', and make "Room" a sort of mother-and-son version of "Life is Beautiful" with a heart-warming slow-motion reunion at the end, people crying and some cheerful happy-ending music but "Room" is respectful enough to our intelligence not to tell us that everything will go perfectly right after such an experience. The second act consists on Joy and Jack coping with their trauma, and building new relationship with family members who's either strangers or estranged to their world. "Room" isn't about people stuck in a room during seven years, but stuck in the world after such experience, and this time, it's harder for Jack.Indeed, I finally saw what was beyond that picture, Jack had a stunned 'where am I?' born-baby look, with his vision blurred because of the years spent in obscurity, he was reborn, but life will go very fast for him. One day, he'll ask his grandmother (Joan Allen) to cut his hair (a vivid symbol of "Room" days, his Samson-like 'strength' as Joy told him) and this action ironically makes him even stronger, and is a positive signal for Joy. Then they visit the room again and Jack realizes how small it was, just as when we visit a childhood place. He didn't grow much physically after the "Room" but he could finally enjoy life now that he discovered how wonderfully big it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Save some room, this movie will makes you think outside the box. It's a well-made film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prepare to cry, to feel, to be angry, and to cheer. This is one of those kind of films that will stays with you long after the credits roll. It's captivated. Not to confused with the awful bad, 2003's The Room, 2015's Room is an admittedly unsettling adaptation, based off, the novel by author Emma Donoghue of the same name. Room tells the story about two people: 5-year-old Jack Newsome (Jacob Tremblay) and his Ma, Joy Newsome (Brie Larson) living together in a single room. Told from Jack's point of view, the movie makes it clear that he's used to the idea of never going outside. What the audience knows that Jack doesn't know, is that he and his mom are prisoners, by a serial rapist, named Old Nick (Sean Bridgers). Now, on Jack's 5th birthday, Ma must finally tell him, the truth, so that they can siege the dangerous and heart breaking opportunity for her and Jack to escape. Can Jack cope with the decision of life outside of his own four walls; or will the room continue to be, his inner sanctum? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, Room really hit close to home. I had known people that went through similar trauma like this. While, this movie is hard to watch, it's a movie that needed to be seem, as it shows how to cope with the rest of your life after going through life changing event like sexual, mental, and physical abuse. Indeed, there is something worth discovering, outside, beyond these 4 walls. The movie is beautifully acted. Brie Larson is a tour de force. By far, one of the best acting of my generation, I have saw from an actress in recent times. You feel the love, angry, and dramatic heartbreak in every scene, she is in. After all, she essentially missed out on her formative adult years and was forced instead to raise a child in inhospitable conditions. You sense every emotional range of a mother whose young life was drastically altered at age 17. Not only that, but Larsen, well-mastered acting gives strong testament to the unsinkable bond between a mother and son, whose love propels them to rescue each other. I have to give credit to the young Jacob Tremblay, as well. Tremblay, in particular, is mesmeric. He has a lovable charm about him. I really felt like he was a son, I never knew, I had. That's how close, I got with his character. Both Larson and Tremblay make a remarkable duo. Another thing, I love about the film, is how accuracy closed, it was, to the source material. Screenwriter, Emma Donoghue didn't change much of anything from her novel. Inspired by real-life kidnapping cases like the Fritzl case, &amp; the Jaycee Lee Dugard case, author Emma Donoghue was able to use symbolism, themes, and metaphors, from both real-life news, and classic literature to make a very well-written film. I love all, the references to Count of the Monte Cristo, Alice in Wonderland, and the Book Thief. Not only that, but all the Religious symbolism ranging from Sampson's hair to the villain, being called Old Nick, help make the character development of Jack, being told here, very believable. If the movie had any fault about Jack's story, it's the fact that many viewers were confused by, Jack's appearance. He had very long hair and very soft voice. Because of this, there has been elaborate and incorrect theories speculating that Joy is pretending that Jack is boy, to hide it from her captor. While the first half of this film was entertaining, it still lacked a lot of logic. Like, why didn't they just smash the window and climb out using their table and chairs? Also, how come Old Nick didn't see Jack when he was sitting straight up in the truck? Why would Old Nick just drop Jack like that? Those are really big jarring questions. If you think about it, it's something worth debating about. Thinking outside of the box. Another fault of the film is how it does feel a bit disjointed. It's kinda like watching two different movies. Filmed in two parts; the first half, is learning to survive and escape, your torment hell. While, the second half is learning to cope after the trauma has happened. Yes, I know, a lot of critics might think the second half, might had gone a little too long, and repetitive, but I believe, the movie is well-paced. After all, you rarely see films tackle character study after a horrible event. This was something new to me. Another person that deserve some credit, is director, Lenny Abrahamson and cinematographer, Danny Cohen. The movie is well-shot. I love the scenes where they showing time has changed. A good example is how the camera focus on, the skylight of the room. Another great shot, is the whole rug sequence. Wow, that was really intense. In my opinion, while, this movie is Rated R. I didn't see anything that was graphic. Most of the rape scenes, were not shown, and the film had no nudity. Even the violence, was tame. If anything, it's just the dark subject matter. However, I saw harsher films rated PG-13 that dealt with a similar concept. So I don't get, why this movie was Rated R. It makes no sense to me. Overall: This haunting and disturbing movie is amazing. Worth the price, checking out. I hope, many success for it, during Oscar season.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is a great film. i only came to comment because of something that happened in the film that annoyed me so much. spoilers ahead.so when she gets home and they are interviewing her for what seems to be a daily TV show its so annoying but it would be just the kind of reaction you would expect from a snobby women working on TV who has had daddy do everything for her and thinks she can sit down and pass judgement on a girl who has been hold hostage for a good 5 years if not more. i am guessing it was 5 years. hold in a room in a shed. and yet this reporter still takes a stance that she is above her, that what she thinks and says is so important and is so. while interviewing her it is so typical of the interviewer coming from a place of judgement and not from a place of love or care. it is a part of this sick world we live in where ego of the wealthy seems to think it is so much better than anyone who has had any kind of hardship, so annoying.and it is done so well. and it annoyed me so much am guessing that was the intention. so daddys girl interviews the girl about her baby boy. who she conceived from the man who held her captive for 5 years. first she asks how she feels about the father of her child. obviously an horrendous question knowing what she has been through but am sure i could imagine this being asked. and then. she asks her why didn't you get your captive to drop off your child at a hospital somewhere. a man. who held her hostage and raped her why didn't she ask this sexual monster to do the right thing. and take away her child. really. to a hospital and drop him off because it would have been better for the child. really. how could she ever know that. he could have killed the child. anything could have happened. how can you expect a man a beast who has hold you hostage for 5 years. to take your child away and do the right thing. this annoyed me SO much. and it is only because of her actions she is now alive and well and also her son is alive and well. it is her actions that made it possible for him to escape and for her to be saved. yet this so to do women thinks she can judge. so screwed up our world is people. daddys girl would have never experienced what it is like to be hold hostage your life at risk. yet she sits there and judges her. its horrendous. later i believe it is what causes her to commit suicide feeling she was worthless. its a very touching film. but also shocking. its very well done. really got me going.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as upsetting as I was expecting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very hesitant to watch this film. I knew the subject matter and find news about abduction and abuse very upsetting. The thing is, I wanted to see the performances by Larson and Tremblay, so I watched it. They did not disappoint. They were both absolutely flawless. I was shocked at how the film wasn't that difficult to watch. I thought I'd be tense the whole time but I wasn't. It really is a movie that the masses can relate to. Anyone can find a way to relate to this. It is a film about a mother and son bond. I also love that the author of the book also wrote the screenplay (love seeing a female screenwriter!) It's nice that she got to choose what parts of her story were shown on screen. I probably won't be able to watch this film again (lots of crying was happening on my part) but I highly recommend seeing it if you haven't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lifetime Channel-Movie with a Big Budget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching "Room" is like taking in a film on the Lifetime channel with an A-list cast and a big budget. Like the novel that was the basis for the film, there is a two-part melodramatic structure to the narrative.Melodrama #1 depicts the harrowing captivity of a woman held hostage by her captor for a seven-year period in a dingy, claustrophobic shed in the offender's back yard. Two years into captivity, the woman delivered a baby boy, who is now five years old. The first half of the film plays out like a Harold Pinter drama with the mundane dialogue of the mother and son, plus menacing visits from the captor.The second melodramatic action follows the daring escape of the child, who is successful in alerting the authorities, who free the mother from the shed. The second half of the film is the more engaging because it introduces the family members and seeks to portray the recovery of the traumatized mother and child. Unfortunately, there are too many plot holes in this intense drama, the most glaring of which is the insensitivity of the grandfather character, as played by W. H. Macy.The screenplay was adapted by Emma Donoghue from her novel, and her strong suit is in storytelling, not character motivation. At one of the crucial junctures of the film, when the mother needed support from the family, the grandfather refused to even look at the boy.In the novel, it is made clear that the father is tormented by the idea that the grandson would have the same face as the perpetrator who abducted and raped his daughter. But in the film, the little boy's face is a dead ringer for the mother--not the father. The motivation was not spelled out in the screenplay, and the film's director was completely oblivious of the unmotivated action of the grandfather. In the DVD's commentary track, the director spoke of deleting a scene where the grandfather peeks into the bedroom of the little boy, but still cannot bring himself to look at the child. By restoring that scene, the motivation for Macy's character would still be confusing to the audience.At the premiere of the film at the Landmark Theatre on West Pico in Los Angeles, there was an artistic installation of the 11' X 11' room that was recreated on the site. Such a display indicates the shortcomings of this film in the superficial treatment of a serious topic. This film should have offered a strong social commentary about predators like the one who abducted the young woman. Shouldn't the television reporter be investigating the perpetrator, instead of grilling the young woman, as we see in the film? The overall effect of the film sadly trivializes a serious subject and turns a topic that should evoke moral outrage into a routine tearjerker.</fullReview>

Not stressing much on the saddening prison-ed part, it quickly packs up and move into the reformation side of two soon up to happy ending.It remarkably acknowledges all the possible issues that should arise in various individual situation both are put into. One doesn't think of beyond because he has never experienced it, all the facts mentioned to him suddenly are fake and story for him.

		<shortDescription>Brie Larson is great, and Jacob Tremblay as well, Sad Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had picked Brie Larson as the favorite to win the best actress this year and she might juts pull it off though this movie has an anticlimactic ending that doesn't explore the full extent of the horrible events depicted. Room is based off a book by the same name written by Emma Donoghue. The novel won all sorts of awards and shortlisted for many others. I have not had the privilege to read it but I've heard good things. Donoghue also adapted the screenplay. The significance of this movie cannot be denied as I clearly remember hearing the horrifying tale of the three women in Cleveland and the other awful experiences of young woman at the hands of derange men. This movie takes place in Ohio too. Overall this movie is very sad and moving, a real downer. Jack played by Jacob Tremblay steals the show. I'm surprised he didn't get nominated for a Golden Globe. His young performance was only outdone by the young man of Beasts of No Nation, Abraham Attah. This doesn't take away from Tremblay's performance. He dominates the film and his voice-over brings us into the strange world of room. The back and forth between him and Larson's Joy, or Ma, was real and grew steadily nerve-wrecking as they plan their escape.See the rest of this review and more at swilliky.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>just because it's about a major drama doesn't make it good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first 45 min are not bad. It gives idea of the claustrophobic situation and the desperation of it, although very little. After the escape (hello! No spoiler, it's in the description the movie) out becomes unbalanced and drags on as a drama. Nothing about the investigation. Just to many scenes of getting back into the real life. The narration a boy who is far too old to be a 5 year old is about as irritating out gets but I get this with American child across a lot. The story is rather flat, in dialogue, in relationships, in storyline. I know it happens to people like kampusch but that just isn't enough to compensate for poor directingand flat writing. Not impressed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disconnect with society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed Room, Room had the ability to create a sense of suspense within a 'room'. A sense of mystery, I was quite interested in the idea of this 'room' which if thought about is quite a bizarre idea. As it did occur to me that it is quite strange that a man had kidnapped a minor and proceeded to keep her alive in his shed, eventually impregnating her and continue to pay for all expenses of her and this child. All in all, despise the odd premises it is an intriguing story on coping with the outside world. For "Ma", someone who has experienced it but has been detached from it for several years and "Jack",one who has never been a part of it. I do believe that Jacob Tremblay's portrayal of the boy Jack was quite well done, I was sold at his bewilderment of seeing the outside world and the impacts that has been inflicting on him after being exposed to the false belief that the room is everything. It's got this whole idea of new things versus the old familiar things and the idea of the fear of new experiences. It also deals with the problem of post traumatic stress on Brie Larson's "Ma" and her trying to cope with the world despite her experiences of potential rape and having been kidnapped for such a long time. It is clear that there is a disconnect which brings viewers to the next theme of a sense of belonging and fitting in. Overall I do recommend it for people who like films with more thinking required but this is definitely not your average popcorn flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Room is an emotional film, dramatic and tense, and a stand out thanks to Larson, Tremblay, Abrahamson and Donoghue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Room opens on Jack's world on his 5th birthday. To him, the universe is as expansive as the four walls he knows. Jack's mother known simply as Ma (Brie Larson) is driven by one mission in her life, to shield him and protect him from the true and harsh realities of their life in spite of the harrowing circumstances.I first heard about the book Room through a friend. She told me the concept and I was immediately intrigued and quickly added it to my Need to Read pile. But it had the reverse effect when I heard there was going to be a film adaptation. I was concerned how the distinct style and voice would transfer over. The wisest decision filmmakers and A24 made was to have the book's author Emma Donoghue also write the screenplay for her bestselling novel. Her faithfulness to the original source is unmatched and her expertise in expanding upon the literature for film should be a basis for all future movie adaptations of novels.For those unaware of the subject matter, Room is about a young woman being held by her kidnapper. She has been there for some time, long enough to have a five year old son named Jack. She creates a wondrous life for him in the confines of that 1010 room in an effort to protect him from the horrors of their situation so may grow to be a happy child. What we the audience see is this life and the effect Jack's curiosity has on Ma, spurring a desire to escape to the outside.The beauty of Room lies in its unique perspective and distinct mechanism through which it chooses to tell the story of its two characters, through the eyes and mind of a five year old child. In that regard, it is awe inducing. In doing that, a film about several different simultaneous traumas is bearable when in reality it should be like living in a raw nerve. And still, the harrowing emotions these characters go through is palpable, going through the screen straight through your soul. There is a constant tension and quiet terror to Room, an anxiety that leaves you restless, wriggling in your seat as you desire to help the characters. I was left nauseous, an amazing feat given how restrained the film is and how perilous it may have been in someone else's hands other than Lenny Abrahamson. He showcases the two sides of this story, inside and outside Room, with balanced finesse and an artist's eye and accomplishes a film that is both tender and terrifying without being far-fetched or jarring.You really can't talk about Room without talking about its two stars: Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. Both of whom give outstanding performances with the former perhaps having the luck of earning the role of her career. With as many complex layers to the film as it has, it rarely resorts to telling and virtually relies entirely on the actors' performances and the audiences' abilities to observe minute details. The character of Ma is strong, vulnerable, traumatized, scared, desperate, hopeful, and angry, along with scores of other gentler emotions and Larson does it with a quiet grace and inherent awareness of her craft. Her commitment to the character is so honest that there is no Brie Larson.You may not be ready for the intense subject matter of Room, and that is okay, but we implore you to give it a chance. Room is one of those films that will touch your soul and feel for your fellow man.Please check out the site for Archon Cinema Reviews for full reviews of all the awards season contenders!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't list out all the things, I love about this movie as it would violate the spoiler rule of IMDb. But I'll try to describe as much as I can. The movie starts, giving you an insight into the small world of Jack, who is now five years old. He lives with his mom. He has a very different concept of the world and people compared to us. The story unfolds and you realize their condition. The escape scene can give you chills and it was one of the best scenes of the movie. They adapt to the normal life of the outside, and it doesn't turns to be easy for them. But they carry on, and Jack who is learning the ways of the new World, that he has found, makes some amazing discoveries which can bring tears of joy to the common adult. Brie Larson portrays her role very well. The performance by Jacob Tremblay, who played Jack, was amazing too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, moving, transcendent, wondrous.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Giving meaning to tragedy and trauma is dangerous ground. Whether you're a preacher, a writer, a journalist, a film-maker or just somebody trying to walk alongside someone experiencing trauma, the traps are the same. Say too much and you risk the trite, the trivial, the weightless; say too little and you risk a silence which is filled by worst imaginings. Try to find meaning and you flirt with missing the point, not doing justice to the pain; try to let events speak for themselves and you come close to nihilism. There's so much that can go wrong it's best to do nothing if you don't have to, if events don't force themselves on you. Trauma is distant to most of us But as I found out when my when friend was murdered by terrorists, that approach is ultimately of no use; sometimes the worst case happens, the unthinkable becomes your daily concern, the unimaginable your lived experience. This is the territory we are in with Room, the film adaptation of Emma Donoghue's massively successful novel (an adaption written by the novelist). I had little knowledge of the book personally, but the film-makers want us to be in no doubt as to where this film goes - the bare facts make this a hard sell. It's the story of a young woman (faultlessly played by Brie Larson) confined in one room for seven years where she's repeatedly raped by her captor; she inhabits the room with her five-year old son to whom she gave birth in the room as a result of the rapes. Jack's world is the world in four walls; it's all he's ever known, all he's ever seen save for what he sees through the single window in the form of a skylight and the television. This is a child's eye view film; it is through him we perceive the abuse which we never see; it's through him we learn of his mother past life on the outside; it's with him that we eventually journey to the outside world in the film's final third. Jack's mum has helped him create a fantastical world within the four walls of his existence; around his fifth birthday she tries to explain the outside world to him. He's disbelieving, but gradually grasps towards something resembling truth. When he attempts to affect their escape he's just about aware enough to cope with the revelation that there are other people and animals and places. We know there are real-world equivalents to this fictional story, but still this film is trying to imagine the unimaginable. By all rights it should be inadequate or trite or tasteless or just plain unbelievable. In trying to make a film that isn't a thriller or a drama or comedy but instead a hymn to love and relationships, the film-makers should be falling flat on their faces. Instead they've given us a genuinely unforgettable, overwhelming and transcendent film that helps us rediscover ourselves, our loved ones and the world around us. It finds beauty in the desperately ordinary thanks to some remarkable cinematography that makes the small room both a place of captivity and a universe to discover; the relationships are perfectly drawn and life-affirming thanks to Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay's (the son, Jack) achingly beautiful performances. The depths of their relationship are unfathomable yet also utterly recognisable to anyone who has ever loved. The startlingly brilliant music haunts, prods, pushes and finally engulfs. We never see the rape or abuse take place, but we're left in no doubt as to its reality, its inescapability. Yet we're never without hope or beauty, and ultimately the film lets us and the characters find life in new, beautiful and subtle ways. There's much to say about Room, but at the end of the day there's little I can properly articulate. I can think of maybe one other film (Pan's Labyrinth - in many ways very different, in others very similar) that has come close to making me feel as moved, alive, tearful and full of wonder as this one. It's a rare work of art that leaves you speechless yet desperate to talk, but Room is one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed the first half of the movie more than the second. Jack and his mother's time in Room was captivating. I was intensely interested in their relationship and way of life, trapped in such a tiny enclosure. During their attempts to escape, I was kept on the edge of my seat in suspense. Jack's first time seeing the real world was magical and terrifying at the same time. I couldn't even imagine the sensory overload. Then they both arrived at Jack's grandmother's house. Events here seemed to unfold choppily. There was no clear direction. Before, Jack and Ma's goal was to escape Room. Now, they were simply living day-to-day, trying to adjust and readjust to the real world. This was something they didn't handle gracefully, which was unsurprising after all they went through. Room is an impressive film?one I won't likely forget. The acting is stellar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Room is one of the best movies I've watched in a long time and totally deserving of all the award attention that it has been getting.The performances of both Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are excellent. Brie Larson really succeeds to show the fear and desperation that Joy/Ma felt. There are parts where she seems so tired and exasperated and I thought that it was a spot on reaction for someone in her position. Jacob Tremblay is a phenomenal child actor. It's too often when children in movies are two dimensional characters, whose range as characters moves from 'cute' to 'annoying brats'. Tremblay was more than that - he showed feelings and variety. He was accurately childishly annoying in some scenes but I never held it against his characters because it made sense that he would behave in such a way.The director also handled space in an excellent way. In the beginning Room doesn't appear all that small which showed nicely how to Jake it was his only known world. In the end we are shocked to see how small Room truly is and that combined with the camera showing Brie Larson's face makes her character all the more tragic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Room is directed by Lenny Abrahamsom and stars Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. I will not describe the plot because if you no nothing going into this movie, I feel like it makes so much special. What makes this movie so special and worthy of being nominated at the Oscars is the performances by Larson and Tremblay. I've never seen such great acting by a nine year old year kid before. Brie Larson also did a fantastic job, an amazing performance that in my opinion she will win the best actress. This movie is also directed beautifully which is all thanks to Lenny Abrahamson. The only negative that wasn't very a negative for me but might be for some people is that it is a very slow and heavy movie but the great storytelling just makes you want to see what happens next. Overall Room is a fantastic story of a mother and her child in a bad situation. The performances were amazing by everyone. Definitely deserves to be in the Oscars race.</fullReview>

Room does leave you with a few dried up tears because you cry when you see the horror of captivity but you soon are smiling at the innocence and hope that Jack brings to his mother's world by bidding the final goodbye to the Room and makes peace with his past.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>7 years is a long time. It is a 5 year old whole and complete life. The story behind this movie is so much more than possible displayed via a screen. A life taken away from the world is gruesome. A life coming to the world inside a maybe 10 square metres of a room is so far away what the ordinary thoughts can grasp. I were so emotionally involved in the way the mother had routines, structures and organization to build both her and her sons life. Amazing! The whole concept of a human settle down in its own mind and accepting a room for life is breathtaking. Accepting the fate and raising a child for 5 years inside a shed. If I only think about that, I feel so alive and proud of the freedom in the world... the freedom in making own decisions. So...all right....enough with the philosophy and the realistic point of view for this one.Oscar nominations has brought attention to the picture. And that is fair. This movie has great acting, great production, great aspects of the whole storytellling and a really good director.Maybe there could be even more realism considering the boy is out in the world for the first time in his entire life.... and, on the other hand... the mother had raised and educated her child in such a good way that the courage took overhand in situations and helped them escape.The way back into the world can be long. The way back into the world can be devastating. Sometimes is the sad thing the only thing to hold on to...the habit of having something.I am so impressed by the way the story and the movie rolls out.

		<fullReview>Room is one of those few movies which maintain the crisp of the literary work they originated from mainly because the same person wrote it for screen adaptation. If it were a young adult novel with fan following, studios would have teared the novel into at-least 2 movies so when one watches it, should remember that he is getting double the fun and why not, Room is a powerful movie with all the elements a blockbuster entertainer lacks these days.We open our eyes to the screen and we are in a small room with two inhabitant. We spend a substantial amount of time in that tiny room but never we ever feel suffocated because of the freshness maintained by the director and drop dead performances by both Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. One wonders if it is going to be a usual torture or survival movie but it is bigger then that. It is very much common that movies are taking a more realistic and social approach towards crises then that of only physical ones.Room is based on a very strong idea and is made by a brilliant director. Performances are of worth watching. Brie Larson is magnificent, although much appreciation should be given to the casting director who opted for her, as most of the praise Brie is getting, is due to the persona she brought to the movie which is different then regular cry baby. And that was the decision of who ever casted her as they at that time gave the movie something other lacked. Jacob Tremblay is brilliant in his role and it's very disappointing to see that many of the award organizations have over looked his work. Although the script is very strong and to the point but the Jacob's escape from the room seemed little weaker. Second half of the movie was much inspired from Irwin Winkler's 'At First Sight' and Clind Eastwood's 'American Sniper. Brie's performance is very good but not as much as she is getting rewarded. As I explained, it's mainly her personality which brought something new into this genre of movie. Rest of the cast were good too. One last mention is for the art designer who worked on the interior of the room which kept us interested in it all the time we spent there.A work of art in the head of a blessed team.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exceptional perspective of a child who hasn't seen the world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Room is a dive into the head of a child's perspective, who witnesses the world for the first time. Emma Donoghue comes with a tale that is so beautifully wrapped under the outlook of Jack who believes space is confined. It is in a way reflective of how we have been living in today's world, and how possibilities gawk at us from a distance, and we are never prepared to challenge ourselves into stepping out.Ma: You're gonna love it.Jack: What?Ma: The world.The plot of Room unfurls like a beautiful flower. You are thrown into the mundane sphere of daily chores, and then suddenly you are told what's happening and what seems to be the disconnect. It is hurled at you at once, amidst the regularity and it is hard to handle just like Jack's head refuses to accept it. But then again that is the truth. Jack, the smart kid he is, accepts it and tries to help his Ma out, whilst challenging himself to a bizarre world that he has never encountered before.What are quite thoughtful are Jack's diegetic thoughts which go in the background often telling you how he feels about the world. They put your insight in the garbage. Seeing the beauty of the world through a learning phase is indeed really soothing. That's where the screenplay goes really brilliant. His words are so powerful and yet so innocent that he will compel you to go broody.Jacob Tremblay is exceptional as Jack who turns five and knows everything. Brie Larson plays an outstanding Ma, and fiddles with the right emotions. So is Joan Allen as Nancy, Jack's grandma who epitomes sanity and tries to put sense and normalcy in the inane.SPOILERS: Film's most touching moment is when Jack reunites with his mother and the music bashes your nerves to dust. It makes you happy and sad at the same time. But that's only the half of it. The rest of the movie progresses with how he tries to gel up with the asynchronous. Lenny attempts to manifest how Jack sees his surrounding through his sheepish eyes once he is out in the open. You can almost feel yourself feeling sorry for Jack and Ma. It would make you want to hug him right up and teach him the ways of the world.Room concludes at an arresting juncture where Jack wishes to see the room he used to live in. He finds it smaller now that he has seen more of the world, and bids every object he used to adore so much in that room farewell, as his ultimate closure. It is really so pensive that you can't shake it off. It was like he was in a womb till he aged five.If you are a drama freak, you can't simply miss this one. Brilliantly thought of and well written. Thank you Emma!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expect the Unexpected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay. Wow, did I just fall in love with Brie Larson? Hell yeah! But was it the soft gentle Brie I've grown accustomed to over the years, or the Brie who was Jack's mom? Possibly the latter. This movie is a must- see for so many reasons: good directing, great score, amazing acting. I mean, Jacob Tremblay can act. There is no question he is the main character of the film, the reason why this story is being told. And of course, where there is a yin there is a yang. The reason why it's so easy to be sucked into Room right from the get-go is Brie Larson aka Joy. While I was watching this, I guess I was waiting for her to take over the action but she never quite did. Instead what happened was that she and Jack shared this beautiful synergy, which signified what this movie was all about: the bond between mother and son. Some points in the second act (of the story) were dull, but the relationship between these two made the first 45- 50 minutes of the film grade A. In my opinion, Room is definitely worth the watch. The facts aren't all that pleasant, but just hearing "The Mighty Rio Grande" during the bridge between the first and second act, is enough to give you goosebumps. Wasn't surprised by the acting, but more so by the creativity, and that's always the toughest component to find in movies today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Room is a very moving and depressing. It is extremely well acted and put together. Brie Larson is my front runner for the Oscar, and little Jacob Tremblay put together a great performance for being so young. I didn't expect to see a phenomenally acted movie, but instead a compelling story line. The first half of Room had both! Brie Larson is a new star! Its hard to imagine that anyone else could have done as well as she could. Tremblay was a great supporting role that complimented Larson as well. His emotion and commitment to the role really added to the terrible nature of that locked room.I was really expecting a great story, which there was. The entire movie was a great story, but the first half did a much better job of telling that story. After they escaped the room, the story went from compelling and torturous, to just being depressing and rather slow. The first half has something devastating happening that is also unique. No one can imagine what these two were going through, and how just Larson and Tremblay handled the isolation was amazing to watch. Honestly, if the movie would have ended after the escape, it would have been better. Room is a very good movie with a great story and great acting. If the second half would have a little better, this would have been a movie for the ages. Still, Room is definitely worth the watch; 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, Absolutely deserves the recognition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know anything about the movie until the Oscar buzz started. To say the least, I had my apprehensions before getting into the movie. Why? Because, I read the synopsis which implied that Brie Larson would be playing a mother. That didn't make a lot of sense to me, cause until 2 years ago she used to portray the role of teenagers in high school.Anyway, once I did actually start watching the movie, I was totally captivated by what I saw. The first 10 minutes hook you into the story and I kept wondering what will happen next?Brie Larson shines in her portrayal of the psychologically petrified, abused, yet selfless mother who gives everything it takes to protect and nurture her child. I was pleasantly surprised by her performance, because prior to this, I've only seen her in 21 Jump Street and Trainwreck, which are fun and campy movies, but her performance didn't stand out. Here, her performance is very nuanced and subtle, that it didn't feel like I was watching a movie, the events were unfolding in-front of my eyes and most of the credit goes to Larson for giving a stellar performance.Jacob Tremblay is phenomenal as Jack. Apart from Jacob, part of the credit goes to the casting directors who chose him, because you can't easily teach 7-8 year old to act, you need to choose a child whose demeanor and personality corresponds well with the character he/she will be portraying so that his performance comes across as natural one. If they hadn't chosen the right actor to portray Jack, the film wouldn't be getting the recognition it's getting right now. I'm excited to see what Jacob does next.The rest of the cast, which included the likes of Joan Allen and Matt Gordon play their roles beautifully.Lenny Abrahamson is a great storyteller and I'm really pumped to see what he does next. Let's see if he beats this one.I won't divulge much into the story, cause you need to experience it for yourself. The IMDb synopsis is enough to give you an idea of what you would be getting into. My only problem with the movie is that it felt 15 minutes longer than it should have been. The movie deals with the repercussions of what the characters endured in the room, which in my opinion was stretched longer than what would have sufficed.PS. Don't take my word for it, experience it for yourself. You might even cry at a point in the movie, when the characters achieve redemption.My Rating: 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding Performance ; Sad Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really worth watching the movie. Outstanding performances from not only Brie Larson ( which already brings Oscar) but also Jacob Tremblay. We can all be surprise how big imagination of the children's can be. ~spoiler~ Grandma referring the room: Wasn't it awfully small? Child replies: It went every direction,all the way to the end. It never finished. I love the story and the movie. Yes we all love happy endings. However, the story reminds us that such stories can be real and we are not lucky to always have happy endings. Hope, that this story will not be only for having a great 2 hours and we show our sensitiveness for such realities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotional and Intense with Strong Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Room' tackles a very dark and complex subject matter. It is centred on a fictional incident of a man abducting, imprisoning and raping a young woman for several years. There are many ways a writer or a filmmaker could approach this topic. Some may choose to play up the abuse to invoke a visceral reaction from the audience while others may focus on the resulting media blitz. 'Room' does depict both the abuse and the media reaction but it does not dwell on them. Instead, its main focus is the relationship between the woman, Joy, and the son she birthed in captivity, Jack. This is a great way to approach the premise as it allows the audience to get to know them, which makes us care for them. In some moments, I found myself rooting for the characters and hoping that they would succeed. In others, I felt bad for them when they irrationally acted out in anger instead of feeling annoyed. These well-developed characters are brought to life further by two very strong performances. Brie Larson (Joy) and Jacob Tremblay (Jack) bring out the emotional depth to their characters that makes us empathise with them. Although Larson has been touted as the lead of the film, Joy shares the position of protagonist with Jack. Many shots were filmed at low angles including those from Jack's point of view, allowing us to see the world from his perspective. This directing choice also makes Room, the name Joy and Jack gave to the garden shed that acts as their prison, seem a lot bigger than it actually is, reflecting how it makes up the entirety of Jack's world. To top it off, there are montages that feature voice-over narration by Jack, which reflects the images on screen. Unfortunately, I found myself focusing on the visuals and missing the narration. I don't know for sure why I did this. Maybe I wasn't in the mood to listen to prose read aloud. I'll have to wait for my second viewing to get a definite answer.The one complaint I have that does feel definite ? although minor ? is the music that accompanied the start of an important sequence. The piece of music was designed to be emotional and intense in a way that would be more appropriate for the climax of such a sequence. Fortunately, the sequence did become emotional and intense as it progressed. I admittedly find it difficult to connect with characters on an emotional level but the time spent developing the characters made me feel the impact of this scene.I will need to watch this film again before saying I loved it but I definitely liked it a lot. If you are looking for an emotional film with strongly written and acted characters, seek 'Room' out when you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A know story from a different point of view</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found "Room" to be a wonderful movie. It's the typical story of the teenager who gets kidnap one the way home from school and spends years locked in a room by her captor. During those years she gets pregnant of her captor and give birth to a child that becomes her reason to survive. Upto this point it's a story that has already been told a million times, but, here comes the spark of this movie, this one is told from the child's (born in captivity) point of view. From the first scene on, the director takes us on trip inside this little 5 year old kid. How he structures his word, his conception of what the word is, and isn't. What is real, what is imagination, what is TV, and so. On the side we see an extremely strong Mom who somehow managed to make of that terrible reality a happy one for her child. And then they finally get out and the movie starts... A wonderful movie indeed. I strongly recommend this movie to all psychology students or those who are interested in such topics. An already told story from a whole different point of view. Totally worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enter this ROOM</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies have the ability to transport you to many places. Places that are familiar, places that are strange and different or places you would not visit otherwise. It can take you to "A Long Time Ago In A Galaxy Far, Far Away", or it can take you to visit the "Pirates of the Caribbean" or, sometimes - if you are very lucky - it will take you to ROOM.Directed by Lenny Abrahamson, ROOM tells the story of "Ma" (Brie Larson) who, as the movie begins, has been held hostage for 7 years in a windowless 10x10 enclosure. She has dubbed this enclosure "ROOM" for the benefit of her 5 year old son, Jack (Jacob Tremblay) who is held imprisoned with her. The first half of the movie takes place entirely in this enclosure where Ma has helped create a world for Jack. It is very much Ma taking care of Jack. The second half of the movie takes place "afterward" (I will not spoil anything here).Ms. Larson, in her Oscar nominated role, is fantastic as Ma, imbuing her character with the right combination of strength and weakness of one imprisoned for so long, but you can see the love she has for her son and that she will do anything to protect him. While the first half of the movie is worthy of her Oscar nomination (and Oscar frontrunner status), it is the realistic affects to Ma (who we find out is named, ironically, Joy) during "afterwards" that really cement the role. We don't see a "superwoman" here, we see a real person dealing with a traumatic event and it's aftermath. She is ably assisted by strong turns by Joan Allen and William H. Macy as her parents, as well as Tom McCamus as "Leo".The surprise for me is how strong a performance 9 year old Jacob Tremblay gave as 5 year old Jack. While Larson, rightfully so, is receiving critical acclaim, I am surprised that Tremblay isn't receiving more. Larson is the rock of the first half of the movie, but it is Tremblay who holds the 2nd half of the movie together. Jack's warm and loving soul radiates throughout the back half and keeps things together when it looks like things are falling apart.Director Abrahamson gives a strong hand to the proceedings, having us focus on just what we need to focus on without it becoming too depressing, maudlin or sappy. He knows when to pull in and when to pull out and has you rooting for these characters from the start.This movie is not for everyone and I am sure that more than 1 person will have a tough time making it all the way through it (I had a strong desire to go home and hug my family afterward, much to my son's chagrin). I was warmed by the strong love of mother and son and how it takes a subject that could have been a downer and has made it heartwarming and life affirming.8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ROOM: ? poses an interesting question: How does a five year old boy, Jack (an excellent Jacob Tremblay) comprehend and react to a world he's never seen? He and his mother have been held captive in a 10 X 12 shed with a skylight his entire life. His only contact with the outside world is a distorted picture on an old TV and the sky. His only human contact is his captor and his mother who's been held for seven years. He perceives most things as a two dimensional TV image. She must help him differentiate between what is real and what is fantasy. He's never seen a tree, a car or a building. He's a healthy, bright kid who must sleep in a wardrobe while his captor visits nightly to rape his mother (Brie Larson). She devises a successful plan to help them escape. The always wonderful Joan Allen plays his maternal grandmother and with gentle love and encouragement, helps Jack find his way in a very strange world. He's never seen stairs?? Larson is excellent as the mom. Room, is disturbing to say the least but director Lenny Abrahamson lets the story unfold at a nice pace and lets us see the desperation of their situation without letting it get maudlin. Score: 8. GO.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Room' Review: Heart-Tugging Experience, a Young Boy's First View of the Real World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Room" (2015)Director: Lenny AbrahamsonStarring: Brie Larson, Jacob TremblayReviewer Grade: 8ishReviewer: Lane FortenberryIt's fascinating to listen to a child's take on the world. It brings laughter to hear what they believe certain things represent and what those objects actually do. The adults would then correct the child and explain what it really is and what's really out there. Normally, adults don't have to do this twice ? in two different worlds.In "Room," well, it is a different world. Young Jack (Jacob Tremblay) is locked up in a shed, known as "Room," with his mother, or Ma (Brie Larson). They survive with the necessities, basic food, plumbing, a bed, but have no contact with the outside world. Old Nick (Sean Bridgers), who is responsible for locking them away, brings supplies through a password-protected door. The only natural light comes through a skylight atop the shed.Jack believes everything on TV is magic and doesn't truly exist. He believes there is only Room, like it's on its very own planet. Voice-overs are provided by Jack explaining what's going on inside his head, and what everything means to him. He has a fear of ever going outside, but must if he and Ma plan on escaping to a better life. Jack is almost born twice, and experiences the world twice ? once in his own and then the real one. A bond between a mother and her child can never be broken.Both Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay shine so brightly in "Room." Larson is emotional, understanding and at the same time expresses the exhaustion of raising a child, especially one who has never had exposure to the real world. She's genuinely authentic and outstanding. It's going to be a real competition for Best Actress between her and Saoirse Ronan.Tremblay shows his bright future as an exceptionally talented young actor. You will fall in love with this boy and truly feel for him and what he undergoes during the film. His voice-overs are hilarious, but saddening at the same time. The writing was superb for his character. There are no flaws with the rest of the cast, as well."Room" does such a fabulous job with letting us see a child grow up in this unfortunate, but unique circumstance. We have no idea how we would coup with such an experience and the psychology behind it. Being in that situation would be ever so frustrating, but Larson handles and deals with it the only way it could be dealt with. It's another beautiful film from A24.Check out our content at ishmovies.wordpress.com!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific acting and direction create an emotionally powerful journey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It says a lot about the quiet yet assured power of Room that despite the fact half of Lenny Abrahamson's film takes place in the titular and small "room" or really prison that Brie Larsons Ma and her son Jack played by impressive newcomer Jacob Tremblay are kept in, scenes in the film constantly engage the viewer through terrific performances, a taught and sharp script by Emma Donaghue (who here adapts her own book) and there's an emotional resonance that will catch many viewers off guard.Room is not by any means of the word an easy sell or even a typical cinematic piece of entertainment but Abrahamson who showed promise with the sporadically brilliant Michael Fassbender starrer Frank has a clear affiliation for the tricky material that Donaghue created.Focusing on telling the dark and in more ways than one horrific story through the eyes of Tremblay's innocent and impressionable Jack, who never once has set foot outside the thin yet impenetrable walls of his world that he and his mum inhabit, Abrahamson finds himself directing many of Room's proceedings as though they were being seen through the eyes of a 5 year old child just as Jack is. Utilising a sparring yet effective voice over from the young boy that tells us all we need to know about how he sees the life he lives and constructing impressive visuals even in the films tight surrounds, this is Abrahamson's real calling card after two commendable early efforts and the cast also join Abrahamson in an reaching another level of success.She may have just recently won a surprise Golden Globe for her committed and believe able turn as a loving mother but Brie Larson has been carving out a noteworthy collection of films over the last few years so the true breakout of Room is young Tremblay.Tremblay delivers a deep and beyond his young years turn as Jack and it's thanks to this child actors success that Room becomes the film that's been resonating with audiences the world over. While Larson will be billed as the star here it is Tremblay that carries the film through its sometimes murky middle half and whenever he and Larson share the screen, Room is an often faultless exercise in dramatic filmmaking. It's a stunning turn and one that will likely seeing the young performer be an in demand presence in the years to come.While it arguably loses some head of steam after a breathtaking opening half in its exploration of the opportunities that lay outside the prison walls, Room is a unique and emotionally strong tale of the bond mothers and sons share and in a strange yet touching manner, a tale of what it means to be alive in this great big beautiful world we call home.4 remote control cars out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Try to Watch This Film "Cold"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first, I do my absolute best not to ever write a "spoiler" review. I'm going to honor that pledge with this review, but I have to say that this is a hard movie to do justice to without spoiling it. But I think I can, so read on.I decided to go see a random movie this afternoon after seeing the 2016 Oscar nominees were released. This movie is nominated for Best Picture, and it was the one of the three nominees playing at the local indie-flick theater in town that was about to start when I arrived at the theater, so I chose to see it. The most important thing you can know about "Room" is that it's worth seeing at least once. It's a pretty simple, low budget movie, so no special effects or anything like that, so if you'd prefer to wait for the digital release you can. Regardless of when you view it, though, my suggestion is to try to go into this movie without knowing virtually anything about it. Seeing it cold, without having read any reviews or heard a thing about it, will greatly augment the experience.I say that because that's how I went about seeing this movie, and not knowing what it was about really made it quite powerful for me. So while it's fine to wait to see it at home, don't let anyone tell you about it between now and when it hits digital release.Now, here's the one, tiny spoiler--nothing huge here, but just one slight tidbit that I have to reveal in order to write much of a review at all: This movie has a significant plot twist to it. That's all I'm saying, but the point here is that in going into this movie cold and not knowing a thing about it, I thought I was watching a certain story play out on the screen, and then the plot twist hit........and WOW. Man, oh man. I did NOT see that coming.That said, I'll finish here by saying a few words about the quality of the film. The acting is great. The cinematography is great. And for a low budget movie, it does what it sets out to do very effectively.The only thing that I might be slightly critical of is that as the plot develops this movie gets a bit odd--not in the content of what the story is about (although that is odd in and of itself), but rather that after that plot twist happens it seems like everybody in the film becomes a very irrational actor. For me, this made the film suffer a bit, as I kept looking at the decisions that people made as the plot moved on and I thought, "That's not very believable." And yet, the more I think about it, the fact is that the irrational decisions and far fetched mindset that so many of the characters have in this movie may actually make it more believable, since people tend to be irrational creatures.That having been said, I'd give the early portion of this film a 10, and the rest of it a 7. It gets worse as it moves on, but at no point does it ever become a bad movie. The other downside is that it's not a film that would be very re-watchable--it's probably not one that you're going to want own on Blu Ray so you can see it over and over again. But it's definitely worth seeing once. All in all I'd call it an 8. So, 8/10 stars for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Deeply Moving Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine if your entire world was a single room. Adorning this room is a heater, a small table, a bed, a closet and a toilet sans a seat. Also in the room is a carpet, a sink, a tub and a small toaster oven. The only thing connecting you to the outside world is a skylight, an old TV and a crestfallen mother with memories of the world behind your four walls. Everything you know is in that room. How would you develop? How would you understand; and what would happen if you left your world in search of a better one?This is the story brought to luminous life in the film Room adapted from Emma Donoghue's novel of the same name. Told largely from the perspective of five-year-old Jack (Tremblay), the young boy comes to grip with the realities of the outside world after narrowly escaping imprisonment and saving his mother (Larson) from seven years of isolation and sexual torture. Their tormentor is a man described simply as Old Nick (Bridgers) a man always sporting heavy working boots, thinly framed glasses and a look of indignation. Every night, Old Nick trundles into the keycoded room and defiles his prisoner while Jack tries to sleep in the closet. After turning five however, his mother tells him of the outside world and plans an escape.Allegory of the Cave by Jan Saenredam The first act concerns the realities of "room" and all it's little joys that Jack seems to savor. While always having a demeanor of consternation, his mother gives him the best version of gentleness she can afford, reading to him nightly and constructing arts and crafts out of broken egg shells. Once we leave room, the story floods the audience with a vortex of raw emotion initiated by Jack's first real look at blue sky and tree branches. We feel as Jack does; fright, confusion, elation, concern, in short a complete sense of awe.The movie only gets more captivating as it goes on and I dare not spoil anymore sufficed to say that the acting on the part of Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay is nothing short of revelatory. Fully immersed in challenging roles, the two create a relationship so visceral and rewarding that it can bring any unsuspecting adult to tears. Every moment of joy and sadness is thoughtfully executed; which if put in lesser hands would come off as manipulative. Larson recently won a Golden Globe for her portrayal and will likely get at least an Oscar nomination come January 14. My sincere hope is that Tremblay likewise gets a nod complimenting the story arc of a mother strengthening her son and visa versa.While not based on a true story per se, the novel Room was inspired by a true case of abuse and imprisonment dubbed the Fritzl Case. The mere fact that such things can happen in this reality stands as an impeachment of humanity and all the disgusting things we do to each other. Yet despite the tragedies that unfold before us and the toils we might have faced, this small piece of fiction makes a case for hope and perseverance in the face of hardship.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful film, but different from the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, this is a beautiful film, driven by a brilliant story and outstanding performances from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay.Larson is hugely deserving of her Golden Globe win, and I hope to see it replicated in the BAFTAs and Oscars. Conversely, Tremblay's lack of Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations is mad, his performance was one of the best parts of the movie! How does an 8-year-old even begin to portray the role of a 5-year-old who has only ever lived in a tiny room, while his mother is routinely abused by their captor, before being expelled into a harsh and alien world? I saw a quote from a review that said Tremblay's performance is "a revelation" and I couldn't agree more!However, I was surprised to find that the author, Emma Donoghue had also written the screenplay and yet changed so much from the original text! I'm not naive that films can't be rigidly faithful as certain things do not translate. For example, one of the most innovative elements of the book is that it's told completely from Jack's point of view, so work needed to be done to map that onto a film script, and naturally some changes would have been needed.But why change things like names? Officer Oh became Officer Parker for example. It's a trivial change, but having read the book only recently, it jarred and seemed unnecessary.Then there were the larger changes that undermined some of the story's power. Where Ma and Jack originally stayed in the hospital for what felt like a much longer time (admittedly from Jack's perspective), and greater care was taken not to expose Jack to the world before his immune system was ready, the film seemed to accelerate his transition. The passages in the hospital highlighted the desperate contradiction between Ma's need to heal and Jack's need to always be near her, which the film seemed to gloss over. Overall, the speed at which Ma and Jack progressed from escaping Room, through a brief hospital stay, her suicide attempt and their eventual adjustment to life Outside, undermined the complex emotional and physical struggle for both characters that Donoghue describes in the book.All that said, it was still an excellent film. Horrifying subject matter, told in a way that was moving and funny without being trite or disrespectful. If I hadn't read the book, I would probably have rated it a 9. Ardent lovers of the original book might find themselves a little disappointed in places, but I'd recommend it to all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal and Ominous, but good performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very brutal film, but it has to be expected from the fact that it is about abduction. It feels very menacing the whole way through, as things aren't all sunshine and rainbows on the outside. There is very little musical score to the film, which I think makes the film feel even more empty and desolate. The child actor Jacob Tremblay, who plays Jack, is very good in this, one of the best child actors I have ever seen. And yes, the child is a boy and is played by a boy, despite how he looks for the majority of the film, which some film-goers around me at the cinema were shocked to find out. There are parts of the film in which I was left asking what happened to some of the characters, but it was a pretty good film nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Discovering a whole new world beyond the 4 walls.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all know the German folk tale 'Rupanzel', and this is a similar kind with entirely different motive. All the above it is not a fairy tale set in the medieval period, but inspired by many real events of the present era. A couple of years ago I saw a German movie called '3096 Days' based on the true story. When I heard of this movie is being made, at first obviously I remembered that title, but after seeing the poster alone convinced me not the same. Automatically the expectations rose, and now it's got the 4 Oscars nominees, including the best motion picture.The both halves of the movie were entirely different from each other like the two sets of story, but the core of the theme remains same. The first half was a crucial part that takes place completely in a single room with a minimal cast. It does not go through the intro, just begins to tell the story like it's already happening and you might take a few minutes to realise the state of condition. The next half is a reaction to what happened in the previous. And again this is also an important storytelling section because like the title, it was not all about the room, but beyond that 4 walls and its roof and floor like how it affected the mother and son."If you don't mind, it doesn't matter."The movie does not talk about the crime feature at all. Not even considered to reveal behind the motive. So the other side mystery remains as it is. The whole narration was one sided, everything was seen through the eyes of a five year old boy. He begins with the line 'Once upon a time...' like a fairy tale, because it is to him and with his cute little performance along with Brie Larson's, the movie briefs their struggle for freedom.It was a too casual opening, like nothing bad is really happening, just they're weird people or maybe agoraphobia, except they're not. You know when we say we love to be kids again to escape this complicated adult life, sometimes we won't mean it except it was a normal reaction to the situation we're in. But what if a five year old boy wants to be four again when her mother thinks its time to him know what the real world looks like. Yeah, that's a too much to take in for a young boy, but that's the best chance they had to break free from the psycho who put her mother in that room."When I was small, I only knew small things. But now I'm five, I know everything."It was a tidy place, but the camera angles were impressive. I know it was shot in a studio with a wide open space behind the camera, but that does not the viewpoint in the actual story. When the first half ends, it is an indication of the good parts are over, at least that's what I thought of, but what came after was the unexpected expansion in narration. Usually most of the similar tales end in that part itself like for example 'Prisoners' and the rest is understandable stuff that won't be shown.When a tale had a ending like 'happily ever after', still some people desire for it to continue a few more minutes to know how happy really they are and that's what this film's second half. Remember, most of the similar themes have multiple perspectives, like how victim's family is coping with, cops are pursuing the suspect, abductor's plans and motive, and captives struggle. Like I said it was all about what a mother and her son goes through those years in captivity and after that.There were some suspicious characters and events like I had a bad feeling over the doctor's soft talking, also the mother-son's master plan when in captive. Those are tiny diversions to viewers assume differently against where the story is heading. It is all about the mother and son's mental trauma, especially for the little boy similar to when Tarzan is in a big town for the first time leaving behind his other life. It was a perfect pace as well, neither hurried nor a slow development. The movie was a big break for many, especially for the Irish director, and Brie Larson and of course for the kid. Definitely one of the finest movie of 2015 and a must watch.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading all the comments I just had to see this movie. I expected it would be about the difference in feelings between mother and child about their situation (In the Room as well as outside). And in a way it was, especially the first half of the film, which was really good. The second half disappointed me a little bit. It even was a bit boring and sometimes over the top sentimental. Where the movie made me cry in the first half, the second half made me laugh. Because it was funny to see how over the top wise Jack was. And everything was done to make the viewer feel something. However sometimes less is more. Over the top is funny. But the American audience will love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotional, but never sappy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Room is based on, among other incidents, the crimes of Josef Fritzl, but it's not a horror film: it's a drama about people who are habituated to imprisonment. From the opening moments of Room, we are guided by five year-old Jack(Jacob Tremblay), as he tells us what his world is: Plant, Sink, Ma and TV. Everything else is Outer Space, where Old Nick(Sean Bridgers), owner of Room, gets them Sunday treats.Ma(Brie Larson) is the only one who takes care of Jack, but she's no saint: she gets upset, she gets frustrated, she lashes out, and so does Jack. But none of the drama is overblown, instead staying firmly in reality: Larson and Tremblay give naturalistic performances, while Abrahamson's direction shows us Jack's perspective, without being showy or distracting. Instead his camera simply hovers between the characters, and we feel we are observing life from Jack's mind. For an Irish-Canadian-British production, it seems to take more cues from the humanism of a Dardennes Brothers film than a Hollywood drama. The story develops unexpectedly, even if you think you know where it's going, seemingly unfolding without any plot contrivance. Emma Donoghue's screenplay has a rare understanding for how children speak, with cries of "liar, liar, pants on fire", but never talks down to her audience. Casual references are made to Room, and Ma and Jack's past, so that it feels like they exist beyond just what we're seeing. You will also cry. It's unavoidable. Jack lives in the young world of exaggerated emotions, and we join him. There are big moments when he discovers the world, emphasised by slow motion and an emotional score; but there are quieter moments, such as when Jack meets a dog for the first time. While only brief, they are handled honestly and provoke a reaction from the audience without demanding. It's not a perfect film, as a couple of interactions feel forced and the second act could be trimmed down. But these are just quibbles: Room is a drama that manages to tell a moving story without resorting to sappiness or melodrama. You could argue that by the time the credits roll, many of the plot threads are left unresolved. But that would be missing the point: Abrahamson is telling the story of Jack and his Room, not Ma, or Old Nick or anyone else: and for him everything if finished.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're itching to see a masterpiece in film, then go out and watch Room. It's the perfect example of filmmaking that doesn't dumb itself down for its audience. And at the same time, it isn't highbrow or overly complicated. Room starts out in a padded room with a young boy, Jack (Jacob Tremblay), and his mother, Joy (Brie Larson), lying in a bed together. We're not sure why they're there at first. But eventually we figure things out. Joy was abducted 7 years prior and Jack is her son by her captor. Joy is a normal mother. She loves her son. She get's annoyed by him from time to time, just as a normal mother would. Everything is not hunky-dory, but the two of them are content there with each other. Or at least Jack is. You can sense, in Joy's eyes, that she is hiding pain. Jack doesn't know of anything that's happened. He knows of no world beyond those walls.It's not until about 25 minutes in where we realize what's going on. But we don't mind because the journey there is just as riveting. The plot is revealed very slowly, as the filmmakers let us figure things out on our own, and do well not to spell things out for us. They don't assume the audience is stupid--at least those who are willing to commit to the storytelling. Nothing is ever stated, but we have a grasp on background and character dynamics due to brilliant exposition. Room is slow, I admit, but consistent. Director, Lenny Abrahamson knows what he's doing at all times. Besides getting fantastic performances from his leads, I'm thrilled with every choice he makes. From what he includes to what he omits, he understands what's necessary for us to get as organic of an experience possible. This movie could very well be depressing, but it intentionally never stays in one place long enough to do so.Larson is something to behold in this film. She's pretty much gives as flawless of a performance that anyone possibly can. It's perhaps the best female performance I've ever seen. And Tremblay, for a child, is extremely believable the whole way through. The film is ultimately about moving on. And that process can be long and drawn out and never- ending. There are times while watching this film when we ask ourselves how it will end. Not because we want it to, but because we're not even sure how any ending would be enough. But then we find out we're not looking for an ending at all, but a beginning.Twizard Rating: 100</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I tell people Room is great, they generally say one of four things: 1) "never heard of it"; 2) "I read the book and it was good"; 3) "you mean The Room, the worst movie ever made?"; or 4) "that sounds like a terrible movie."Teenager me probably would've hated Room, but more sophisticated, adult me found Room to be a wonderful, tasteful exploration of existence, time, space, and what it means to be living in a world of good and evil. Room made me feel a way about a movie I haven't felt since I watched The Elephant Man years ago.It would be easy to turn Room into a ham-fisted Lifetime movie, but the acting, pacing, and restraint of Room could go a long way to show Quentin Tarantino that you don't need a lot of yelling, dialogue, and forced situations to make a movie. Brie Larson (Ma) is certainly Oscar- worthy for a delicate and tortured performance that never gets derailed by any maudlin notes, and Jacob Tremblay (Jack) does some of the best child acting I've seen, even handling off-screen narration with impressive realism.We get two distinct hours. For the first hour we are trapped in Room, finding small pleasures in small things, alternating with the terror of an evil man. The second hour does something amazing: it gives you a heartfelt examination of Jack and Ma entering the world, emotionally, physically, and somewhat spiritually. Never has the simple act of walking a scruffy dog or playing with a ball in a yard meant more on screen.It's a shame so many people have never heard of Room, who all went to see the mindless action movies of this summer, who probably will never see Room.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotional and Dark, Depressing yet Uplifting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply put, "Room" is an emotional film. And it seems as though half the time you do not even know what you're feeling. Seamlessly the film manages to portray happiness in a tragic way, depressingly dark situations yet present some optimism and make you feel genuinely scared and/or worried about its fictional characters. Room is emotional in a very real sense; it's not just another movie where a romance falls apart, or where a loved one gets a terminal illness and it doesn't tug on your heart strings with cheap bullshit. Room doesn't try to trick you into feeling things, its realistic tone and grim story is enough. Not to make light of the cinematography, music or any of anything else which made the film, these are all good too, however we are really in this one for the writing and acting; the story and characters. The film follows its protagonists as they live their day to day lives trapped inside a small dirty room with no way out. Locked in by a nameless man that they call 'Old Nick,' The characters are a mother and son 'Jack,' 'Ma' has been inside this room for seven years and her son has never experienced anything beyond the room in his life. For around half of the movie we stay in the room with these characters, we as an audience never leave the room until the characters do. Personally I was beginning to feel the claustrophobia myself, the movie makes you feel as trapped as the characters are. The room feels hopeless as it does small and the atmosphere is actually quite haunting. Now though, that Jack is five years old, Ma believes that it's now time and that he is finally old enough to help her make their escape. Through a series of events, the two do make it out of the room, however we are still only about half way through the film as we follow their lives after leaving 'room.' The films point of no return; leaving 'room' is both scary and cheerful for both us and the characters in the film. The juxtaposition of being stuck in the room and the freedoms of such an open and unknown world is mind blowing. Yet, before they leave and it is uncertain whether they will succeed or not, you almost don't want them to try. Jack pleads his mother to wait till he is six years old and this is a terrifying theme throughout the film; Comfort and security over freedom. Jack's life and world may have been horrible, however the thought of leaving was frightening and almost made no sense to Jack. The movie manages to portray a horrible situation without feeling like a cheap horror movie, this is to be taken seriously and manages to portray despicable acts and conditions of the characters, without reverting to gross out moments or cartoonish dark villains. The villain of the film, is definitely disgusting and hateable, but ultimately is not the point of the film. The maturity of the film dealing with a sickening character and subject is appreciated. Another running theme of this film was the experience ? or really inexperience of five-year-old Jack. He'd never known anything beyond this one room his entire life, basically; 'room' was his world. And this is such an interesting concept to me. Jack's concepts of fiction and reality blur and at such an age he is vulnerable to information. It's important to learn the truth however almost incomprehensible due to his extremely limited knowledge. Possibly my favourite shot of the film, has Jack creating shadows with his hands in the partial sunlight that comes through via sunlight. This shot has obvious relation to 'The Allegory of the Cave' philosophical theory. Put simply, if a caveman never leaves his cave, and all he ever sees are shadows, this is what he believes in, this becomes his reality. And the same goes for the child in the film. 'Room' is all he knows, and beyond stories he's told or what he sees on their television, Jack's sense of reality is inaccurate. He knows about animals such as dogs and cats, he knows about grass and trees and he knows about general bits of information, however due to his isolation he cannot separate reality from fiction and therefore will not know which things are real and which are not. A dragon for example is as real or fake as a dog in his mind. The themes throughout the film and the emotion that these themes bring are all portrayed through the actors; who all did a fine job, but the performance that really stood out was child actor Jacob Tremblay as Jack. Children are often not the best actors, they're still young; still learning, but this kid is ahead of his time, ahead of his age really. For such a thematically complex film as well as a mature and grim one, Tremblay did an amazing job making me believe in his character, as well as his collaboration with Brie Larson as mother and son, their relationship is strong and convincing. The film gave me chills when it needed to in moments of pure intensity the beautiful moments were made that much nicer in comparison to the dreary and depressing ones. It even gave me a new perspective on the world and the way we might look at it. What if we are all experiencing some version of Jack and Ma's 'room?' But, this is just a movie review, I don't want to get too philosophical. "Room" is saddening yet uplifting. It may be hard to watch for some yet I'd think also hard to stop watching, and overall the film has the ability to change ones' perspective. "Room" is shocking, yet beautiful and most of all unforgettable. This is Drama at its' best. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Room is a touchy story about Jack and his mother that was kept isolated in a "Room" by a man who kidnapped her, raped her and got her pregnant and is using her as sexual slave for more than seven years. While Jack now five years old, spent the whole life in that "Room", not knowing that there is a life outside the "Room".I started to watch every movie nominated for Best Picture, and Room is the second one after Spotlight. I had a feeling that there wasn't good movies this year, but I'm happy to say that I was wrong.Room is another pure drama that will be stuck in my head for a long time. A masterpiece story by novelist Emma Donoghue directed by Lenny Abrahamson in perfection. Very touching, with great characters and great acting job.Jacob Tremblay is so young, I don't know if this kind of story would be a good idea for someone of his age, I mean psychologically. However, he was great and one of the things that I enjoyed most about the film. It felt like reality show. I feel sorry that he wasn't nominated for Oscar.One of the part that I liked the most was when Jack narrates his feeling inside and outside the "Room". I always enjoy the narration in movies.Story, dialogs, acting, directing and narration is great. A worth watching movie without a doubt. Different story, very well made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A mother and her son, which looks like a girl, live in a room that has no windows, a locked door, and no light other than that coming through an overhead skylight. Jack (Jacob Tremblay), a bright five-year old boy with hair down to his shoulders wakes up every morning saying hello to his universe. He does not greet the sun, the grass, the trees outside, where he could run and laugh and play like a normal five-year old but only to the objects he knows for five years as being "the real world", his world: the lamp, the sink, the plant, the refrigerator. His only friend is a mouse that he feeds, thinking that the mouse also lives in that little world, the only one real for him. Sometimes a man comes over, during the night, and then Jack must sleep in the wardrobe, not to be seen. The relationship mother-son appears to be normal: they cook, dance, laugh, stretch out, read about Alice, mother tells the tale of Monte Cristo. The poverty that surrounds them is not painful. The real pain and anger I felt when Jack could not believe that outside "the room" exists a real world, with real people, and trees, grass, leaves, seasons, snow. Then the reality strikes: captivity. A child born in captivity, because of a madman, a rapist. A story of a child whose life started in a cage having as a talisman his mother love and her tooth, thinking that "his strong" is in his long hair. Real world proves to be scarier than "the room". A movie that should be seen, a story that must be known, a boy that deserves all the awards: Jacob Tremblay.</fullReview>

Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay give amazingly true central performances as a deeply devoted mother and son, with superb support from Joan Allen, who is also wonderful in her role as a loving, deeply hurt mother and grandma and William H Macy is also striking in his brief appearance as a far too damaged dad. All credit to the crew, particularly the director, Lenny Abrahamson and Jacob's family and support team, for getting such an amazing performance out of such a young boy. We couldn't think of one to match it.I'd read the book, so knew the story and had particularly loved the fantastic idea of using a 5-year old narrator (which the film honours). My husband hadn't. Half-way through the film he was so upset that he had to beg me to reassure him that it was going to be all right. The man beside him, also with his wife, was so moved that at one point he absent-mindedly reached for my husband's hand. It's THAT moving.If you've ever been, or had, a loving mum, go and see it. If you've ever been a child, go and see it. Just GO AND SEE IT, please.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching "Room" is an intense experience for it's the story of a woman (ma) who fights for the survival of her child, the one source of happiness and strength in a very limited world, a place that could have killed her long ago. At first, we see the interaction between mother and Jack. Through the eyes of a very gifted director, we are able to almost feel their hearts beating, how their souls are almost like one. He depends on her completely because it's all he has known. She has insulated him from pain and created a world inside their prison. He's happy, and that sustains her. It's what makes her endure the visits of her kidnapper. She has become one with the child, but one day she realizes he will grow up, and this place will not be sufficient for either, especially for him. Jack is a bright and inquisitive young boy. He has learned to read, and he is beginning to wonder. She knows it won't take long for his soul to break because he's like her, a part of her: a sensitive soul that needs to grow and develop. There's much love here, but there's plenty of sadness and horror, too.One day, she fashions a plan to secure his freedom, and at first, it's not good enough, but with a modification, it succeeds, and this is barely the first half of the film because unlike other stories and film makers who take the easy road and simplify the dilemma or the problems of the main characters, this film has taken us to the edge of the precipice, and if you thought the life in the room was hell, things are about to really intensify.Transitioning into normalcy is not as simple as it's in the fairy tales, and just like Larson and Tremblay have already proved themselves as accomplished actors, their performances become even more exquisite in the second half of the story. We got to know them as they spoke about the world. We knew how simple their existence was, how controlled, and how dangerous it was, too. We became part of their world, and now as the doors of freedom are open, we begin a long road to adjustment. It is not easy. It might have more pain than we realized.Most people are happy to see Ma (Joy), but Jack represents many things to others. For those with a big heart, he's a bright and scared little boy who will most likely be o.k. after a while. It's the immediate family who have the toughest time since the transition is sudden and very emotional. Joy's mother tries the hardest, and it's a good thing she's around. Others experience a myriad of feelings which will affect both Jack and his mother. Her prison has changed her, and her expectations don't quite match her perceptions. It's at this moment that I was so impressed by Tremball's performance, which is better than most of this year's praised performances, adult or otherwise. He communicates his emotions through body gestures, glances, strong lonely yearning with his eyes, as he goes through the new trauma the big world has for him.It's a long and painful road, but it has a good resolution, one that feels real and universal, one that doesn't rely in long speeches, beautiful photography or any sort of overblown productions. This is as heartfelt as they come, giving us another reason to believe that we haven't forgotten to be human.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Naked emotion, star-making performances from writer, director, Larson and Tremblay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right from the first scene, Lenny Abrahamson shows us so much with a simple piece of information. Ma loses a tooth, making us realise she's not seen a dentist in years; Jack falls in love with a mouse because it's real, remaining us that he's likely never seen a living, breathing creature. We ache for Jack's lost innocence but also the same for his spiritually broken mother. When the two of them scream at each other, we feel the tragedy for both of them. Eventually, of course, Jack and Ma make it out of Room and Abrahamson does a terrific job at conveying Jack's terror at a world he doesn't understand. Shots from Jacob's POV are filtered, shaky and intrusive with extreme front-lighting, making us flinch back from the screen. The choice of music creates a sense of wonder but also a sense of sadness, and the inspired choice of casting the doctor to look exactly like their captor makes Jack's fear palpable. The whole film is cleverly from Tremblacy's point of view, replicating that spectator experience Jonathan Demme created in Rachel Getting Married. It is like you are there with Jack the whole time. The escape scene has the emotional resonance that Frank Darabont brought to The Shawshank Redemption, and even some of the small spats between Tremblay and Larson are reminiscent of Rian Johnson's Looper.The film breathes on the achingly beautiful performances by Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. Larson's spirit is completely broken and we learn that early on from a rape scene where Old Nick is chatting nonchalantly as if she's a normal relationship. We see naked emotion play clearly across Larson's face as she is traumatised by a terrible interview question, scared by the knowledge that there may be no way for them to rescue her even if Jack did escape, embittered by her realisation that her friends all lived normal lives, and enraged by her father's refusal to acknowledge her son. Her performance is truly spectacular, but of no less import is Jacob Tremblay. He carries the film on his tiny shoulders and does such an incredible job in portraying Jack's emotions. A scene in which he cries about his imaginary dog will make you long to console him and then a later scene where he meets an actual dog will bring an enormous smile to your face. William H. Macy feels underused but is solidly excellent in his small role as Joy's father, whilst Joan Allen is a firm hand on the final third of the film and sets up a great Oscar-scene between herself and Larson.Emma Donoghue's screenplay is well-balanced between Jack's discovery and the events actually taking place. The character of Old Nick, whilst well-acted, is a great testament to Donoghue's writing more than anything else. There is a demented sense of morality in his words that show you he feels no remorse. That is what makes him a great villain. Donoghue's superbly written scenes make the movie what it is, everything else is a vital but supporting piece. This film would have stank with a lesser screenplay.Room is a film of small scope but grand effect. In many ways it is the Boyhood of this year. There's so much naked emotion floating around in this beautiful film that it's impossible not to be touched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Room: One Skylight, Two Great Performances, and Four Walls make one great film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Room" starts in the middle of a horrifying tale of abduction with little back story and little history. And that works wonder. It places us right in the middle of the claustrophobia of the two main characters, Joy and her son Jack. The first third of the film made me almost as uncomfortable as I was during the whole masterpiece film, "The Act of Killing." There are so many times when this film could have gone awry, sappy and melodramatic. In fact, the sappiest thing about the film was the music, being far too uplifting and loud for the themes in the movie. The framing of each shot in the first-third of the movie augments the feeling of being trapped. The shots are as beautiful as they are terrifying. The acting of the two main characters is spot on, especially the five-year-old boy Jake, played by Jacob Tremblay. Brie Larson plays the complicated role of Joy, the mother, who goes through untold agony. We aren't told what happens in detail; we see it on her face, in her body.There were so many times this film could have gone for cheap sentimentality; they could have gone for the easy reconciliation and happy ending, and it didn't. Put one in the win column for small, well writing, well directed and well acted cinema that doesn't involve stunts or explosions. Rating: Pay Full Price"Room" is excellent. While it didn't play for cheap emotion and the issues it addresses are horrifying, it could have used more detail regarding the aftermath of events for the mother. The son's issues were dealt with well if not completely. The framing of the shots? Fantastic! The music? Terrible. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay deserve Oscars nominations.

		<shortDescription>Overly unrealistic and lacking depth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie has its moving moments, especially the emblematic one with the kid staring in awe at the newly discovered world, but that's about it. The story is overly unrealistic and both the psychological drama and the physical misery lack depth.17-year-old girl is kidnapped with the lure that some sick dog needs her attention. This is followed by 7 years of imprisonment in a backyard shed (the so-called "Room") and regular raping, which ? in the second year ? produces a child. The mother accepts the fruit of the relationship (named Jack) without reservations and from that moment on her only goal is to keep it safe. A goal in which she succeeds with flying colors. And so, no matter his complete isolation, the misery of his existence, and the fact that he is a constant, although unconscious, witness of his mother's abuse, at 5 Jack is both mentally and physically healthy, even happy child, he has smooth skin and complex reactions and the only sign of his unusual circumstances is his long hair...I didn't even have to use irony ? the whole thing is flat enough on its own. Actually, I see it as an insult to anyone who have lived through "the Room trauma" ? be it real, or more metaphoric. It sets ridiculous standards for the victims while what they truly need is understanding and compassion. But yeah, let's say that mother's love conquers it all and clap our hands.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just returned from the pictures after watching this film. Great performance from the young boy Jack, but doesn't carry the film.Too many unanswered questions and holes in the plot lines. The worst was:-three slows and a stop, and robocopette leads them directly to the shed??? really??? I left the pictures when they found the dog toy behind the settee. probably not a great admission for a reviewer, but it had seemed to have slipped back into maudlin and lethargy. maybe I missed the best bits, but did I really have to get into a state of boredom before I could appreciate it? just because Jacks' like was full of tedium and repetition, doesn't mean the point has to be hammered home so effectively. there is nothing wrong with slow moving films as long as it is effective.films where you wonder whats around the corner rather than hope.I have only left a film once before. Hostel.Ankles. I couldn't watch anymore, and for completely differing reasons, and neither could I tonight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The story is there... but completely out of place.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Within the first 10 minutes of this film, I was curious as to where the writer was going to take the story. Do the mother and son break out? Do they just accept their fate and live there for eternity? Does one of them die? Well, the writers did a great job of surprising me as it seems as if they have never heard of the three act structure.The production value, I digress, was very well done. Good direction, excellent performances, cinematography, etc. For a small budget, it was well done. That's about all I have to say I liked about this film.Back to the story... I'm not going to spoil it here, but as I was saying before the film doesn't follow a three act structure at all. Some films can get away with this, namely some cheesy 80's comedies, but these are comedies, not dramas.In room, there's no call to action, journey to overcome a goal, obstacles in the way of that goal, point of no return, etc. There are subplots that have their own beats, but not a main story.There is sort of a climax at one part. It happens literally half way through the movie, and then the rest of the movie is the resolution, for a whole hour in which you'll be checking the time hoping to god the movie will be over soon. If you have ever thought at the end of a movie, once a character has overcome their weaknesses and achieved their goals, what happens after the film fades to black? The character ought to go on with life, where he or she will face more challenges to come. This film almost seems like it has a fourth act that merely explores this idea. It delves way too far into the aftermath of the events that happen only an hour into the film.There is also a slush of subplots that don't know where they want to weave themselves into the story as they aimlessly fly throughout the film. Here's the beef to my arguments (SPOILERS):First, as I've mentioned before, the story is horribly structured. It starts with about 40 minutes of repetitive introduction, followed by a 20 minute long second act in which they break out, and an hour long resolution in which Jack and his mother deal with the real world.Some may say that it does follow the three act structure and that I'm just missing the real story, which is Jack growing into a world outside of Room. Well here's the problem; if The introduction had included the escape, and then the second act focused on Jack struggling to fit into the regular world until he overcomes his fears, then I'd say it's appropriate to say the story is focused on a boy being exposed to a world he's never seen before. This isn't the case however, as Jack isn't exposed to the real world until the second half of the movie, and this story line is barely glossed over in my opinion.In this movie it seems you have three plots: -Ma's growth and struggle as a kidnapped mother -Jack's coming of age into the world outside of room -The escape from Room.The film tries to put all of these plots into one piece, not focusing on one in particular, which failed to engage me in the story at all. There are also plenty of loose ends and unexplored characters that I could go into, but I'd rather not.Overall, this film reminds me of Prisoners and Sicario. It's a story that has potential, but seems like a first draft of a script. There are too many subplots and not a core story that it focuses on, nor is there a proper three act structure to draw the audience in. The performances and production value is great, but other than that, I thought it was a waste of my time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Series of Plodding Events</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the start of Room, a young woman and her five-year-old son are living in the titular edifice, a backyard shed. The woman (Brie Larson) has always told Jack (Jacob Tremblay) that "outer space" is all that exists outside Room; as far as Jack is concerned, this is the gospel truth and the universe consists of Room and Room alone.It is not giving anything away to note that Ma and Jack escape Room, as the movie is more about the ability of each to cope with the outside world. For Jack, every step and every breath outside is a wholly new experience. Ma, despite having lived for 17 years before coming to Room, encounters different obstacles ? the world has moved on, and she doubts her own ability as a mother to Jack.I had been expecting a suspenseful drama-thriller about a daring escape, given the various synopses I'd read. (The movie is based on a novel by Emma Donoghue, which is itself loosely based on real events.) Much of the first half of the film, though, concentrates on life inside Room for Ma and Jack. Ma uses her strong will and infinite patience to convince Jack for five years that all is well and that what they have is a normal life, that what they see on television is not real, but everything from the single bed to the lidless toilet tank is definitely real. Ma sacrifices as much as she can to keep Jack happy and (relatively) safe, even to the point of giving herself over to her captor on a regular basis in exchange for food and other items for Jack and herself.To say that this first half moves slowly would be to understate things. We don't just get a slice of the life that the duo leads; we get the entire pie, and most of it just isn't all that exciting or intriguing. We do get to see a little into the characters of the characters, pardon the phrasing. We see that Jack doesn't like to not get his way or to have his worldview challenged. Then again, who does at age 5? We see that Ma is often calm but firm with her young charge. It's a small Room, after all; no need to go nuclear when there's really no point to it. In any event, much time is spent watching their everyday sheltered lives. Because the general plot involved their lives beyond Room, I began to grow impatient: Were they going to spend the entire movie in Room, only to escape in the final minutes? Why wouldn't anything happen? The fact that Ma and Jack would eventually escape left the first half of the movie perfectly devoid of suspense. Although still waters do often run deep, I didn't really feel like I was getting a lot out of watching a whole lot of nothing.Once they do escape, though, things pick up. The focus quickly shifts from a struggle for survival to a struggle to understand. Ma's parents, played by Joan Allen and William H. Macy, have different reactions to the return of their daughter and the arrival of their new (to them) grandson. In the five years since Ma's abduction, her parents have separated; her dad lives on the other side of the country now, and her mom lives with her friend Leo (Tom McCamus). With Ma's return, there's a lot of media hype, and lawyers, atop a potent array of stress factors. Escaping may have been the easy part.The acting is uniformly terrific. Larson's work is powerful, evocative, and heart-wrenching, and it's definitely award worthy. Allen and Macy also excel with perhaps the best work in their respective careers, and that's saying something. Young Tremblay is also very good ? as is his character, a plucky, long-haired cherub who's more at home in Room than in the outside world (and with good reason).But the acting cannot overcome what's basically a very turgid script. Room is punchless at its core, and it would be a total waste if it weren't for the Herculean efforts of its talented cast. When there is no action, I look for meaning. When there is no meaning or action, I look for the exit. Room suffers from spending too much time contemplating things and not enough time doing them ? or at least discussing them. Forget the action, I wouldn't have minded seeing more reaction. The first half of the movie could have been subtitled "A Series of Plodding Events." The second half goes a long way toward saving the first, thanks in part to additional characters and a fresh setting, but it's not enough to save the entire movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Room is one of those movies that people read rave reviews about and then adopt it. Having just watched a UK preview screening I wanted to let you know what kind of a movie it really is.For starters it is really...well...cold. The director has tried a silent approach to take out the emotion and concentrate on the subject matter but has gone too far and left it a bland and dim affair. I was expecting a lot more from the confined direction but not once did I get feeling of claustrophobia. Every character was also very one dimensional and stereotypical.Too many issues all going at once but none of them were dealt with properly. It's not a bad movie but I think the bland direction and lack of narrative let it down...I would imagine the book would be far,far superior. Still worth a trip to the cinema because I love movies on the big screen...where they should be...and it will not show well on T,V or DVD.One of those movies that try to make you think but come across as somewhat pretentious and believes it's own hype..will not win a single nomination...let alone an award.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The scenario is interesting enough. A mother and her little son are imprisoned for 7 years by a man in small shed halfway down his garden. We think of the horrors experienced by similar victims publicized in the media and we are immediately intrigued to learn more about this phenomenon. But very sadly this film does not fulfill its potential. It concentrates almost entirely on what appears to be a hackneyed feminist agenda - namely the love of a mother for her son - rather than breaking new ground and explaining to us how and why such things occur. In short it leaves far more questions unanswered than it manages to solve.There are too many absurdities to list in this production.With only a single door between her and freedom it beggars belief that the mother was not able to force it open or make her escape at the moment it was opened. There was a skylight to the roof but in 7 years she had not the ingenuity to smash it and escape. There were various metal objects around the room and it would not have been impossible.The man enters the room and sleeps with her regularly. Indeed their relationship seems quite calmly domestic. He does not need to force sex upon her but they simply undress and relate as if normal husband and wife. And both are able to sleep peacefully at night as if everything was normal. She complains at the food and he tells her that he has no work and struggles to keep them both. He buys presents for the boy and seems reasonable normal and decent.It doesn't make any sense. Any man who would imprison a woman and child in a tiny shed for 7 years must be insane. And yet every action of this man is rational. And we are told nothing about the origins of the story. How did her relationship with the man ever materialize? How long after meeting did he imprison her? How did it ever happen? Instead of covering this ground we are subjected to nearly two hours of thoroughly predictable motherly behavior as if we could not imagine it ourselves. Brie Larson executes the task quite competently but this was not an Oscar winning performance. She merely left her Gucci gowns in the closet, left her make up in the drawer and acted herself. Her award was purely a boost to the underlying feminist message of the film.But the boy was something else. Jacob Tremblay dominated the film in every way. His mood swings, his emotions, his play as a boy half his real age and his capture of our imagination in every scene was nothing short of masterful. Not only should he have been given the Oscar but his performance illustrates the need to introduce a new category in the annual ceremony: Best performance by a child actor. He certainly deserved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is Claustrophobia at its best! I usually hate these sort of movies, but this movie somehow made it work! You would naturally think how could been in whole movie work so well without been boring? Well, this movie made it work. The direction and acting in this movie as just so powerful that it could not be boring for a second.Ma and 5 year old Jack have been placed in a room for years and years by a man by the name of "Old Nick." Old Nick never lets them leave. Jack has never left this room before. Ma somehow manages to make a small little room the whole world to Jack. She manages to convince jack how fun it is been in one little room, and she convinces us too! Then one day Jack escapes to make a terrifying and thrilling journey to self discovery.Brie Larson was amazing as the Mother who has been abused and is raising a kid to be strong and show him the real world. She deserved the Oscar. I remember seeing Brie Larson is "21 Jump Street" and thinking she will never make it in a movie like this. I was proved wrong once again! My hates off to Jacob Tremblay who played 5 year old Jack. He's one of the best Child Actors I have seen. He made every scene seem so believable. Director Lenny Abrahamson brought this movie to life with his amazing skills.Great movie. I would have loved to hear about "Old Nick" and seen more of Ma's parents on screen, but that's only mild. Not even close to destroy this whole film's powerful message. I give this 4/5 stars. -Autistic Jay</fullReview>

I loved the fact that the movie focused on what happens after, which is a big deal on its own. Everyone seems to think that it's all about getting out of a hardship when it's also about handling the aftermath and making it over such an experience. This was not a sad movie. It was a movie about courage, about never letting go and keeping it together. I will forever remember the dialogue when she says to the kid "I am not a good mom" and he replies, "well, you're mom". This was the one phrase that defined the movie. Nothing more needed there. This movie, while not a 9 or a 10, it's one of these movies that will stay with you forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Room is the story about 5 year old Jack (Jacob Tremblay) and his mother Ma (Brie Larson) who are a typical loving mother and energetic son filled with curiosity and imagination in an anything but typical situation. They are both living, surviving, trapped in a 10 by 10 foot space that Ma has called Room in her best efforts to protect Jack from the absolutely unthinkable nightmare that is the only life he has ever known, a life she isn't sure will ever be anything else. However, miraculously, through Ma's ingenuity and guts and Jack's courage, one day, they escape. With their 10 x 10 Room behind them, they face a new world (literally) of hopes, possibilities, challenges and fears. I wasn't sure if I wanted to watch Room or Spotlight next with the Oscars upon us, but a good friend of mine, Steve Williams, strongly recommended Room. I'll be watching Spotlight next, but thank you to Steve for the recommendation. It was powerful. Larson has had supporting roles in Trainwreck, The Gambler and Don Jon along with multiple TV appearances, but this is her first leading role and she also looks right at home. In fact, her performance has not only earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Actress, but many critics are predicting she will go home with the win and after watching the movie, it would be an award well-deserved. Room opens on Jack's 5th birthday. We find out later that Ma was abducted 7 years earlier and Jack was born and raised in Room. Her abductor makes regular visits (conjugal in nature) with Jack tucked away in Wardrobe. We already know from the preview that they do eventually escape and are given a chance to have a life outside Room, so that's not a spoiler there. I won't give it all away, but the escape will leave you breathless with white knuckles as you cling to whatever you have nearby. I really only had two minor issues with the movie. First, after she is reunited with her parents, Ma is unsettled to discover they had split and her mother (Joan Allen) had met a new man. Her father (William H. Macy) flies home to be there for the reunion, but quickly leaves and can't even look at Jack or address him. And then we don't see him again and are left wondering what happened. The second minor issue I had was that the preview uses part of its limited time to share a scene after their escape between Jack and Ma in which Jack is concerned about their abductor finding them again. Ma reassures him that it will never happen. And it doesn't come up again at all. It's handled just fine in the movie, but the issue is that the preview seemed to indicate it would be a factor in the aftermath. It wasn't. The aftermath of adjusting to the real world was dramatic enough as it was and didn't need to be in the preview.Room is a touching, heart-warming, intense, gripping, original and well-acted and well-told story that I thoroughly enjoyed. I predicted a solid 4 stars: worth the money in the theatre, worth watching again, and has a good chance of making it to my home collection, and that's exactly what I'm sticking with.marksmoviemind.blogspot.com</fullReview>

Very subtly done. A child is deprived of any experiences for his first five years except his mothers love in a cloistered room devoid of nature. This allows the watcher of the movie to experience this hell vicariously which is very disturbing and upsetting. I admired the mother for protecting her son as much as possible from her suffering yet in the end once she was free from that responsibility she had a breakdown and could no longer function.

		<fullReview>A fantastic mix of genre, this film is a psychological thriller, a horror film, a drama, a character study and all of this it is doing at the same time seamlessly in what is one of the darkest films of the year.This story is incredible and opens up naturally to an endless list of themes that get explored and there is so much that can be done with this core material that it would be practically impossible to include it all, that's why Room succeeds. It understands what it is and doesn't try to reach too far out of its zone in what would certainly result overbearing. By putting the focus solely on the mother/son relationship it doesn't feel like the film is missing anything.I have been telling everyone since I saw her in 21 Jump Street in 2012 that Brie Larson would be going a long way, this is proof of that and whilst I still reckon Rooney Mara or Kate Winslet to be the best actresses of the year, she sticks to a close third. There were times, especially in the first half, where everything, every emotional beat fell on her performance and she managed to rip your heart away. The way in which she portrays a mother's worst fear is harrowing. Yet, her fictional son, steals the show away from her. Look it is easy to get too excited about a child performance just because it is good, but this is not what's happening here. Jacob Tremblay has possibly upstaged my favorite young performance ever (Tye Sheridan in "Mud") and I didn't think that possible. He really made a character come to life, there were no filters, it was a true performance that made him disappear from the screen.I think that has also to be credited with Abrahamson fantastic work. This is one of those few films where you really feel the director's presence and it doesn't get in the way of the film. He really had a strong vision for this and you see how powerfully it makes the transition to the screen. You feel the confidence and the inspiration.I had a fantastic experience with the film, whilst it doesn't manage to achieve what other sad films like, the example I always use, "Requiem for A Dream", in other words to be depressing but at the same time give you that rush of adrenaline and experience you kind of want to relive, it is still a deep and insightful drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Room</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Screenwriter Emma Donoghue (adapting her own novel) designed an intriguing structure which makes Room difficult to categorize. Is it a thriller, a domestic drama or a character study filtered through an unusual perspective? Don't worry; it's a rhetoric question, and I prefer not to get into too many details, because the less the spectator knows, the better the story will work. So, I will just say that Room is a provocative and very interesting movie with an innovative premise, amazing performances and solid direction. The story is generally developed through the eyes of the kid Jack, something which offers an incomplete vision of the facts; but thanks to the screenplay and Brie Larson's extraordinary performance, we can quickly fill in the holes in order to realize the scale of the situation and the way in which the main characters assimilated it. But that's just the beginning. It can be said that the "conventional" ending of the film happens during its half, creating a brusque and significant thematic and narrative transformation which brings new challenges to the screenplay and the performances. Fortunately, both elements work, and they take us to an ending which isn't necessarily happy, but definitely satisfactory. As I previously said, Larson makes a magnificent work in her role (in my humble opinion, she should have already won an Oscar for her performance in Short Term 12), while the kid Jacob Tremblay also brings an excellent performance, absolutely natural and convincing from the beginning to the end. On the negative side of Room, it was a bit difficult for me to adapt to the second half after the suspense of the beginning; but that's when the previously mentioned character study comes into scene, and once I comprehended that strategy, I recovered my interest. Even though I liked Room pretty much, I don't have particular wishes to watch it again; however, it deserves a recommendation because of its originality and unusual execution. And, personally, it confirmed me the damage the trailers make to the films they pretend to sell. If you are interested in watching Room, don't watch any of its trailers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania.Here is what a professional film critic from New York Post has to say about "Room" (2015): "Dopey as the film is on a plot level, it's equally vapid in its psychology". Here is what i have to say to this "professional film critic" - "Dude, please, change you profession, ASAP, thank you"."Room" (2015) is THE best drama that came from 2015. It features great performance by Brie Larson for which she deservedly must win Oscar, great supporting work from veteran familiar faces, and probably THE best acting from a child i have ever seen. This movie could have felt apart very quickly if it weren't greatly played by actor portraying Jack, in my opinion the key character in this story. Fortunately Jacob Tremblay gives unforgettable, jaw-dropping performance that glues this movie together. Superbly crafted by director Lenny Abrahamson and amazingly written by Emma Donoghue (based on her own novel), "Room" tells the hard, gritty, and sometimes very difficult to imagine story, that unfortunately has happened in a real world just months ago (without children as i read). The first hour of this movie is simply a masterpiece. I won't spoil anything, but the second hour goes in a different direction, but never looses it's reality or great movie craftsmanship. I was waiting for this movie months after i heard about it, and finally seeing it i'm so glad it delivered everything i have hoped for - not that i wanted to see such a story - i wanted it to see happening on the screen, in a movie world. "Room" is as good as movie drama gets it.Overall, i can't praise this movie more - this is the best movie that i saw in 2015. There are more movies from Best Picture contenders that i haven't seen it yet, but those will be more visceral experiences. "Room" is different kind of drama. It unfold just in front of, keeps you glued to the screen for all it's running time 1 h 50 min. Sometimes it will be difficult to watch, but don't turn away - this is the best movie of 2015.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally heart-breaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This just... this just... This movie just broke me. When I started watching this, I taught it would be sad and everything, but not THIS kind of sad. I mean, I cried in most part of the film. I cried watching a boy eat cereal, that's how powerful this movie is. With a very hard and deep topic, solid performances and the greatest photographer, screen-writers, directors,etc ever, Room will be one of my all-time-favorite-heart-breaking-movies. You want to cry? Just give this movie like, ten minutes, ant then we talk. Another great thing about Room is that, yeah, it's heart-breaking, it deals with a pretty taboo topic and is very real; but at the same tame is fast-passing and its so easy to connect with the characters... And I just love the hopeful message at the end.This movie was simply too much for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>although what Ma and Jack are suffering is not a thing that likely happen to you or any one you know but this film makes you feel related to them and it leaves you emotionally drained. the moment jack returns to his ma you feel relived, and jack explanation to his surroundings gets you to feel absurd.when Ma was having the interview and doubt got to her about what she did for jack was the right thing it gets to you either. this was the first film i watch made by Lenny Abraham son but now i am sure there will be a lot to come Brie Larson performance was so neat and made me forget she was acting and i believe she is the closest to the academy award this year</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Room - a film about the ineffable bond between Mother and child despite horrific circumstances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kidnapped at fourteen and locked up in a room for seven years with a five year old child conceived through violence, director Lenny Abrahamson's film inspired by Emma Donoghue's novel of the same name - a composite of true events - is titled ROOM; a delicate and harrowing story of two people caught in a private space, where they live a life of extreme tenderness and tension. The actors are excellent, Brie Larson as Ma and Jacob Tremblay as Jack create a home/neighborhood/community/country inside a small, cluttered "room" with occasional shafts of light beaming down from a skylight that displays the stars and moving clouds - the outside "world" a dream beyond their reach.A television sputtering on the blink allows that other "world" entry, but for young Jack, what he sees flickering on the screen is both real and "make believe" ; distinctions have been erased and are unknowable. The relationship between mother and child is stunning - the connection between them is acutely poignant, as if the umbilical cord had never been severed. Days are spent exercising, running back and forth- sharp turns are necessary after a few steps, making us aware of the claustrophobic feel of the space; and Ma's attempt to teach her son to read and maintain a somewhat "normal" existence is impressive and heart-rending. Jack's poetic and descriptive use of words to describe his circumscribed environment invokes the originality and charm of expressing and interpreting what we see and feel through language tailored to one's unique cosmos. We also witness the chilling visits of "Old Nick" her captor whose step on the stairs on his way to the "room" is a sign for little Jack to hide and feign sleep behind a shuttered closet door - the presence of "evil" glimpsed through cracks in the battered and weatherworn slats.When Jack turns five his mother decides he is old enough to participate in an escape plan involving resilience and courage which eventually succeeds. Mother and child are hospitalized and the second half of ROOM begins. How to acclimate one's self to being separate individuals, after the powerful link between them is sundered - a tie which was both nourishing and restrictive? Accommodation to "freedom" begins, and the aching awareness of the familiar becoming unfamiliar, as well as the unfamiliar becoming familiar, are daunting and formidable.ROOM is an exquisitely fragile story of the pliancy of the human resolve to survive and adapt to suffocating circumstances and adjust to the shock of change after flight and rescue. A child's ability to embrace the magic of his new environs - as one Dr. mentioned in examining Jack, "he is still plastic"; and an adult's more complex road to acclimatization which includes grieving the loss of a singular bond where the "other" completes you to the exclusion of everyone else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coming to terms</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best movies depicting a strong parent-child relationship, after the recent 'Babadook'. Those who watched that can find plenty of irony when they get to compare the plot of this one with Jennifer Kent's masterwork.Though I had seen trailers to this one going in, along with having an idea of all of the plot turns, the narration still managed to hold me, and most of the well behaved audience, in a vise-like grip, all the way through. Irony is used more than once within this plot itself, to tie everything up quite badly, and though I'm a fan of keeping things ambiguous, this approach does have its merits, especially as used by the director here.The performances (Brie Larson deserves the Oscar - her performance in 'Short term 12' was overlooked, as does Jacob Tremblay, ably supported by Joan Allen, Sean Bridgers, and William H Macy, in a rare performance, in all of 2 scenes, but hey....) are all top notch, and the minimalist approach in each of the movie's technical departments holds up against tough scrutiny, including the use of its score (fantastic, unique...), works to perfection, and greatly helps in putting us in the middle of the protagonists' lives, front-and- center.The best movie I've seen all year this year, in spite of some annoying, and unnecessary censorship. It was strange to note the use of the 2.35:1 aspect ratio, though many mainstream and Indie filmmakers, considering the scope of the subject matter, may have gone in for the narrower 1.85:1 aspect ratio. Not complaining. I very much prefer this aspect-ratio, and it works fabulously, especially when one plot device has an important aspect of depicting an evolving perspective of the outside world, that's beautifully realized, while also being subtle.Also appreciate the numerous opportunities not taken by the makers to make this a sloppy melodrama, our a powerful drama that plays to the galleries, while preying on base emotions.Not to be missed. I might go enjoy it once more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Innocent Take on A Dark, Multifaceted Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film Room tells the story of 5-year-old Jack and his mother, Joy, told in Jack's perspective. All of his life, Jack has lived in a small world known as "Room," which his mother convinces is his reality, and that everything beyond is fantasy. The room is small, fixed with only a bathroom, a small kitchen, a television set, and a skylight. They essentially live in an average bedroom.To the audiences, it becomes apparent that their living situation is much darker than Jack perceives it. Through her sugar-coated stories, Joy explains to Jack why they are in "Room;" Joy was abducted as a teenager and kept in a security-locked garden shed by a man only known as "Old Nick." When Jack becomes old enough, Joy uses him to finally free the two of them from their prison. From there, Jack experiences the outside world for the first time and begins adjusting to his new life beyond "Room." What makes Room such a great film is that it places the audience into the world of Jack. It lets the audience experience how Jack comes to know "Room" as his whole world, and how he processes seeing the real, outside world for the first time. The photography employs hyper-focusing on objects in "Room" to accentuate Jack's familiarity and never shows the outside world until Jack finally escapes. From there, the direction of the film manages to make the audience feel so acquainted with Room that everything else seems alien for a moment.The film is multiple films at once, which is a good thing. The entire premise of the film touches on Platonic themes explored in the famous The Allegory of the Cave and incorporates those themes into a contemporary issue, making it philosophical. At the same time, the film deals with the emotional drama and friction that occurs not only with Jack, but also with Joy. Joy struggles with trying to teach Jack about the outside world, as well as trying to gain her family's acceptance of Jack, since she is dealing with the fact that Jack is Old Nick's child, while dealing with the media circus surrounding her story. The film details the emotional experiences and side effects that occur when one leaves the world and sees it for the first time again. It's philosophical, psychological, and emotional.Fantastic performance from Brie Larson as Joy; she encapsulates the deep emotional scars that her character carries from Room. She takes on multiple roles as Joy; a strong mother figure for Jack, but also a helpless, adjusting woman to her family. Jacob Tremblay gives an excellent performance as Jack as well; he helps bring the film's innocent perspective to life and provides a great emotional dynamic and contrast to Joy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow that is what comes to mind when I think of Room and especially when I think of Jacob Tremblay's performance. Room has one of, if not, the best child acting performances of all time.No doubt Director Lenny Abrahamson worked his ass off to make this possible along with the rest of the cast and crew which also do a tremendous job to make this film come to life.One thing that I think makes this film so great is it's screenplay. It is written by someone who knows the source material more than anyone, the books author Emma Donoghue. I loved how events in Jack's life where told by his extremely imaginative and optimistic point of view even if deep down what he is describing is extremely dark and traumatic. The whole film opts for a hopeful, feel good tone which I appreciated as it easily could have been much darker.Since I saw her in the indie flick Short Term 12 I remember saying that one day Brie Larson would win an Oscar. I may be right as she beautifully portrays a loving mother who is strong when she needs to be for her son. It's a fantastic performance with a believable on screen bond between the two leads. Although Brie Larson being Oscar worthy, Jacob Tremblay's mesmerising lead role in the film outshone her by far, but this may be due to personal expectations.Go see Room, it is an extremely well made film from it's wonderfully unique screenplay (and dialogue), it's astonishing child and adult acting and of course it's directing that has successfully brought everything together as we cut the cord and say "Hello Jack!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This wonderful film might easily be over looked with the likes of Star Wars, Hateful 8, The Revenant and Creed taking up most of the headlines but this is such a wonderful film, don't let it slip away without giving it a watch.Initially set in one small room where a Mother (Bree Larson) and her 5 year old son (a spellbinding performance by Jacob Tremblay) are held hostage. From the first shot you're instantly struck by the superb cinematography and the way one room can be portrayed. The simple and beautifully easy way of life for the 5 year old boy is fascinating to watch and draws you into their world with ease.It's a long, slow film but doesn't feel like it in either case. Full of emotional, nail biting scenes it's a brilliant roller-coaster of emotions; you can't beat the odd tear of happiness when watching a film.Bree Larson is up for Best Actress at the Oscars for this role and it's easy to see why, some wonderful acting on her part and indeed the entire (quite small) cast. This is a delightful film and I'd absolutely recommend taking the time to see this one.</fullReview>

Brie Larson is amazing and very much deserving of the Oscar this year, and Jacob Tremblay's performance as her son Jack, is stunning. Despite its grim subject matter about the complexity of the relationship between a mother and her child that being kept captive, "Room" never wallows in darkness, but instead stares defiantly into the light and the hope. It is an emotionally powerful story and an honest film that is great through its simplicity. The script from Emma Donoghue is truly spectacular.

This movie takes you from being mad and frustrated, to crying nonstop in seconds. It makes you giggle at some of the innocence that Jack has and it makes you feel grateful for what you have. It has been one of the best movies I have seen in the year, with amazing performance from "Ma" and "Jack". It doesn't need the physical and evident violence to make you feel it. At all times it's possible to feel the deep, strong shocking life that is being shown.Definitely a movie, that I might not re-watch so often, but for sure will go into the collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rounding out the Best Picture nominees that I hadn't already seen (I'll be getting to the rest, don't you worry), is Room. This one is about, according to IMDb:After five-year-old Jack and his mother escape from the enclosed surroundings that Jack has known his entire life, the boy makes a thrilling discovery."A strange one, based on a book that I haven't read. So, I won't be making any comparisons to the book in this review. Plus, an adaptation should be able to stand alone, and not require extra reading to be a complete experience. Moving on.Ultimately Room is a success, it's got some pretty great performances and direction, and the movie is put together really well. Brie Larson does a really great job, and you are pulled into her world and really feel her frustrations. Jacob Tremblay is massively annoying, but I think that falls directly in line with his character. While Jack and Ma are stuck in Room, you feel the tension that the small space creates in very believable ways. Still though, he's really irritating.One of the biggest standouts of this movie is the editing. Especially once Jack escapes from the titular Room. You see the world from his perspective, and the way the scenes are shot and edited together fill you with a very real feeling of being overwhelmed, and experiencing an entire world that you've never seen. It's nice to see filmmakers who know how to SHOW and not tell.This certainly won't be making any of my "favourite movies ever" lists, but it really does work to communicate an effective story. It's not my pick for Best Picture either, but I'm not going to pretend that it's unwatchable.This one is up for Best Picture, Best Lead Actress (Brie Larson), Best Directing, and Best Adapted Screenplay. There's a good chance for adapted screenplay or maybe Lead Actress, but those are the strongest impressions for me.The main characters are Ma and Jack, so you do have a solid female character driving the movie. She's pretty dynamic and interesting too, the things that she is willing to do (or more specifically, have Jack do) in order to escape are pretty intense and staggering. That said, like Brookyln, this movie is lacking in the department of characters who are not cisgendered, heterosexual, white people. (With that total sitting at zero, once again).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A prison is certainly always synonymous with a room where the arrest or punish someone who has conviction. But what if in fact the prison does not always serve to restrain an inmate? What if the prison is actually a place that offers privacy and comfort for its occupants? All the questions about prisons, prisoners, and discussed through the perspective of freedom that could be considered interesting in this film. "Room" is an adaptation of a Emma Donoghue's best seller novel, winner of various awards. Emma also wrote the script for this Lenny Abrahamson (Frank, What Richard Did) movie. "Room" starring Brie Larson, Jacob Tremblay, Sean Bridgers, Joan Allen and William H. Macy. I should let you know that this review is contain SPOILER, because it is difficult to discuss this film without having to mention the important points on the core story of the film, so it would be better if you watch the film first before continuing to read."Room" tells the story of Joy (Brie Larson) and his son, who was five years old, Jack (Jacob Tremblay). They both day-to-day life in a room. Although the room is not very large area, but it has a volume that was already enough for Joy and Jack to survive. All their basic needs are there, ranging from bed, TV, dining table, heating, bathtub, toilet, and a kitchen for cooking. Every day they were also supplied by Old Nick (Sean Bridgers), even every Sunday, Old Nick will give something that Joy and Jack want."Room" has a touch of philosophical about life in restraints. We will continue to be made &#x200b;&#x200b;thoughtfully and wondered whether the true meaning of freedom. Through voice over from Jack we will be invited to see the world from his perspective. Jack, who was born and grew up in that room would see the world in a different way. For Jack, the world was limited to the room where he and his mother lived. Therefore all the things that he had never seen in the room will be considered not real by Jack. All of it made &#x200b;&#x200b;Jack's perspective on the world to be so narrow. But Jack actually enjoy it, just enough for him to stay in that room, all his needs are met, then there is no reason for Jack to look for something new to the outside world.Meanwhile, Joy has a different problem. Joy was formerly a woman who had his day with normal, therefore, certainly she will feel tremendous restraint as a result was confined in the room. Her desire to return to live freely so high. This causes the present conflict between the characters Joy and Jack, Joy wants freedom, while Jack was very comfortable with his &#x200b;&#x200b;life and so lazy to look for something new. All the contradictions and problems are present not just end there. Entering the second half of the film, "Room" slaps us by presenting the new problems. Once freed from the room, the character of Joy and Jack are confronted with a reality that does not match with their expectations. Joy is so wanted freedom, without realizing it now instead turned into someone trying to curb anything. On the other hand, Jack is already very comfortable living in the room, to be very surprised and unprepared to face real life. The outside world was not like what's in Jack's head. It made &#x200b;&#x200b;Jack becomes difficult to adapt to the existing environment.The two parts in this film makes us so constantly thinking and contemplating what the real meaning of freedom. When Joy and Jack was out of the room and get the freedom they want, when they returned it was also getting a cage with different forms, it is physically they were freed, but not with their souls. From here we can take a lesson that freedom or something we want does not always correspond to what we expect. Sometimes, something that we think is best for us it is something very bad for us. All contemplation of the meaning of life and freedom that can be said is full of complexity successfully delivered well by Emma Donoghue, make all the tricky thing was able to penetrate easily into our deepest hearts, and raises questions that will continue to arise in our brain.One more element that successfully made &#x200b;&#x200b;"Room" appeared outstanding is the acting from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. Brie performed perfectly as a woman who "corrupted", we will be able to understand all the suffer that Joy experienced, due to the confined and sexually abused for seven years. In order to get the maximum results for the play, Brie Larson made &#x200b;&#x200b;preparations to confine himself for months and do a strict diet. While Jacob Tremblay success leads us to feel to be a five years old, boy, who for the first time seeing the real world, after all this time just to live in a small room together with her &#x200b;&#x200b;mother. We will understand why Jack felt fear, wonder, once amazed to see the outside world that has never been imagined by him earlier. The power of chemistry presented Brie and Jacob was spelled out very remarkable. They were like a real mother and child, there is no distance and stiffness that occurs, all flowed very naturally.Brilliant directing from Lenny Abrahamson, the great script from Emma Donoghue, and a dazzling performance from Brie Larson, Jacob Tremblay success makes "Room" as one of the best film in 2015. "Room" is also an example of a movie that perfectly successful capture all aspects of life. We will be laughing, crying, and pondered with him. A movie with a wonderful floated like a poem from a first class poet.</fullReview>

Her son Jack(Jacob Tremblay, with a stunningly believable performance) share the screen together for a long stretch and are absolutely riveting in this heart breaking film. Joy has somehow been able to teach Jack to read and expanded his vocabulary to a high level while trapped in hell. Through sheer willpower they eventually exchange one form of emotional torture for another. The story does not go the way I expected it to, and this is not a criticism. Life is not a bowl of cherries with everything working out in the end. Room is a realistic view of the world carried with two outstanding leads in Larson and Tremblay.

		<shortDescription>Room</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the films coming out last year, I would definitely have to say that Room was one of my most anticipated releases and one of the films I was most looking forward to. Having now seen the film, I must say that it did not disappoint. I was mentioning in my review for Brooklyn about how we are getting a lot of really good female driven films that have great female performances and great perspectives from a woman's point of view and I would certainly add Room to that list as well. Room, is not based upon a true story, but the events in the film were most likely taken out of the newspaper headlines because we have had a lot of these cases surface and come to light within the past couple of years. The film does an excellent job of conveying what being trapped in a small space would have been like and while the film is quite disturbing at times and leaves you with an unsettled feeling it is also emotionally very powerful and also has moments of great beauty and humanity thrown into the film giving it a wonderful balance of both tragedy, loss and despair as well as hope and love and knowing that with time that everything will turn out okay. The two lead performances from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are amazing and two of the best performances of this past year, or really any year lately. Larson has proved what a talented actress she is with films like Short Term 12 and now Room will definitely be the film she will receive a much deserved Oscar for. I was really in disbelief though that Jacob Tremblay did not receive an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Jack. Here is a young kid who delivered one of the best child performances I think I have ever seen in a film and he proved himself totally capable of handling and delivering a performance in what is an emotionally really intense film and one that I think even people more than half, or triple his age would find difficulty in doing, but he makes his performance so natural and believable and we believe every second what he is thinking and going through and with his total fascination with the world and the things around him. This was a great oversight for the Academy by not nominating him because it was certainly one of the top performances of last year and worthy of an award. I am so glad that Brie Larson was nominated though and her performance is so great that I know she will be walking away with Oscar gold. Here is a character who goes through the unthinkable and yet while she still struggles during and after her circumstances, we see what a brave and independent woman this is and how for all the years in captivity she put her young son, Jack and his needs in front of her own and always looking after his best was just amazing and completely heart warming to watch. As others have said this film truly captures the deep and personal relationship between a mother and son and the endless love that goes with it. Larson's character is loving and caring for Jack, but we also see how she is strong and even later in the film while dealing with depression and trauma for what she went through we are completely with her every step of the way and again this is such a beautifully natural and realistic performance and one that must have been extremely emotionally draining and challenging to play each and every day, but Larson pulls it off flawlessly and is totally deserving of what is sure to be her first of many Oscars. The film would unfortunately maybe be too difficult for some to watch because of the heavy emotional content and the subject matter of the film, but I would challenge any serious film goers to give the film a chance anyways because it is such a wonderful cinematic experience and one that will surely move you and challenge you in many ways. Often throughout the film as I mentioned earlier, there is also scenes of love, family and maybe even in a sense coming to terms with yourself and the events of your life and these such moments did bring tears to my eyes and deeply moved me. This is a film where we certainly see that there are a lot of bad people in the world who do terrible things to one another, but the film does not let us lose hope because we are also confronted and experience the love between this mother and son and a relationship that does get challenged, but never broken and the strength that family and the right people in your life can have. This is not a film about despair, or the evils of mankind and yet while it does deal with that, this is overall a film about hope and overcoming your past and struggles and finding your peace in life even after a terrible trauma which is further helped by your loved ones. The film is certainly realistic and gritty at times, but all the more natural and real because of it and this is one of the most emotional and best cinematic experiences I have had of last year because we identify with these characters every step of the way and we feel hope and compassion for them and in many ways see that the outside world and things in it are truly beautiful and a wonder to behold and that personal growth and healing can happen to us all no matter what our circumstances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The depth and quality in Room stretches further than most emotional, heartbreaking films. If you're aware of the Fritzl case back in 2008, or any similar besides, there's a fair few hardships to view when watching Lenny Abrahamson's rare gem. Brie Larson, known as Ma, has been trapped in 'room' for several years. Her son Jack (Jacob Tremblay), who's just turned 5, has never been outside. His world is inside the four walls that surround them. This is sweet, sentimental material, but so, so agonising, showing the strengths of a relationship between mother and son, and their ability to overcome the odds. Larson is impeccable, a beautiful performance that'll have you smiling then crying moments later. The young Jacob Tremblay is a sensation, playing a part that would seem impossible for someone to even comprehend at such an age. Room is more than anything a love story, with added thrills and drama. Highly recommended viewing.</fullReview>

The escape scene is harrowing, which just goes to show you don't need special effects or superheroes for suspense; in fact, there is more suspense without them. I was expecting more of a grim story, but even though the subject is grim, this movie is about survival and it could be seen as uplifting. There is a complete lack of sensationalism, which I appreciated. Brie Larson is phenomenal. One of the best films of the year.</fullReview>

The plot of the film was amazing in terms of the events of the film, but where it really shines is when it explores this very interesting and unique relationship between Jack and his Mum, and you get to understand these very fleshed out characters and learn a lot about them. I was completely mesmerised from start to finish and not once was i bored, as the story of these characters is so emotional, heartbreaking, heartwarming, and dramatic that you care for them as if they are real people. Going into this film without seeing the trailer made this film infinitely more enjoyable and surprising. There were sequences that made me feel ways that no other film ever has. I have experienced intense edge of seat moments in films before but there were part(s) of this film where i could feel my heart beating like crazy and no other film had ever done that before. That is really a testament also to the amazing directing by Lenny Abrahamson, i have not seen his other films but the way he captures all of the emotion and all of the drama in such a unique and effective way makes me interested to see what he works on next. The way the film was shot was so confronting that you feel like you are going through everything with these characters, and that you are trapped in this room with them. The performances from both Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay were absolutely phenomenal. They delivered every line and gave off every emotion so perfectly that it sucks you into the film and it makes everything incredibly grounded, realistic, and personal. Brie Larson was astounding, you could tell her character was very damaged, and you didn't need much of an explanation of what she has been through, simply from the way she talks and acts in certain scenarios you can gather a lot of information about her past, and that shows how amazing she was in this film. But even more surprising was the astounding performance by Jacob Tremblay, this kid is going places, usually you have child actors who show signs of being great but never really make it, but this kid has just put in what is probably my favourite performance from a child actor ever. He commands the screen in every scene and was one of the biggest highlights of the film. But even more astounding was that neither one overshadows the other and both of their amazing performances are front and center the whole time. So overall this is an incredible film, from the directing to the performances, to the plot, everything tied together really well and made for a very gripping, dramatic and intense story. Late in the film it does get a few pacing issues here and there but nothing so substantial as to dampen my overall enjoyment. This is a must see film, and although it will most likely not win Best Picture, i think it is the dark horse in the competition. 9.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joy was kidnapped 7 years ago: since then she has lived in a single room with her 5-year old son (by her kidnapper) Jack. On finally escaping, both mother and son need to connect to a world which has moved on for Joy, and which Jack has never known.This is a psychological drama on three acts: there is an expository section which shows us the limits of Joy's and Jack's world (and, as it is the only world Jack has ever known, it is perfectly normal to him), then there is the drama and excitement of the escape and, finally, there is a lengthy section in which we see what happens afterwards. This final section was the part I loved because it simply plays with your emotions as you follow the progress of Joy and Jack, and Joy's family, as they meet assorted issues which must be dealt with.Brie Larson as Joy ("Ma") is wonderful, and young Jacob Tremblay as Jack is simply astonishing. Jack is a complex character and far from easy to play, but you never for a second think you are watching a child acting: Tremblay IS Jack.This is an excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unlimited wisdom with limited room</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Room, directed by Lenny Abrahamson, is a magical film about the big world inside a small room and the big world which proves to be a small room, as a mother and son escapes into the real world after years of being captivated in a room.As the film begins, we meet Joy Newsmen (Brie Larson) and her 5-year old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay), who are locked up inside a small room by their captor Nick (Sean Bridgers). Enraged by Jack's perception of the outside world, Joy devises a plan to get them out, which succeeds. The rest of the film deals with them trying to adjust with the world, painting a thoughtful irony on how the bigger world is also a tiny room, but also teaching us the luxury of life that we have, which often goes unappreciated.The film explores and depth-fully portrays the connection between a mother and child, making us feel connected with our own mothers and children. The characters are portrayed so realistically, will all the actors doing an unbelievable job that we find ourselves wondering if they are real, just as Jack wonders what is real and what is not.Although the film's genre is Drama, Abrahamsson has presented the film in such a way that it offers zero-drama, which at times goes to the extent that it seems so real, as if it was a recording of a real life event. Emma Donoghue's writing seems to be based on a true story, and the fact that is not can be only be explained as "magical".Well balanced with scenes that will make you cry and scenes that will make you cheerfully delighted, and the morals that it offers, Room is a must-watch masterpiece, that is deep, lively, and thoughtful, and will undoubtedly room you in its infinite wisdom with only a few characters and limited space.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a dazzling movie.The film is superbly built; the first half is set within 'Room'; for Joy (Brie Larson) it is the shed where she's been held hostage, for her little boy Jack (Jacob Tremblay) it is the only world he knows. Joy has told him that the only thing outside of Room is outer-space and anything seen on TV only exists in TV-land. One of the most intriguing aspects of the film is the contrasting lenses through which Joy and Jack look at the world and specifically Room. For Jack it's all he's ever known; he affectionately names each object - sink, bath, plant, wardrobe. For Joy, it represents oppression, for Jack, it's life. And yet, the promise of trees and leaves and dogs is still alluring - Joy eventually lets Jack in on the truth about 'outside' before hatching a plan to escape. The intensity rises throughout the opening sequence as the desperation of their situation becomes more apparent. As Jack plays dead and their evil captor loads him into a truck wrapped in a carpet, I have never wanted anything more passionately in a film than for their plan to succeed - it had to. My heart wouldn't cope if it didn't, such is the strength of connection that Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay create through their incredibly forceful and convincing performances.Thankfully their plan did work and the film could easily have ended here; a story of brutal oppression, despair, hope, uncertainty and ultimate victory; a classic tale. Mother and son out in the open. Free with trees and leaves. Granny and Grampa. It would have been a good film.The reality had far more depth. Joy had escaped; it'd been all she'd wanted, all she'd thought about but now she was there, she wasn't happy. Jack wasn't happy either, although his reasons are more immediately apparent; losing the comfort and security of home and the close proximity of his Ma. What Joy was processing was far more nuanced; perhaps an element of guilt-ridden anti-climax, what-now syndrome, a remorseful and personal look at how life had moved on without her - her parents had separated and gotten on with their lives. Did she even matter? Overwhelming insecurities over her parenting naturally arose.All of this drives her to the edge of death as she attempts to end it but this moment gives her some perspective. Jack cuts off his hair - his 'strong' - and sends it to her in hospital. This display of love and affection empowers Joy and she comes back a stronger, happier woman and a stronger, happier mum, scarred by trauma unimaginable but on the road to a better life.It's two magical performances from Larson and Tremblay. It's a mesmerising tale that is expertly woven together into an exceptional film. In my opinion is deserves Best Picture and if Larson doesn't win Best Actress then I will eat my hat and wonder what the world is coming to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Experiencing this film, and it is quite the experience, you will see why actors Brie Larson and Jacob Temblay are receiving accolades left and right. Director Lenny Abrahamson manages to capture limited space with beauty and elegance, when neither are in play within this film. He is helped with this presentation through the terrific writing, screenplay and novel by Emma Donoghue, who provides the audience a look inside the world of the missing child. The story, according the Donoghue, is not based on any one story, but one can't help feel the story is familiar and current. Within the film there are a variety of additional stories that make one think, such as News Reporter (Wendy Creson) Q&amp;A's, the kidnapper's (Sean Bridgers) thought process, parental (Joan Allen and William H. Macy) accountability, and a whole lot more. The combination of relatable story lines makes this project important and relevant. Cinematography by Danny Cohen ("The Danish Girl") takes the audience inside young Jack's (Temblay') point of view as he discovers the world he never knew, adding yet another layer to this amazing film. Don't miss this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Make Space for Room!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fantastic feat in directorial achievement from Lenny Abrahamson, Room gives the audience a front row seat to the power of love and unrelenting devotion. Revealing the commanding force of love between a mother and her son when they are the only two people in their world, Room is an incredible tribute to the essence of human existence. The first half of the movie is filmed in the garden shed prison shared by the captives, proving Lenny Abrahamson to be a phenomenal director more than capable of creating a powerful film with little space. If you see no other Best Picture Nominee from this year's Academy Awards, please see Room; for it is truly the most captivating piece of art up for this year's top prize.The audience is immediately thrust into the gripping story of Ma, who used to be known as Joy (Brie Larson), and her son Jack (Jacob Trembley) prisoners in a reinforced garden shed attempting to "celebrate" Jack's fifth Birthday. We soon learn that Joy was kidnapped 7 years before by a man, only known as Old Nick (Sean Bridgers) who is holding them hostage. Repeatedly raped, Joy gave birth to a son since her kidnapping. Jack and Ma, as he calls Joy, are never allowed to leave the shed, called Room, and Jack has not seen the outside world in his entire life. With as active an imagination as any 5 year old boy, Ma tells Jack stories to keep him entertained and distracted from the grim reality in which they live; a reality where pants are treats only delivered one day a week. Reaching the end of her psychological rope, Ma devises a plan to save herself and Jack, allow her to return to life in the outside world, and give Jack a proper childhood among family and friends, trees, wind, and even bugs. Escaping Room proves to be more daunting than happy, as Joy has lived in constructed isolation for so long that her adjustment to the outside is difficult. Jack, having almost no immune system, must make an extremely careful entry into the world; a world that he has only been introduced to in his 5 years of life to an old television with a blurry picture. Seeing everything the world has to offer proves overwhelming for Jack and he seeks out Ma more than ever. Rediscovering and creating human identity, rejoining family and friends and a normal life, and creating a life for Jack illustrate the journey that one woman will traverse to give everything possible to her little boy.Brie Larson is one of the year's standouts this year in the role of the embattled, psychologically exhausted Ma. She eloquently displays the desperate yearning for life outside the garden shed, yet shows her complacency of not seeing a way out in extraordinary fashion. The child actor, Jacob Tremblay was also a force as the boy whose entire life has been lived in four walls. He excels when he shows the wonder of a 5 year old out in the world that he has never had the opportunity to experience. The two work together so well, and develop a compassionate chemistry on screen, creating a truly powerful experience for the audience. Watching the two only have each other, desperate for things among everyday life that seem so inconsequential was an incredible experience.Identity and love are the cornerstones explored in Room. Joy lost her identity once she was kidnapped; she is then tasked with creating a new one for herself and her son in order to simply be able to live through their shared experience as captives. Jack, on the other hand, is robbed of developing his own identity apart from his mother. Once out of room, he is exposed to parts of the world he thought didn't truly exist, and being in contact with all of life's wonders in such a short amount of time was magical, yet overwhelming for the young boy. The depths of love explored in this movie are unparalleled by any other film in 2015. Constantly having her body violated, Joy became pregnant by her captor, eventually delivering the baby inside the garden shed. This all happens off-screen, but is a difficult concept for the viewer. Able to look past the harrowing truth behind Jack's conception, Joy loves him and would stop at nothing to protect him. Likewise, Ma is the only person Jack has ever known, his autonomy is solely based within her, and he is so devoted to his mother that he keeps a tooth of hers that fell out in his mouth so he always has a piece of her. Compelling is the story of how deep love lives within human beings, despite the circumstances we encounter.Without question, Room is the standout as far as art pieces recognized by the Academy for their top prize this year. (I am still upset that they missed out on recognizing Carol) I sincerely hope that Room pulls out a dark horse victory for the highest honor this year. If nothing else, I hope that Todd Haynes wins a statuette for Best Director, as the range he gained from the two actors inside four walls is unmatched in skill and product. A gripping tale of love and identity among on-going psychological hell, Room is uncontested in delivering its message. One can only cross their fingers that The Academy gets this one right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great performances and moments of lyrical beauty halted by a stagnant 2nd Act</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With moments full of beautiful lyricism mixing with deep questions about the proper fallout from serious trauma, Room is a mostly successful turn of tiny cinema. It leaves a lasting mark in the obvious but very well done climax. But with what seems to be the theme of the year, what starts and ends strong stumbles along the way to that ending, often rambling itself into too much. Certainly, here would be a film that could have been just about the best 45 minute short anyone could ask for... But I'm not sure it works for me as a feature.When it breaks into lyrical musings on Room, World, Space, etc. is when this film is at its most effective, memorable, and thought-provoking. This is probably in no small way a telling sign of the wonderful "book author adapts screenplay of her work" aspect. Without having read the book, I imagine those sections are lifted straight from the prose. If not, they felt like it, and it was a feeling of a fairy tale story that reminded me in some way of "Another Earth" in style that I longed for more from this film.As far as the narrative goes... Based on the logline, I have to say that the whole plot played out just about how I imagined. There were no surprises for me, and I only felt that nagging me because it seemed like the direction was pushing this as 'shocking surprise.' But for me, it felt right into what I figured it would be.The performances are of a very high-quality... But I found Brie Larson's character to be the supporting role here. It's a great performance, don't get me wrong... But it's not the knockout punch she gave in Short Term 12, nor is it the knockout punch I expected from the awards season hype machine. On the other hand... Jacob Tremblay gives one of the best performances of the year by ANYONE- regardless of age or gender. Here is one of the finest performances by a young actor I can recall. Goes right up there with Ms. Tatum O'Neill and Mr. Haley Joel Osment. It is truly a wonder... The power he holds in his eyes, in his understanding (or certainly the directors) of the confusion of the situation... It's the glue that holds the movie together. It is well worth the price of admission just to see this child light up the whole world.After they break from room, the movie rambles and stumbles until the final scene. Again... a SHORT of this- around 45 minutes in run time... Would be perfect. I didn't feel enough holding my interest for a good hour after the escape. But all in all, this is one that I am very glad Hollywood made. Brie Larson is the future. I always enjoy her more than J-Law, and can't wait to see what she does next. Her maturity and focus is beautiful, and I'm definitely a fan.Room asks big questions, and I am still thinking about what the answers are... I've always been fascinated by the feral experience, and this almost went there. I'd love if it had, but that would probably take away too much from that perfect, perfect performance by the actual lead of the movie, Jack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartwrenching yet surprisingly uplifting..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Room was a film that i was very intrigued to see to the extent i actually did go out of my way to see it. I knew barely anything about it, i had seen the trailer a good few times in front of other movies but i never looked into it a great deal. It is one of those rare films that never strikes as something that would be worth going out of the way for, until it is actually released and then you think about it and realise you in fact do want to see it because it peaked my interest a great deal. With that being said, i do not regret my decision. It is a film i highly recommend in fact.First of all, Brie Larson stars as the main character, a young woman who was abducted from a young age and is forced to raise her son who is now five years old in a confined space that they deem 'room'. She gives us an incredible performance, i had only really seen her as Jonah Hill's love interest in 21 Jump Street, but she is so different here that it is hard to recognise her without prior knowledge of who she is. The stand out however is young Jacob Tremblay who plays the young boy Jack. I will say this now, he is really going places and will be a big star in the future if he carries on with performances like this. As a child actor his performance sucked me in as much as the big nominations currently in the Oscars. Whilst being vague, when you actually get to see him experience the outside world for the first time it really brought tears to my eyes because he plays the role in such a way that you really believe he has only known that one plave his whole life. For example he sees 'Old Nick' (the man who is keeping them captive) as a sort of magical being who brings them clothes etc. Because he has never even seen another person in his life. This makes it all the more interesting when he experiences real life people for the first time.At it's core the film is really a powerful story about the bond between a mother and son, but as well as this it is a metaphor for life itself and how we can take it for granted. With such amazing performances from the two leads it became something really special and whilst it is shocking and heartwrenching in places by the end it becomes a real uplifting, inspiring gem. As much as it may be tempting to ignore this film in favour of all the terrible comedies January is notable for, please don't. This is a film that must be seen. When i first saw it i thought maybe it dragged on 5 minutes too long, but in fact looking back i wouldn't take anything out. It shows us that nothing is more powerful than love and for that alone it deserves to be seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Discover the world in the beautiful emotional story of Room.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Room is the splendid unique film that explores the world through the eyes of Jack (Jacob Tremblay). Only knowing the environment of one confined space, the young boy and his mother are welcomed back into society, where Jack slowly begins to discover a whole new planet.This storyline is so cleaver and heartwarming, as it explores mothering relationships, childhood, and discovery. Brie Larson is amazing as being the perfect mother in an imperfect situation, her winning leading actress at the Oscars would be no surprise. And of course Jacob Tremblay plays the wonderful, adorable, real Jack who is so convincing in his performance if it wasn't for Revenant he deserves the Oscar. His performance brings you in to the film and makes you feel like discovering the world for the first time.The whole film is uniquely shot, and feels completely new and different to other films. It makes way for all the emotion that is to come.To the middle of the film it begins to get a bit slow for me, but that is really part of the narrative.In my Oscars list I will hope Brie Larson wins that award, and for the screenplay, but for the moment the big won for me is hoping to go to the Revenant. However Room is beautiful film that will make you draw tears three times and is a clear 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not really know what to expect before going to see this one. I certainly didn't expect the film to cause me to cry so much. It's a powerfully emotional experience and wonderfully performed. To say anything to spoil the plot robs you of the surprise this film is, so please try and avoid any description of the plot. It will give you the wrong idea anyway. But go see it! Brie Larson is so good - and the story so immersive. Can't recommended highly enough. also, William H Macey gives a great turn in a small role, but one that packs so much punch I don't think I can forget that moment. It's strange, whilst wa thing the film I was so moved but had no desire to watch it again - because I didn't want to feel so moved again. But now I'm planning on going back.</fullReview>

It's a wonderfully acted drama that has you thinking throughout . You think the worst has happened but perhaps the worst is yet to come , especially for the young boy ?

		<fullReview>Here's a small budget movie that will top the lists of 10 Best of the year. Award worthy performances make it work. While Bri Larson is excellent and billed as the lead, Jacob Tremblay carries the movie. It is really his story. He is on screen in nearly every scene and does all the voice overs. It is the discovery of the world through his eyes that raise the movie above harsh drama.The writer gets the credit for the good and perhaps the blame for some things that were so heavy handed red flags nearly popped off the screen. Perhaps it was better developed in the book but the William H. Macy character and issue felt rushed and distracting. The Dr. handing out sleeping pills when sleeping wasn't an issue was a jolting red flag. The news reporter interview was so far in bad taste to be realistic. Both mom and attorney sat by to set up another unlikely scene. The male characters were all written as insensitive clods. That includes the male cop. Even the male dog while kind sure wasn't much to look at.Ignore the flaws and admire the performances. The movie may be hard for some to take as it deals with abuse issues and aftermath. It is in limited release so if you can't see it in the dark, it will be almost as effective on a home platform. See it somewhere as it one of the best movies of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my review of the ever so uplifting Room (spoiler free)Cast: Academy Award nominee Brie Larson*, Jacob Tremblay and 3 time Academy Award nominee Joan Allen.Plot: Ma (Larson) is kidnapped at the age of seventeen and she is kept prisoner in a 10 foot room in a garden shed. She is constantly trying to escape her prison while her son, 5 year old Jack (Tremblay) is always wondering about the outside world.Directed by Lenny Abrahamson known for the quirky yet witty comedy Frank (2013). Room is a truly inspirational story and is always heartwarming from start to finish.Brie Larson (Trainwreck) has always been threatening to outbreak and in this film she does exactly that, however nine year old Jacob Tremblay's performance is beyond awe-inspiring, normally a child actor is only ever as good as their director but that is not the case in this feelgood and at points heartbreaking picture.This film literally open's a new door in the art of film making and will have you gripped from start to finish, this film will make you smile or make you cry, it will grab you by the heart and it will never let go. This is a film that is painful to watch I completely 100% recommend it, in my opinion this one of the best films of the year and it is a must see, even though it is very painful to watch at some points I think this is a total masterpiece 10/10. Just perfect.*Best performance by an actress in a leading role Room, 2015</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A deeply moving and unforgettable experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Room is easily one of the most emotionally devastating movies i have ever seen. Period.It completely draws you into this world that both of its characters inhabits and never lets go. The story of a mother and son kidnapped and living in a room for years is equally haunting and beautiful.Movies of kidnapped inhabitants are a dime a dozen these days, but what makes Room so special is the realistic and empathetic approach to its story. The "villain" isn't astonishingly evil, but frighteningly real.So is Joy, the mother of Jack. She isn't Jason Bourne, she has no particular set of skills. All she has is her love for her son and that keeps her going for the both of them. Instead of focusing on the gruesome details of rape, abuse and kidnapping, Room chooses to focus on the humans in the story, and their survival through mutual love.You might be surprised most by Jack, the boy who grew up in Room. You cant help but be heartbroken as you see how much he loves the jail cell he grew up in. Jacob Tremblay and Brie Larson both give performances for the ages. As is the direction and music. This could have so easily fallen into the clich revenge plot or melodrama, but it never falls into those trappings.Visually, the movie intentionally traps you into the Room for the first half, never letting you see outside of it. It really makes you feel the characters predicament and the "Room" itself becomes a character.Of course, they do escape as written in the plot, and i wont spoil what happens after. Just know that the performances are incredible, and you will leave the cinema with memories of this film that will stick with you. You will remember Joy, Jack, and Room.As the hype for Room increases, i suspect certain audiences might leave slightly disappointed from how grounded and realistic the film is. No, there is no twist, no gimmicks and no flashy moment or revenge plot. And the film is all the more better for it.Despite its subject matter, Room manages to inspire, and is surprisingly heartwarming. I didn't expect myself to love the film that much but i can say wholeheartedly that this film is a triumph of human emotion and it is the must see movie of 2015.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Room with a View</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Rating: &#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606; out of 4)This film is highly recommended. In brief: Two wonderful performances make the film even more impressive.GRADE: A-Depending on your point of view, the world can be big and overwhelming or small and intimate. For the characters in Lenny Abrahamson's riveting film, Room, their personal experience is the sum total of a 11' x 11' area. Ma and Jack have been held captive for many years. Although Ma knows the real-life details of their lives, Jack has been spared that harsh reality. Their day-to-day survival activities include storytelling time, games, and gazing out at the piece of sky through the shed's skylight. This claustrophobic house is Jack's world.For most of Room, we are caught in the tiny confines of their room and the film makes this space an important character in itself. The director effectively uses Jack's voice-over narration and numerous close-ups of the everyday objects surrounding them to show their desperation in an isolated corner of the world. As they cling to some shred of hope and sanity, the psychological battle between captor and prisoners rages on. Jack lives in a world of naivet and innocence. Ma tries to protect her son while still having the inner strength to carry on and shield him the awful truth.But it is the love story between mother and child that resonates and makes this film so special. The screenplay by Emma Donoghue, based on her own novel, is concise and literate. She wisely allows the visuals to tell the narrative and focuses instead on the real-life dialog between the two main characters to establish their bond and hardships.Foremost are the magnificent performances of Brie Larson and young Jacob Tremblay. Their chemistry together is remarkable. Ms. Larson delivers a strong and impassioned performance. Her role runs the range of emotions and the actress uses the quieter moments to convey the angst and anger that manifests within this courageous woman. Mr. Tremblay also is in full control as he fully registers the heart-breaking moments so naturally. He inhabits his part with such confidence and authority, delineating his character's moodiness and sense of wonder with such skill. Most adult actors should envy the intrinsic talent of this 6-year old. (That this young actor was somehow excluded for an Academy Award is enough evidence to question the voting process of the Academy.) Strong work is given by Joan Allen, William H. Macy, and Sean Bridgers in supporting roles as well.The film does have some issues with time passages that remain murky and more clarity is still needed with some of the minor characters who seem more like plot devices than real characters. But those details are minor complaints. Room is excellent, a film that emotionally captivates its audience with its gripping story, sensitive direction, and top-notch performances.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly, a Mother's Love Knows no Bounds.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you get to watch just one film this year, let it be this one. Hell, I'd say if you have to watch just one film in your lifetime, choose this one. This movie shows what the power of love can accomplish. And not just any love.. A mother's love; the purest, warmest, selfless thing in the whole world.ROOM is a rare gem... A kind of movie that would make even the cruelest of hearts kind. I am not kidding. If you want to change yourself, if you want to become a better person, just spare two hours of your time and watch this movie. It makes you realize how precious a thing love is.. And how unfortunate and ungrateful we are to take it for granted and not cherish it as much as it deserves to be cherished. Thank you so much everyone who was involved in making this film. You guys have created a gift for the humanity. And the actors.. Wow! Where to even begin! Brie Larson gave the perfect performance. She nailed every emotion, every vulnerability, and deserves all the awards for it, no doubt. And the little kid was just breathtakingly good! Seriously I mean.. Not once did it even feel like we were watching a boy who was acting! It was so real. The supporting cast added to the amazing work and helped make the film a modern classic. Once again, thank you all of the people who helped make ROOM a reality. Bravo! I pray that all of the moms in the world get everything they desire and may all their wishes come true. =)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie of 2015</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best movie of the year by a mile. Arguably the best movie of 2010's till now. One of the most brilliant movies that has ever been put on screen. The world from child's perspective is innocent and hopeful and at the same time enlightening. In my humble opinion, the kid gives the best performance of the year excluding Rooney Mara in Carol. The movie has so many strong scenes that keep your heart racing, and literally make you cry. A great book to screen adaption by author Emma Donnoghue and Lenny Abrahamson. The production house A24 has been doing really good this year, 1st with Ex Machina and now with Room. Brie Larson is finally getting the attention that she deserves thanks to the movie, although I liked her performance in Short Term 12 way better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally taken aback by its vivid storyline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the very first scene to the last, scene by scene is well carved and crafted. This movie gives scrupulous details to almost everything that has screen time, starting from the character's outfit to the every bit of emotion they felt on the screen. Hats off to the director, he is such a genius. The plot is a bit slow, still I neither felt distracted nor bored. It is a worthy watch. This dramatic movie is a window to look into our own emotions. And also makes us to think in a different dimension all together. It forces us to wear their shoes and walk a mile to feel exactly how they feel. P.S If you didn't cry after watching this movie then you don't love your mother as much as I love mine.</fullReview>

I won't tell anything about the plot cause i think this movie can really be appreciate if you watch it knowing nothing (or almost) about it before. I've never felt so emotional watching a film, it was heartbreaking and it's truly one of those movie that you can't stop thinking about after you watch it. Everyone involved did a great job, but Brie Larson and Jacob Trembley were just terrific, their dynamic was amazing and they deserve all the recognition they get.

		<shortDescription>Great adaptation of a fantastic novel; deeply affecting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because of me being an idiot, I finished reading the book Room literally an hour before I saw the movie. The good side of this was the novel was still in my head, but the bad side was also that the novel was still very much in my head. Usually when this happens, you become critical as you constantly go "Where's this bit? Where's that bit?". The novel is pretty intact with this adaptation, and is also a pretty much perfect adaptation.A lot of Jack's internal monologues are narrowed down, obviously as this is a visual medium and not a novel where you can get away with this, and this shows how Emma Donaghue takes over lovingly crafted novel and makes it work with a film format. And when she has produced the script with the same tone and sensibility, albeit with some scenes appearing slightly shortened (notably the interview scene, which in the book brought me to tears and felt a little hastened here), she gives that script to very talented people to bring to life. Irish director Lenny Abrahamson shoots the movie with very tight shots - around 80% of the shots are ECUs or CUs, which is mixed with a cooler pallet to make the world seem cold, and as the movie ends, we see a final wide shot of our two main characters walking from the camera to give a great resolve. It's a very tight, clever piece of storytelling with camera-work. The cast are also stellar. Joan Allen features prominently as Jack's grandmother, and is great as a woman who's trying her best to warm to and love Jack whilst also making her own daughter's return to the world more accessible and is great, Tom McCamus plays 'steppa' Leo who is the first person to really coax Jack out of his shell, and uses his warming and caring voice, and subtle, gentle expressions to gain his affection. Sean Bridgers plays Old Nick, the captor and creator of Room; Sean Bridgers deserves a lot of credit for being genuinely repulsive, despite only being seen a small number of scenes, and for creating a quiet unassuming quality about him - that no-one would ever expect him - while also being horrifically calm with everything he's done. Now onto the main players: Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. Brie Larson has come a long way since Envy Adams in Scott Pilgrim, and she creates a TOTALLY realistic portrayal of a traumatised woman who is also a genuinely loving person/parent. In her already mentioned interview scene, where she's asked horrifically insensitive questions to provoke, your heart breaks for her. As Jack, Jacob is our eyes of the movie as we follow him wherever he goes, and he's so adorable yet wise in his way; he says things like his "strong" is in his hair, like Samson, and you find it utterly adorable and endearing at the same time. He is really good, and it's good he is because if he wasn't then whole movie fails.I can't think of any flaws with the movie at all actually, and if there are they are pretty minor. There are obviously differences with the novel, which is always frustrating BUT as a movie, this is perfect. Brie Larson is particularly wonderful, as is the script and the minimalistic movie score. Hopefully Oscar for Brie, and all around good things for this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Room - Not the Story That I Was Expecting, But the One That This Film Deserved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Room completely blew all of my initial expectations away with a very empathetic and human story with phenomenal performances from its two leads, as well as an incredible screenplay and fantastic direction.Going into Room as someone who didn't read the book that this film was based on, I was expecting a mystery/thriller that centered around the escape/finding of the mom and son that the film focuses on. Instead, what I got was a very emotional, and very human look at the relationship between a mother and her son, as well as how these two are damaged by what they've experienced within a very confined space, and how they recover from and cope with said damage. Emma Donoghue, who wrote the book that this film is based on, did a beautiful job writing the screenplay, and part of that is because these characters she created felt like real people with real problems that pretty much anybody can relate to no matter who they are.However, the characters wouldn't have been so realistic if it wasn't for the actors who play them. Brie Larson is an absolute revelation, and is, in my opinion, the front-runner for the Best Actress Oscar this February. I've always been a fan of her's, from her commercial work in films like Trainwreck, 21 Jump Street, or Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, to her smaller work in films like Short Term 12 or Don Jon. Her performance in Room is some of the absolute best work I've ever seen from her, and this is because she portrays the shock and stress of returning to a world that's been snatched away from you for seven years so brilliantly. She captures the heartbreak, and sadness, and anger of this sobering situation perfectly, and it shows it the incredible transformation her character undergoes throughout the film. As great as Larson is in this film though, it would be unfair to overlook her son played by Jacob Tremblay, who is as important as Larson is, possibly even more. This is because Jack is the character that the audience sees the film through; he's the person that guides us all through the events that take place. And that is absolutely fascinating to me, because essentially Jack is experiencing the world for the first time ever. So because of this, he is filled with wonder about this new world, especially in a fantastic scene involving him laying in the bed of a truck looking at the sky, and the score is just overwhelming the entire scene with how loud it is. And that's the other thing about him; he's overwhelmed and apprehensive about what the world holds, but he doesn't always understand why. And as an audience member, we're able to piece extra bits of the story together without being told, but instead shown what things are like. When you're able to understand something without having to explain it, that's great storytelling, and it makes the character of Jack one of the most fascinating of the entire year.This film wouldn't be what it was without its director, Lenny Abrahamson. I've heard that Abrahamson took a lot of inspiration from learning how to raise a family for directing this film, and it really shows in every scene that he directs. You really get the sense that this was a film that was made with care, and love, and not just towards the respect that the book and its characters deserve, but in crafting something that felt genuine, that felt relatable to anyone who experienced growing up or raising their child. It feels like the director just wanted to tell a good, relatable story with the material that he was given, and he did just that.Room is a movie that really affected me. I'm notorious for literally never crying in movies, but in Room, I cried for literally the entire second half of the film. And that's because the characters of Ma and Jack, what they go through, and particularly how this affects other people that Ma knew before being taken away from the world she once lived in, felt so real to me; I actually believed that these events actually happened. And when a film does that to me, it's film that I know that I'll be revisiting time and time again, and Room is exactly that kind of movie. If I had seen this before the end of 2015, it would've been my favorite movie of the entire year. Without a doubt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Intelligent and Honest work from Lenny Abrahamson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the start of the film Jack (Jacob Tremblay), the five year old protagonist and from whose perspective the story is told, has spent his entire life trapped in a ten foot by ten foot room. His mother (Brie Larson) has raised him with the belief that the room they live in is the entire world. She does so to protect him from the fact that they are prisoners, held captive by a man who uses her as a sex slave. Dealing with subject matter that could easily tip over either to unbearable bleakness or clich melodrama, director Lenny Abrahamson, writer Emma Donoghue and the two excellent actors do an incredible job at creating a film that feels both honest and empathetic. A number of intelligent decisions in presenting the material are made, including telling the story from Jack's perspective, not making the captor a 'movie villain' and choosing to deal with the fallout of the climax, which occurs in the middle of the film. The result of these decisions is one of the rawest emotional experiences of the year and further proof that Lenny Abrahamson can do no wrong (Frank and What Richard Did).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen them all now. I saved "Room" for last because quite frankly I was afraid of the subject matter. I almost did not watch it.I was afraid to see some sort of exploitation of the ordeals suffered by the three Cleveland girls. Their stories touched me very personally, as for so long when I would stop at the gas station or the 7-11 to buy smokes (so long ago now) I would see their "missing" posters. And as time went by, those 8x11 paper posters began to fray at the edges, to become ripped at the tape holding them up, and then to disappear; just like the girls on them. I do not recall noticing when the posters disappeared... and that makes me feel guilty. Especially after they were freed, and I remembered that I had forgotten them.So I put off "Room" for last. I didn't want to feel guilty all over again. (No escaping Catholic upbringing.)I am pleased to report that after 10 minutes I felt no guilt watching "Room". I am even more pleased to report that I felt many other emotions: fear, revulsion, despair, hope, patience (is that an emotion?), sympathy, and empathy. That last is surprising, since nothing in my life could prepare me to empathize with a 5 year old boy who only knows the inside of a back yard shed, then suddenly must deal with the world. The real world. Most of all, I felt astonishment. At this late date it is hard for me to imagine discovering the world. But it was so easy to share Jack's astonishment. I felt like a five year old who knew nothing but the inside of a small room then suddenly must deal with the world. I felt what Jack was feeling. And for me, that makes it the best movie of the year.A tender, thoughtful movie. The one that touched me, instead of just entertaining me.My choice for Best Movie. I know it will not win. But what do the voters know?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Room for Improvement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew I was wrong, but I avoided this movie for so long because I couldn't help but think it was somehow associated with 2003's The Room. A sequel, remake, reboot, whatever?that unintentionally hilarious, albeit awful Tommy Wiseau film from 13 years ago still haunts me.And now, this 2015 film haunts me. Only, in a much different way.Other than my own dumb fears about the similar title, I knew almost zero about it going in, and I would like to try and keep my review to the bare minimum for anyone else who hasn't seen it. In fact, if you have NOT seen it, and you absolutely MUST, stop now, bookmark this and return. I won't spoil anything significant, but even knowing more than me going in, or about 1%, is too much.Okay, you're back? Good. Here goes, to the best of my ability, my effort to non-spoil this.Getting the synopsis out of the way might help explain my thoughts and feeling following. Movie opens with a mother and her child in a small room. Within minutes, or less, you realize that is their world. As expected, more and more is revealed on how they came to live in such a small room. And for how long. Too long. It also becomes apparent that the boy knows of nothing else IN HIS ENTIRE EXISTENCE but "Room." Or the mysterious man that enters nightly, brings "presents" on Sundays and is not allowed to see.Annnd, I'll stop there. There's so much more I want to say. Feelings, emotions, fear, anger, hate, longing and ideas on how to solve the problem. That last one?that's just me. I'm always trying to put myself in the character's shoes and attempt to fix whatever problem, or plainly, "what would I do?better?" After some ideas, luckily, I realized: I am NOT in her shoes. I never experienced what she went through. I doubt 0.00000001% of the world's souls ever has. So, I'm glad I could shut down the "obvious solutions" to this mother and son's imprisonment. So, there you go. The movie's about a kidnapped mother and her son in a tiny room. How would you cope? How would you care for your child when all he knows is those four walls? How would you escape?if you ever could? How would a five-year-old experience the real world?if he never has before?This movie is harrowing, magnificent, brilliant, tough, original and has some of the best acting I've seen in years. Of course, Brie "Mother" Larson was fantastic. Never once did I not believe her, she was as real as it gets. But, damn, that boy, (at the time of filming) 8-year-old Jacob Tremblay was incredible. I did love his mother's performance, but multiply that by two for Tremblay. You can't help but be captivated for what he has to go through, or learn about "the real world" outside of Room.The other performances were solid ? ALWAYS love me some Joan Allen ? as was the cinematography, score, direction?everything. I can barely think of one thing I didn't like here. Okay, well, maybe one thing?Even though I still grant this movie my highest honor: 10 out of 10 stars and it does nab my top pick of the eight Oscar nominated Best Pictures of 2015 so far (still have yet to see Bridge of Spies and Brooklyn,) my only complaint is that I wanted to know more. More of the aftermath, and the details of what's outside Room.Guess I need to go buy the book this is based on. My one gripe, which really isn't a complaint, isn't enough to lessen how incredible my experience was with this movie and how perfectly it was shot and performed. You must see Room.Um, to clarify, don't see "The" Room. Just "Room."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When the movie ended everything around looks the same but feels different. A profound movie experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Emma Donoghue's Room (2010) is sublime alchemy, switching from heart wrenching horror to endearing tenderness with an air of innocence permeating throughout. It is a book that is so profoundly good that immediately when I was done I realized that even though the world is still the same everything feels different; I have changed. Narratives like this don't come very often for me. I love the book so much that I started and maintained a book thread in an internet forum (http://www.xtremeplace.com/yabbse/index.php? topic=99456.0). In prose, the harrowing subject matter is pushed to the background by using a very clever narrative device - the entire story is told from the perspective of a five- year-old child. We become privy to his thoughts, his emotions and his voice of innocence. I had my doubts whether this narrative stance could be replicated on film without losing its emotional impact. From the get-go I realized my fears are totally unfounded. Lenny Abrahamson has directed Emma Donoghue's adapted screenplay magnificently and it is buoyed by two stellar performances by Brie Larson and newcomer, Jacob Tremblay. How the film manages to avoid all the usual trappings of exploitation and emotionally manipulativeness is a case of absolute marvel. Room deftly dances around these big holes of hysterics and histrionics, but yet still manages to make the horrendous situations feel authentic and heart-hitting. From top to bottom the cast shines, especially with Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. Larson has turned in a career defining performance and I think she is the one to beat at the Oscars. Such humanity and honesty, and through her character arc we are graced with what a mother would do for a child. She essentially creates a cocoon to nurture her child and to protect him from the cruel reality. Newcomer Jacob Tremblay is also phenomenal and he carried the film's weight on his little shoulders. He would of course say it is his long hair that gave him "strong". This is not a dutiful and obedient boy that does everything his Ma says. They do quarrel and have shout-fests but their diamond-hard bond is the beating heart of the story. I do feel the movie is largely spoiler free but I don't think I should say more on what happens after their escape from Room. The second half is essentially their journey back into the world and I am thankful that the movie doesn't whitewash everything into a stroll towards a golden sunset. Just like reading the book, I came out of the cinema feeling everything has changed, and I am grateful for the story of an unconquerable love between a mother and her child in harrowing circumstances. This is the first great film I have seen this year and I feel it is a profound cinematic and emotional experience to have lived in Room for two hours. Do yourself a favor by checking in at the earliest convenience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A near perfect film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Room' is an immensely powerful film. It has the ability to make its audience care from minute one right until the dying seconds. There isn't a weak scene any where in sight and the result is two hours of magnificent cinema. It's rare that a film can succeed in so many different aspects. The drama throughout is second to none, taking the audience on an emotional roller coaster that is genuinely moving. There is a scene of suspense that Hitchcock himself would be proud of. The intensity in this scene would struggle to be matched by the absolute best action directors Hollywood has to offer today. I haven't been that on the edge of my seat in a long time. The script is also incredibly thought-provoking. The character of 'Jack' played by Jacob Tremblay delivers some truly beautiful voice-over work. If you truly listen to what he's saying, in context, you can appreciate just how much we all take for granted the small things in life. Behind everything else the film has a wonderful message.Director Lenny Abrahamson, who has deservedly been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Director for his work in 'Room', has done an unbelievable job of balancing all these aspects of the film. He was helped a lot too by his two leads giving near flawless performances. Tremblay gives one of the best performances by a child-actor I can remember in a long time. Sadly the category of Best Actor is simply too strong for a child to be nominated in it this year, but make no mistake, anyone who sees this will be blown away by his performance. He's definitely one to be watched out for in the future. Brie Larson has received a nomination in the Best Actress category and deservedly so. The girl can act. She's been around a long time now but has really found her niche in the last couple of years seemingly. Here, she perfectly puts you in the shoes of the character and makes you feel every emotion and every shred of desperation as realistically as if you were actually in that situation. Based on what I've seen here, I'd call her a shoo-in to win the Oscar.There's not a lot else to say about this work of perfection, other than make sure you see it. The title could be considered a little bland and I hope it doesn't put anyone off giving it a chance because the product itself is anything but. Perfect direction, a beautifully written script and superb performances, all equal one of the best films of the year. I don't think it has quite enough momentum behind it to win the Best Picture award in what is a very strong category this year, but the fact it's been recognised with a nomination, and thus more people will get to see it, is a bonus if nothing else. A flawless film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Emotionally Strong Movie I Can Never, Ever Forget.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those that have not yet seen Room have not seen it because it is an independent film. Indies are usually hard to come by and are often expensive. Having seen that this was one of the highest rated films of 2015, I felt obliged to give it a watch. I was totally overwhelmed by how much of a psychological impact it had on me. Sometimes, psychological impacts are bad. Room is not one of them.Room focuses on two characters: Ma/Joy (Brie Larson) and her son Jack (Jacob Tremblay). Very, very rarely are the two main characters of a film as good as Larson and Tremblay. One of the few movies where the main girl and the main guy are this good is Silence of the Lambs. Room is at that level. After receiving her Golden Globe, Brie Larson is nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress--a role which she WILL win for. Larson is one of those familiar faces seen in the backdrop of movies such as Trainwreck, but Room finally exposes her acting ability and lets her shine as she deserves.The one that really steals the show is young Jacob Tremblay. He is a cute little Canadian kid who gives the performance of a lifetime. I was actually rooting for the kid to win or at least be nominated for an Oscar. Being nominated for an Oscar is a victory in itself. Say Tremblay did win, imagine how angry other people would be if a prepubescent beat them. When its good, its good. Tatum O'Neal was 10 when she won. Justin Henry was Tremblay's age when he was nominated for Kramer vs Kramer. Room is a very depressing movie full of redemption that will make you cry sadness one minute then tears of joy the next. When Brie Larson's character was in her late teens, she helps a man find his dog. Unbeknownst to her, she falls prey to a kidnapper and is placed in a 10x10 foot shed and kept there for almost 10 years. She has tried multiple times to escape, but is never successful. She is raped and eventually gives birth to a baby boy called Jack. Jack has never been outside of the confinement and thinks that is all there is in the world. Joy loves her son and shields him from the horrors of the reality. Jack is a happy- go-lucky imaginative young man. A few days after Jack turns 5, Joy tells him the realities and practices an escape plan. When Jack ventures out, he is completely overwhelmed. When they both get out, the adjustments to life outside seem almost impossible. Jack has never seen outside the Room and Joy's reconciliation with her family after years in captivity seems almost impossible. Room is based on a book based on a true story of a Austrian father who kept his daughter locked in a basement dungeon for over 20 years. But the movie touches base with so much more. The very idea of kidnapping is depressing. But it also shows the importance of family. Joy and Jack love each other more than anything, and we feel it. Joan Allen and William H Macy play her parents, and we feel when they reunite. But perhaps the most important thing Room shows is how precious life is and how much there is in the world. Jack was a happy boy, living in a tiny space. His journey outside is the biggest treat of his life. And of course, the acting by all is superb.Room really hits home. It is one of the very best, emotionally-charged movies I have ever beard witness to. One of the 100 best movies of my life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adapted by Emma Donoghue from her own novel, this Fritzl-esque tale of brutal long-term abuse may come across as the easier, Hollywoodised alternative to Markus Schleinzer's Michael, but that description misses the point. Room goes beyond the horror of physical incarceration and explores arguably the more challenging issue of the psychological incarceration that follows. It's easy for cinema to show suffering; harder to portray recovery, especially the stuttering kind.Joy (Brie Larson) and her 5-year-old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) are imprisoned in a tiny room by an abuser known only as "Old Nick" (Sean Bridgers). Jack hides in the closet when Old Nick visits Joy every night. During the day, Joy teaches Jack about the world outside Room (note the lack of definite article). There's wonderful humour and pathos in her struggles to explain reality and fantasy via images on a fuzzy old CRT TV. But for all her efforts, Joy comes to the conclusion that she must help Jack escape and see the world for himself.I'll plant a minor spoiler alert here.We have a movie of two halves. The first half takes place entirely in Room. The second follows the escape of Joy and Jack, and their efforts to recover in the brightness and busyness of the wider world. There's no trial for Old Nick. This is not a movie about the all-healing power of justice. It's about a mother and son adjusting to long-term trauma, and how it affects their relationships with the (grand)parents who've been living in their own dreadful dark for the past seven years.It may be surprising to hear that this comes from Lenny Abrahamson, who last brought us the relatively slight and irreverent Frank. While that movie was distinguished by its irony, the earnestness in Room is almost suffocating. It's not always subtle, proudly wearing its intention to devastate, making it not so much a weepie as a complete and utter bawlie, expertly tailored to tug the heartstrings. In some scenes this can be a curse but overall it's a blessing. It's no small feat to reduce an entire auditorium to a blubbering mess.As Joy's mother, shattered by her relief, Joan Allen almost steals the show with an amazingly detailed performance. In the middle is Larson, playing Joy as powerful and principled, carrying her hidden brokenness out into the real world. But the movie belongs to Tremblay. Abrahamson has drawn an astonishing performance from the youngster. For a start, the kid really acts like a kid ? it's not one of those creepily precocious manchild performances that American cinema sometimes conjures. Through Jack there's a sense of genuine wonder at the world, whether it's within the confines of a sound-proofed shed, or outside where the sky goes on forever. The youngest Best Actor in Oscar history up to this point was almost 30. Just saying.I can't say I was on board with every filmmaking decision. Stephen Rennicks' soaring, Johann Johannson-style music is frequently grating, seeming to exist to make us the audience feel all fuzzy rather than having any real relationship with the narrative. And there are certain scenes which don't quite ring true. For example, the primetime TV interview ? an exercise in awkwardness ? is unconvincingly thoughtless. I mean, as if we need any more help sympathising with Joy. Perhaps US TV journalism really is that insensitive, but it felt like low-hanging fruit to me.There are no answers to the evil of Old Nick, nor for the suffering of those he's abused. But uncertainty and doubt are not the same as hopelessness. I felt manipulated ? but that's what good movies do. In its soul-scouring search for truth, inevitably the film dips into sentimentality. But let's applaud Room for bringing to a broad audience an extremely difficult subject and making it as accessible as it can possibly be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unconditional Helsinki Syndrome......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack is a spirited 5-year-old who is looked after by his mother, Ma, who dedicates herself to keeping Jack happy and safe, nurturing him with warmth and love and doing typical things 5-year-olds like to do. Their life, however, is anything but. They are confined to a windowless, 10-by-10-foot space that Ma has named Room. She has created a whole universe for Jack, and will stop at nothing to ensure that, even in their situation, Jack is able to live a complete and fulfilling life. But as Jack's curiosity grows, and Ma's resilience reaches its breaking point, they enact a risky plan to escape, bringing them face-to-face with what may turn out to be the scariest thing yet, the world outside.......Depending on who's point of view you see the film from, Room has two different connotations. From the point of View of Ma, it begins as a prison drama, her and Jack being held captive against their will, and Ma being subject to abusive on an almost nightly basis. And then there's the road to freedom, enlightenment, and finally, subjection and coming to terms with the years that she lost, the most important years of her life, and in turn, beginning to resent Jack for being the creation of her imprisonment.From the View of Jack, it begins as normality to him, he and Ma are the only people in the world, apart from the man who visits every night while he is in his 'room', the wardrobe. His life here is the norm, being born with a built in Helsinki Syndrome helps the falseness of his world, and the love from his mother is unconditional, likens other Mothers love.So when he finally leaves his world, he is subject to a whole new world, an unsettling domain where he is made to wear a mask and sunglasses as he will be vulnerable to a host of new germs. And no just that, new emotions are abound, such as Ma acting differently, not the always there person he is used to, but someone who is distant and weary.Plus the fact that there are a host of new people he meets, who react differently, not forgetting the fact that they haven't seen Ma in an age, relief turns to anger, turns to guilt, turns to neglect.It's a fascinating movie, heart breaking in one sense, and forfilling at the same time, because not only can Jack start his new life, Ma has to grieve her lost life, so an element of jealousy can be seen in some scenes.Larson is wonderful as Ma, showing so many emotions in such a short time, it won't be surprising is she wins every award this season.Tremblay is a major force in this film, putting in one of the best child performance I've seen in while. Here's to a wonderful career ahead.But the film belongs to Macy. There is one scene at the dinner table that is so devastating, so sad, Grandpa denying his own Grandsons existence, and uttering a syllable,Mis both should destroying and the core of the film.Jack isn't to blame for anything, he was just created amongst the chaos, he is the blessing, and to see a world full of hate form the view of a five year old, especially when your free, you would long for that one final visit to the room.An exceptional movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Room keeps the viewer in suspense as it slowly unravels the story of how mother, Brie Larson and son, Jacob Tremblay is stagnantly held captive for years until finally Brie has the sudden courage for a spontaneous escape. Brie brilliantly portrays the trauma she's experienced when she returns home to her parents...sadness looms in the air for the entire movie as everyone involved tries to regain their normal life. The movie is at times slow, but Jacob saves the movie with his innate, youthful curiosity to make sense of the world. The mellow ambiance makes one ponder about the usage of time, the importance of support and not taking things for granted. Overall, great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The premise, a mid thirties woman held captive in a single roomed windowless garden shed for seven years, molested by her captor resulting in a pregnancy, and the resultant son living his entire five years of life in the shed, is not encouraging. But Brie Larson as Ma and Jacob Tremblay as Jack have to be seen to be believed. They are so good you forget they are actors. The other roles are competently supporting, and serve to focus one's attention on Ma and Jack. The storyline unfolds with unpredictable twists and turns, but the emotion it finds in virtually everyone who has seen this film I've spoken to make it one of the best cinema experiences of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It shows you how devastating is the life of a mother who has been kidnapped for seven years with her son Jack, who just turn five. The film in deeps the complexity of the situation by showing the emotional repercussions of not just the mother and the son, but the grandparents after the kidnapped; and the particularity of jack, who doesn't have real knowledge of the real world, other than what he sees in the TV and it's unable to comprehend properly. The story it's narrated at times for jack, what gives it a bit of innocence and helps to balance out the strong subject. Both actors are exceptional, especially Jacob Tremblay, who despite of his short age is able to portray a wide of complex emotions in a terrific way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read Emma Donoghue's novel ROOM, I was looking forward to the film adaptation. I suspect she could have sold the film rights to a big name director like Peter Jackson or Steven Spielberg. We would have been treated to a talking egg snake or an animated plant. Sometimes too much money doesn't make a better film. ROOM is proof of that. ROOM is proof that less is way more, that subtlety and nuance is far more valuable than every special effect that money can buy. Ms. Donoghue was protective of her work and it paid off. She went with a director who understood the novel and who was willing to collaborate with the author. Director Lenny Abrahamson has brought ROOM beautifully to life on the screen. The director is true to the feel of the novel. Donoghue has done a terrific job on the screenplay. And the two lead actors totally inhabit Ma and Jack. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay deserve every great review, every award they can get. Tremblay isn't just a talented child actor. He's a talented actor. He's extraordinary, present in every moment he's on screen which is pretty much every scene of the movie. Larson shows us so many layers of Ma, a young woman who is trapped and needs her young son to help her win their freedom. We feel her love for her son, her fear for his future, her frustrations and her battles with the after shocks of life in Room. ROOM is a beautiful film about the life saving love a mother has for her child and his love for her. The only thing I wish was that ROOM had gotten wider distribution. It's a film that is a must see.</fullReview>

The first has proved in this movie that she could fill a dramatic role, although I also love her in her comedy roles. Jacob was a discovery for me, but he's very authentic. I am sure he will has a successful career before him.I just resent the fact that Ma's character did not get developed thoroughly. There are a couple of lose ends there, and his discomfort with the whole story is not really explained properly.It's worth for the story, and for the acting.

		<shortDescription>Amazing Realism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie blew me away. I'm too used to the usual tripe version: too much dwelling on the sick nature of what happened in gory details to shock the viewer rather than focusing on the characters, and usually the movie ends the second they escape, off to an instant happy ending. This movie is refreshingly different and focuses on the personal experiences of the boy in particular and his mother, with almost half the movie dedicated to what happens after the escape. Because of this it's very effective at making you feel for the characters and connect with each rise and fall. Not an instant happy ever after that people swaddle themselves with, but a true raw connection with the human difficulties and consequences of a horrible ordeal. It's celebrating how people adapt and dust themselves off that is inspiring, not a whitewashed instant gratification. Well worth the watch, best movie I've seen in some time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Room" is one must witness on the nearest screen possible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is one life changer of a movie, "Room" is one must witness on the nearest screen possible to experience a heart-stirring tale of mother and son. Though as simple as the premise is of a mother and son taken captivity, what makes "Room" stand out is how it can take the gut right out of every emotion to convey the complexities of the source material by Emma Donoghue (who also wrote the screenplay) with the the help of Lenny Abrahamson's subtle direction. Brie Larson is at her best ever, since "Short Term 12", playing the scorned Ma, having to make ultimate sacrifices for her son Jack, played by the excellent Jacob Tremblay. It is their performances what made "Room" hit all the heartfelt notes in an unforgettable way. Every individual and duel moment from them will take your breath away. From the claustrophobic scenes in "room" to the breathtaking touches of "space", the experience is one of a kind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very powerful. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay give tremendous performances as a young mother her five-year-old son who live in the eponymous room. As their story unfolds, the film begins to tighten its grip, so it's a pity that around this time in the story there are a couple of not very believable aspects to the plot. Never mind: once they're out of the way, the final section of what is essentially a three-act drama raises the emotional temperature further. I confess I was a tear-stained rag at the end.The presence of Joan Allen and William H. Macy in supporting roles is a testament to the quality of a project they clearly felt they wanted to be part of. Sean Bridgers, Tom McCamus and Amanda Brugel also make noteworthy contributions.On the basis of this, and of that excellent, eccentric movie FRANK, it's easy to see that Lenny Abrahamson is a superb director of actors, with an interest in and an understanding of the complexity of people's relationships.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie of 2015 (may contain mild spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to start off this review by stating that I have been an IMDb user for nearly five years and have rated hundreds of movies and TV shows, but this is only my first review. I try not to give 10 out of 10 ratings lightly, but Room more than deserved it. I felt so strongly about this film that I was compelled to try writing a review. I did not know much about Room going into the film. All I knew was that a mom and son were confined in a small room 24/7. I was absolutely blown away by nearly every aspect of the film. I'm having trouble thinking of any flaws in the movie. Brie Larson was simply incredible as "Ma". While I have seen many of this years top movies, I have not seen them all. Nevertheless I have a hard time believing that any actress had a better performance. She will certainly be nominated and should win the Oscar for lead actress. Prior to seeing Room I had only seen Larson in supporting roles in movies and TV. I had no idea she was capable of such a performance and I look forward to seeing her in future roles. Not to be outdone was Jacob Tremblay, who played Larson's son "Jack". Tremblay had what I believe to be the best performance by a child actor/actress in cinema history. I know it's hard to make such a claim, but I was that taken aback by Tremblay's performance. I don't care whether or not Tremblay is nominated as a lead or supporting actor (even though he was a lead in my opinion I know the academy often puts child actors as supporting nominations regardless of their role) as long as he is recognized for his incredible work. I truly felt emotionally invested in these two characters. I genuinely cared for these characters and felt helpless alongside them trapped in "Room". In the scene where Jack is in the back of Old Nick's pickup truck I nearly yelled at the screen. I usually don't show such strong and outward emotions in real life let alone when watching a movie. Emma Donoghue's story is incredible as is Lenny Abrahamson's directing. I feel the need to single out the amazing job done by cinematographer Danny Cohen, especially in the scenes when Jack first sees the world outside of "Room". I felt like I was truly seeing the world through Jack's eyes. Everything looked so vast and bright even though all I was seeing was a simple neighborhood. I may need to give myself more time to digest this film (and perhaps and other viewing), but I think I have to already say this is one of the best films I have ever seen. It could even be in my top 10 films ever, although, like I said, I may just being saying this because the film is so fresh in my memory. While Star Wars: The Force Awakens is still my favorite movie of 2015, Room edges out both Star Wars and Spotlight for my choice of best film of 2015. I will be rooting for Room throughout awards season and hope to see it win the Oscar for Best Picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Room" is life affirming, a work of art both moving and beautiful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are only a handful of films that I can think about during a regular day that get me lost back into the theater to re-experience the beauty and magic of those films. "Room" is one of them. This is a film that can transform your emotions so quickly and so authentically that you forget your watching a film. "Room" controls you and manipulates your feelings to a level that no film has done before. We enter the film in a tiny room, which is actually a shed in a man's backyard that Joy (Brie Larson) and her son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) have been held captive for seven years. Joy is repeatedly assaulted by the man (which is how Jack was conceived) and is trapped in a nightmare. The two make the best of their situation, and once they escape, try and see the world for the beautiful and larger room that it truly is. Let's start by saying that Brie Larson gives perhaps the greatest performance by an actor in cinematic history. Her emotions and realistic approach to her character are so full of detail and has the ability to put you to tears due to her character's tragic situation and her remarkable comeback. This is the best actress alive today. Jack Tremblay also makes a startling revelation as one of the world's most talented young actors. "Room" is a beautiful film with spectacular direction by Lenny Abrahmson, who shifts from beautiful scenes between a mother and son, to a heart-pounding escape, and finally to the powerful and beautiful struggles and joys that life has to offer. "Room" will alter your feelings greatly throughout, but will leave you speechless due to the breathtakingly beautiful writing by Emma Donoughe and the glorious implications of hope and beauty in the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Richly profound and incredibly acted.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Room" is based on the 2010 novel of the same name, written by Irish-Canadian author Emma Donoghue who was also responsible for the film's screenplay. It tells the story of a 5-year old boy named Jack (Jacob Tremblay) and his Ma (Brie Larson), who are living in the confines of a small enclosure after Ma was kidnapped by a man when she was 17, and has been held captive there for last 7 years. This same man was responsible for Jack's birth, so Jack knows nothing or has seen anything else in his life apart from this room he's currently holed up in. After a daring escape plan finally frees Ma and himself, both individuals must find a way live a customary lifestyle again, but things are much harder than it seems."Room" works simply because of how unembellished and dreary it's narrative is and how seamlessly Larson, Tremblay and Joan Allen fit into this world of hopelessness. The acting from the two leads are stunning; you will not see a more genuine and heartbreaking Mother &amp; Son relationship as this for a long time. Their rapport and on screen chemistry was dazzling. Larson exudes that devoted motherly persona, doing her utmost to keep her child protected at any cost and blames herself forcefully for the situation they find themselves in. She doesn't care about her own wellbeing; everything she does, all her actions and rational thinking is about how she can get her child out of this nightmare and how to bring his life back around to normality. If you loved her in Short Term 12, she takes it up another notch here with a monumental display of sadness, anger &amp; pure unadulterated love. Amazing, Oscar worthy stuff and if she won it would very much deserved; a performance that packs an almighty wallop.Tremblay couldn't have played this role any better and he can easily join the ranks of the greatest child performances I've ever seen. It's a difficult part to play, but like Larson he gives his character so much depth and complexity and carries the same amount of care and affection for his 'Ma' that she has for him. Being such a young age, he doesn't quite understand what's going on, so he takes whatever his Ma says as gospel. He only knows 'Room'. He only knows what he see's on the TV in Room. He only knows the sky is blue. He doesn't know there's a huge universe out there waiting for him, that there are more people like him and Ma, that the dogs and cats and trees he see's on TV are real. The growth we see Tremblay's character experience and the way he conveys it is utterly transfixing; it's hard to believe he's just 9-years old. A big, big future ahead for this hugely talented kid.And credit must also go to Joan Allen, whom I've admired for a while now but hasn't had a role like this in years. It's such a delicate and thoughtful performance, perfectly nuanced but enough there to feel her woes. It reminded me of Dern in last year's 'Wild', and I was so happy when Dern got a nomination because I loved her in that. I feel the same way about Allen. The direction is very much on point and the gorgeous score has been criminally under-appreciated. It's not in your face but it doesn't need to be, as composer Stephen Rennicks elects to keep a smooth, perfectly apt melody whilst only increasing the strings slightly for the more intense moments. "Room" is a film that will stay with you for days. It's subject matter is dark, leaving very little leeway for humour or any sort of respite from a grim situation. What we're presented to us is a highly grounded tale of human nature, the ugly side of it, but also the true beauty and strength of a Mother-Child bond.</fullReview>

The movie was just outstanding and amazing that I bawled at least thrice.There were scenes were I couldn't take the loneliness, the anguish, and the desperation portrayed by Ma. It was truly heartbreaking seeing her broken but she still tries to remain courageous and holds on to her hope for her son.Brie Larson definitely needs to be recognized as a fantastic actress.

		<shortDescription>Sexual prisoner escapes with son</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title is "Room" not "The Room." The more general term makes the film about the space in our lives and in our selves and our need to escape whatever walls or restrictions that others ? or we ourselves ? have imposed on us. So our experience really is reflected in this freakish story. The film is about the vast room we have at our disposal not the small room to which we might accept restriction. Unlike most of us, this boy's first five years are spent in a small enclosed shed with no other outside experience but a usually blank skylight sky and the confusion of realities on the wavering TV. No cable there, no proper connection. His Ma has nurtured his delusion that there is no real world out there, concealing their imprisonment until he is old enough to handle it ? i.e., to escape. When they do get out she's troubled by his slowness to make a "connection" to anything, but he does, first (of course) to Lego, which enables him to start building his own world, then to a neighbour pal. Unlike most of us, Ma, nee the lost Joy, had her high school joy and promise smashed by seven years of sexual enslavement. But as she was the anchor on her school relay team she's the anchor in her Jack's life. And he becomes her reason to survive. Their (non-umbilical) cord isn't broken until well into their liberation. Only then does she stop breast-feeding him. The film ends with Jack and Ma going back to Room to say goodbye. Of course the past is not the same: the evidence has been removed but mainly, it's not Room any more with the door removed. Its essence was restriction not space. The two leave restriction behind to embrace the expanse of freedom. But psychological restriction remains. Ma's suicide attempt and the TV interviewer's insensitive probing show her still scarred. Jack seems stable when he pulls out of his Ma's embrace to go play with his new/first friend Aaron. This story is a bleak parody of Eden as a parable of our origin. Their captor "Old Nick" evokes Satan. Joy's two "families" curiously contrast. Her relationship with her captor is a bleak parody of marriage. Jobless, Old Nick is a loser who asserts his false authority by enslaving and abusing Joy. Imprisoning Joy gives him a power and potency he lacks in real life. Enough families, alas, live like that without the literal abduction. Joy's one firm rule is to insist Old Nick will never touch or even see little Jack. She enforces that principle to the point of hysteria. She will save Jack from her contamination by Old Nick, later even denying his paternity. Once reunited, Joy's father can't bring himself even to look at Jack. For him, the boy embodies his daughter's and therefore his shame. The boy's father's imposed restriction parallels the grandfather's self-imposed containment.In contrast, Joy's mother Nancy's new man embraces him in a sensitive, respectful manner. Jack opens up to him: "I had a dog once but he wasn't real." Luckily, Leo brings him a real dog, Shamus, a cozier creature than the big black lab who's Jack's first contact in the outside world. As Nancy admits, Joy's was not the only life destroyed by her abduction. Obviously the parents' marriage was another casualty. The father moved away and remains remote. But Nancy immediately accepts Jack. Her first words to him are thanks for saving "our little girl." Jack saves her again by sending her his "strong" in the hair he lets Nancy cut off and bring her. In a touching irony, Joy's horrific enslavement has not diminished her adolescent tensions with her mother. Bonding is like that, as restricting and yet as liberating as ? the room through which we live.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most disappointing and unfulfilling movies I've ever watched.(SPOILERS&gt;Sort of but not really:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I'll say it's best if you go into this movie fresh with as little known as possible, that way you will have at least that going in.So you're trapped in a shed by a man who kidnaps you and rapes you practically every day for seven years. In this shed there is a door which is locked by a combination keypad lock, you have been provided with sheets, some clothes, water, food, I think there is a glass or two, matches, an oven/heater/microwave, and there is a skylight in the top of the shed. The guy comes in to have sex with you and he eats the food you cook for him and he sleeps in bed with you(not sex, actual sleep). After a while you bear a child Now I'm pretty sure quite a bit of you reading this would have come up with quite a bit of plans within five minutes or at least a number of complicated plans within a span of a week, or at the very least hatched a convincing plan when your son was born and of a decent age to run. The woman in the movie however comes up with two really bad plans, one of which surprisingly works. Well actually her first plan consisted of hitting him that one time with a really heavy thing, him damaging her wrist..somehow and she not trying anything after that from what I can recall. I am still surprised that the end plan actually worked considering how asinine it was, didn't seem very logical and didn't line up with how a captor of this woman would behave.Ignoring all that though, I thought it was a movie about the psychology of victim and kidnapper/captor/rapist, or the mom and her son within the confines of this shed and how they cope with being held against their will and the child somehow not knowing this. Nope. I said okay then fine, maybe it's about the plan and coming up and following through with a plan that sets them both free and- nope. Then when the escape takes place I thought it was then going to be about the kid escaping from the guy and finding help. Nope, he finds it within a minute of jumping out the truck. Okay then I thought, well the guy who 'saved' the kid didn't bother to take a photo of the truck or even bother to note the license plate so I thought it would be a manhunt for the guy and a race to get to the mom before the kidnapper-No, no, nope, they find her within like five minutes. She's okay. Then maybe how about she and her son living with the constant threat and presence of the one who kidnapped her still on the lamb, free to swoop in and- no, they arrest him in some aside news report. Well fine then, no action, a quality drama about how this woman adjusts to losing all that time in her life, dealing with how the world is now, getting a job, settling back in, adjusting to men having being raped for seven years(or just adjusting in general after being raped and confined for seven years and having a baby for your rapist), picking up her life and how her son adjusts to all this and being-No. Nothing of the sort really, or kind of. They sort of go for some of those things, then stop short and drop them. She gets depression but it's nothing that significant or rather not shown to be that impactful, just seemed like the sort of depression that I've seen in a number of teenagers. I figured we'd have much more in the form of the son, but no, he's shy and has bad grammar, but it's not really that out of the ordinary for a kid with say aspergers. Late in the movie a random kid(I was actually thinking none existed in this movie world since no one really came over to interact with the kid or mom when they got back but is somewhat understandable) and he got along fine with the other kid kicking a ball. Maybe about the family dynamics, her parents aren't together anymore, maybe then about the family why and how they split apart, how they must adjust to finding their daughter and their son and-no, not really.It just sorts of superficially goes for things and then stops short, it felt like watching a well made Lifetime movie of white middle America drama. I guess it was partially my fault for seeing the numerous ripe dramatic and tense places the film could have gone and then never going there.You don't have to give me action, suspense, terror etc, but you could have given me some solid drama to sink my teeth into, and unfortunately this movie didn't have any of that for me. My wife liked it though, so I guess it's more for the women Lifetime audience mom crowd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing view of childhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film as part of the LFF and can't recommend it enough. Even though the subject matter is dark, the film is truly uplifting. I would recommend even for fans of the book as in my eyes this offered much more. It doesn't have the sense of time you get from the book nor perhaps Ma's desperation but I thought it dealt with the matter beautifully. It wasn't sensational at all where it could have been. The acting is fantastic, Brie Larson was excellent and I thought she would be good when I heard she was cast as she impressed in short term 12. No disappointments there. The boy, Jack, was just brilliant, I see so many films where the child actors overact and are over cutesy. He did neither, he was perfect. He really broke my heart with the smallest expressions and quiet words.I would like to see them both nominated for Oscars and this is without doubt one of my films of the year. Enjoyed this much more than the book. Go see it. It's fantastic. Bring a tissue!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A woman and her son are held in a garden shed, referred to as 'room', by a man who uses the woman as his sex slave, having abducted her 7 years earlier. The woman concocts a plan to smuggle the son out in order for him to find help and free them. After the plan is successfully executed, we follow the two in the aftermath of the ordeal, struggling to retrieve the life that was previously stolen from her.The film is repetitive and annoying. At no point is the captivity nor the woman's response to the situation believable. It's just a garden shed located in some suburb instead of underground. The woman's not shackled and can virtually escape every time the captor enters the room. Relying on child actors is a notoriously shaky endeavour and again the constant whining of the kid and the way it talks, is grating and tiresome. There also seems to be no real connect between the first and second act. The 7 years she previously spent in the room might just as well have been a written premise at the start of the film. With no deeper layers to the film and with no character really fleshed out, the film feels aimless and not well thought-through.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally avoidable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that the IMDb rating tricks you into believing is better than it actually is. The IMDb synopsis also makes you believe that you are being taken on a journey - of the struggles of being held captive, into the psyche of the captor, of the innocence of childhood, of motherly love that triumphs. You probably imagine some sort of "Life is Beautiful" unfolding in a room. But NO! Be warned. This movie is about an annoying kid and his annoyed mom stuck in a room. They both manage to escape the room and guess what? They continue to be annoying and annoyed. The characters are so completely one dimensional, the movie fails to both entertain or be insightful. You end up feeling stuck with the characters in this 2 hour long ordeal. Like someone dragging a fingernail on a chalkboard. The quickly made TV documentaries after kidnapped victims are rescued (as in the case of Elizabeth Smart or Amanda Berry) look like Oscar winning stories in contrast and are actually watchable. This movie is plain painful to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Room (2015): Dir: Lenny Abrahamson / Cast: Brie Larson, Jacob Tremblay, Sean Bridgers, Joan Allen, Tom McCamus: A room can seem gigantic to a boy whose only glimpse of the outside world are that of a television. He is Jack and this room is his world along with his mother Joy. She raises him within that room heightening his imagination with various activities until bedtime in a closet. Nights are chilling because that is when Old Nick returns. He keeps them locked in this room and abuses Joy who protects Jack. When all seems lost Joy schemes a plan for Jack's freedom and the result is a spectacular yet intimidating image of adapting to a bigger universe. Director Lenny Abrahamson does an intriguing and detailed job at showcasing this outside freedom from both perspectives and how both Jack and Joy adapt differently. Brie Larson has become one of the most dependable talents with a resume of diverse roles. This is Larson at her best as she struggles to raise her son within confinement and then prepare him for an escape into an unseen world. Sean Bridgers plays Old Nick whose footage is brief but important as his sadistic choices become clear. Joan Allen plays Joy's mother who eventually introduces Jack to his very first hair cut. Tom McCamus plays her second husband, Leo who accepts Jack when his grandfather cannot muster up the ability to look at him. This is a powerful and emotionally charged film about motherhood at its most extreme. It demonstrates what a mother will go through to allow her son a promising future and an escape from the enclosed space that was room. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the room completely.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a common saying that goldfish grow to the size of their bowls. This, in turn, is used to describe the limits or extent of a person's world view, often implying one of two things ? either that you can have a very narrow and limited view of your environment if you allow it to be that way, or alternatively, that by pulling off someone's blinkers, you can set their mind free into all kinds of untold possibilities. Room explores, brilliantly, both of these extremes in a way which is touching, tender, emotional, yet also has tension, precision and power. The first section is claustrophobic in the extreme in some respects, the goldfish clearly trying to be kept restricted and contained. Four bleak walls and one distant skylight form the landscape, with tattered crayoned pictures and grubby misshapen items offering little relief. Yet the creativity and determination of Joy towards her young son Jack lights up much of this segment. At least initially. Things very quickly take a more sinister turn as we're introduced to old Nick, their captor, who is initially a shadowy and ill-formed figure, viewed from the wardrobe.As plans are fomented to deal with the situation at hand, the action and acting, accompanied by the music, interplay in quite magnificent ways to ratchet up the dramatic tension. Even then, little moments of tender humanity and humour are allowed to show their faces, making this feel like your peering into their tiny bowl. And when finally the break for freedom happens, you're left almost unable to breathe with fear and hope, as the brave new world swings tantalisingly into view.The second section, unsurprisingly, takes more than a few blinking moments to come into view. Suddenly the bowl is huge and scary and although we're allowed to breathe again, it's in a short shallow slightly shaky way. We meet more people who we're given to understand in an understated way have also been finding things difficult to cope with. This is in many ways at the crux of what we see unfolding, although there's also a beautifully played subplot about growing up and letting go.There was one what I felt was a slightly clunky moment during a TV interview, but with hindsight, I can see this was a plot device used to take you deeper into the mindset of Joy, helping to explain subsequent events. The juxtaposition happening before you is unsettling at the same time as it's uplifting and yet the director manages to tie things up and bring closure to the production in a beautiful way. Although certainly elements are harrowing, it is never mawkish or gloom-ridden and it strikes a particular balance between dark and light throughout. The score, edits and photography are superb, really adding to the piece overall, with the music in particular hitting the sweet spot. I've spent most of the past 24 hours with things from this movie bubbling around in my mind, in particular, picking over details of what we've seen as well as wondering about what happened next (I know I know, it's fiction but that's how engaging and embracing I found this). One of Jack's little soliloquies towards the end in particular had a resonance that went far wider than the contained events we were presented with ? he's outside the bowl looking in now methinks. 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Five-Word Review: Beautiful, Harrowing, Suspenseful, Wonderfully Acted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Emma Donoghue adapts her own successful novel for the big screen in this Oscar-nominated drama that could be based on real events. Room begins in a tiny room, a converted shed in the back garden of an abductor. Brie Larson (this is surely a breakout role for the supporting actor from comedies such as 21 Jump Street and Scott Pilgrim vs The World) plays Joy, the woman who has been trapped there for 7 years, and this is all her five-year old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) has ever known. His conception of the world is limited to "Skylight" and "Wardrobe", with the place outside the room merely outer space. I don't want to say much more - don't watch the trailer! - as you should really, definitely, see this film. Room, at different times over the course of its runtime, sets different tones. The beginning is harsh, uncomfortable and harrowing. The claustrophobic direction, with Danny Cohen's expert cinematography, honestly makes you feel like there is nothing outside of this Room. The entire lives of our two central characters are on display, with literally nowhere to hide, and the nasty, desolate situation is equal parts hard to watch and finely crafted. From this desperate, harrowing scenario comes suspense, with a tense, breathless atmosphere concocted with almost no action. However, what I perceived as the prevailing tone of the film (chiefly due to my optimistic nature) was the beauty and wonderment of the piece. Somewhat like Inside Out, the only way to describe Room is simply beautiful. The relationship between mother and son is rarely so sublimely depicted. Even through all the pain and suffering that they go through, director Lenny Abrahmason conveys the love wonderfully, helped by skilled, natural performances. Whilst some scenes are sad enough to bring a tear to the eye, I found myself closer to crying in some of the less depressing scenes - embraces, reunions, etc., which is helped by a score that seems jarringly loud due to the still quiet of most of the rest of the film. When the music kicks in, you know it's a special moment. The convincing nature of the piece is supported by two giants of performances in the form of the astonishing Tremblay, who hopefully has a bright future ahead of him, and the rightly-award-tipped Larson. Tremblay helps steer Room from the pitfalls of a precocious, irritating child actor with a natural and believable role, conveying wonderment and joy at the situation that we, and his mother, know as horribly bleak. His tantrums are like watching a real child in motion, and he comes out as the lead actor - a tough feat, but successfully achieved. Meanwhile, as Joy, Larson bears all the sadness and anger that is the inverse of her innocent and wide- eyed son. The supporting performances, especially from Joan Allen as Joy's mother, and William H. Macy as her father, are equally brilliant. I struggled to think of anything wrong with Room. And it's true; very little keeps it from being a perfect 10. And having waited a couple of days, I have still not come to any realisation of negativity. I suppose all I can say is that it is not incredibly memorable - I may not watch this film much in the future, and it's tough to watch. However, Room holds up as one of the very greatest films of 2015. 95/100.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really had no idea what this movie was about when I was going see it and it was truly an amazing story! Brie Larson fully deserves all the wonderful recognition she is getting. She delivers such a heart- wrenching, powerful performance in "Room." Such a sad and emotional story, Larson connects so well with the emotions of a person in such a terrible scenario allowing the audience to go there with her. With the help of her small but incredibly talented co-star, Jacob Tremblay, Larson gives the performance of a life time. The relationship between the two of mother and son was one of my favorite aspects of this film. I also appreciated that they gave the audience an inside look at the aftermath once the victims finally were blessed to escape from captivity. I was blown away to see what life had brought for Carol and George, now 17 years old! Director Lenny Abrahamson creates such a big story in a small space. Between the directing and the music, there is no way you don't shed a tear at least once during this film. Tears and all, this film is worth the watch. It has taken award season by storm and I'm glad this film is receiving the recognition it deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are many levels to what makes a great movie. You can talk about the technical aspects, the pacing and the writing all day long and know that it's great. But what makes an incredible movie? For me, it's the emotional value.I watched Room towards the end of 2015 before I saw any of the frontrunning best picture nominations and to be honest, it was the most memorable. The writing had me invested in the story, the acting had me invested in the characters and the film making was incredibly unique giving me even more of an appreciation for the movie. As I said though, what had me hooked the most was the fact that the content of the film was hitting me on an emotional level. Whilst following their own personal arcs, I was experiencing the same emotions and understanding where they were coming from. That's intelligent movie making.I can only say good things about this film. The only reason I didn't give it a ten is because I'm a sucker for sweeping environment style cinematography that obviously didn't have relevance in this kind of film, however, upon a rematch I may be inclined to change this and give this movie a rating of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2015's best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard the tiny voices of a five year old child describing how he/she (Sex wasn't specified at the time) has made a connection to every object in a shabby "Room", I opined in my mind that maybe it was a cheap ploy to draw out pity from the unsuspecting audience, who were totally unaware what they were in for. But without enough information on the context in which the child's words were conjured up, blended with the fact that the film was within a time frame of 5 minutes, I resolved to continue. And for the remaining 90 minutes I was left astounded because I had never seen a film that is so "tortuous" and "touching" at the same time-each "T's" given their own half and ground work to manifest, shine and totally connect with the audience in ripples.It all starts in a room-claustrophobic it is: a room that serves as a "world" to 5 year old jack and his Ma/Mum (played by Brie Larson). Immediately, it becomes visible to the audience that the duo are inhabiting in a poverty stricken situation, especially when you hear ma telling 5 year old Jack that the vitamin he is currently taking is his last or even when she tries to kill a rat, which is normal but with a discomfited explanation: telling jack that "It might steal our food". Enough bases are laid to show how deprived they are living with little exposition for their living conditions. Lo and behold, while concerned with their state of affairs, there is a high tendency to forget that all this takes place in just a "Room". No movement is shown on how they move into other quarters, which sort of leaves the viewer in a state of guesses. Is Ma a prostitute- considering that she locks Jack in the closet when a male visitor comes around? Or Ma might be living on government support while trying to maintain her crack addiction (far-fetched though). My guess was the first question and the most logical for anyone to conjecture. But it also goes to show how the hush-hush of the plot forces one to reason otherwise. A water closet without a lid, virtually no windows except the small glass sun-light entry at the roof with a lavatory, bed and a bathtub-all in one small space-a "Room"! The most intense moments in the film come with how Jack views his environs. It is his world. He was born in it-very in touch with the virtually non-existent happenings that take place. Things like cars, trees, the sky and even other humans are all abstract. At first sight, I thought Jack was a girl because of the long hair, but given the circumstances, one would understand why that came to be. I remember that scene where Ma tells him that there is a whole other world out there and not a planet like she had previously told him-his feedback was with disgust-vocally and vehemently hostile to Ma's words. Even when he goes out of "Room"-the yearning to go back guides his every being, how he reacts to every touch and fails to connect. Jack is played by Jacob Tremplay in one of the most pitiful as well as endearing performance from a child taken from his small confines and thrust into the world-finding it hard to fine-tune into the larger- than-"Room" earth. But his recovery is visually soothing-done in a step by step manner though with a little touch of let's-do-it-for- convenience-sake.It was a kidnap by a middle aged man that put Ma and Jack in the "Room". Only he knows the code to the room. He kidnapped Ma when she was 17, raped her and Jack was the product. Ma waited until Jack was 5 before she used him to find freedom. The scenes leading up to their escape no matter how valiant swings back and forth between borderline irresponsibility of a mother and last minute attempts at freedom-literally. Unfortunately for Ma, it takes Jack a little while to understand why Ma rolls him up in a rug or why she places a hot rag on his head so he can pretend sick. And in the process convince the captor to take him outside-a means by which Jack escapes. Brie Larson has played a mother before. See the film (Train wreck), in which she played Amy's sister: 2015's best romantic comedy yet! That protector/guardian/Mother role is a comfort zone for her; she plays it as if it is a second skin. But here, her work is laden with a puddle of grief and she lives up to the billing wedged between a downcast figure who reserves strength and optimism and a woman who struggles in the aftermath. The scenes after her character is rescued shows how much she is in touch with her sorrowful side, which is aided by the poignant feel of the film's score. "Room" is a harrowing experience. 2015's best-----yet! From my own perspective, this is the film to beat. Last year (2014), it was the dark, brooding, righteously-themed business drama: A Most Violent Year, but this year (2015) presents a melancholic-esque claustrophobe: "Room". It's usually small scale, little budget, independent, non-franchise films like this that makes the most sense-telling a story that reaches out to the heart and apprehension of its audience. I would bear false witness if I said it wasn't distressing-it is! The perturbing narrative claws at the gorge of human consciousness, and replicates itself there like a cell undergoing meiosis-it spreads and plants, adhering, which leaves the viewer to imagine him/herself in the same gloomy hopeless picture of a woman who has lived in a particular room for 7 years-no sun, no air, no human contact. This is the kind of film that will uplift the mood of prisoners after seeing it-who will in turn thank their stars for their plight-at least they get to feel the sunlight and interact with humans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Room is a powerful and inspiring film that is unlike any other film I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"When I was small, I only knew small things. But now I'm five, I know everything!"It doesn't feel right to call Lenny Abrahamson's latest film a small one because it is such a rewarding and emotional experience. Yes, it is a low key and small scaled film, but it has such a profound impact on the audience that it is far from being small. The first half of the film takes place in a very confined space, which makes the second half of the movie even more rewarding as the world around these two protagonists expands. Very few times in film has a director captured such an interesting and authentic mother and son dynamic as we find here with Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay's performances. Larson is guaranteed to win the Oscar for her lead role here and she fully deserves it as this mother who has endured the worst of times, but found a means of surviving through her son. She truly lives a nightmare, but Abrahamson doesn't focus on that as much as he does at making us experience their world through the young son's eyes. He is innocent and has never seen the world outside of the small room in which he unknowingly has been held captive since his birth. His mother has done everything she can to give him a happy and normal life despite the situation. Tremblay delivers an equally impressive performance, and his young age shouldn't have been a factor when it came to voting for the best performances of the year. He was outstanding and held his own in each scene he shared with Larson. The two performances are the main reason why Room has achieved such greatness. Room is based on Emma Donoghue's best selling novel about a 5 year old boy who experiences the world in the confined space of a small room. The only person he has direct contact with is his mother. His only contact with the outside world is through a small TV, but his mother has told him that the images are of other universes far from theirs. Jack also knows there is one other person that exists in their world, as some nights a visitor comes into the room from a locked door, but his mom orders him to keep away from him and stay in his wardrobe. Jack's mother has done her best to give him love and nurture, but as his curiosity begins to grow there is only so far she can go with her story. What will happen when young Jack realizes that there is actually more to the world than the small room in which they have been confined in? What follows is a deeply emotional and profound thriller that shook me to my core. Lenny Abrahamson is known for delivering original and unconventional stories. Previously to Room he had directed Michael Fassbender in Frank, a film in which the main protagonist wore a giant paper-mache mask throughout the story. Room however goes a step further delivering a thriller in a very unconventional way as we get to experience the harrowing events through the innocence of a five year old boy and the depths his mother goes through to give him a normal life. From the very opening scene we know there is nothing normal about their lifestyle, but at the same time the film avoids the typical atmosphere we are used to seeing in crime related films. I don't want to say too much about Room because the less you know about it the better, but the second half delivers even more thrills and engages the audience with even more to ponder about. Finding freedom is only have of the battle, and most of the time these films fail to focus on it, but Room manages to deliver on both ends. This is an effective and powerful film and I'm finding it incredibly hard to put into words how much it affected me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A riveting tale about the triumph of the human spirit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Room tells the story of a 5 year old boy named, Jack(Jacob Tremblay) &amp; his Ma(Brie Larson). Ma was abducted by Old Nick(Sean Bridgers), when she was 17 years old. Her son Jack &amp; her have been held captive in a tiny room for a couple of years. For little Jack, that room is his whole world. He has lived there, all his life. Ma tells Jack that, "Room" as they call it, is all there is in the world. Anything outside the room, is space &amp; aliens. She tells him this fantasy tale, to hide the truth about Old Nick. Somehow, Jack &amp; Ma get the opportunity to escape &amp; miraculously, they do. Now, Jack has to face the real world in its entirety. Ma has to cope with the world after a long gap &amp; help Jack get accustomed to his new life. Room is a flawless &amp; mind blowing film! It is a one of a kind experience. Director Lenny Abrahamson has masterfully adapted Emma Donoghue's novel of the same name. One of the highlights of this movie is that, everything is shown &amp; explained to the viewer, from Jack's perspective. From the camera angles, to the adorable narration, we see the events of the film unfold through Jack's eyes. Apart from being an emotional &amp; feel-good drama, Room also has a few thrilling moments. These will have you on the edge of your seat. At its core though, this movie is about the infinite love that a mother &amp; her child share. The performances are the main highlight of the film. Brie Larson has given the best performance of her career, as Ma. Larson has proved her versatility by acting in a variety of movies, ranging from adult comedies like 21 Jump Street(2012), to indie dramas like Room. Brie Larson truly deserves all the appreciation &amp; accolades coming her way. Jacob Tremblay is the standout performer, as Jack. At a tender age, Tremblay effortlessly showcases a variety of emotions as Jack. Jacob Tremblay has a bright future in Hollywood. Sean Bridgers is great as Old Nick. Joan Allen is brilliant as Nancy. William H. Macy is awesome as Robert. Tom McCamus is excellent as Leo. The supporting cast did a superb job, as well. Room is a must watch. It is not just the best movie of the year but also, one of the best movies of all time. An instant classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How many times in your life have you been forced to finish a bad movie, book, or story, all the while just wishing it would end? Rarely is that longing as desperate in our reality as it is for the characters in Room. When Jack screams at his Ma, "I want a different story!", you know there's more to it than just a hunger for a different bedtime yarn. Her response, "No! This is the story you get!", punctuates their situation, and ultimately our own desires, with such force it nearly knocked me out. Room, a powerhouse of horrifying drama and real-life suspense, breaks out from its confining premise with enough gentle moments of love to make it one of the year's best. If you can't tell, I'm being careful with the details of the plot. However, know that it's a setup that's about as bleak as one can imagine. Director Abrahamson (maker of the criminally underrated Frank) creates an atmosphere of intensely palpable desperation in his small sets. In lesser hands, Room could've been either an oppressively gloomy downer or dishonestly optimistic hack-job. Instead, it's both strikingly candid and beautifully grace-filled This compassion for its subjects is thanks in no small part to the much-deserved-Oscar-nominated Larson, and young actor Tremblay. His character, in particular, presents such a powerful look at childish na?vet, he gives us one of the most amazing examples childhood trauma and perseverance I've ever seen. That theme (determination through suffering) creates an experience that harbors as much exhilaration as it does tears. Piercing and gut-wrenching, Room is a film you may want to escape, but will be glad you endured.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievable Room</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My journey with Room started in July last year. I saw the title on the source material I use for film release dates and I was intrigued by it. I read the plot and viewed the trailer and very quickly decided I really wanted to see it. Extremely rare for me. I thought it was strange. Then I read up. I discovered there was a novel to this point I was unaware of and that the novelist had done the screenplay. Nothing changed opinion wise until three weeks to a month ago when the reviews started arriving. On reading them numerous people were saying from all sides how emotionally affecting it was and how marked Brie and Jacob's performances were. Fast forward to yesterday when I finally sat down to see it. At this point I felt as if it was equal in significance to any film I've seen accounting for my emotions towards it and feedback response.Believe me it did not disappoint. Incredibly emotional throughout and I really felt it. I think because the seriousness of their situation is so expertly vividly outlined. You understand that they are struggling to survive without many essentials and there's obstacles at almost every turn.Brie and Jacob's performances were astounding and filled with tenderness and massive emotion. Lenny Abrahmson dealt absolutely brilliantly with portraying the situation without overdoing the dramatic feel. In fact he captured it perfectly. I've never reacted to any film in the manner that I did to this one. I extremely rarely show my emotion anywhere but particularly in public. I found myself on the verge of tears multiple times. Had I lost my composure I would have struggled to regain it. It wasn't because I was emotionally heightened for it due to it's ultra significance to me. Only due to the fact of the massively raw, stark, immensely powerful nature of it. It's possibly the most important film to me I've ever seen at the cinema. Certainly equal as stated earlier. I won't forget this for a long time maybe never. Bring tissues it's an extremely difficult harrowing watch at times. Totally absorbing, incredibly moving and to echo Mark Kermode you must see Room. It's my film of the year as of yesterday. I don't envy the films charged by me with the task of surpassing it. I am forever grateful to all involved. Unforgettable. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has made an obvious, profound effect on me, since I can't seem to stop thinking about it, talking about, or writing about it. The premise is both emotional and frightening. The idea can be more horrifying than some horror movies, especially if you take into consideration the fact that these types of things actually happen. The connection between Ma and yourself is almost immediate. Even if you don't know what's exactly coming (my case, since I never watched any trailers), the emotion and soul she irradiates is obvious from the start. Through the movie you feel with her, fear for her, and just love her for the love that she has for her son, Jack. Watching her as she does everything she can to make Jack's life "normal" is both heart breaking, and heartwarming. Jacks innocence, his naivety from everything on the outside, and his own way of "coping" with something he doesn't even realize he's coping with, it tugs at your heart. You feel for this kid, as you feel for the mother, and yet he knows nothing else. We want him to have a normal life, when to him, his life is normal.As amazing and strong as the premise is, the way the film was made is simply put, amazing. The acting is superb, especially from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. You're not watching an actress and actor play mother and son; you are watching a mother and son. The internal dialogue the Jack provides, as well as the dial he verbalizes, is great. This movie will definitely be tugging at serious heart strings. Bring tissue for the tears you're sure to be shedding, and find your strong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tremendous mix of drama and science-fiction that will eventually resonate with nearly viewer at some point in time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing a trailer for "Room" months back in 2015 and being almost entirely mystified; it looked like a strange, almost ethereal mix of drama and science-fiction that even the trailer couldn't adequately communicate. Not until seeing it, I realized that this is a film that isn't easy to summarize in a brief two minute trailer, and I'll undoubtedly struggle to illustrate the film's genius with its review. This is the kind of film one needs to experience and feel; a film where words often feel either exaggerating or shortchanging in attempting to illustrate the film's emotional power and exceptional narrative.Simply put, "Room" is the emotional movie-going experience of the season. A deeply moving film that combines the aforementioned genres of drama and science-fiction, "Room" is the kind of film that hits you with its most powerful shot after you walk out of the theater or turn off the TV. It lingers in your mind and the characters, their motivations, their conversations, their struggles, and their thoughts don't escape you, unlike most dramas, where character names are probably not even remembered by most following the end credits.The film opens with a young mother named Joy (Brie Larson) and her small child named Jack (Jacob Tremblay), who live their life in an enclosed garden shed of about one-hundred square feet and their only available sunlight is a skylight. They eat, sleep, bathe, and cook in there, and for Jack, it's the only life he has come to know. At first, their routine actions and close relationship lead one to believe that they've chosen this life in order to free themselves from the constraints of society. However, we see the horror of their reality soon enough.Seven years ago, Joy was tricked and kidnapped by a man known as "Old Nick" (Sean Bridgers), who raped her and had her give birth to Jack. Since then, she has lived inside this closed space; it isn't until their escape-plan is successful that Joy goes back to her mother and father and Jack finally experiences the outside world. Previously, Jack believed, largely in part of his mother, who tried to make their life seem a lot less hellish, that outside of the four walls of "room," as they referred to it, was outer space. The people on TV were just flat, and nothing else besides them and Old Nick existed.Upon finally escaping and trying to return to a life that seems brand new to them, Joy struggles to get Jack to assimilate to the world. His entire life was predicated upon just him and his "Ma," as he was largely kept hidden in the closet whenever Old Nick would come pay them a visit. Now, he must be socialized into the world at age five, and learn that there is not only a larger life, but a larger world outside of "room." His mother, on the other hand, must grapple with her demons that have haunted her since she was captured.If you look at "Room" from the perspective of Joy, you find a drama about being re-socialized into the world after living your entire life in captivity. It's a familiar story, but one that is truly sad and potent, and Brie Larson brings such life and emotion to the role for a woman so young (her precocious acting reminds me quite a bit of Jennifer Lawrence). However, if you look at the film through Jack's perspective, you see a film that plays with the realm of science-fiction. While nothing about "Room" deals with supernatural or "the unknown" in a grandiose sense, we do have a character who has never experienced life first-hand and sees everything around him not only as foreign but, for lack of a better term, alien.This results in a film that's very lucid and ethereal, largely in part because of Lenny Abrahamson's (who directed 2014's "Frank," a strong film dealing with mental illness) unique direction and cinematographer Danny Cohen's dreamlike grasp on reality. These beautiful and immersive aesthetic choices make the world and everything we take for granted and overlook on a daily basis look as if it's an unearthly object, with extreme close-ups and high-contrast depictions employed by Abrahamson."Room" is a film largely bent on repetition; everything from Joy and Jack's daily actions in "room," Jack's attempts to socialize with other adults, Joy's attempt to come to terms with returning to her old life, and more are all showcased as recurring events in the film. This slowburn narrative tactic allows character motivations and interest to rise and boil accordingly, creating a film that turns impacting and even emotional when bigger, more elaborate events occur (the truck scene may be one of the best sequences I've seen in film last year). With all that and more considered, "Room" is a wonderful treat of a film; one that will hit everyone differently in a sense that it's not a matter of if it will resonate with you but how it will eventually manage to do so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific Thriller with Great Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Room (2015) **** (out of 4)A mother (Brie Larson) and her five-year-old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) live in a small room where the mom eventually decides to try and get out of the room so that her son can have a better life.I'm really not going to say much more about the plot because it's really best that you go into the film just knowing the simplest detail and that's the fact that the mom and son are living inside a small room. I must admit that I went into this movie with high hopes and they were not only met but easily surpassed. Director Lenny Abrahamson once again shows that you don't need a one hundred million dollar budget in order to make a great film. No, ROOM shows what great directing, great acting and a great story can do.What really amazed me about the film is the way Abrahamson was able to make you feel trapped by the surroundings. The first portion of the movie all takes place inside this small room and this room is really a character of its own. What makes the film so special is the fact that you get accustom to this small room and you can feel for both of the characters and understand what they're going through. This first portion also works as a terrific mystery because you don't know why they're in this room and slowly the mystery is revealed.The film turns into a remarkable character study during the second act. Again, I'm not going to spoil any of the twists so lets just say that the mother, the son and others are so torn from what happened that it's remarkable watching the actors bring these characters to life. The various troubles that follow is something hard to watch at times but certainly impossible to forget.Brie Larson turns in a terrific performance and only after viewing the film will you see and understand how many different emotions she has to play. She easily becomes this character and there's not a single frame where you feel that you're watching an actress work. No, instead you really do feel as if you're seeing a real character going through these real hardships. Tremblay turns in one of the greatest child performances I've ever seen and especially when you look at how challenging the role and film are. Both Larson and Tremblay have a terrific chemistry that really comes across wonderfully on the screen. William H. Macy, Joan Allen, Matt Gordon and Sean Bridgers are all terrific as well.ROOM deals with a very troubling subject matter and the film really doesn't pull any punches. The subject matter turns more ugly with each new twist but in the end you're seeing one of the best character developments in recent years as well as some of the greatest acting that you're going to see. It's really remarkable what the director managed to pull off but ROOM is certainly a great gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely NO Room For Improvement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If those members of the Academy eligible to vote for Best Actress had even the smallest sense of justice they'd strike a second Best Actress Oscar and give one each to Saorsie Ronan and Brie Larson because God knows what the other nominees, especially Charlotte Rampling, are even doing on the same short list. But of course the members concerned have long banished the word justice from their collective vocabularies as I predicted right here on IMDb back in November, 2013, when I said in my review of Short Term 12 that neither Larson nor the excellent movie would even be nominated. What can I tell you. Those are the breaks. In a perfect world everyone involved in Room from the Head Honcho right down to the guy who carried beer would be recognized for their contribution to one of the finest movies of the year. Okay, the people responsible for nominating actresses got it right for once but, as if to compensate they failed to even nominate Larson's remarkable co- star Jacob Tremblay. Like Short Term 12 this is hardly Multiplex fodder aimed at the popcorn set but that doesn't mean it shouldn't play in the Multiplexes and expose the cgi sequel freaks to real filmmaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Make space in your life (and in your heart) for "Room".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Which of the following situations would you find the most traumatic? (1) You are kidnapped, removed from everyone and everything you know and love, never knowing if you will ever be free again. (2) You are born into a captivity in which you know hardly anything about what most people take for granted as "the world" and then are suddenly thrust into that world with almost no understanding of what you're seeing, what to do or how to behave. Stop. Think about it. Either situation would be a horribly upsetting and disorienting to experience. We see both situations play out in the fictional drama "Room" (R, 1:58). Although the film is not based on any specific real-life story, it does have a strong basis in reality ? in the cases that we occasionally see on the news or in a true-crime TV drama. A young woman is taken captive by a monstrous person who holds her for years against her will. In some cases, innocent children are born into such situations, knowing nothing but confinement, with only a mother's love to depend on.Joy Newsome (Brie Larson) was seventeen when a man who claimed that he needed help with a sick dog abducted Joy and imprisoned her in the garden shed in his back yard. The man (Sean Bridgers), whose name Joy didn't know (simply referring to him as "Old Nick") kept Joy as a sex slave, bringing her just enough food and other essentials to survive. He brought her supplies once a week, but visited her for sex every night. Eventually, Old Nick's ongoing rape of Joy produced a baby boy. Joy named him Jack. Jack only knows Joy as "Ma". He has never even seen Old Nick. At a set time every night, Joy sends Jack to sleep on the floor of the wardrobe in the corner of the room. Old Nick punches a code into the door's electronic lock. He enters. He does "his business" and leaves. Jack is now free to climb into bed with Ma.The days belong to Joy and Jack (Jacob Tremblay). He's now five years old. He has never had a haircut, never seen a doctor and never left Room. The wardrobe where he sleeps when Old Nick comes calling, Ma's bed, a toilet, bathtub, sink, toaster oven, small table and old television is all Jack has ever known. As far as he knows, the world he sees on TV is all made up and the small skylight in the roof of the shed is outer space. To Jack, there simply is nothing else but Room, the mysterious voice of Old Nick, and Ma. For her part, Joy does all she can for Jack. She "cooks" the meager rations that Old Nick brings and she breastfeeds Jack. She's his teacher, his playmate, his protector and, basically the only person who exists.As hard as Joy works to make a life for her and Jack in Room, their situation is starting to change, calling their long-term survival into question. Joy has tried to escape before, but it becomes clear to her that she has to try again. Maybe Jack is now old enough to help ? if she can get him to understand her plan. It isn't a spoiler to reveal that Joy's escape plan works, because that is what the second half of this movie is about. Joy is reunited with her mother (Joan Allen) and father (William H. Macy), who are now divorced. Joy and Jack move in with her mother and her mother's boyfriend (Tom McCamus) who do their best to help Joy and Jack adjust to their newfound freedom, with all that means for each of them.These adjustments aren't be easy. Jack has to learn? everything that you and I take for granted about our world. Joy has to try to get past the emotional trauma of seven years of captivity and having raised a son in that environment. Then, of course, there are certain legal questions that a family lawyer is now there to handle? and the media circus that naturally accompanies such stories in real life. This film doesn't dwell on the legal or public aspects of this case, but those elements are there in the background, even while this dramatically changed family focuses on finding a way to forge fresh bonds and move forward in the most difficult of situations."Room" is as remarkable as the story it portrays. Basing the film on the 2010 novel by Emma Donoghue (who also wrote the screenplay) frees the plot to explore a wide variety of issues without being confined to the details of one specific real-life case. Telling the story through Jack's eyes (complete with a judicious use of well-written narration by the boy) helps us to understand the wide ranging implications of such an experience for Jack, his mother and his newfound family. Director Lenny Abrahamson takes full advantage of these story-telling opportunities with his use of camera angles and the markedly different tone in the movie's very different halves. Topping it all off are exceptionally affecting performances by all the main characters ? especially Larson and Tremblay. Although the pacing of the film sometimes lags unnecessarily, there is no criticizing this film's emotional impact and the importance of the lessons that it teaches its audience. I have no room to give this film anything less than an "A".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GMM: Room Movie Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Envision spending your entire life confined to a single room, the size of a shed, with just a small skylight as your only perception of the outside world. For Jack (Jacob Tremblay), this was his life. This was all he knew. Room (2015) is a film based off of the best-selling novel by Emma Donoghue, told through the eyes of Jack, the five year old son of Ma (Brie Larson). Jack and Ma escape from this small confinement and attempt to adjust to something Jack never knew existed, the world.Room is a small story driven independent movie. And like many of its kind, Room has to rely on a great screenplay, solid acting, and moving character development for it to get wide recognition. Room delivers on all of these aspects. You know a movie really tugs on the heartstrings when you notice multiple viewers in the theater crying during specific scenes. Jacob Tremblay and Brie Larson are near flawless together on screen as they depict the highs and lows of being confined to a single room for years, as well as their transition back to society.It was very interesting to witness the depictions of what a child would believe as real, or not, based upon what he has been deprived of. Luckily, Jack and Ma have a television, but Ma has had to shelter Jack from some aspects of what really is going on outside of the 10x10 shed because she fears what this knowledge might bring to him. Real, TV world, space, aliens, and people are concepts that are different to Jack. The only other person he sees besides Ma, is old Nick (Sean Bridgers), whom Jack only sees through the cracks of the wardrobe he sleeps in.Once they escape this world called room, director Lenny Abrahamson is tasked with showing how Jack adjusts to this seemingly alien planet. Both trauma and confusion seem accurately depicted as Jack and Ma both have mixed responses to what Jack has never known, and what Ma's life used to be. By the end of the movie, it felt satisfyingly complete, as it touched back on the initial openings, reoccurring themes, and feelings of closure for Jack and Ma.As mentioned above, the film does receive a standing ovation from bringing the viewers to feel deep compassion for the character. However, the times of suspense should only get a pat on the back. The sense of danger, fear, and urgency does not seem to suck you in. Part of this was attributed to the score that at times seemed more redundant and annoying. What seemed to be the same piano notes only appeared during scenes of sadness, awe, and joy, but nothing was there to enhance the other scenes.The only criticism of the directorial style was the lapse in direction that the story was supposed to take towards the end of the film. The entire time the story was told through the eyes of Jack. However, towards the last part of the movie, there was a shift that included some of Ma's point of view. This slightly took away from the ways a five year old would try to explain certain behaviors or actions of adults. Also, for those who have read the book, don't expect the movie to include every aspect of it. Just like every other film based on books, graphic novels, comics, or even true events, only certain aspects can be adapted and some must be altered in order to try and make the best move possible.Room is definitely an emotional journey through trauma and discovery. It has very strong storytelling and acting. Room fell short in some aspects, though they did not sufficiently diminish the overall experience of the film. It brings different concepts for those to learn from, such as the importance of family, experience, and empathy towards others. If you want to escape the confinements of recent big budget films, or want to experience something moving that you will not forget, go see Room. Room earns an unwavering 8/10.Read more movie reviews and discussions from graymattermovies.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>and the Oscar goes to...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brie Larson's performance in this film is beyond question one of the best performances I've seen by a woman in a long time. This film starts with a mother and a son living in close confines. You think at the start they are just poor, but you begin to realise they are locked in a shed and the mother has been held captive for seven years. She tries to make the room a safe place for her son to grow up. But then one day decides she has to use her son to escape. This leads to an emotional roller-coaster of a film that doesn't let go the whole way through. This is not an easy to film to watch, so many emotions going on below the surface. I had seen Brie Larson in movies when she was a kid, but I had no idea she could be this good. What her character has to go through his horrific in itself. But she shows courage and a strong will to survive. There is so much emotional depth to her character. She shows love for her son, uses her survival instincts and a real strength has a human being to want to live in the real world again. The performance is astonishing and the performance by Jacob Tremblay as the young son is equally powerful. If you love great movies and performances, and can take this subject matter you must see this movie. Brie Larson better prepare a speech at the Oscar's because this the most sure front runner I've seen in a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bona fide masterpiece of emotion and storytelling. Best film of the year hands down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard for me to fully express the staggering impression that Room left on me using only the written word, but I'll have a go at it anyway. First I'll say that it's hands down my favourite film of the year thus far, and I left the theatre with many emotions swelling in me, affected in a way the only a small group of films have been able do for me. It's a patient, mature study in psychology and a sweeping symphony of complicated emotions revolving around a terrible, tragic situation that seems like a well of hurt and pain until in climbs it's way out into a tenderly heartfelt, incredibly life affirming resolution that never dips into half assed melodrama and feels earned and appropriate. The film casts such a powerful spell that it briefly changed the concept of time for me; Upon arriving near the end, I felt as if years had actually passed for me in theatre since I embarked on the film's journey. The camera, script and actors kept me so intimately close to the characters for the duration of the piece and made me love and care for them so much that it brought me right into their timeline with an intimacy that rarely happens for me in cinema. Now on to the actors. What brave, compelling work from every single performer on screen, right down to the bit parts. Every role castes with a sharp eye for detail and reverent contemplation of who is right for what, creating a roster of heavy hitters and up and comers to be reckoned with. Brie Larson gives a beyond award worthy turn as Joy, a girl who was kidnapped at a young age and held captive by a horrible man (Sean Bridgers, displaying smouldering volatility in terrifying proportions) who impregnates her. She raises the child in the dour, tiny garden shed he keeps her in. Faced with the unthinkable task of creating a nurturing environment for her little one, she tells him that the shed is 'Room', their kingdom, and that the people he sees on their little TV are fake, imparting that they and their captor are the only real ones and there is no outside world. This reminds just how mouldable our minds are when we are small, and the film beautifully explores the psychological ramifications of how we raise our young, how nature vs. nurture comes into play in startling ways during the darkest of times, and the decisions we are forced to make on our own to ensure that our children are safe, even when things have gone beyond wrong, as they have for the poor girl. Old Nick, as she nicknames their captor, rapes her every few days, and treats the two of them like animals. Her son Jack reaches an age where escape becomes vital in his mothers eyes, and she takes her chance, orchestrating a harebrained ditch effort to break free, which is my favourite sequence of the film. It's also one of the most tension filled, seat gripping scenes I've ever seen, as the character buildup has set our personal stakes epically high, which combined with the excellent set up makes for a clammy nightmare of an escape. The director makes the fascinating choice not to use any music at all until they reach freedom, which I noted. As soon as they are out, I let out a cathartic, audible sigh of relief, as the dank hell they undeservedly spent almost a decade in gives way to a vibrant, strange new world for little Jack. The camera takes his perspective and pores over every aspect of the outside realm with the patience and curiosity it takes to place us in his psyche, a child viewing the world in its entirety and true form for the very first time, essentially a second birth, a theme which the film handles marvellously. I must speak about Jacob Tremblay, a Vancouver native who plays Jack and gives the most soul wrenching performance I've ever seen from a child actor. The levels of sheer intuition and innocent truth he infuses in his work at such a young age are just unbelievable, and he should be in the riding for Oscar gold as well. Larson and him have uncanny chemistry, the love shown in the early scenes a blooming Rose of hope that fends off the looming darkness they dwell in, which is tested by the inevitable complications they face upon entering the real world once again. Larson burst onto the scene with 21 Jump Street and Don Jon, fun but inconsequential fluff. Here she shows us that she means business, and wants to tell stories that are important, and show audiences what it means to be human through her work. I look forward to where this extraordinary girl takes us in her next cinematic journey. Joan Allen makes subtly heartbreaking work as Joy's mother, William H. Macy is briefly present as her Dad, Tom McCamus makes compassionate work of her stepdad and like I said, everyone else is superb, right down to the day players. I was crippled by emotion and raw with nerve jangling suspense after this one, exiting the theatre soaring on the high I eternally strive for in my cinematic adventures. The fact that only one theatre in Vancouver is playing this one is an affront to the universe. Get down to Tinseltown and see this one before it's gone. You'll thank me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The subject matter for something like this is already reason enough to know how emotionally taxing it will be as a whole. The film is cleverly built in two different halves, and I think that the best way to make each half work is by having the other in the film. I have not read the novel so this is by extension something it did, but it still worked wonders. The biggest reason to see it is definitely for Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. Larson seems to be the front-runner to win the Oscar, which I actually think is a bit surprising because it's such an understated performance. As great as she is, Tremblay impressed me even more. There's such a realistic, genuine heart to his work here. At no point does it seem like he's even acting a part. He deserves an Oscar nomination for Leading Actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Taste. Great Production Value</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never write reviews but rarely do my opinions disagree with the IMDb top 250 so greatly so I wanted to explain myself.Room has probably the highest production value of any movie. That being said, it primarily takes place in a shack and inside a house. That being said, it probably cost around 5 million to make. So high marks there. I must mention is has perfect acting. H Macy, Bree, that kid, everyone, congrats. But in my opinion, perfect production value (script, camera, acting, directing, location, art dept, etc) does not mean the movie is perfect.It's how the production value works together as a living entity. For instance, Star Wars has inconsistent production value, yet it is still watched today. That is because the bad and good production value come together and create an entity. A movie.In Room, all the production value does not make a great movie. I leave the movie feeling empty and destroyed. I leave hating the cinema if that is the best cinema has to offer. I digress, the movie needed to be told in a non linear way to make it more tasteful with about half of it being cut and replaced with something else. While I'm sure this is quite tasteful as a book, as a film, I don't want to see a women getting rapped in front of her son 8 times and nether should you.This leads me to conclude that the academy, critics and many IMDb users are sociopaths. Or simply, nitpickers whom only care about production value. The level of this dastardly accusation I have just come up with is proportional to the rate I disagree with critics, IMDb users, academy with a +/- 2 point buffer in regards to our respective ratings of this movie. I give this a 5.4.This means I may be right in this conclusion: Cinema is not safe. But than again, it probably never was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ties with Spotlight for the best drama of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a great story! When I bought a ticket, I didn't expect this movie to be so deep and honest. Abrahamson's good direction and Brie Larson's and Jacob Tremblay's amazing acting make this movie almost documentary-like. It just all looks too real and too realistically painful to be a feature film.Movie starts with a mother and her son, Jack, and their story about how they were locked in "Old Nick's shed" for 7 years (although Jack is only 5 - I think you can guess what that means). The kid never saw the outside world and believes that everything can either belong to the "Room world" or "TV world". The clash between him and his mom about is she lying about the outside world or not produces one of the greatest and best-acted scenes of the whole year.Among all the people that deserved the acclaim for this beautiful movie and beside Amrahamson, Larson and Tremblay, I want to point out Emma Donoghue's great success in adapting her own bestseller into a very clever and touching screenplay. Also, Joan Allen did a great job as Joy's mother (Jack's grandma). I really really hope she gets nominated for the Academy Award for her performance.Talking about Oscars, I think Brie Larson has a pretty good chances at not just getting nominated, but also winning the award in February. Young Jacob, on the other side, has a pretty serious competition in the Supporting Actor category (Keaton and Ruffalo, (both frontrunners) from "Spotlight", Rylance from "Bridge of Spies", Rogen from "Steve Jobs", Dano, Del Toro, Elba, and possibly Stallone and Hardy), so he should be really satisfied with just getting a nod. It's very sad such a good performance might be overlooked only because he is still a kid (and we know Academy rarely favors child actors).If there is a movie that will get overlooked in the next couple of months, I think it will be "Room". Go buy your movie ticket right now and prevent that from happening. I'm sure you won't be disappointed.Movie rating: 8.9/10My "Best Movies of 2015" list: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls031061874/ My "Best Movies Ever Made" list: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls072746304/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Did This Get Nominated for 4 Oscars?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all know how the Academy continually gives out awards and award nominations to the wrong movies, while snubbing movies that are superior in every other way. HOWEVER, the Academy really dropped the ball here.I am a huge movie buff and will pretty much watch anything even if the premise doesn't have mass appeal. This one clearly has less mass appeal, but the critical acclaim drew me in and wasted 1 hour and 20 minutes of my life (I couldn't watch the last 40 minutes and after reading the plot summary on Wikipedia, I was relieved/upset to find out I didn't miss anything.)The character development flat out sucks. I'm all for movies with a slightly ambiguous nature, but you gotta satisfy the viewers somehow by letting them know what's going on and having the movie make sense. Brie Larson is decent in the main role, but her character isn't really explored and there isn't enough depth to her character. Jack (don't know the actor's name) is a basic 5-year old and I've heard a better child-centric voice narration from a Disney movie. The only reason I gave it a 5 and not something lower is because there are a few aspects of the film I liked. *SPOILER ALERT* The scene where they finally escape from the room is engaging, but after that the film drags on as the people who made this film don't have any knack for quality storytelling. *END SPOILER ALERT*Don't waste your time on this movie as it doesn't do justice to a very disturbing subject matter and only leaves you asking one question: Why did I waste 2 hours of my life? Congrats Academy for messing up again. It just really sickens me that great films like Love &amp; Mercy, Straight Outta Compton, Sicario, and The End of the Tour get not nearly the acclaim they deserve by the Academy (Sicario and Straight Outta Compton deserve more nominations) or fail to be recognized by the Academy at all (Love &amp; Mercy, The End of the Tour). The Academy sucks and this film re-confirmed it for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a lovely room!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please, please, please. Can you make room for about two minutes to read my review of the movie "Room"? This movie is a haunting look at the emotional &amp; survival aspects of child abduction seen through the eyes of a young boy. That boy's name is Jack; his mother Joy was abducted as a teen and held captive for numerous years. The despicable excuse for a human being who abducted Joy impregnated her and the result was Jack. The first half of the movie is captured in the shed "room" where Joy &amp; Jack are held captive and it shows them both go through their normal daily routine, and their mother to child interactions. It is very disturbing to watch, but so resounding in how their resiliency holds them through. Jack is blinded to much of the world due to his captivity, and only envisions to be reality on what he sees on television; this is brilliantly presented by screenwriter Emma Donoghue who adapted the script from her novel. The second half of "Room" is stored in the aspects of adjusting to the real world after Joy &amp; Jack are able to free their captor. Director Lenny Abrahamson helms the picture with a commanding orchestration of the inner emotional layers that Joy &amp; Jack go through their experience in captivity and adjusting; my only minor critique of "Room" was in the film's unrealistic ending which obviously I won't reveal because there is no room for spoilers in my reviews. Brie Larson was astounding as Joy, and this is the real Joy who will be the next Oscar winner for Best Actress. Jacob Tremblay as Jack was a revelation, and this young actor is heading straight to the real world of stardom; he is a genuine pure talent. There was also strong supporting work from Joan Allen as Joy's mother, William H. Macy as Joy's father, and Tom McCamus as the boyfriend of Joy's mom. OK, I will free you now from this review, sorry I held you captive with all those roomy puns. Just make sure you make room for "Room". ***** Excellent</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sparse Tale Powered By Two Strong Leads</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After five-year-old Jack and his mother escape from the enclosed surroundings that Jack has known his entire life, the boy makes a thrilling discovery.The difference between this film and a B-grade thriller or revenge film is in the level of performance achieved by the two leads, Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. They are the beginning middle and end of everything good about this film. (And luckily, they are strong enough to cancel out William H. Macy, who is horribly miscast in this movie.) There is no doubt that Brie Larson will win the Oscar for Best Actress, and no doubt that she deserves it. After her picking up a Golden Globe and a SAG Award, it would be very strange to applaud anyone else. She is strong, weak, sad, elated, protective and terrified. This is just about the fullest range of emotions that a person can have, especially in under two hours on screen.Many have noted that Jacob Tremblay is equally good. Some say he is even better than Larson (and that is quite possible). Yet he did not get a nomination. This is definitely unfortunate. Whether he is on par with Leonardo DiCaprio's strength this year is hard to say, but it seems that Tremblay easily was more intense, more memorable than Matt Damon. With all due respect to Matt Damon.Not having read the book, I can make no commented on the adapted screenplay. I think the script we end up with is excellent, but if the award is for the adaptation, that might be more difficult to call.This leaves Best Director and Best Picture. I find it very unlikely that Lenny Abrahamson will win. He definitely deserves to be in this category, and he has risen relatively quickly. 2014's "Frank" was a quirky little film that deserved more attention, and "Room" is going to launch him into the A-list. His next film is rumored to be a Civil War story, and although that has been done to death (what hasn't?), many eyes will now be on it.And Best Picture? That would be quite the upset. Some people have really gotten behind the film. Richard Roeper, for example, thinks "Room" is one of the best films of the decade. He would love to see "Room" go home with the little golden man. But it would be an uphill fight. Most likely it will end up taking third or fourth place (and we are not privy to the votes).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Room</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the book by Emma Donoghue, from what I heard about this film I thought it may have similar vibe to Oldboy (without the violence), I knew a little about the concept, but it turned out to be even better than anything I could have expected, from Oscar nominated director Lenny Abrahamson (Frank). Basically twenty-four- year-old Joy "Ma" Newsome (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Brie Larson) and her five-year-old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) live in a squalid shed they call "Room", sharing a bed, toilet, bathtub, television and a rudimentary kitchen, the only window is a skylight. A man called Old Nick (Sean Bridgers), Jack's father, abducted Joy seven years ago and has held her and Jack captive ever since, he routinely rapes her while Jack sleeps in the wardrobe, Joy is overcome sometimes with depression and suffers malnutrition, but tries to stay optimistic for her son. Having been in Room since he was born, Jack has been allowed by Joy to believe that everything he sees on television, from the rest of the world, is make believe, and that only Room and its contents are "real". This changes however when Old Nick tells Joy he has lost his job and threatens he may not be able to afford future supplies, so Joy decides to finally tell Jack the truth, there really is an outside world, everything on television is real, he reacts dramatically with disbelief and a lack of understanding. To stand a chance of getting out of Room, Joy trains Jack to fake a fever, hoping Old Nick will have no choice but to take him to hospital, but instead he says he return and bring antibiotics. Joy has Jack play dead so that she can wrap him in a carpet, in the hope that Old Nick will remove him from Room, he falls for this trick and places a wrapped up Jack in the back of his pickup truck, driving through a residential area, Jack is stunned by exposure to the outside world, but jumps from the truck and attracts the attention of a passer-by. Old Nick tries to take Jack back, but gets away before he can be questioned or caught, the police question a startled Jack about what has happened to him, he slowly explains about where he and his mother are being held, they soon identify the location of the shed and Joy is also rescued, they are both taken to a hospital. In the hospital Joy is reunited with her parents, father Robert (William H. Macy) and mother Nancy (Joan Allen), who she learns have divorced, Nancy is now married to new husband Leo (Tom McCamus), Jack is still overwhelmed by all the new things and people approaching him. Joy and Jack return to her childhood home where Nancy and Leo live, Robert cannot accept Jack and leaves, Jack initially struggles to adapt to life in the larger world outside of Room, speaking only to his mother about his feelings, even expressing a desire to return to Room. Joy struggles with anger and depression about the seven years taken from her and her son, she argues with her mother, and during a television interview about what happened reacts angrily, she finally has a breakdown and attempts suicide, but survives and is taken to hospital. With his mother recovering, Jack slowly shows signs of adapting and settling into his new life, bonding with his grandmother, Leo and his dog, playing with toys he has been given, and he meets and plays with a boy his age, he also finally allows his grandmother to cut his long hair, his "strong", so he can send it to his mother in hospital. Joy returns home and thanks Jack for saving his life again, he asks her if he can see Room again one last time, she agrees to his request and they visit room, escorted by a police officer, Jack feels that with the door open and light coming in that is has shrunk, Joy assures him it is the same place, Jack and Joy says his final goodbyes to Room, and they leave to continue life in the bigger world. Also starring Cas Anvar as Dr. Mittal, Matt Gordon as Doug, Amanda Brugel as Officer Parker and Joe Pingue as Officer Grabowski. Larson gives a compelling and career-minting performance as the emotionally drained mother who has had life stolen by a terrible situation and longs to escape, but this film almost completely belongs to newcomer Tremblay, who (with his long hair could be mistaken for a girl for a long while) is exceptional as the youngster whose whole life revolves around the small space he lives in until being gobsmacked by the realities of life in the bigger world, the mother-son bond is highly believable. The novel was inspired by the case of Josef Fritzl, the Austrian man who incarcerated his daughter in a basement for 24 years and systematically raped and impregnated her, but obviously the crime element is lessened. The incarceration and claustrophobia works fantastically for the dark first half, then when the break into the outside occurs it really delves into the complexities of the real world, this is absolutely from the point of view of the innocent child, it is nightmarish and emotional in and out of Room, but it is ultimately thrilling, uplifting and a well executed story, a must see drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay for Emma Donoghue, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film tells the story of a five year old boy who has never left his room, because he and his mother are held captive for years by a man.The synopsis doesn't give me an idea of the unimaginable horror that is depicted in the film. Such unspeakable crime can be committed only by the most perverted individuals. As a result of this highly emotionally charged issue, "Room" is highly engaging. Towards the middle of the film, I find every cell in me wants the woman's plan to succeed. I held my breath, I welled up and I sincerely hope there would be some humanity left in the world. Another very emotional scene is the brief TV interview. The interviewer seems so caring and empathic, but asks very biased questions which leads to another emotional zenith. This film depicts the horror of captivity, which I am sure doesn't even match the true abuse and desperation that the victims face.I hope the victims can recover and lead fulfilling lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautiful Ode To The Love Between A Mother &amp; Her Child</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A cleverly envisioned concept realised on the film canvas in a controlled but highly effective manner, Room is an ingeniously crafted, expertly narrated &amp; superbly performed thriller that packs in a much darker story than expected, works as a beautiful ode to the bond between a mother &amp; her child, and benefits immensely from Brie Larson's compelling performance.Room tells the story of a young mother &amp; her 5-year old boy who live in a dilapidated room where she has fabricated a safe &amp; happy universe for her kid in order to shield him from the gruesome reality of their current situation. But after sensing that he is now much capable of understanding things, she concocts a risky plan to escape from the confinement and return to a world her son is totally unaware of.Directed by Lenny Abrahamson and written by the author of the book this movie is adapted from, Room begins on a calm note that takes us through how this mother &amp; son spend their daily life in the small room they live in while steadily bringing a sense of curiosity about their surroundings, which turns absolutely traumatic once their predicament is revealed. The plot is divided into two parts and both cover their isolation in different confinements.The first half is fabulously constructed, with production design team doing a commendable job in congesting the enclosed room with all the necessities that finds its use in the finished print. Cinematography encapsulates the whole picture with an overcast ambiance that aptly reflects the harrowing experience our leading lady has been through. Editing could've been improved for sequences in the second half become repetitive at times. And the background score makes its presence felt only when required.Coming to the performances, Brie Larson &amp; Jacob Tremblay spearhead this aspect with an impressive input and share a spot-on chemistry with each other. Joan Allen, Sean Bridgers &amp; William H. Macy do well in their supporting roles but it's Larson &amp; Tremblay who carry this film all the way for the former delivers what's arguably her finest performance to date while the latter manages to be less irritating &amp; more adorable as the story progresses. Plus, their bonding as mother &amp; child is believable, heartfelt &amp; mesmerising.However, the most striking thing about Room is the way it deals with the themes of isolation freedom &amp; love. For the majority of its first half, we see only two people who are completely dependent on each other, haven't had the exposure of the outside world in years, and share an amazing bond despite the nearly hopeless situation they are in. The next half focuses on their difficulty in readjusting to the real world, as the mother finds herself equally isolated in the outer environment while her son is trying to grasp the unfamiliar world around him.On an overall scale, Room is a beautiful, riveting &amp; heartbreaking story that keeps its main focus on the relationship between a mother &amp; her child, and even in the darkest of situation it doesn't discard the elements of love &amp; hope. The first act brilliantly paves way for what's next in store, the middle act capitalises on the solid groundwork and is simply perfect for it brims with just the right amount of tension &amp; uncertainty, while its remaining runtime feels a bit stretched &amp; becomes repetitive before finally concluding on a hopeful note. Rewarding in more ways than one, Room is one survival tale that's worthy of your time. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ROOM (2015) **** Brie Larson, Jacob Tremblay, Joan Allen, William H. Macy, Sean Bridgers, Wendy Crewson, Tom McCamus, Amanda Brugel. Incredibly well-acted character study about a young woman (Larson in an Oscar calibre turn) whose 7 year abduction includes the company of her 5 year-old boy (Tremblay in arguably one of the best child actor performances ever committed to film and deserves an Oscar nod too) who manage to survive by their wits with their communication and creating pretend world for her son while attempting to escape her captor in the process. While harrowing in its theme, director Lenny Abrahamson forgoes the Lifetime TV film route and wisely avoids melodrama by invoking full focus on his two leads and their travails and aftermath endurances. Adapting her novel, Emma Donoghue's script is spot-on, engrossing and genuinely moving. One of the year's best films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"For love all love of other sights controls, And makes one little room an everywhere." John DonneThink of a relationship more powerful than a mother and child, and you'll be wrong. Room, directed without glamour but with tenderness?many close-ups?by Lenny Abrahamson and written lovingly from her book by Emma Donoghue, is the essence of such a relationship: a young woman, Joy (Brie Larson), imprisoned by a wacko for 7 years and bearing a child, Jack(Jacob Tremblay) who stays with her for 5 before they escape.The first half of the film ever so gently shows the creative power of a mother, who does not let her cloistered son want for ideas and perspective about the world they see on TV and through her eyes. Although Larson's performance is low key and she does nothing spectacular, the reason Jack is so well developed without meeting the world is because of her composed love.The second half delivers us from the almost idyllic "room" to the outside world, where Jack faces a reality almost blindingly real, filled with germs and a grandfather, Robert (William H. Macy), who can't talk to him because of Jack's paternity. Yet there is grandma (Joan Allen), who loves Jack and to whom Jack can say one of his first endearments beyond his mother. The power of this film is its unwillingness to accelerate his acclimation; rather like ripening fruit, that growth takes its own time.Tremblay is a discovery of an exceptional actor?we should see him again soon and for his lifetime. Larson is already an accomplished actress who brings subtle intelligence to difficult roles (see her in Short Term 12). Besides the other very fine actors is the outstanding Joan Allen as Grandma Nancy-just think about the layers of reaction she must have with a daughter returning from a kidnapping and a grandson who needs the gentlest nurturing.The cast does what is needed to bring off one of the best films of the year and Oscar nominations aplenty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jacob Tremblay was amazing actor in the film "Room", as he could really perform his role powerfully. I thought film had some good acting in it. The story was weak. I did want to get into the world of the kidnapper so that I could feel more for Ma and Jack.Why this kidnapper put them in this situation? That would have been more interesting. I was confined to this little room for more than 40 minutes of the film. Suddenly Ma decides that Jack has to help them get out of this situation. He was able to run away very easily and then the rest of the film was about their life at the grandparents. William Macy is a great actor but I don't know why he was needed in this role. He could have been a good kidnapper. Ma attempting suicide was not believable as no one who had been confined to a room would ever imagine committing suicide after what they both went through and were given a new life.Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay were good as actors so I have some hope for them. Novels are whole different world from films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From four walls to no walls, a brilliant movie about a mother and son finding strength in each other</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine, if you will, being born and raised in a small, square, space with only a skylight from which to see the outside world. How would living in such confines define the person? What happens to that world view when the outside comes crashing in? This is the story we watch unfold in "Room".In a complete change from his last film, "Frank", Lenny Abrahamson's "Room" stars Brie Larson as Ma and her now five year old son, Jake, played by Jacob Tremblay. Ma and Jake live together in a room with two chairs, a table, a bent spoon, a bed, a sink, and a wardrobe. Why they live in such a confined space is the basis for the first half of the movie. The second half is what happens when they break free from the room and Jake discovers a vastly bigger room on the outside. The film is told mostly from his perspective, which could be disastrous, but with Tremblay's magnificent acting, and a script which carefully understands a child's perceptions, this technique works to the film's advantage. It is not too saccharine and for the most part, believable.I would be shocked if this film does not net Brie Larson with at least an Academy Award nomination. Her portrayal of a mother in unbelievable circumstances is nothing short of brilliant. Easily the best movie of the year that I have seen so far, but one so emotionally engaging, that it left me drained. If you chose to watch "Room", and I do recommend it, bring plenty of tissues. There wasn't a dry eye in the theater.</fullReview>

I've never seen a film dealt with in such a realistic way. This film was an emotional roller-coaster, I was in tears many times throughout this movie. This film has the best acting of the year.

Joan Allen is great as well, and I expect all of them to get Oscar nominations. In no way was I expecting to be as engaged as I was in this film, because I was absolutely mesmerized. Lenny Abrahamson's directing is incredible. He allows you to really understand these characters, and you feel all the emotion and passion poured on-screen.

		<shortDescription>A dark, feel-good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is difficult to produce a seriously dark film that makes the audience feel good about having seen it, but novelist and screenwriter Emma Donoghue has made the material, director Lenny Abrahamson has delivered the look and feel; and astounding performances by a 23-year-old Brie Larson (Ma) and 7-year-old Jake Tremblay (playing 5-year-old Jack) take the audience through amusement, curiosity, horror, and confusion to a climax that leaves them moist-eyed and content that things will work out.The cinematography, considering the 10-foot square set, was brilliant. The escape sequence, seen both from the astounded Jack's eyes as well as a drone's eye view, grabs the viewer and makes him feel he IS little Jack, if just for a moment.As the escape is executed, it becomes plain that this is a high-grade chick flick. Instinctive motherhood and female mind games that most men would never think of present revelations to those with Y chromosomes, twists that that the brutal Old Nick (Sean Bridgers) never sees coming. Brie Larson's acting, even as her character acts, convinces everyone.There are only three, well, two questions that much of the audience may have: 1) Why was grampa Robert (in a fairly brief appearance by William H Macy) unable to look at Jack? 2) Why did it take forEVer to get Jack's hair cut? (This question is beautifully resolved, by the way.) and 3) This is when you know it is a woman's story: Why, in seven years of captivity, did Ma never think to stand the bed on its end and climb out through the plastic skylight?Those questions aside, ROOM gets ten stars for acting, direction, and cinematography. It loses three stars only for the minor plot fails.</fullReview>

I believe the Film makers wanted to provide another message from the movie. They want us to see the movie from the Child's perspective who don't know anything about outside world. That's what we are, We are just like the child. We have made this "Room" in our own head, we don't know nothing about anybody, we accept our destiny, whether we wanted it or not, over the course of life and time. We just live, live and go on living our life in our own head which is depicted as a "Room" in this movie. Escape from what you don't want to be, You don't have to live your life on someone else's terms. This world is beautiful if you get out of your "Room". &#x2764;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that shows how shelter and surroundings differ, especially when a boy becomes open to the outside world!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Room" is certainly one of the most compelling and interesting drama movies of this year the plot and story is just so different and complex. The film is a harrowing tale of a young boy named Jack(beautiful work from Jacob Tremblay)who along with his Ma(Brie Larson)is trapped and confined for many years in an enclosed room with a 10-by-10-foot space to live in. Thru it all Ma coaches and cares for Jack along the way by reading him stories and singing him songs and putting him to bed with warm love and food. It just goes to show what it's like and how a person must make it when their life is a shelter away from the norm and society. Then all of a sudden the second half of the film takes a spin a twist as when the two escape an outside world is discovered by the little boy and mom. As the grandparents of Jack are found the loving yet tough accepting Nancy(Joan Allen)and Robert(William H. Macy). Most revealing and different is how little Jack sees an open world of sight and sound as it's an adjustment it's clearly not what he was use to with Ma. Overall this film proves that each and everyone leads their own little sheltered life in their own way and world. And true when one ventures out a new world of sight and sound and mind is discovered as each world and room for that matter is of different sight and it gives off a different feel for everyone. "Room" is one drama that sets free the character and viewer to discovery of new sight and to a new look of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay shine; everyone else is just irritatingly selfish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILER ALERT*** ***SPOILER ALERT***Sooooo...I stayed up late last night watching the movie "Room". Brie Larson won the Oscar for Best Actress for this movie, and the plot seemed like it might have potential. I guess now would be a good time to say once again...***SPOILER ALERT*** ***SPOILER ALERT*** If you don't want to know why I didn't like this movie very much then you should stop reading now.Brie Larson was pretty great, and the little kid was even better especially his narrative parts. The movie had plenty of touching moments, no doubt. I mean, even I couldn't keep the water works from flowing when mother and son were re-united in the back of that police car. Sadly, the main issue with this movie is that it peaks in the middle, and the last 58 minutes of the movie is filled with a bunch of useless drivel and irritating performances by some pretty decent actors (Joan Allen, William H. Macy, Wendy Crewson). Lit'rally, there was one seen that irritated me so bad that I wanted to reach thru my TV screen and smack someone. It's a scene where a "better-than-you" talk show host asks the mother if during any part of the seven years they were held captive if she ever thought of sending the boy away to a hospital or a shelter so that he could have a chance at a normal life. I just wanted the mother to say something like, "Hey, ya dimwit, do you even know what was going on? The guy had us locked in a soundproof shed with an electronic keypad lock on the door for SEVEN YEARS!!! The only way to "send my son away" would have been to send him with said abductor who probably would've just as soon slashed my son's throat and left his body in a dumpster than to risk having someone find him out because he was trying to give my son a chance at a NORMAL life!!"But, unfortunately, those lines were never spoken. The other detraction from this movie is that it doesn't take too long to realize that once the movie peaks that it's not going to have a succinct, defined ending. It was just a matter of waiting to see what scene the director decided to end it on. It could have ended a half hour sooner, or it could have played on for two more hours, but there was just no way to wrap it all up in a nicely wrapped package.Yeah, usually I like it when a movie doesn't have a typical Hollywood ending...but not when you can see it coming from 35 kilometers away. In the end I give "Room" 4 out of 10 stars; two for Brie Larson and two for her son. Everything else in the movie is just pure, unadulterated nonsense.RECOMMENDATION: Check out Spotlight instead. It won Best Picture for a reason.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a perfect example of a film that sold me just by its premise: A boy who has been kept in one room his entire life by his mother, begins to wonder what the limits of the world beyond the walls of the enclosed area are. It's also a film that if you're planning on going to see, you shouldn't watch any of the trailers or even read the IMDb synopsis. Just go out and see one of the best films of the year. Brie Larson, who impresses more and more each film she appears in, plays Joy, mother of Jack. Larson hides the depths of her character for a good portion of the film, which makes the emotional moments all the more powerful later on. The story of a mother and son trying to escape this 'room' and their whole emotional journey is what drives Room to greatness. The film itself has a unique structure in that it seems the film could have ended about 45 minutes before it did, but yet it keeps going. It's not that that time is wasted, but I think the flow and rhythm of the movie isn't always there. Which is why the emotional moments midway through are what stick out to me most.Jacob Tremblay absolutely kills it as Jack. At 5 years old and an extremely demanding role, it's hard not to think he deserves some awards attention as well. He pulls off every emotion that is called of him and his chemistry with Brie Larson couldn't be better. The supporting cast is really good as well, but that can get into spoiler territory so I'll stick with the two leads. I also should mention Lenny Abrahamson's directing. I loved the way he chose to unveil why exactly Jack and his mother are stuck in this room and the revelations that follow. Room as a whole isn't always as smooth as it wants to be, but the performances are among the years best, and I think the story will take you on an unexpected emotional roller coaster.+Larson+Tremblay's performance is an anomaly+Emotional journey+Meticulous directing-Second half doesn't live up to the first8.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to start off by saying I recommend you do not watch the trailer for this film. If you do watch the trailer that's fine, but if you wish to avoid knowing what the "second half" of this film is like then you should avoid it.That being said, in order to avoid commenting on the second half I am referring to, I'll try to talk about issues explored in the film rather than plot content.The basic premise is that a woman and her son live in a shed, which they refer to as simply "Room," years after the woman's abduction by an older man. Their names are Joy and Jack, and they are very codependent.What I did not expect from this film is that it deals with the theme of perception of reality, and how much the environment has an impact on this perception. Jack has only lived in Room his whole life and knows nothing outside of this life. To maintain his innocence, Joy has had to tell stories to build a certain perspective on reality for her son. One of the best scenes of the film is when Joy decides it is better for Jack to know the truth about the world and reality, and Jack's reaction is heartbreaking and played brilliantly by Jacob Tremblay.I want to say more, but I feel like I would give too much away if I did. In a nutshell, this film deals with issues I never would have imagined to be tackled in a film with this premise. I recommend you see this film unless you find the premise disturbing, though the film is never violent or graphic.3.5/4.0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moving drama that earns its sentiment. Larson gives one of the best performances of the year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Room couldn't be further from Lenny Abrahamson's last film Frank, a bizarre music-orientated comedy. Gone are the idiosyncrasies that made Frank wild and, for many including myself, compelling, instead we have a moving drama that earns its sentiment. The different approach is felt immediately as Abrahamson traps us with his two principle characters, Ma and Jack, in tight and sometimes oddly framed closeups. It's a somewhat clumsy execution to show the claustrophobia and intimacy Abrahamson wants to achieve as he uses Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay's faces as blank canvases, but the effect is thoroughly felt, and the film's following 30 minutes remain its best. The photography decides to take a step back, but it continues to catch that raw emotion. The concept of a mother having raised her son in confinement then finally breaking free has many avenues to explore. Having not read Emma Donoghue's book, of whom also wrote the screenplay, I mostly expected a small scale -getting out of the eponymous room then reuniting and resolving itself there. Instead, the film goes further than I expected, getting Ma ? also known as Joy, which is becoming a familiar character's name this year ? and Jack back to her teenage home with her own mother. Then, in a way, it doesn't go far enough. But it's interesting to watch it play in its happy medium. It does rely on some key contrivances to get there, such as the kidnapper's wonky perception and ultimately not fighting hard enough when he could have, but that doesn't take away from the gripping escape sequence as the orchestra swells and squeezes tears from you whether you like it or not. Room becomes a rehabilitation story as well as a discovery story, as Joy struggles to re-adapt to home life and Jack is seeing the world he only suspected but never imagined. The detail and convincing touches in Tremblay's performance are what make it special, such as the fact that Jack has never had to deal with stairs. The film is told mostly through his perspective, but it's not held as a consistent theme though that helps it be less on the nose. The first time Jack sees outside is not the first time we see outside. But it's still cathartic as we watch him finally see real trees and real telephone poles. While many can assume that actors as young as Tremblay, who was 8 when he shot Room, are coached through their roles then we can also assume he had expert teachers. He may not carry the gravity of the film throughout, but he nails the moments that count. Brie Larson had not only shown potential but delivered the goods with 2013's Short Term 12. It's a similar environment here with devoted maternal instincts but this time it's pushed to the brink of her skills as an actress. She's drenched in this exasperation that speaks to years of exhaustion. In the tone of her primal performance, she paints a full rich portrait of Joy's whole life from her carefree teen years to her brutal capture by Old Nick when she was 17, to every little story and lesson she's told Jack. Joy's constantly revising the way she raises Jack and while there's bumps in the road, it's a complete picture of motherhood. She balances resilience and vulnerability, hope and dejection with a fine tooth comb. Most times she commands the screen and offers one of the year's best performances. It's a film about the harsh realities of growing up, operating for both of the main characters, and it's a very sensitive and emotionally potent portrayal. Joan Allen, as Joy's mother, is heartfelt and shows unconditional love in a wonderfully nuanced way, whereas William H. Macy, Joy's father, is regretfully underused but doing the 'in over his head' thing Macy does best. From one domestic space to another, it's easy to wish it would spread its wings instead of remaining so confined. It's clear that recovery is difficult but there was a lot more ground Room could have covered. It loses a lot of steam after the escape, but at the very least it never loses my investment in the characters. It's not working on a defined timeline, or with hardly a goal in mind, so it leaves itself a little elusive. I was either ready to jump 10 years to see how they're doing or I accepted that it would simply end at a good enough point. Story problems aside, it's focusing on emotion, and while it may step into melodrama, it's always potent. It's hard to pinpoint Abrahamson's voice as a filmmaker exactly, and he might be a little overzealous with how he adapts his style so far, but he's certainly got the right edge.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well developed look at the story of a kidnapping victim.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack was a little boy who believed that the room he was born and raised in for 5 years was the world, and only he and his mother live there together. Than one day shortly after his 5th birthday, he has to come to grasp with the fact that "Room" is a very small part of the world.I thought they handled the situation perfectly, especially Brie Larson as Jack's Ma, Joy. Room was semi narrated by Jack, but this was his mother's story, of how she used Jack to keep her sanity while in the room, and she was still in that room even after she physically was let out.It was interesting watching the two in the room living there day to day life and how she explained the limited world they live in. It was suspenseful as Mamma Joy used Jack as part of her plan to break free and it was fascinating watching Joy readjusting to the world and Jack discovering it.I thought it was a well done picture with some great acting going on that revolves around Brie Larson but gives even small parts like the one William H. Macy had, as a dad who can't deal with what his daughter went though, the kind of subtle development that gets under your skin. It walks slowly buy says a lot, and I really like that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Normal is not so easy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Tragically, stories of women being held captive have become all too common in this sometimes frightening world in which we live. Emma Donoghue had the high profile, real life situations of Jaycee Dugard, Elisabeth Fritzl and Amanda Berry (Ariel Castro) to draw from for her terrific novel upon which this film is based. While not easy for anyone (especially parents) to watch, it's a well made movie with outstanding performances ? including a career-changer from Brie Larson.Director Lenny Abrahamson (Frank, a critical favorite from last year) takes us inside the world ? or more accurately ? the walls where Ma (Brie Larson) and her just turning 5 year old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) live. Seven years ago, Larson's character was abducted while walking home from school, and since then she has given birth to Jack, and the two have been held captive in a small shed with only a skylight connecting to the outer spaces of life. The captor ? known as Old Nick (Sean Bridgers) ? periodically brings them supplies, while also regularly visiting to satisfy his more base needs with Ma.For the first half of the film, we as viewers are held prisoners right along with Ma and Jack. We see what a patient and wonderful mother she is as she strives to provide some semblance of hope for her son, though in a nearly hopeless situation. When Jack turns 5, Ma begins to explain the outside world to him, as she knows they must try to escape in order for her son to have any semblance of a normal life. During this time, we are in awe of this 10 x 10 environment and how it is every bit the nightmare we have imagined while reading the articles and seeing the reports on real life ordeals.The second half of the film is equally fascinating, as we watch young Jack and his sense of wonder and caution at discovering the real world. We also see the psychological trauma that Ma experiences after staying strong for so long. Assimilating into society brings different challenges for both Ma and Jack, plus those of her mother (Joan Allen), her father (William H Macy) and her mom's new beau (Tom McCamus). The film doesn't shy away from their reactions, though some are easier to stomach than others.Providing any more details would soften the impact of the film, and this is one that is meant to be felt ? even if it's a true kick in the gut. The film is well cast and well acted, and young Jacob Tremblay captures our hearts quickly and joins the short list of child actors who go far beyond "cute" and into profound. Brie Larson exploded onto the acting scene in Short Term 12, one of my favorite movies of 2013; but it's here where she steps into the elite level of actresses. She brings a tenacity and emotional strength that leaves us never doubting whether she has "her strong".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unintentionally insulting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the movie that happens every year that isn't good, but wins critical acclaim by being distinct and including a child actor. It's disturbing, but without the tact required by the writing.Now to spoil things. A woman is held hostage as a sex slave for seven years and at some point has a baby boy, who she convinces the "Room" is the entire world. During this they play uplifting music and it is absolutely tonally daft. Once they escape Room they are better off. Then, "Ma" feels bad about how horribly she treated her son and thus tries to kill herself, to make it all better.Also, the boy in this movie looks and sounds exactly like a girl and has long hair. So I'm expecting maybe "Ma" lied that it was a boy, so her kid wouldn't be a rape target. Nope. Toward the end you realize it's a boy, and you go, "Whoa, why was I distracted by that for absolutely no reason?"Then, they revisit Room. And Ma feels better. Because going to where you were repeated raped for seven years makes you happy. Absurd, ridiculous, fantastical film that is unintentionally insulting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Did Abrahamson Do It?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is remarkable about this movie is that the audience members didn't fall asleep for the first half of the movie and that's a great thing. Unlike The Diary of Ann Franke (1959), the underlying and ominous tone of Room doesn't have the constant and imminent death threat from Nazi occupation that helps to sustain the visceral tension that Ann Frank was subjected to. Instead the director was confronted with the challenge of somehow making the mundane and likely boring life in a small room something of modicum of interest. In a way, the audience experiences the same efforts of the mother to keep her child preoccupied as much as possible with the few resources possible. Overall this movie has a deliciously balanced and sustained plot development often times left out of the confined and happily released plot outlines of most mystery thrillers.The performances are superb and so consistent with the storyline, there isn't any pretense that any of this was stage or acted. The relationships are well developed within the timeframe of the movie and are delightfully varied to reveal the breadth of human responses to such a tragedy. The presentation mostly from the child's perspective made the directorship's job tremendously more difficult but at the same time more captivating and absorbing for the audience. Instead of the usual death lurking around every corner horror genre or the sensationalism of publicity drama, the movie narrowly and richly captures the amazing and arduous behavior of the mother's attempts at some form of normalcy and the doubts surrounding her own competence in having done so.Like The Miracle Worker (1962), the depiction of a world beyond our own universe, our senses, Room offers up a new way of examining our own environment. Unlike Helen Keller, though the child in Room wasn't limited by his senses, but by his limited surroundings. Nevertheless, the audience is exposed to a refreshing and innovative way to re-examine our own limited senses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Room" (2015 release; 117 min.) brings the story of a young lady named Joy, and her son Jack. As the movie opens, Jack wakes up and can't wait to tell Ma that it's his 5th birthday. He goes around the room, exclaiming with joy "good morning rag, good morning TV, good morning sink!". It becomes clear very quickly that, despite Jack's innocence and joy, they are actually held captive and Jack has never known anything other than "Room", as they call this place. Joy is trying to figure out a way to deceive the man who is holding them captive, so as to escape. TO tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this is directed by Lenny Abrahamson, who just last year brought us the delightfully quirky "Frank", and Emma Donoghue, who wrote the book on which this is based, wrote the script. I have not read the book, so I do not know how closely the movie sticks to the book (I'm guessing quite closely, though). Second, as the movie's trailer makes plain, Joy and Jack do end up getting out of "Room", and as a result this movie really consists of two separate parts: before and after, and each takes about half of the movie's running time. The "before" part is nothing short of extraordinary, as we observe Joy and Jack living in their cramped quarters (which look quite big to Jack). Third, everyone's been talking about the Best Actress Oscar chances for Brie Larson in her role of Joy/Ma, so imagine my surprise when it turns out that yes, she is quite good, but the young boy playing Jack simply steals the movie, period. Jacob Tremblay brings one of the more astonishing and accomplished performances of such a young actor or actress in recent memory. Joan Allen (as Joy's mom) is quite powerful too, but also keep an eye out for William H. Macy's short (less than 19 min.) but impactful role as Joy's dad."Room" opened this past weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I finally had an opportunity to see it. The week night screening where I saw this at was attended surprisingly well for a week night, which is great news. I imagine that "Room" will pick up quite a few nominations in the upcoming awards season, and deservedly so. "Room" is an outstanding movie on so many levels, and I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. "Room" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</fullReview>

It's a raw look at a life of a mother and child from the start to the finish. It's film making at its best, filled with love, devotion, hurt, and determination to survive. The theater was silent during the entire time, as the film develops into a series of events that it forms over 5 years and beyond, of a life of mother and child in a room. This is a movie with no special affects or horrific scenes. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are just amazing in their roles as the two main actors in this film.

		<shortDescription>Room Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Held captive for years in an enclosed space, Joy Newsome (Brie Larson) and her 5-year-old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) finally gain their freedom from a man known only as Old Nick (Sean Bridgers), allowing the boy to experience the outside world for the first time alongside Joy's mother and father (Joan Allen, William H. Macy) and her mother's friend Doug (Matt Gordon).So this is a big one. I was interested in this ever since I saw a trailer a few months ago. I thought it looked good enough but I never thought it was going to be this good. So the film, based on the novel of the same name, is about a mother and son, Joy and Jack, forced to live in what amounts to a single room. This room consists of a bedroom, a bathroom, a kitchen, and a living room. Joy has been living in it for over seven years and the room, or "Room" as Jack calls it is all he has ever known since he is yet to experience the outside world. Room is what is normal to him and how he sees the world has been influenced by it. The world to him is only what is inside of the room and nothing more. Once he and Joy finally escape the room, they (mostly Jack) must readjust to their new lives outside the room. Jack must reshape his view of the world and also must relearn what is real and what isn't. The story may not seem as much but it really is a story of fear, hopelessness and hope and most importantly a film about redemption and family bond. The film definitely pulls you through the range of emotions: sadness, happiness, anger, nervousness, etc (I will admit to almost crying at a few moments). I will not give anything away here in order to not spoil these moments. The story which was told mostly from Jack's perspective, follows Jack's evolution and his changing view of the world. He uses his five-year-old imagination to make the best of out where he is and what he knows. There were plenty of moments in the film where Jack goes on some "imagination tangents" where he would come up with his own stories and they were infectious. You can tell that these were happening from the child-like music and the change in the camera. Besides all of that, the film is about the relationship between Joy and Jack and later with them and Joy's (nameless) mother. What sold me with all of this was the amazing acting from Larson and Tremblay (and to a lesser extent Allen). I thought they had great chemistry with one another and it showed (mostly in the beginning when it was just them in a room). The cinematography here was amazing here as it helped bring to life Jack's imagination which mostly served to advance the plot. What also helps by telling the story from the kid's perspective, it lightens up the rather dark subject matter in the film (and it is very dark). I was not a big fan of the ending but I can't give it the benefit of the doubt by not having read the film's source material. Overall, this is a great film driven by a great story and great acting and should not be missed as it surely likely to earn some awards.Score: 9/10 keithlovesmovies.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotional and rewarding, Room is a beautiful coming of age thriller that is one of 2015 bests</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today's movie shares a big trait with True Grit that was debated when the awards season came out; with who the main character was. True Grit's marketing pushed that Jeff Bridges was the main actor of the movie even though the story really shows that Haliee Steinfeld was the focus. Once the awards season came, she was given plenty of supporting actress accolades even though most people felt that she was more in the reigns of best actress. Room will probably have this same issue with one of it's actors.I think the reason the studios tend to put great child performers into separate categories away from the big A-listers that are nominated for other movies because their afraid that they either won't have a chance at winning or if they do win, no one would take the award seriously. Children need to be taken seriously.Today's movie Room may be a mother/son bonding story, but it's really about the psychology that goes through their minds when after years of being together, are going on a journey that separates them physically and emotionally. It's about two people growing up despite being different generations as Room portrays. Joy Newsome (played by Brie Larson) is a young woman that has been living in a shed converted into a small home for the past seven years by her kidnapper she calls "Old Nick" (played by Sean Bridgers). In the time since, she gave birth to a child (fathered by Old Nick) that she named Jack. In the years growing up there, Joy tried as hard as she could to be a good mother and protect Jack from the situation and raise him like any other child. Now turning five, Jack (played by Jacob Tremblay) only sees the Room they live in as the world and that anything outside is "outer space".Joy finds out that "Old Nick" has lost his job and is low on money, which will mean fewer resources for food and heat. It is now that she tells Jack about the outside world (the only thing they had for information or entertainment was television that was mostly tuned onto Dora the Explorer for Jack) and that they need to get out. She knows that the only way out is if "Old Nick" realizes that Jack has to get out due to illness. The first half of the movie is planning on the escape and the second half is about what happens after wood.I can barley say anything about Room as most of the movie contains major spoilers. All I can say is that even though this is a thriller, I count this as a coming of age story. A really good one as well considering that we have both a young woman and a little boy who know little about the world around them. Brie Larson does phenomenal as Joy who has the hard task of both remaining forever frightened of "Old Nick" and being a proper mother.Speaking of which, Jacob Tremblay may be the frontrunner for most supporting actor awards as his performance is better then a lot of child actors. How they got a kid this young to pull off the necessary emotions that few adult can properly show off? I don't know, but this is defiantly his movie. Is perception on the world and the adults around him remind us why we were frightened by the rest of the world as children. When our parents aren't around, we might as well be on an alien planet, stepping around strange sounds and sights. This child made me realize how one can see the world differently at a different age.I'll give this ten imaginary dogs out of ten. Room is an emotional, but rewarding coming of age story that may be hard to sit through the first half. But once the second half starts, you'll realize how strong bonds are between parents and children. You'll realize that in order to move one, part of your old self has to go away. Room is one of the 2015's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An experience like none other</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Room is wonderful. It made me laugh, cry, and put on my thinking cap, all while earning it's rightful place in the thriller genre. There were moments of sheer suspense akin to Hitchcock's most nail-biting sequences. Room is as much a study of the oppressed human psyche as it is a breathtaking observation of a five year-old discovering a world beyond captivity. The director here is at the top of his game. Though he crafts such heart stopping sequences of suspense, his true genius lies in his ability to take simple shots of what we're so used to seeing everyday: trees, clouds, cityscapes, etc., and turn them into borderline-hypnotic images of strange, exciting, new things. It is truly an experience like none other. At the heart of this movie is the story of a relationship between a mother and son. The two main characters are so intriguing and, right from the start, you feel as if you're taking this journey with them into the outside world. Room is a masterwork. All the elements needed to make a fantastic film have fallen into place here. Please, go see this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It could have been the most harrowing 90-minute movie ever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On his fifth birthday, optimistic little Jack (Jacob Tremblay) goes through the routines of eating breakfast, brushing his teeth, and exercising. And as a special treat, his mother, whom he calls simply Ma (Brie Larson), helps him bake a birthday cake ? though there are no candles available. These seemingly normal activities all take place in the confines of a small room, filled with little more than a bed, a sink, a tub, a wardrobe, a toilet, and a stove.Most nights, a man called "Old Nick" (Sean Bridgers) visits the room to have sex with Ma. But Jack doesn't understand this custom, instead letting his imagination dream up a world of wonderment, all existing neatly in the boundaries of the room ? where a mouse joyfully nibbles on some scraps and where his imaginary dog Lucky can frolic. In Jack's mind, the only reality is inside the room, and everything on the other side of the wall is most certainly outer space. After one particularly traumatizing night, when Jack wanders out of his hiding spot to observe the sleeping adults and is frightened by both Nick and an instance of physical violence against Ma, the fatigued woman realizes that she must coach the young boy into aiding with an escape plan to finally rid them of the restrictive imprisonment of the room.At first, "Room" is something of a mystery, harboring dark revelations that might not be entirely evident from the basic setup. To protect her son, Ma creates a series of lies about the outside world ? but in a moment of desperation and the realization of future obstacles, she begins to reveal some staggering truths. Though details are steadily disclosed, a good portion of the film is shown through the perspective of the child, who imparts an obvious innocence and an ignorance that complicate the strangeness of their durance. While soundproofing foam, the existence of a single window (a skylight), and a keypad on the door are telltale signs of chilling immurement, there's a certain sad unawareness from the youth's viewpoint that makes the situation both scarier and ambiguous.Like "Life is Beautiful," "The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," "Pan's Labyrinth," or "Tideland," which all use adolescent imagination to counter the effects of an unthinkably repugnant reality, "Room" sets about attempting to lessen the horrors through diverting make-believe asides. But it never gets far enough, instead switching over to an incredibly suspenseful escape (involving a plan that the boy is ultimately just too young to competently assist with) and an equally harrowing rescue. Anxiety builds quite cinematically as so many things could go wrong ? or worse, result in further elements of permanent unknowing. But rather than embracing this nerve-wracking segment of their lives, "Room" takes a stab at more encompassing closure, resulting in a slightly slowed pace and a few notes at a message film (which threatens to negate much of the impact, as if this were merely an elongated "Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit" episode).What could have been an utterly thrilling 90-minute exercise in purposeful introductions and terrifying solutions soon morphs into a more bloated story of rehabilitation, reintegration, and coping with blame and guilt. The focus on the aftermath starts to dilute the potency of the initial premise and its hair-raising unraveling. Fortunately, "Room" utilizes two exceptional actors who, practically by themselves, build a two-hour character study that tackles the full spectrum of tormenting captivity and agonizing recovery in a highly emotional, thought-provoking drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Originally Posted of Derpy Reviews (www.derpyreviews.blogspot.com), a Young Adult movie and book review blog. That posts weekly reviews, interviews and giveaways.Room Directed by: Lenny Abrahamson Starring: Brie Larson, Jacob Tremblay, Sean Bridgers Based on the novel by: Emma Donoghue Production Company: Element Pictures Run Time: 118 minuets Rated: R (For language)Winner of 6 awards including, Peoples Choice Award (Toronto International Film Festival) 3 Audience Awards (Aspen Film Festival, Mill Valley Film Festival and Hampton International Film Festival), Truly Moving Picture Award (Heartland Film), and Most Popular Canadian Film (Vancouver International Film Festival).Jack has only ever know Room, a small ten by ten space where him and Ma live, but its a whole universe to Jack one that Ma has created for him to live in with-out fear. Jack is an enthusiastic, smart little five year old, and soon his questioning begins to unravel the nurturing world that Ma has created for them. Soon they take a risky plan to escape and it pays off, but not all is cheerful outside the confines of their old shack. Jack must be incredibly strong for not only himself but for Ma and his other family as well.Room, was incredibly hard to watch at some points, especially because the horrors that happen in this movie, have happened. But at other points it was funny, lighthearted and heartwarming. The acting was great, I have heard a couple murmurs about Brie Larson possibly being nominated for an Academy Award - I wouldn't be surprised. This movie will keep you thinking about people and stories like this, for example the Amanda Berry case. But all-in-all I would recommend this movie but its not at all a "happy feel good" movie.I would recommend this book to...-Readers of Room by Emma Donoghue -People who like dramas, not necessarily happy ones. -Fans of realistic movies -Anyone interested in stories like those of Amanda Berry'sBesides those 6 wins, Room was also nominated for Best Actress - Brie Larson (Gotham Award) and Best Film (London Film Festival).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ROOM is a disturbing look into the Canadian Psyche . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . that is far easier to take allegorically than in any literal sense of story-telling. As a linear tale, ROOM is deeply flawed, building to its primary climax just 58 minutes into the 118-minute feature film, and then tacking on a pretty boring final hour (that mostly emptied my American theater by the end of the showing). However, when astute viewers realize that the main characters and locales in ROOM are standing in for other things, the flick as a whole is much easier to take. Perhaps if it was more directly titled (CANADIAN CONFESSIONS, for instance) more people in the world film market might "get" it. This movie is suggesting that most if not all Canadians feel trapped in a cold, squalid room or shed--sort of a back bay to the Real World tantalizingly close (but a world away) just South of their border. The ironically named Mom here, "Joy," tries to convince son Jack that every wall has two sides, but Jack's not really buying it. Jack's kidnapper\rapist father, of course, is meant to represent Uncle Sam, that is, America. And Jack himself, certainly, stands in for the Canadian film industry, infamous for being comprised of a million counterfeit Americas--amazingly including ROOM itself (C'Mon, guys, don't tell us ROOM is in "America," and then show a politically-incorrect "Apache Burger" joint just down the block in Etobicoke, Toronto, Ontario, Canada!). When Joy, with Jack's help, escapes ROOM (for the wider world of America, allegorically speaking), she has so much regret over what she's missed during the prime of her life the past seven years she attempts suicide. Only Jack (that is, the fraudulent Canadian film industry, the country's main export now that the XL Pipeline won't be spewing nation-killing tar sands oil to the rest of the planet) is able to cheer up Joy (at least, while in some sort of confined ROOM, such as a theater or shed).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Short Shelf Life Following Awards Season</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Room' is the harrowing story of isolationism, and then, later on, immersion. We're first introduced to our two main characters, twenty-something Ma (actress Brie Larson) and four year-old Jack (up-and-coming Jacob Tremblay), inside a garden shed. We are, of course, unaware that this is a garden shed, but the size is what's immediately noticeable. Small, dark, and dank, with a single skylight. Jack, the product of Ma's kidnapping despite her insistence of his immaculate conception, is oblivious to the space of the room, or lack thereof, and equally of the world outside it. Ma, we're later told, has been living in the confines for seven years. It's seven too many, and when she decides quite suddenly that some attempt must be made to free one or both of them, plans are quickly set in motion at her behest and against Jack's wishes.I'm hesitant to mention their escape at all, but the always inexcusable trailer not only alludes to the escape but presents it as a first- act occurrence, mostly using the opportunity to list the other notable actors of the production. It's an unfortunate introduction to the story, as the audience does benefit from the time spent in the shed, however fully expecting the scenery to change in a moment. We come to understand their lifestyle: stretching in the morning, TV, eating canned slop, TV, running from one end of the shed to the other, TV. They have each other, and TV. It's been the source of Jack's entertainment, and no doubt his education, for much of his life. So when Ma tries to explain that TV holds some truth, that other people exist, and so too does a world outside of Room, it's hard for Jack, now 5, to grasp. "How does it all fit?!" he asks out of a serious incredulity (a single line delivered in a way that certifies Tremblay is one to watch).Nevertheless, he does grasp it, or he pretends to. He audibly bounces back and forth between acceptance and some acting form of denial, but his trust in Ma ultimately outweighs his fear of something larger, and then, halfway through the film, the outside is revealed to him. It's an abrupt and belated transition and his daring escape doesn't seem at all plausible but paints our everyday surroundings so empyrean that you more than forgive it. Triumph of the realization is replaced with a terror. Talking to the strange people he's only just recently come to see as real instead of "magic" is too much, too soon.A female officer warms to Jack, and his bravery leads to Ma's rescue. The two are reunited with the family he's never known, but a reluctance to engage with anyone besides his Ma is apparent. By this time, the film feels unbalanced. Its pacing is jarred, and the idea is that it's supposed to, but it feels less like a new, eye- opening experience and the slow understanding that comes with it, and more like a train wreck in slow motion. The second half offers little to the viewer. The meat of the story is left behind, and while it wasn't exactly Kobe beef, what we're left with is little more than the canned slop our duo had been subjected to in the beginning. Joan Allen does her best with what little she's given, William H. Macy isn't much more than a snapshot and a stepping stone to Ma's character development, Tom McCamus surprises, and Sean Bridgers eerie acting as the deluded kidnapper is oddly missed after his exit, which is without any real resolution.This proves to be a compelling story, and is at times emotionally gripping, but is ultimately ill-fated for a film adaptation. Best suited as prose, or as a journalistic publication on which the narrative is based, it falters in being brought to screen. Neither first-time feature screenwriter Emma Donoghue nor Lenny Abrahamson are at fault, as both do greatly with what is to be offered, and the casting, particularly the ever-impressive Larson, is inspired. Still, in leaving the theater, something is left to be desired."Room" will prove to be a nice addition to the rsum of any involved, but with little shelf life beyond the awards season.B-Andrew Paul, occuris.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bored to Hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes there are these special movies - high ratings, lots of ppl loving them and you just wonder - is this the same movie Iam watching ppl are talking about!? I was just well bored, almost bored to a brain-killing stupor. The young kid played his role not bad but if I compare him with the little girl from the movie Hidden (I know, I know, different genres but at least the location/space/set for acting is comparable)- he's just okay. The one thing I was the whole time wondering - why the woman didn't just kill the guy in his sleep. Well I heard about Stockholm-Syndrome, but the woman didn't behave imo like a person with that "kind of state" would, but Iam no specialist here. Well, so many ppl praising and liking that movie so tbh they can't be all wrong - so just try that movie and see what kind of movie Room is for you. Btw - one very weak point of the movie is for me that I didn't attach to the mother and his son at all - I watched that movie with no sympathy nor dislike for them. Well, I rated it 1 because of all the legions of 10s, my "real" vote is a 4 but no more.I re-watched the movie and I must say I even do like it less, if it's possible. I realised why I don't like this movie at all: Room tells us the typical Love-Conquers-It-All-Narration but if u have ever known/met a person or worked with a person who was sexually or otherwise traumatically assaulted you know that just love doesn't heal everything. Lots of ppl just never really leave behind the trauma, the trauma is a big part of their life. So this movie is kinda Disney-life and has not much to do with real life. Room is the typical sugar-coated version (and the book also if it has the same conclusion) of a Love-Conquers-It-All-script - it happens in real life yes, but this kind of story is told countless times before on screen and in real life rare. Many real good stories hurt reading, but Hollywood gives you 9 times out of 10 cotton-candy at the end. So does Room. Btw - the boy almost shows no sign of disturbance in his behavior whatsoever. If u see pictures (or meet them in real life) of e.g. war-traumatized kids you understand how dumb this is. If I compare this movie to The Lovely Bones with Saoirse Ronan, Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz u also see that the actors are just mediocre. And whereas The Lovely Bones is really heartbreaking and got suspense and is told poetically superb, Room has nothing of it to offer. Or watch Chained with Vincent D'Onofrio as a sick, emotionally dead serial killer. To watch D'Onofrio's superb play was shocking good. And the relationship between Rabbit (Eamon Farren) and his captor Bob (D'Onofrio) beats everything Room provides easy. Chained is shocking good. Room is shocking naive and boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a kind of film you should "want" to watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Room -A gross irresponsibility of the writer of this film, along with a supporting production crew, and cast. The story glamorizes the process of being held hostage, using a young women and her child. I am afraid why a story teller would choose such a topic, and why would he be so consumed as to make a message of this to the general population. Although it may seem cute at first seeing how a boy senses the room, and world around him; I am left with the taste that it only desensitizes others. This is not a story we should expose ourselves to like this, as a human race we might be tempted to play it down if it happens to others in real life, or make it seem to others it is not so bad to commit such an act to others.There is a responsibility here when you interact with the public. I realize art is based on trying to work through what happens to you or what you have experienced, the art part being you are trying to get others to feel and communicate with you and what you are experiencing. But if that be the case here, then a more appropriate form of art in the direction of it should have been a movie portraying the horror of being held captive, and better yet maybe even realize this is too hard a topic not just for the writer to articulate but also too hard for the general public to consume. I give this film a rating of zero, and suggest this film maker and crew take a different occupation to make money. I don't want to be a part of any of it anymore. And yes, there are many movies which could be labeled as I did with this one, but someone should write an honest review, a responsible review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It doesn't get any worse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It opens badly, but this is deceptive. If you watch carefully, are very, very patient, look at what's actually there, and give it three minutes-----it gets worse. But wait. This too is unfair. Are you actually seeing what's in front of your eyes? Are you sure? The film demands that you give it at least another ten minutes, and you do. And as soon as you do, it gets worse. After that it gets worse, and then worse, and worse, and worse. And it's only just begun. The setting hasn't even left the room. Then it does. Finally. Surprise! A goodly portion of the film, in fact, at least 30 percent, takes place outside the room. I have no idea why. To show that the outside world is just as claustrophobic? That would've been a good point, but the story doesn't allow it! The writer is adrift. The shift of scenery doesn't help. It makes Room even worse - and it gets worse yet, and even worse than that, despite the brief, welcome, charitable appearance of two superbly talented actors (William H. Macy and Joan Allen) who can actually act, whether they have a character to play or not. Acting, in fact, is not an issue in the movie. To be fair, the child star of the film, Jacob Tremblay (made deliberately genderless as only a 5-year-old could be) gives as execrable a performance as any adult ever has, and deserves a lot of credit for it. If the director intended it that way, he probably either has no children, or doesn't know or like any. It's not totally Tremblay's fault: he obviously found it impossible to believe in the story, as did the writer, director, actors and producers who concocted this infinitely boring, one-dimensional, unfelt drama. Here and there throughout the story, that sickly, treacly piano that has invaded the soundtrack of hundreds of anemic films like a skin rash makes an appearance. To top it off, Room is made with the highest of production values. They are the only values visible, and may lift the movie to the heights of Trumpian emptiness. Americans love nothing better in their movies: production values are the new family values. The overall impression is of a movie, clunkily directed by Lenny Abrahamson, written by someone (Emma Donoghue) whose entire experience of life must have been acquired in a room, probably a classroom, possibly a cloakroom, a writer unashamed to display her bad handwriting, and constitutionally unable or unwilling to share with the public how little she knows or cares about the world she inhabits. A lot has been written about the hell the cinematographers went through to make parts of this movie, jamming their equipment into a tiny cramped space for countless hours. It doesn't show, and what does is not interesting. If they'd shown us the hell, and not the Room they made of it, I'd have had a lot less to say but would've left with more than a craving for a quick burger on my mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Couldn't get past the first 40 min of depressing material. This is just too much for me. Why is the story of a captive and her child interesting? It is not. Shows the detailed life of a captive person. I am sure there is something uplifting at some point but I am just not interested. This is current, has happened, etc. I just don't need to watch the detail of it including the emotional pain etc. This is not a story that needs to be told it is a story that we need to prevent in the real world. It is not entertaining, just exceptionally depressing. The possibility of harm to the child by the captor is in no way exciting or interesting to me. I could also watch a day in the life of a prisoner who is raped in the cell but why? Is that somehow interesting? Not to me.</fullReview>

What are you trying to do? Does a boy really watch dora? Is it so difficult to cut his hair a little bit? All you want to do is showing us how a boy can become GAY ? Or you want him to be gay? It is really sad and the sadest thing is that people adore such movies , 8,6 for this movie? Is this movie better than schindler's list? Better than Titanic? And The pianist? And many others uplifting movies? You should open your eyes people, your ears and do not accept everything the garbage gives you.</fullReview>
