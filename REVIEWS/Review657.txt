		<shortDescription>Tugs at your heartstrings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You better take a box of Kleenex with you to the screening of #TheLightBetweenOceans because you're going to need it, trust me. Heartbreaking pretty much encapsulates the entirety of this film which from the start aims to drive its point home on an emotional level.Based on M.L. Stedman's best-selling novel, starring Michael Fassbender, Alicia Vikander, Rachel Weisz, Bryan Brown, and Jack Thompson, adapted and directed by Derek Cianfrance, THE LIGHT BETWEEN OCEANS is essentially about a lighthouse keeper and his wife living off the coast of Western Australia and they raise a baby they rescue from an adrift rowboat. But years later, the lighthouse keeper and his wife encounter the real mother of that baby. Should they go on with their lie and keep their child or do they tell the truth and risk losing her forever? I've never been a parent, so I don't know what it feels like, because I can only imagine that the fear or anxiety of the possibility of losing your child through any circumstance crosses the minds of every parent who wouldn't want such misfortune befalls them. In this case, it cuts even deeper because it's about miscarriage, to have that happen to a woman whose dream is to become a mother, it's the worst nightmare for her. In THE LIGHT BETWEEN OCEANS, I think Alicia Vikander plays that with such strong conviction and ferocity, so much so that even though you know her character is doing something wrong, a part of you wants her to get away with this act, because Vikander has made you feel sorrowful for what her character has gone through. It's a remarkable performance for a woman who won Oscar for last year's "The Danish Girl," you see THE LIGHT BETWEEN OCEANS and you'll immediately understand exactly why she deserves that statuette. And Michael Fassbender plays the lighthouse keeper husband with a conscience, the film does deal with fate, love, moral dilemmas, and how far you're willing to go to get your dreams realized after having previously seen them crushed a few times, what secrets would you keep to make those dreams realized and so Fassbender's moral compass keeps bugging him. Fassbender is so gentle and sturdy and calmed in this film.If you've seen director Derek Cianfrance's previous films, "Blue Valentine" and "The Place Beyond The Pines," you'd know that Cianfrance is not one to shy away from couples' confrontations, it's as if he wants his actors to really unleash their strongest resentment possible, so when conflict arises between Vikander's character and Fassbender's character or between Vikander and Rachel Weisz's character, it's so real and ugly that you wouldn't want to get in the middle of it otherwise they might come at you as well. The cinematography for this film is exquisite, such a beautifully designed, beautifully shot film, not to mention composer Alexandre Desplat's music, his emphasis on piano, that makes the emotional journey of these characters all the more deeply affecting. THE LIGHT BETWEEN OCEANS guarantees to tug at the heartstrings.-- Rama's Screen --</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Romantic Film that Will Pull Tears From Even the Most Reserved Viewer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you watch a romantic film, you expect it to achieve skilled levels of drama, acting, entertaining and relatable story to keep the viewer engaged, but still have a realistic romantic plot. The Light Between Oceans is a spectacular romance story that is truly perfect in many ways.The Light Between Oceans tells a dramatic story with many romantic elements. There are couple of jokes but it should not be considered a comedy in the slightest. The characters do embark on a large and emotional adventure throughout the story, so this film can also be considered an adventure. The story begins when Tom (Michael Fassbender), a WW1 veteran comes back to his home, Australia. After suffering in the War, he takes a job of a lighthouse keeper, living completely alone on a small island. However, he meets a girl named Isabel (Alicia Vikander) and they quickly fall in love. After getting married and moving to the island, they try to start a family but lose two babies prematurely. Everything changes when a baby mysteriously washes up on the shore and they must decide to keep her or report this phenomena to the authorities. The story is based on a book and the story itself is fantastic. In this film however, many scenes are unnecessary and cause it to feel stretched out. For example, there are flashback scenes about the baby's father, which would be nice in the book, but in a film are not necessary and drastically increase the run-time. There are also some scenes that seem to be there for no reason and could be cut out to make the film more enjoyable. Despite those issues, the acting is emotional and fits the characters. Michael Fassbender and Alica Vikander truly make you believe their characters, Tom and Isabel, are deeply in love. Another aspect is the film's heart-wrenching drama, which the entire cast brings to life. From sadness, to anger, to just plain awkwardness, they demonstrate their emotions wonderfully. On top of that, the cinematography is exquisite, especially of the lighthouse, the waves and the beach. It truly shows beautiful parts of Australia not widely known.My favorite scene is when the boat landfalls onto the island with the baby. Isabel is heavily traumatized from losing two babies, so seeing a live baby changes her mood quickly and, it is interesting to see how the characters react to the situation. I also like this scene because it displays the actors' outstanding performances and is also easily one of the most important scenes in the film. Although this film lacks any adult language, it still has a considerable amount of adult content so I recommend it to ages 13 to 18. Younger kids may be too young for the content and may not even understand the plot. I give this film 4 out of 5 stars due to its length but still, the acting and beautiful cinematography makes it all worth while. Reviewed by Gerry O., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Baby in a boat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. As the closing credits rolled, it seemed incredulous that Kleenex was neither a sponsor or even mentioned in the "special thanks". Surely a tissue company was behind such a straightforward cinematic sob-fest (calling this a tear-jerker doesn't do it justice).Director Derek Cianfrance is accustomed to wallowing in movie sadness. His 2010 gem Blue Valentine was an expose into a fractured and challenging relationship. This time he tackles the M.L, Stedman novel and slows the pace to an excruciatingly slow crawl.Michael Fassbender plays Tom, a tormented WWI veteran so intent on isolating himself from society and people that he accepts a job as the lighthouse keeper in some desolate area of Australia. The locals in the small town of Stanley in Tasmania welcome Tom and provide him a festive send-off. One of these locals is Isabel (Alicia Vikander) who, despite grieving for her brothers killed in the war, takes an instant liking to the handsome and mysterious Tom.Soon enough Tom and Isabel are married and living a blissful life on the isolated rock. Emotional turmoil and tragedies follow as Isabel suffers numerous miscarriages. It's then that the movie takes a wild turn. Rather than a message in a bottle, Tom and Isabel find a baby in a boat. Yep, unable to bear their own, the sea delivers a baby to their ocean front home.Tom can't help but notice that Isabel's depression instantly disappears as she cares for the baby, and in the blink of a misplaced eye, the three become a family. Of course, it wouldn't be much of a movie if the baby's birth mother wasn't discovered, so Rachel Weisz as Hannah brings her own tragic story and mourning to the façade of Tom and Isabel's make-believe happiness. What follows is a look at loyalty to spouse versus doing the right thing ? a dilemma that isn't as easy as it should be.The lighthouse and surrounding coastline are extremely photogenic, as is the town and, of course, Fassbender and Vikander (both deliver excellent performances). It's also nice to see Aussie screen veterans Jack Thompson (Breaker Morant, 1980) and Bryan Brown (Cocktail), even in small roles. It's a purposefully sad and gut-wrenching movie that evidently moves so slowly to ensure the viewers have sufficient time to utilize those Kleenex.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Only Get One Chance to Forgive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Derek Cianfrance, who directed the poignant Blue Valentine and the riveting The Place Beyond the Pines, brought probably the best out of Michael Fassbender and Rachel Weisz in quite some time, even if the film pulls at your heart strings a few too many times.Amidst the beautiful landscaping shots of sunsets, beaches, and oceanic views, Cianfrance crafts the story of a couple who desperately want a child but can't have one, extremely well. As much as this film deals with tragedy, grief, and sorrow there was something so beautiful about the way Cianfrance tells the story. It unfortunately becomes flooded with sadness and difficult circumstances, but I never stopped rooting for these characters. Even when they are at the brink of a bad decision, I wanted the best.That can be directly contributed to the terrific performances from the cast, and particularly Fassbender, Vikander, and Weisz. Fassbender brings so much power and gravitas to his roles, but I've never seen him so vulnerable. We saw a peak at the emotional weight he can bring to his characters in X-Men: Apocalypse last spring, but nothing can prepare you for his heartbreaking turn in this film.Vikander and Weisz are just as good. All 3 characters have bad qualities and choices that could turn them into unlikable human beings, but Weisz and Vikander add a graceful human touch to their roles. Though Vikander doesn't have children in real life, I believed she could be a mother someday with her turn. Weisz on the other-hand is a mother, and that motherly instinct exudes onto the screen. Both performances are so mind-bendingly good.One of the issues that's been brought up about this film is its over-reliance on pulling at your heart strings. It's a valid argument, especially considering all of the tragedy and horrible circumstances that occur. I can't really say it's a film I will revisit, but at the same time, I found Cianfrance's directing and the performances enough to get over the depressing nature of the film's plot. It's not an easy watch by any stretch of the imagination, but it's an important one for sure. +Oscar worthy performances from all 3 leads+Beautifully shot+Cianfrance's style-Manipulative at times7.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'The Light Between Oceans' has class but falters the message of love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film full of class, and one of the most aesthetically beautiful films to grace the screens this year, Derek Cianfrance's "The Light Between Oceans" manages some tender and enchanting moments. With that said, it stumbles and falters in certain executions of character motivation and generic story structure. Cianfrance has performed remarkably well in his other two efforts ("Blue Valentine" and "The Place Beyond the Pines") however, this is probably his weakest overall outing yet."The Light Between Oceans" tells the story of Tom and Isabel, who live on a remote island. Tom works as a lighthouse keeper, and is trying to come out of the horrors of World War I. As the couple begin to find happiness in their solitude, their inability to have children begins to plague their fairy tale. Isabel's hopes and prayers are believed to be answered when a dead man and an infant baby girl wash ashore. While Tom grapples with the reality of reporting the incident, or making the woman he loves happy, he ends up choosing the former, kicking into motion some heart wrenching consequences.The high marks are present and littered frequently throughout. It begins with the heartbreaking turn from Academy Award winner Rachel Weisz as the devastating Hannah, a grief-stricken mother whose arc goes into interesting territories. Michael Fassbender as the stoic and tortured Tom, has the actor showcasing another effortless and engaging presence that proves he's got plenty more to offer the realm of cinema.Co-star Alicia Vikander, recently just crowned for her riveting turn in Tom Hooper's "The Danish Girl" earlier this year, is as capable as ever in portraying a difficult and unlikable character. The problem is the script doesn't particularly offer her an opportunity for the audience to tap into the soul of Isabel. Her behavior at times is so despicable, it's hard to wrap your head around any her actions and why she chooses to do them. What's worse, it that we can't understand why her husband Tom would love someone like her. It feels even at times, unnatural. Everything from the inception of their love, to the finding of their baby, and the surrounding events that follow.Technically, the romantic drama is wholeheartedly intact. Composer Alexandre Desplat continues to deliver score after score, with strings and chords that tug at the heart. Desplat's choice of swells and subtlety are quite remarkable. They are choices that can once again, land him an Oscar nomination for Best Original Score.Cinematographer Adam Arkapaw ("Animal Kingdom" and "MacBeth") glosses the screen with invigorating colors and breathtaking imagery. When the word "class" is associated with any work of art, Arkapaw is the epitome of understanding in that regard. He frames a scene with respect and adoration, fixating on the not so obvious objects and movements of a scene. He allows us to travel graciously through the picture, enriching a methodical and lavish wonder of screen shots.With all these great high points provided, there's a very visible and apparent weakness in the script. Constructed by Cianfrance, and adapted from the novel of the same name, he attempts to build a vivacious love story. He gives us two people who he is saying to the audience are "meant for each other." Cianfrance ends up failing in establishing a believable and unique take on these two individuals from different walks of life. Tom, a veteran and tortured man of war is drawn to the passion and energy of the young Isabel. On paper, that can be sufficient but you must give the viewer motivation, action steps, and beats that prove the point you're trying to make. There's an elephant sized hole in the house that our director and writer tries to build.The writer/director truly fumbles in the final third of the film. He chases ideas that are leisurely shoehorned in the story. Cianfrance chases suspense, nostalgia, heartbreak, and resolution. All of these things seem like they're thrown together in a ten-minute scene reel. The filmmaker also manages to go down "J. Edgar" territory of bad makeup, aging characters that end up just becoming beautiful distractions of their former selves. There's even an abrupt ending that manages to raise eyebrows.Consequently, "The Light Between Oceans" doesn't totally fail. It's ambitious but unbalanced, desperately attempting to make a modern-day John Cassavettes. His fixation with love, and the dismal look at the reactions of people in a relationship is evident. Perhaps in the future, he'll put a much more focused effort on the sub-stories and actions that surround them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's a Great Movie in Here Somewhere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"They gave me a pile of books," said the director. "I looked through them and there was a book called 'The Light Between Oceans,' and I thought, 'That's a pretty cinematic title.' Cracked it open and started reading it, and it's about this light keeper, which is a very cinematic job."But how cinematic is this adaptation of the M.L. Stedman novel? Eh, good enough I guess. It's certainly not the ideal date movie, and may not even be the ideal "girls' night out" type of movie either. I guess it's as good as a "turn of the century" type story can be about a veteran widower who lives on a lighthouse island with a woman who lost both her brothers to the Great War.Let me tell you, it appears quite promising at first with its stunning views of the horizon and the clear eye the two good-looking leads have for each other. It may even look great on paper when you read that their main issue in marriage is the coincidental discovery of a baby abandoned along with a dead body in a boat. It may sound like great philosophical debate when their issue becomes whether to raise the baby themselves or find the baby's rightful owner. But instead, The Light Between Oceans gives an unemotional delivery that is unfit for the big screen for any reason besides drawing in readers of the novel.The film features only two actors for the majority of the time, two highly-acclaimed newcomers Michael Fassender (12 Years a Slave, Steve Jobs) and Alicia Vikander (The Danish Girl, Ex Machina). If I were the director, I probably would have cast someone else; but I don't know who, as the characters were not defined richly enough to make me care. I'm not saying their performances were bad at all, they did as much as script and direction allowed. The problem was their chemistry, and the amount of time taken to show their love for each other, which is both too much and too little.Right after the couple's first meeting, they exchange long-distance letters that eventually lead to their marriage and residence at their lighthouse home. A drawn-out amount of time is spent on their giggling, kissing, beard trimming, and time under the bedsheets, but none on making us actually care or notice the quality of their performances.I think what hurts the two leads the most is the way the camera envelops their story together on and off the lighthouse island. There are many stunning views of the oceanside, especially at the magic hour. It captures the quiet aloneness of the island against the frightening sounds of the roaring ocean waves, so what went wrong? Anytime the camera was not on a landscape view.When there are actors on screen, pleasing lighting arrangements are instantly ruined by atrocious aperture settings that spin out of focus and wobble all over, giving you the experience of seasickness without the need to go for an ocean venture. As a photographer with six years of experience, I could tell that there was some masterful camera- work wanting to get out, but it's too overly manipulative with its motion sickness as well as its blaring window backlights and distractingly questionable edit patterns.I am not a fan of these types of British Oscar-bait movies that try way too hard to be dramatic. I'm not all in for slow-paced movies that linger on all the wrong moments, challenging me to stay awake through the third act. But if this type of movie doesn't bother you, then it is probably harmless enough. There's certainly a fantastic story and movie if you're willing to dig deep enough, but The Light Between Oceans is still an easily forgettable study of who-knows-what that not even an Alexandre Desplat score can make more engaging.As an added word of caution, you'll need some extra patience as it comes to the end. It abuses the "multiple- endings" more than The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't want to write a summary, I'm a critic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just came back from the premier, and now my friends are rushing me to go out for drinks, so lets make this brief. This is no ordinary movie and it is all thanks to Michael Fassbender unique performance. I might not be able to find the perfect words to describe this chef d'oeuvre but I am confident that it is worth a try. Although at first impression the movie might seem a bit slow paced, it is essential to take a closer look at the depth of the character's progression. As the movie unfolds its first scenes, we can't discern what causes the strange tingling feeling but we can feel emptied by Fassbender's numbness. The camera angles picked by the director depicted the lack of emotional sensations experienced after the war. There is no doubt that Fassbender is the perfect candidate to be the keeper of the lighthouse. But everything starts to shift as Isabel is introduced. As first sight, we feel the ice surrounding our extremities begin to melt. What is truly amazing about this movie is the way that Fassbender was able to warm on the outside as Isabel entered his life but he remained the rigid moral and reflected person that the war forged into him (this stuck to him because we can really feel the guilty as he realizes that the biological mother of Lucy is right in front of his eyes). He was ready to go to jail and take all the blame for not declaring the boat as that was his duty. (...) I came to the realization that the island is just a metaphor to describe the way that Fassbender evolved throughout the movie; the movie begins with a sunrise and ends with a sunset, meaning that these two phenomenons can only be observed on the opposite sides of the island. Just the way that Fassbender went though a whole cycle. (...)Isabel acting when the baby was taking from her by the sergeant, actually the whole scene lacked some fundamental elements. Her baby is taken away from her. She had two miscarriage. This baby means everything to her. I have so much more to say but my friends are leaving without me, and I want to have a social life. Thank you for your time. M-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very powerful dramatic script with some good romance elements but most of the characters failed to make us believe the emotion.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Derek Cianfrance is a very talented director for drama and romance movies. his directed "The Place Beyond the Pines" and "Blue Valentine" are good romantic drama movie. I love the way he gradually developed a story with character development and like the story telling style. His movie has a common basis. First, introduce all the characters then play the story line with compact plots and subplots. But in this movie the subplot build up and the character development somewhat missing. This movie is based on the novel of M.L. Stedman. the novel is very good and the moral dilemma is the main catchy point of this novel. If I talking about the novel, this is a very good story for a movie. An emotional story with a very supportive background of world war 1 and the suffering from the inner ego of Tom Sherbourne made this novel a classic. For a classic novel with a very strong storyline, you have to maintain the believable emotion and the pace of the movie. The director failed to create the proper emotions between the characters and after the second half he totally failed to maintain the pace. the script is very strong and the story has numeral subplots, that's why you have to develop the character map very ideally. The casting is very good but the chemistry and overloaded slow paced subplot hamper the build up of the character's development.Performance wise Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander has done well for their role but Rachel Weisz has done an outstanding job for the role of Hannah Roennfeldt. Only her emotions and dialogue delivery connect you with the story and really she is the heart of this story. The direction is not up to mark and the editing is also like sometimes lazy. I think the director missed the opportunity to create another history like "The Reader" or his own "Blue valentine."</fullReview>
