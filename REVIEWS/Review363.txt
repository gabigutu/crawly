		<shortDescription>Very Cute with lots of belly laughs and better than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 last night at a screening last night and was apprehensive about going but so glad I went! It was a great silly date/family movie that I really think out-did the original and was a great reminder that sequels can revive the energy and feeling of the first film without relying on the same jokes, and storyline. It had plenty of great call-backs to the original and any fan of that film or anyone with, or who knows, a loud big family will be smiling ear to ear and can plan on laughing away. The film was more or less what you would expect with almost all of the original characters making reprisals and the time didn't degenerate their characters or the absurdity of their actions but like a fine wine they matured with time. I laughed out loud many times and the theater actually erupted in applause when it ended, which is very rare with silly comedies like this, and my only disappointment was that it finished almost too soon. I wanted to spend more time with the characters, but it didn't drag on, wasn't unnecessarily absurd and kept the tone and fun that the original film had. If you are looking for a feel-good film and a nice escape from our hectic wild world this movie will definitely please.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the best sequel you could've made twelve years later, and if that's good enough for you, it's good enough for a rainy day at the movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2" is probably the best sequel that could've been spawned from a largely forgotten but monstrously successful independent romantic comedy from twelve years ago. One could theoretically call it a "too little too late" sequel, something Hollywood has been good at churning out recently with sequels to "Barbershop," "Joe Dirt," and "Zoolander," but when a sequel is so similar in line with its predecessor after so many years and practically oozes the same kind of sentiment, one has to be a bit forgiving and credit it for what most sequels fail to capture.Both sequels to "Joe Dirt" and "Zoolander" were flawed from the very concepts, and when it came time to try that concept again, over a decade later, it felt stale and desperately forced when it came to trying to modernize it for the times and the now-grown up audience. While "My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2" has obligatory scenes of poor Toula (Nia Vardalos) trying to teach her loving father Gus (Michael Constantine) how to work a computer, it nonetheless manages to effectively work as charming comedy of moments, even if its structure and narrative theme is about as basic as it can get.The film reenters the lives of the characters we fondly recall from the first film, only now, well into their married lives and elder years. Toula and Ian (John Corbett) are having the typical kinds of struggles most semi-long/long-term married couples have emotionally and romantically, especially with their teenage daughter Paris (Elena Kampouris) in the midst of deciding where to go to college. While she wants to go off to New York University, her parents want her to stay in Chicago and go to Northwestern University, but Paris has been constantly smothered by her borderline insufferable Greek family to the point where she wants none of it.Meanwhile, Toula's parents Gus and Maria (Lainie Kazan) are getting well into their old age, especially Gus, who has had hip and memory problems for a while now. All is going well between him and his wife until Gus uncovers a much-repressed family secret that the priest never signed the certificate of marriage to make Gus and Maria an official union, meaning Gus and Maria aren't legally married, despite fifty years of togetherness. How this was never uncovered before, as if the two never had to file taxes or partake in any other legal activities, I'm not sure, but long story short, they're not married. Rather than doing the logical thing and just going down to the courthouse to make the marriage official, of course the family must complicate it, starting with Maria wanting not only a real proposal from Gus, but a full-blown, bank-breaking wedding. So we're back to square one, this time planning a wedding for the older couple, rather than the younger one.The scene-stealer this time around, however, isn't so much Vardalos playing a role she can practically sleepwalk, but Aunt Voula, played by the lovely Andrea Martin. Not a hugely significant presence in the first film, it would appear that Vardalos decided to give some of the best quips and zingers to her character's aunt, whose loud presence and boisterous, if invasive, mannerisms often result in some strong belly-laughs. Also giving his all in a performance that he can probably perform at any given time of the day is Michael Constantine; despite his character, the actor can't hide his energy and Jack Lemmon-esque grouchiness when it comes time to really commit to being an enthusiastic presence. He winds up being the most commendable presence here.The rest of the film is damn-near what you can imagine if you close your eyes and picture potential setups and events for the Portokalos family. Paris is a fascinating character, but unfortunately underwhelming because, fitting for her character and her situation, she keeps getting nudged out of the frame by her louder counterparts. It would've been nice to see a setup solely involving Paris and her decision of grappling with her parents, her heritage, and her decision of where to go to school. Instead, we get a pretty lukewarm plot involving her making impromptu prom plans with another boy (The Naked Brothers Band's Alex Wolff) after he is rejected by the prettiest girl in school. That's about as cliché as Greeks kissing each side of another person's face when they first see one another.However, "My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2" has some remarkably funny moments. A scene involving Gus stuck in a bathtub isn't played for the kind of bawdy and slapstick gimmicks you'd expect and a scene between all the female Portokalos members at a beauty salon is the epitome of what I wanted from this film all along: good conversation amongst people you can believe are family. Because of their general talent and the fact that they've done this before, the cast's chemistry is fun and the events of the film are lively and concise enough to assure it's never boring and always moving. It's the best sequel you probably could've made twelve years later, and if that's good enough for you, it's certainly good enough for a rainy day at the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2" is everything a sequel should be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>sequel (noun) ? "a literary work, movie, etc., that is complete in itself but continues the narrative of a preceding work." That's the definition on dictionary.com. Miriam-Webster.com says that the word's origin is? "Middle English, from Anglo-French sequele, from Latin sequela, from sequi to follow." Unfortunately for Gus Portokalos, the root of the word "sequel" cannot be traced to any Greek word, but it also in no way means "completely original". Actually, it kinda means the opposite. I generally avoid reading other reviews before I write mine, but when I saw the low scores that critics on various websites gave to "My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2" (PG-13, 1:34), I had to at least take a peek at some of their comments.Most criticisms of this movie can be summed up in one word ? "unoriginal" ? but is that fair? It's a sequel, people! Think of it like this: If you went to spend time with a friend whom you haven't seen in 14 years, would you be happy if your friend acted completely differently than the last time you were together? What if that friend refused to talk about the history you two shared, instead insisting on discussing all new topics, expecting you to enjoy that conversation as much as you'd enjoy a little reminiscing? Well, this film doesn't make those mistakes ? and is to be commended for it! For those of us who loved the 2002 original, seeing this movie is a lot like visiting an old friend ? and it's a visit filled with the perfect combination of fond memories and new experiences that are both fun and sweet.Correction: Seeing "My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2" is like visiting a LOT of old friends. First up is our host, actress and comedienne Nia Vardalos. She wrote the screenplay for the original, which became the highest-grossing romantic comedy of all time (!) and earned Vardalos an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Naturally, Hollywood types and ordinary fans alike have been asking her about a sequel ever since, but she cared enough about quality and her own integrity that she says she didn't write the sequel until she had a story that she felt was good enough, and she was ready to write it well enough to be worthy of the original. And when Vardalos wrote her new story, she brought back all the main characters from the first film ? and many of the minor ones ? and all played by the original actors! Our calendars tell us that the sequel came 14 years after the original, but that's 18 years to a Greek (or, at least, to these Greeks). Toula (Vardalos) still lives next door to her parents, Gus (Michael Constantine) and Maria (Lainie Kazan) and she's still married to Ian Miller (John Corbett), with whom she is raising their daughter, Paris (Elena Kampouris). Paris is a 17-year-old high school senior who, like her mother before her, works part-time at the family-owned Greek restaurant, feels smothered by her loud, proud, loving but meddling Greek family, and wants that proverbial "something more" out of her life. Paris' plan is to go to college ? as far away from her Chicago home as the continental U.S. can carry her. Toula is struggling to deal with her only child leaving ? and with keeping the passion in her and Ian's busy lives.And then there's the rest of the family. Just to cite a few examples: Ian's best friend, Mike (Vardalos' real-life husband Ian Gomez), has gotten married and become a police officer. Toula's cousin, Angelo (Joey Fatone) is the last unmarried member of his generation in the family and he's catching some flak for it. Toula's Grandma Yiayia (Bess Meisler ? who is believed to be in her 90s), who is, of course, also Paris' great-grandmother, is not only alive and kicking, but even funnier and more developed as a character than in the first film. I won't spoil the movie's big surprises by telling you about the changes in all of the characters' lives, but I will say that almost all of their stories are updated ? and in ways that are alternately fun, surprising and always logical and right for the individual characters. There are also a few new characters, played by familiar faces such as Rob Riggle, John Stamos and Rita Wilson (the producer who brought the idea of the original film to the production company of her husband, Tom Hanks).But what about the "big fat Greek wedding" (#2) from the movie's title? Well, the "my" no longer refers to Toula, but to her mother! Gus discovers that his and Maria's wedding license was not signed by a licensed priest, meaning that they were never legally married. Maria sees this news as an opportunity to make Gus woo her more romantically than he did the first time and show her how much he really cares. Obviously (given the movie's title), the old man eventually gets with the program and Maria begins planning a big fat? you know ? but when the planning hits a major snag, it starts to look like there will be no Greek wedding after all. This sets the stage for a grand finale which brings together all the film's story lines in ways that are more fun and heartfelt and less predictable than some critics say."My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2" is everything a sequel should be. The script, directing and strong ensemble acting all remain true to the original characters. Great running gags from the first film continue (although some are overplayed), but also work well standing alone, while many of the new jokes and sight gags are laugh-out-loud funny. Although there's a minor Gus-centered sub-plot that I could've done without, the multiple story lines are fresh and woven together wonderfully. This film isn't perfect, but it's nearly as hilarious and has even more heart than its much-beloved inspiration. "A"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My son and I just came home after seeing "My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2." We loved the first movie and laughed but when seeing the sequel, I must warn you, I laughed until I cried and had sore stomach muscles. There were more hilarious scenes this time around than the first time and a multitude of new ones. If I could have given "My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2" a rating of 11 or 12, I would not hesitate. All of the original cast of characters from "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" are in this movie. These characters are the ones whom we fell in love with. Getting to know everyone's quirks and idiosyncrasies in more detail was beyond enjoyable, amusing and refreshing. There are some awesome underlying messages creatively blended with humor that effectively relay messages we all should take heed and learn from. What warmed my heart and tickled my funny bone also made me feel loved and accepted as a member of the Portokalos family, despite what my DNA may show otherwise. On the way to the movie theater, I decided to keep an open mind. I ignored the negative and hateful reviews of "My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2" to form my own opinions. I cannot begin to express how ecstatic I am that we saw this movie. So, my advice to is overlook the spiteful, pessimistic reviews and opinions you read and hear about this movie. Then take a break, bring some face tissues, go to the theater and see "My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First let me say that I loved the 1st movie. I watch it often (maybe too often. lol) Anyway, I was looking forward to this sequel. I haven't been this excited about a movie since the Harry Potter series. I rushed my husband so we could get to the movies 30 minutes prior to showtime. I expected a crowd, but when we arrived it was quiet. Evidently not everyone was anxiously awaiting this film. I thought the movie started out a little slowly, but it was funny and heartwarming. People in the theater were laughing and clapping and genuinely enjoying it. We enjoyed it too. Did some parts feel forced? Yes. Was it more of the same from the first movie? Yes, but I loved that about it. When the 1st movie ended, I wanted to know more about the characters and their lives. This movie allowed that to happen. I loved that they were able to bring back the old cast. (There is nothing worse than seeing a sequel with different actors.) I loved that the characters were just the same as before, only a little older. This isn't a film to change your worldview, but it is fun for entertainment. I'm looking forward to being able to buy it blu-ray, so I can watch it again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Sequel Deserves a Big Opa...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe we waited this long to revisit this amazing collection of characters. When the original came out, they were like a refreshing storm, giving us a funny but insightful look at another world, yet it had enough commonalities with most of us. We could all relate to the dynamics of relatives, loneliness, love, and other themes.Somehow, the themes are back, with a fresh spin that parallels the original and has the many generations dealing with similar problems. Toula is back and she is still dealing with her parents' proximity and meddling. She is also about to experience her own separation from a daughter that belongs to a new generation and might be overwhelmed by too much affection.Because of technicalities, Toula's parents are not "legally" married, and things must be fixed. This opens the door for a succession of jokes, one-liners, and some very funny situations. They might not have worked had it not been because the cast, though looking older, remains as charming as ever. They're loud, and we love them just like that.We get to see Paris learn that she needs her family when it's time to make decisions, and she is also to become part of the bunch when the family members need to help each other. Of course, this wouldn't be a Greek movie, if we still didn't have various traditions come through and clash with the American counterparts. It's not offensive, just like adding a different type of spice to the mix, and of course, there is a new wedding in the picture, and everyone is involved.One of the freshest turns is Bess Meisier, as the grandma who surprisingly is still around and is funnier than ever, with her gestures, and a new look in the later part of the picture. Enjoy her perfect coming timing.Overall, MFGW2 is a welcome return of our old friends, so enjoy the celebration, be ready to smile, laugh and have a great time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Big Fat Waste Of Time And Money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Big Fat Greek Wedding was both a critical and commercial success, grossing over $360,000,000 worldwide and earning Nia Vardalos an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay. This meant that the sequel, My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2, had a lot to live up to ? but unfortunately it just didn't quite hit the mark.My main issue with this film was the lack of direction, character development or plot structure. Just like Toula's loud and outrageous family, there was just too much going on. Firstly, there's the newest addition to the family ? Toula and Ian's daughter Paris (played by the angsty Elena Kampouris). She's already feeling the pressure from her Papou to find herself a nice Greek boy and settle down. Deeply embarrassed by her very Greek family, she also is a senior in high school and looking to go to college, but she's faced with the dilemma of going to Northwestern University (meaning she will stay close to her cringe-worthy relatives), or living out her dream at NYU. I'm sure you can guess which one she'd prefer!Secondly, there's Toula and Ian's so-called issues? out of the blue, Aunt Voula suggests that they go on a date to reignite their marriage (even though there had been no previous signs of tension). They do so, and suddenly Ian resents Toula for not paying him enough attention. I didn't realise that he needed the meddling Aunt Voula to point this out for him, but there you go.And then to top it all off, there is the abundance of other short-lived, whacky, out-of- the-blue (or all of the above) scenarios that the rest of the characters encounter, including:- Aunt Voula's constant complaining about all of her physical ailments - Maria and Gus' upcoming nuptials (as they have realised they have never been 'officially' married) - Gus claiming he is a direct descendant of Alexander the Great - The all-American judgemental (and borderline racist) women who are eventually put in their place and are suddenly very accepting of their eccentric, ethnic neighbours - Why Angelo (played by ex-NSYNC member Joey Fatone) has been single for so long (I won't spoil it for you but it rhymes with 'romosexual')All-in-all, this film was trying to hard to be what the first movie effortlessly pulled off and it resulted in the jokes being forced and predictable and the stereotypes being more overdone than a tough lamb souvlaki. This proves that sometimes, a classic success needs to remain just that and not rehashed for the sake of it in order to try to force history to repeat itself.motherofpopcorn.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie with somewhat low expectations. I saw the original many many years ago, but honestly, can't remember much about it. I went on a random Sunday night and it hit the spot. I thought it was very entertaining, funny, and enjoyable. The characters were likable and you were rooting for them. I have a big Italian family, and many of these character reminded me of my own family. Yes, they are loud and nosy and all up in each others business, but they love hard and have fun. They understand the importance of family and I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of it. I would recommend this movie to all ages and it is family friendly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Im sorry, but this movie was awful. I remember watching the first one several years back and enjoying it which is the main reason I was interested in this flick. I realize the jokes are supposed to be corny and stereotypical, which was what made the first one unique. HOWEVER, this one was just trash. Seriously brutal. The first 50 minutes felt like an eternity. There wasn't any discernible jokes to laugh at or a plot to be interested in. It was just nonsense about nothing. I never turn off a movie, but this was a close as I ever came. I can't remember what was worse, tearing my ACL or watching BFGW2. This movie was supposed to show a "train wreck of a family", but the jokes on us... the movie is the train wreck. Long story short.. watch old people bicker about the stupidest plot that has ever occurred.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know what you're going to get with this movie - and it delivers. It's a good sequel. The downsides are that the plot is pretty thin and unfortunately 50% of the jokes are in the trailer. But it's a feel good movie and it's fun to see everyone from the original cast, 14 years later, including Ian Miller's parents. Funniest parts were when Gus's young grandsons ape him in explaining how the root of every word you can think of actually comes from the Greek.Nice cameos from Rita Wilson (wife of Tom Hanks and the reason why the first movie got made), bundt cakes, Toula's big glasses and Windex. Lots of "in" jokes for those of us who loved the first movie and thought it was a refreshing change from typical Hollywood fare. Well done, Nia Vardalos. And by the way, she looks stunning in the red lace mini dress at the end of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Chicago dwelling Toula (Nia Vardalos) has been happy since her first Big Fat Greek Wedding to Ian (John Corbett). They have one daughter, Paris, who is a senior in high school and is pulling away from Toula farther every day. Well, it is hard when the entire big family lives near each other so Grandpa Gus (Michael Constantine) and Grandma Maria (Lainie Kazan) and the rest are always snooping. Its called LOVE, as only the Greek Americans can feel. Aunts, uncles, and cousins are always around, at the restaurant where they all work. Just as Paris is applying to colleges and dreaming of space, Gus and Maria are shocked to find they are not really married! Yes, their marriage certificate was never signed by the Greek priest. This creates quite a rift, as Maria wants Gus to ask her again, nicely, and Gus thinks that's going too far. In the meantime, he is learning how to use the computer so he can prove that he, Gus, is a direct descendant of Alexander the Great. It takes a semi emergency to get a proposal from his lips but once it happens, the SECOND Big Fat Greek Wedding is getting planned. Toula and Ian are torn in three different directions. One, will their daughter choose to go to school far from Chicago? Two, how can they help with the wedding plans? And, three, after being so wrapped up in parenting, how can they recapture the sparkle of their own honeymoon days? Opa, a thousand times, Opa! Ms. Nia Vardalos, take a bow, for writing such a terrific film. Then, too, she and the rest of the superb cast is a splendid comic blessing. How wonderful to see the settings at home and at the restaurant while the costumes and lively direction make for one treasure of a flick. Hay, fans, drop the Windex NOW and drive to catch this one as soon as is humanly possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Big Fat Greek Mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though I didn't have any expectations for the sequel to the movie I remember fondly of from 14 years ago, the moment I saw many teasers with birds advertising Windex® for this, I knew we were in trouble.They looked awful and were just plain dumb teasers. The birds asking if we had tickets for My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 made me want to get a refund IF I had purchased any by that point. And how arrogant is that? Many movies sell out ahead of time so it's good to buy advance tickets. These kinds of movies include any Marvel movie, Star Wars saga or the latest teen angst series. NOT this "film." I don't have the research, but did a single soul even buy an advance ticket for this? Boy, those birds seemed to think it would sell out for months. (Fun Fact: the first movie did end up making $241 million domestically and this one, the one you were urged to get advance tickets to: $59 million.)The movie, folks, is just as bad as the bird teasers. Painful at times, even. A horrible, disgustingly bad experience and should never be watched especially if you're a fan of the first one.I never saw the spin-off T.V. show that the first one produced and I really, at the time, loved the first movie. I just thought it was overkill and didn't care to see it. Apparently, I was right since it was all-but immediately cancelled. This movie felt like just a reunion episode of that defunct series and just an excuse to get everyone who is still alive to reunite and prove they're still breathing.And like said sitcom analogy, the main plot revolves around the clichéd sitcom problem: a 50-year-marriage is actually invalid because someone forgot to sign the marriage certificate. This gives the movie's title to give the go-ahead to show another big?not-so fat?Greek?wedding.What is with 2016? So many "comedies" that are not in the least funny: Keanu, Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising, The Boss and now this zero-laugh sequel that no one at all asked for. Granted, I didn't find those other three movies bad, just almost 95% humorless. This terrible movie produced ZERO laughs. Not a single chuckle even.In case you wanted to see these same characters still breathing, then you have an excuse to see this. Other than that, this movie should be avoided at all costs.***Final thoughts: That all said above?maybe I was too harsh. In truth, I did smile a few times and the movie wasn't incompetently shot or acted. It was nice to see everyone back and the same places as before. But all that nostalgia wore off 15 minutes in and I became more and more depressed and frustrated until the ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. It's been 14 years since the Portokolas family took over movie theatres, the box office, and casual conversation in most every social setting. I'll readily admit that, despite my leanings toward more serious film fare, I was a huge fan of the 2002 surprise mega-hit. The movie was refreshing and observational, with commentary on proud cultures and helicopter parenting ? but mostly it was funny. Bundt cakes and Windex will forever be a part of movie lore ? as this sequel reminds us.Given the Hollywood proliferation of sequels, re-makes and re-imaginings, the only thing surprising here is that it took so long for Wedding number 2. And yes, that is the only surprise. Nia Vardalos obviously wrote this script as a love letter to the fans of the original. It fits like a warm blanket ? comfortable and familiar. The setting, the characters and the jokes ? all familiar ? yet still pleasant and easy to watch.With that title, we know we are in for another Greek wedding. However, Toula (Ms. Vardalos) and Ian (John Corbett) have one daughter ? 17 year old Paris (Elena Kampouris), and her big decision is whether to stay local for college or leave Chicago and the family for NYU. Since the wedding is not for the daughter, it falls to Toula's parents. It seems Gus (Michael Constantine) and Maria (Lainie Kazan) have been living in sin for 50 years ? all because the priest never signed the marriage certificate. Let the histrionics begin! Director Kirk Jones (Nanny McPhee, Waking Ned Devine) stays true to the spirit of the Vardalos script and legacy, and much of the movie plays like one big inside joke for fans of the original. Windex make an appearance in each of the three acts, and we get a shot of decorated Bundt cakes, some exaggerated make-up and hair styles, and a steady stream of family members who just can't help their propensity for being loud and up in everyone's business.Most of the original cast returns. Andrea Martin is back as scene-stealer Aunt Voula, and Mama-Yiayia (Bess Meisler) gets her usual "pop-ups" plus a touching moment in the wedding spotlight. New faces include Alex Wolff (brother of Nat, son of Polly Draper) as Paris' prom date; and Rita Wilson (also a producer with her husband Tom Hanks) and John Stamos have a couple of scenes as a Greek couple; while Mark Margolis ("Breaking Bad", "Better Call Saul") appears as Gus' brother from the homeland.Nostalgia and familiarity are the keys here, and there is no reason to be overly-critical of a movie that is so pleasant and light-hearted. "There you go!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoughtful, Funny, Feel-Good Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the features that I enjoyed about the original My Big Fat Greek Wedding was its low-stress plot line. It was a romantic comedy; you knew how it was going to end anyway. So Nia Vardalos did not bother to write faked-up plot twists to drive her characters apart. The tension, such as it was, was provided by the self-doubts of the main character, her romance with an outsider, and the surmountable obstacles and inevitable adjustments and culture clashes that such a union precipitated. As the main character blossomed from ugly duckling to swan, finding herself along the way, you really grew to care about her successes and to root for her burgeoning love affair with the perfect man, Ian.The problem with such a Cinderella story is that a wedding marks the end of the road. Events after the wedding are practically irrelevant in the rom com tradition. So how do you write a sequel to a rom com? Many writers have revisited fairy tale romances, after the wedding, to tell bleak tales of doom, gloom, and disillusionment. Into the Woods is a prime example: fairy tale endings segue into misery, betrayal and destruction. Frankly, I find such post-Modern tales of woe to be intellectually lazy and tiresome. The reality of the post-wedding state may be complex but it is not universally unhappy. All weddings do not end in divorce! Nia Vardalos had the happy idea to make her sequel be about how we turn into our own parents as we raise our own children. In my opinion, there is no Hollywood comedy writer better equipped to address this topic than Nia Vardalos! Beneath the comedy shtick and general silliness, My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 is a thoughtful meditation on dealing with our inevitable transformations as we mutate from young lovers to parents to burgeoning empty-nesters, while learning to nurture ourselves and our primary relationships in the midst of overpowering family and outside-world demands. Do we take our partners for granted? Can we change at any age, as the world changes, or are we stuck? Can we come to terms with the choices that we've made in life? How do we do this while raising children, dealing with our aging parents, and the inevitable disappointments and bizarre turns that life has in store for us? The miracle is that Nia Vardalos and her team have managed to address these kinds of topics while making a fast-moving, slapstick, effervescent comedy that keeps an audience constantly laughing. I thought the film was a tremendous achievement, heart-warming and entertaining.Some critics have dissed this film for being full of shtick and ethnic humor, and for having plot twists that "don't go anywhere." Why? Those were the features of the original film. I EXPECTED a film without woe or major crises, a romp. But I got a lot more. The subject matter was refreshingly adult.Toula, the romantic lead from the original movie, has now become a working Mom, stuck again supporting her family's restaurant business, dealing with her teen daughter's angst and disdain. Toula's fairy tale makeover from the 1st film has disappeared: poor Toula has no time for the hairdresser's, she's trying to be SuperMom... driving her daughter even crazier. Amusingly, Ian is more perfect than ever, now Principal of his daughter's high school. Regardless, his own daughter wants him to pretend that they don't know one another "because the other kids think I'm a narc!" In addition, Toula's family has become so demanding that Toula and Ian's marriage suffers. The story really gets rolling when Toula's father, Gus, while researching his family tree to prove his direct descent from Alexander the Great, discovers that his own marriage was not legal. Can Gus overcome his male chauvinism long enough to woo his own wife into another Big Fat Greek Wedding? Like her father, Toula, too, takes her spouse for granted as she bounces between the demands of Motherhood and Daughterhood; Toula has become her father. Can these couples re-energize their own marriages? Can Toula and Ian's daughter, Paris, find her own love and/or strike out on her own? Or will they all be suffocated by their Big Greek Family? The unusual feature of this film is the parallelism of the generational story lines, parents and children and grandchildren, all struggling with related issues in their different ways, as they come to terms with themselves as individuals and as parts of the larger, all-devouring, eating-and-breeding Blob, the Portakalos family.Nia Vardalos worked on the script for four years, and it pays off in her final fascinating and funny film. There are a handful of jokes and bits that die a thousand deaths, but the majority of the movie is hilarious and, overall, My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 is tremendous fun and a superior sequel.In a final postscript: the coming-out-as-gay subplot featuring Joey Fatone. Some reviewers have criticized this subplot for going nowhere. As a gay/bisexual man, I must disagree with these reviewers. Joey Fatone's character's gay storyline is the next step in LGBT activism. Finally, a gay character who comes out to his family without major drama! At last! It's inspirational. Has this ever happened in a Hollywood film before? Nia Vardalos and director Kirk Jones must understand the significance, or why bother with the storyline as it stands in the final film? It's very uneventfulness is revolutionary. Sure, it would have been better if there had been more backstory. But I was just grateful to have a gay storyline in a film that was neither the butt of a joke nor a drama-soaked misery. It's about time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too little, too late.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sequel to the 2002 box office surprise 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' comes many years too late and its humor that is solely based on clichés and stereotypes does not work these days as far as I'm concerned. While the original movie was certainly no masterpiece, I remember it being entertaining at the time. I'll have to re-watch it, though, to check if that still holds true today.I really wonder who thought it would be a good idea to do a sequel to a fourteen year old comedy that I'm sure most people didn't even think about for more than a decade. Sure, the original movie was a surprise success, but that doesn't necessarily justify a lukewarm sequel, let alone so many years later. After such a long time, you'd think that there would be a good reason to revive an old comedy franchise... but no. 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2' offers nothing that wasn't already done better in the original movie. While the first movie had a relatively interesting plot that held together quite nicely, the plot of 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2' is very thin and doesn't go anywhere. The movie proceeds just as you'd expect. There are no surprises. For a comedy that would be tolerable, though, if the jokes were really good, but that is not the case here. I hardly ever laughed during the whole movie. It's full of lame jokes that don't even reach sitcom level for the most part.So, if the plot is thin and the jokes don't work, maybe some excellent acting could save the movie to some extent, right? Unfortunately, that is not the case, either. Pretty much the whole cast act like they couldn't care less. John Corbett, for instance, is physically present all right, but his acting is absolutely soulless, which comes as a surprise to me because I remember him giving a fine performance in the first movie. Most of the other cast members, including Nia Vardalos, act similarly halfheartedly or way over the top, which is very distracting and out of place at times.The only two actors that I loved watching in 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2' are veteran actor Michael Constantine, who is just marvelous to watch, and up-and-coming actress Elena Kampouris, who I'm sure we'll be seeing much more of in the future. It really makes you wonder when a teenage girl and a gentleman in his late eighties give the best performances in a movie by a long shot.There is one scene in particular, in which Gus (Michael Constantine) is sitting in the church, waiting for Maria to show up. He has a sad look on his face and gazes into space. When he catches sight of Maria, his face brightens and he smiles affectionately. This scene is absolutely convincing thanks to Constantine's excellent acting. Sadly, you won't find much of that in this underwhelming sequel.I would recommend 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2' only to die-hard fans of the original who want to see the familiar characters again in a new setting. Fans of Michael Constantine or Elena Kampouris might also enjoy it somewhat. Other than that, I cannot think of good a reason to recommend this movie to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 (2016): Dir: Kirk Jones / Cast: Nia Vardalos, John Corbett, Elena Kampouris, Lainie Kazan, Michael Constantine: Inferior yet entertaining sequel to the innovative surprise romantic comedy hit of 2002. Now Toula and Ian have a teenage daughter who is facing the same needy crowded existence of her extended family. They do everything together and seem to exist within their own community. Nia Vardalos as Toula is seen as the family member called upon to fix problems but her main issue is her clingy pursuit that pushes her daughter away. She wants her daughter to go to college nearby but realizes that this hope feels threatened when her daughter grows frustrated. John Corbett as Ian is also concerned for their daughter although not quite as clingy. Elena Kampouris plays Paris their daughter and she struggles to pull away from the family chaos. She is going to the prom and contemplates what college to attend. The extended family provide many of the biggest laughs especially Michael Constantine as the head of the house hold raging against society's lifestyles. He wants help operating the computer in order to look up his family tree and prove that he is a direct descendant of Alexander the Great. Lainie Kazan plays his frustrated wife who pulls away when she feels unappreciated. It is also discovered that their marriage certificate wasn't signed. Plot is a retread but structure is detailed. We know where it concludes but this pointless charade can still be enjoyed for its nostalgia and characters that can bring any family to their breaking point. Score: 6 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How do you vote for a movie? Was it good? Was it artistically ingenious? Was it hilarious?The first one was certainly two out of three but this sequel is something a bit more. I laughed but not as much as with the first movie and that was fine. MBFGW2 was dealing with the oddities of Greek life and less with the stereotypes. It wasn't as fun or original many would have wanted and that was to be expected. But what makes this movie good?This movie is about life. Life will be funny, overbearing, things will go wrong and things will go certainly right. If you live in a big Greek family you will encounter several odd moments and although the first movie was a take of liberation from family and coming of age, in the second we discover that the coming of age doesn't happen just once but in reality is a process. Another thing that is always wanted is the liberation from the family ties. You will never be totally free but that's okay because family ties don't always need to be broken to be free but learn how to curve. In short, it was a captivating movie dealing with several family issues taken from the Greek perspective. Don't have any kind of expectations low or high and you will enjoy this movie as I did. By the end of the movie you will realise that although the first movie was about a small personal revolution, this is about that no matter how old you get you still question things and taking a stand whether small or big is not just one point in time for any of us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not worth shouting "opa!" for, but My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 has some sharp moments that mimic the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea that one doesn't marry their loved one, but their entire family is entirely true. I'm on good speaking terms with the majority of my extended family from my aunt and uncle who live close by to my cousins who live on the other side of the country. When I'm thinking about introducing a girlfriend to the family, I'm constantly worried that one will dislike her, creating something of a domino effect. I might take home the president's daughter, yet they might find her laugh unbearable and tell me I could do better. Luckily, I have yet to encounter that, but you never know.The majority of my family has Irish heritage. While this is not what makes us close (it's our simple compassion), there is something of a cliché that's formed and I'm left wondering if were a "cool" group. Nia Vardalos faced a similar problem with her Greek family in My Big Fat Greek Wedding. It was a cute movie that became something of a sleeper hit that made it a box office smash back in 2002. The family was likable and even with the sitcom-like setup, there was potential to tell more of the Greek clan of Chicago. My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 shows us what happened fourteen years later. Toula (played by Nia Vardalos) and Ian Miller (played by John Corbett) are doing their best to give their daughter Paris (played by Elena Krampouris) whose about to finish high school. Paris is clearly embarrassed not just of her mother's constant volunteering at the school to which her father is also principal, but of her large family that's always around to remind her that she's Greek. Even at a college fair, her entire clan descends upon the tables to look into what she's going to study and how far away from home she'll live.Family patriarch, Toula's father Gus still embraces and loves to show off his Greek heritage, whether it be at his restaurant, at physical therapy, or even when instructing Paris to find a nice Greek boy. Things are thrown around when Gus pulls out his marriage certificate for an ancestry project when he realizes that he's never been legally married to his wife Maria. So another wedding is on as the group now puts everything together while Toula tries to keep everything focuses and Paris makes her decision on where she'll go to college. Oh, and Gus is trying to find proof that he's descended from Alexander the Great.My first question is why they waited for so long to get My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 going? Was there really a demand for another movie (I know there was also a failed sitcom) about this family fourteen years later? That would be too much of an issue if the movie was really funny?and it rarely is. The story is not exactly a rehash, but most of the wedding stiff does feel familiar. I think that more could have been don't. that doesn't mean that there aren't some humorous moments. There's the college fair and how we're obligated to help the family in?every situation (you'll see what I mean). The Alexander the Great search got a couple of chuckles out of me. But the writing is not as sharp as the original. The original may have not been a masterpiece, but it was intriguing.The entire cast is all back (it must have been a good thing that none of these people never went anywhere) and they all do their best to throw in a joke here and there. The least interesting character is the newest member, Paris. She's another stereotypical angsty teenager who really has little to complain about. What's unfortunate is that she bickers at her family for nothing and makes her character change without much of a fight. Paris is a robot child to function however the plot feels like it.I'll give it five gyros out of ten. I'm sure fans of the original will find something they'll like, but newcomers aren't going to shout "opa!" after this movie. You can tell the majority is trying, but perhaps its time we put this family album back on the shelf. I'll just get a gyro and watch the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Weirdly found this film OK. The reviews aren't great so I thought I'll tell exactly what's in it. Multiple love stories at once all tied together with a family upset and something to do with passing knowledge on to different generations.We have seen this format so many times and by now we should be getting bored. Surely? But no, look it wasn't the most amazing film. The cinematography was average so was the script and the plot. But it knows what it is. And more importantly it wasn't trying to be something it's not. So it's that feel good family love story. And it does make you feel good and it is surprisingly funny. The only one thing that annoyed me was that they used a certain character for comic purposes at nearly the end of every sequence. But apart from that it's all good. If you like these types of film then you will love it. Even if this isn't your favorite genre but your feeling down then give it a try it's almost certain to cheer you up. And if you hate this genre then I don't even know why your reading this or on this page. You probably decided you were not seeing it when you saw the trailer. Tom</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'MY BIG FAT Greek WEDDING 2': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A sequel to the 2002 blockbuster indie hit 'MY BIG FAT Greek WEDDING'. It was once again written by actress/writer Nia Vardalos, who also stars in the film (once again). The movie was directed (this time) by Kirk Jones; who also helmed 'WAKING NED DEVINE', 'EVERYBODY'S FINE' (which are both pretty good films) and 'WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN YOU'RE EXPECTING' (which is horrible). The movie features John Corbett, Michael Constantine, Lainie Kazan, Andrea Martin, Joey Fatone, Louis Mandylor, Gia Carides, and others, all reprising their roles from the original film; while Elena Kampouris joins the cast. The movie isn't horrible (considering it comes 14- years after the original), but it's definitely not good either. Toula (Vardalos) and Ian (Corbett) are still married, and they now have a teenage daughter, named Paris (Kampouris); that's about to graduate high school. The couple is worried that she's going to move away, and attend a college far away. They're also having marital problems, and have to deal with their overbearing Greek family (once again). Including another Greek family wedding.I did enjoy the original movie, when it came out, but I'm not sure if I'd still like it now (I was a lot younger then). I never saw the short-lived (7 episode) TV series (from 2003), based on the film, but I heard it was horrible. This movie is pretty bad; it's filled with cheesy stereotypes, and the jokes are extremely forced. It feels a lot like a bad TV sitcom (actually), but it does have some heart, and likable characters, too. The film is mostly a pain though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/8JsPKeI7y6U</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less Greek than its predecessor but delivers some good laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2, the sequel to the 2002 highly successful hit comedy is finally here with the whole family returning for another wedding. Like most belated comedy sequels, i wasn't expecting a whole lot from this film, i expected it to play off what made the first film successful and be relatively average. And that is more or less what we have here, in some aspects it delivers fairly well and in others it really doesn't. One of the things i liked hearing going into this film was that the whole cast was returning and that it was being written by Nia Vardalos who also wrote the first one. It gave me some hope that it would have the same overall feeling, but it kinda didn't in the end. Unlike the first film, it didn't feel like a 'Greek' movie for around half of it, it was more of a modern Romantic Comedy with some Greek comedy and set-pieces here and there. Structurally the films plot was kinda all over the joint. There were a lot of side- plots in this film and to be honest, there wasn't really a main plot in the film. It kinda jumps around between the romantic stories revolving around Nia, her parents, and her daughter. Neither one took control of the film and the focus kept swapping throughout. And when the film did depart from the Greek aspect and started heading in the Rom-Com direction they just organised a couple of Greek jokes to remind you that this is still a Greek themed film, and maybe that's where Nia Vardalos writing the film helped it but also kinda let it down. But what i really loved was just by watching this film you could tell that she loves this property, she loves the character Toula and she really didn't want it to fail, and i love when a film is written with so much passion. Now, the comedic aspects of the film were definitely there and there were some very very funny moments. There wasn't really a steady flow of comedy throughout the film, it's sort of delivered in sections here and there. Pretty much, whenever it focused on the Greek aspects of the film there were plenty of jokes, most of the time. And after seeing this film, i gotta say, there are quite a few good laughs..... if you're Greek that is, but if you're not and you don't understand a lot about Greek culture, there really isn't much here for you. Being Greek is really what made a lot of the comedy in the film actually funny. And in terms of who was delivering the comedy, the supporting cast (the entire extended family) were the ones delivering ALL of the jokes, and i mean ALL of them. Unfortunately, Nia Vardalos, John Corbett, and the daughter Elena Kampouris didn't contribute to the humour like at all, not even once from memory. They tried, they definitely tried to have them be funny but it just didn't work at all. But, one thing i have to give the film 100% credit for is what jokes they did provide. Like all of these comedic sequels it would have been incredibly easy to just re-use jokes from the first film and hope people laugh at them as much as they did in 2002. But this film didn't go with any obvious joke callbacks to the first film, which i loved and more comedy sequels should do. I thought for sure they were going to make Nick and Angelo have Ian say something wrong in Greek, and they didn't which was great. They went for new material so i admire what they did. In the end, it isn't nearly as good as the original film, there was less of an authentic Greek feeling, and it kinda lost itself in the Romantic Comedy elements. In terms of the plot it was very unfocused jumping around a lot. But it does deliver on the comedy and there are plenty of laughs to take out of this film, mainly if you are Greek. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sequel, 14 years after the first Greek Wedding.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. There are a couple of interesting "making of" extras discussing how they brought essentially the entire cast back for this sequel. About 13 years ago when I saw the original I recall that I found it funny and totally entertaining. This one is good, but I didn't enjoy it as much. Mainly because I have short patience with overly loud families that intrude into the business of everyone else. I know, that is part of the premise but the first 20 minutes were less enjoyable for me. Often it seems that the humor is being forced and tied too closely to what we saw in the first one.Nia Vardalos, who also wrote the script, is back as Toula and John Corbett is back as her husband Ian. In this story they have an almost 18-yr-old daughter, about to finish high school and go off to college, so they have been married at least 19 years. The excitement has long ago worn off, with both of them always busy, so part of the theme here is rekindling their romance.Toula's father is again played by Michael Constantine, pushing 90, as Gus, and he still thinks Windex can cure almost anything. Lainie Kazan, pushing 75, is back as her mom, Maria. The main wedding focus here is Gus pulling out their old marriage certificate from over 50 years earlier and realizing it was never signed by the priest so he and Maria were never married. He wants to correct that but Maria insists on a genuine proposal and a real wedding.The other main story is about the daughter, Elena Kampouris as Paris. She is at that age where she wants to break free of her parents' influence, and grandpa Gus keeps bugging her about finding a nice Greek fellow and having a family. Overall an entertaining 90 minutes. I always enjoy Lainie Kazan, few realize that in her younger days she was a well-known singer and was actually Streisand's understudy for "Funny Girl" on Broadway. Plus Rita Wilson sings the final song that she also wrote, "Even More Mine" that plays over the credits. I had no idea she is such an accomplished singer, and beautiful lyrics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We got over excited seeing previews of this box office sequel. It's about time. And it did not disappoint. Everyone is back from the original and as terrific as ever. We laughed our tails off. In fact, it's almost funnier than the original. Toula and Ian are long married now, with a half-grown daughter heading off to college after graduation. However, insert dealings with the aging folks; played ever deliciously by Kaizan and Constantine, and hilarious interventions from the extended family in- between, including over-the-top hair salon moments before the wedding, and you get a delightfully parodic piece that is nonstop laughter. There are also plenty of tender moments in-between the humor, which beautifully balances. We absolutely loved it. Kudos to Nia Vardalos and company for finally releasing this long-awaited sequel to her successful box office original.</fullReview>

I also enjoyed seeing all the original cast members, especially Andrea Martin who will always be a true gem among comedic actresses. Great "date" movie for my husband and I as, old married couple that we are, we could really relate to the costars as I think many couples will. Including long time married couples who can get so caught up in day to day life, that they can forget what brought them together in the first place. And you know what?

This time the film focuses on the patriarch and matriarch of the family legalizing their union as Toula (an appealing Nia Vardalos) and her husband (an unappealing John Corbett, desperately in need of a haircut) play second string to their elders, although Toula does follow that winning formula beginning the story as an overly matronly ugly duckling before become that beautiful swan once again. However, Leda she ain't in this Greek tragedy that forsakes its romantic comedy roots. Unlike its predecessor, My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 has little romance and thin plotting, but it is heavy on Greek culture (or the lack there of) and nuptial possibilities.Directed without much skill by Kirk Jones, My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2. is all harmless fun I suppose, only wasting two hours of your time without any baklava to take with you. The film lacks genuine laughs and charm. Miss Vardalos' beloved characters rarely amuse and the film's subplots involving mother/ daughter generation gap issues and parental dullness fail to register any sense of humor or reality. Fortunately the cast continues to please, especially Michael Constantine, Lainie Kazan, and Andrea Martin who provide yeoman-like support and almost succeed in giving the film some class before this dumb script implodes in its heavy-handed predictability.The film perpetuates Greek stereotypes as loud, vulgar, fun-loving people without the guilt factor imposed on the moviegoer. Still one must trend lightly and beware of these Greeks bearing any gifts. Send your regrets and skip this wedding.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was like a semi-comfortable "made for TV movie"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An unsigned Wedding Certificate causes an official wedding to take place between Gus (Michael Constantine) and Maria (Lainie Kazan) who have been together (read married) for 50-years with children. Another plot was to find a Greek boyfriend for Paris (Elena Kampouris); and Paris wants to go to college in New York, which would be away from "all" the family. The only thing I remember from the first one was a metal cabinet drawer hitting someone in the head and that was the only funny thing I chuckled at. That scene was well done. This one was more of the same, but there were 2-sight gags in the beginning that did illicit a chuckle from me: Toula (Nia Vardalos) gets hit in the head with a volleyball; and later Toula eats peanuts in a waiting room that she was told an elderly gentlemen had sucked the chocolate off of them and she, of course, coughs them up. They were it. Well, maybe you had to be there, but both were well done. The rest of the movie did not contain anything else that was funny or even remotely funny. There ensued a lot of stereo-typed comments and they, of course, were to be expected, but failed as they were "old hat" and quite exhausting after a while. Hey, we have seen and heard these very comments before. The constant badgering of everything being Greek became tedious. The emphasis on Paris finding a Greek boyfriend was way out of line. It was like they had nothing else to complain about and poor Paris was beside herself with no place to hide. The music was very good especially the piece at the celebration after the wedding. There really isn't much else to say as this was a slice of life and many dialogues were expected. I hesitate to say predictable, but they were and this movie didn't go anywhere except to safe places. One thing I noticed about all the scenes. There was never any quiet time as the scenes were always too busy. Notables: Rob Riggle as the recruiter for Northwestern College; John Stamos as George, a wedding guest; and John Corbett as Ian, Toula's husband who didn't have much to do. (He had to be there as he was in the first one) This is like a semi- comfortable made for TV movie where no one remembers much. And we can only hope there will be no Greek Wedding 3. Well, Elena Kampouris who played Paris will be remembered and was the only breath of fresh air in here. (I saw you looking)I see you want to know if Paris did go to New York to get away from "all" the family. The answer is yes, and are you kidding?Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I not understand the haters of this very pleasant comedy. It is not vulgar, characters are more developed.Yes for a sequel, it comes a bit late. But it add to the charm of finding the cast back, after all these years. Some look surprisingly the same.The story is simple, but events are funny and charming. And not vulgar like in so many other comedies now.It is also a very warm movie. People with their differences carrying. Even with drama, and gestures, affection stays real for each other.Some characters developed, and not always the one you would think about. The grandmother, has a different role, her comedy part is very different.I really laughed a lot. Maybe for some this comedy is not modern enough, but I cannot remember so many fantastic comedies these last years that deliver in its own kind of way.It has imperfections, in the middle there is a bit slow pace, but then catches up fast again.Very enjoyable, to watch as a couple, also in more open families like ours where some matters that have been discussed here is not an issue at all.Sit back, relax and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Amazing Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am easy to please when it comes to movies - I keep an open mind - However, I do catch a bad movie here and there. What's funny to me is that this movie is funnier if not as funny as the first. I watched this with my grandparents and I haven;t heard my grandfather laugh at a movie that hard for quite some time. I suppose you would have to like movies like the first one to appreciate this one. In the sequel to a wonderful movie - Tula has a daughter named Paris. Struggling to keep her daughter close to her by trying to influence her to pick a college close to home, rather than go to New York, whichh is where Paris wants to go. You see Tula trying to keep her daughter from going through the same things she had to. Tula's dad is the same only older with health issues. Her mother is grumpy a lot in the movie - and the rest of the family just may surprise you with their laughable antics. A wedding is in the works due to the fact Tula's parent's discover they are not legally married - and Tula's mom believes she's "A Hippie". They're Greeker, louder, and just as funny if not more. Give this movie a chance - you will laugh at least once - You must see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Portokalos family secret brings the beloved characters back together for an even bigger and Greeker wedding. My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 didn't disappoint just like i expected i loved the new characters of Rita Wilson who is Tom Hanks wife who also produced the movie alongside her husband also John Stamos and Elen Kampouris although Alex Wolff is pretty forgettable the movie repeats some of the old stuff of the Original movie but as a sequel it's still fun and sweet and it has a lot of Greek music and shows our culture with a very good way. That grandma stole the show especially every time that someone show her jumped and it was hilarious like i said if you liked the first film you are going to love the sequel as well everyone did a great job and the scene in the church and the prom marked something like past, present and future which i found really sweet.

		<shortDescription>Low on comic fuel, fine with united vibes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fans of the first one, finally comes the second installment, a pleasant welcome indeed to see what's going on with the Greekest family ever. Nia Vardalos or as you might know her better as Toula, writes another tale to complement the comedy that was lost in time. But is it that entertaining as it headed out to be? Sadly the answer is no.PLOT OF MY BIG FAT Greek WEDDING 2 Unfortunately in here we have a very vapid plot that fail to keep things together. To watch the family go weird again was hilarious, no doubt about that. But unfortunately the comedy wasn't up to the mark. Sub-plots that were trying to lift up the continuity aren't strong either, and it falls drop dead without substance. What however bides by even at desperate times is the togetherness of this family. An endearing fact you cannot simply overlook! Aunt Voula (Andrea Martin) is just as delightful as she was 14 years ago with her unpredictable irrelevant talks iced with her unique style. Gus as the arch driver of Greekism still doesn't stop at nothing to prove his point. It was good to see him have a go at comedy again. What came in as surprise was Bess Meisler. She walked in to reprise her role as Yiayia. The only sad part ? She has forgotten all about the Turks and is comparatively less baleful.LOW ON ROMANCE Sadly the movie fails to scour romance the way the previous one had. Bringing the daughter into picture was plausible, but trying to depict her life with laconic judgments wasn't really what we were looking for. Her ephemeral tale didn't exactly bring butterflies.THE BRIGHT SIDE OF MY BIG FAT Greek WEDDING 2 If you really take a good look at My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2, even though the movie fails to recreate the past magic, it is hard not to clap for Nia's resolve as she brings along every single character to continue the story even after a decade, a feat which some fail to achieve even with their real family. Pulling something like that off is definitely worth commendable.It is a one-time watch when you want something really light on your platter. A good pastime!

		<fullReview>Sadly this movie was just overdone and tried too hard. The jokes were outdated and forced and the movie had too many stereotypes and story lines which was disappointing as I liked the first movie. This one was just too over the top. I found Nia's character to be frustrating and like she had forgotten much of her rebelliousness from the first movie. The additional ending with the letter was just unnecessary and annoying.There are a few sweet moments. Perhaps if you are Greek you might have a few laughs, but if you are not the laughs are few and far in between. I would give it a miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While it's not as good nor as romantic as the original, I can live with that...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In general, I am not a guy who likes sequels and I had no intention of seeing "My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2"...none. However, I was on a cross- country airplane flight and the film was being shown on the console...and this flight only showed one movie at a time. So, I decided to shove my ear buds in and give it a try...and I am glad I did. If you liked the first film, you'll most likely really enjoy the second...though there is one big difference. The first film was a romance first and was enhanced by its comedy and ensemble cast. In this one, there really isn't much in the way of romance and it's all comedy and the ensemble cast. Considering how likable they all are and that they brought back just about everyone from the first film, it's really just more of the same...but a NICE bit of the same. Well made and a nice date film...but one that won't change your life nor is it exactly a must- see picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another fat wedding in one big Greek family.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A sequel after the 14 years, actually it was not bad. It followed a simple story of another fat wedding in the Toula's big family. Great to see them all once again, and I hope the third film as well will be made very sooner than another 14 years. This franchise has a wonderful set of the characters and each one was in a very unique that imprinted its trademark and so the film gave them all equal parts to explore the opportunity.Yep, it's not anymore about Toula, particularly not in this part or if you're expecting it to be about her daughter, you will be disappointed, but it was a well distributed contents to all the characters and extracted as much as possible good comedies. Beside it was written by Toula (Nia Vardalos) like the previous film.Most of the stuff was as expected, like the slapstick humours. Not everybody would going love it, but if you had liked the first then definitely you would enjoy it as well. Even the first film was not a masterpiece and so this one yet undeniably a good entertainer. Nowadays, in this kind of theme you won't get a fresh storyline, but this one was very original. From the director by 'Everybody's Fine' fame, who really did a good job. A decent summer film, but a very enjoyable film with the family.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't go over the plot/story-line since that is easily found here and elsewhere.I really enjoyed the first one of course, very different, fun and enjoyable. This movie however is a different story.Within the first 4 minutes you already know how the entire movie will unfold - and yes you will be correct on every count. I do have to wonder about the neck/choker that was chosen for the angst ridden daughter, that was in style about 15 years ago - even in the goth world.This is one of those films that you might have playing in the background when family is over so that once in a while everyone can look over and get a small chuckle and go back to whatever they are doing. But it is predictable all the way to the very end.Also you have to question the plot (lack of) regarding the gay character. It honestly feels like right before shooting began, writers and directors sat around and said - hey since this is what is happening in the world news lets tie it into the movie since it is real life. But the thing is, they didn't tie it in at all. You can tell it is just tossed in to the larger story, very disconnected, it would have been much better to either fill out this story-line more or totally omit it.Lastly, many of the characters are enjoyable in their past acting careers - in this film however, it is difficult to get past the plastic surgery of one actress when she is on screen.</fullReview>

Being the one that tries to fix everything Toula has her hands full, but this time she realizes she can't fix everything. I was actually looking forward to this one. I liked the first one, and really liked My Life In Ruins. I have to admit the movie was really funny and I laughed quite a bit, but there wasn't the same magic the other one had. The writing was still great and the acting was funny but as good as that was the movie still felt a little flat. Don't get me wrong the movie is still very much worth watching and I did enjoy it quite a bit, but it is definitely another sequel that isn't near as good as the original. Overall, a very good movie that is worth seeing and one you could watch over and over, but isn't as good as the first one. I give this a B-.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They're all older, yet they're all pretty much the same. Maybe that's another Greek stereotype I'm unaware of. But in this sitcomy world that Nia Vardalos has created for us, it makes sense anyway.From the very first moments, My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 comes off as more of a cast reunion or a "Where Are They Now?" special than anything else.By nature, the title already limits what this film can be about. And it shows. Obvious with every forced plot point, it tries to cover too much ground, but then still finds a way to sneak a wedding into it all.Amidst trying to be the mediator for her whole family, Toula (Vardalos) must deal with her daughter possibly leaving home for college. She also must try to handle her own suffering relationship with her neglected husband (John Corbett), while trying to plan a wedding for her parents who recently find out that their 50-year marriage was never official.At one point there are about 3 major story lines competing for the title of "main". Plus several others intermixed. As a result, we get scenes that serve no purpose and film with no direction.The dialogue is just as sloppy--going for that quirky awkwardness that worked so well in the 2002 original. But here, it plays as unnatural and stiff. Maybe the cast has lost its chemistry with one another. Or maybe it's missing a little of what made the first one work. That first film was completely organic. The sequel is the exact opposite.Everything is forced. From the dialogue to the character depth. Trying to squeeze every last bit of emotion out of its audience every chance it gets.Not to say it doesn't have its moments. I didn't hate it. It just isn't all that good. Certain performances outdo others. Michael Constantine is just as good as Toula's father. But director Kirk Jones just can't extract the same results out of most of the rest of the cast.It's all just really discombobulated. Directionless. It tries to prove points, but then counters them with opposing points--ultimately saying nothing. Or worse: not knowing what it's saying. Many jokes fall flat. Luckily the head count is so high that eventually there are a few you end up laughing at.But as a whole, My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 is a mess. It means well. Really, it does. It'll even make you smile a few times. But after 14 years, you'd at least hope for a better story.Twizard Rating: 59</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weird humour but I enjoyed the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a Greek, I saw this movie in the cinema to support Nia Vardalos. Well, it was exactly was I expected. Of course the story was not so interesting (it's a sequel so it can't be very original I guess) but it was funny.Negative points: I didn't like the stereotypical "jokes" from Pappou and Aunt. Pappou is a very annoying and uneducated stubborn old man - of course he is a true representative of his age. Aunt was too "spicy" for her age.Positive points: It is a movie about family values. The Greek families always press their children too much but it is all because of love. Everyone helps each other and this is how all the families should be.As a conclusion, I would say that the movie is a bit stereotypical - the Greeks don't actually behave this way. Of course the Greeks over-react about things that don't approve of (especially if it a matter of what a member of the family does) but we're trying to balance this complexes (I say "we" because I'm Greek). Nevertheless, what I kept from this movie is that I enjoyed it so much that I didn't want it to end. There are also some touching moments and my friend, who is a bit sensitive, well she almost cried. I would like this movie to last longer.I send my love to Nia Vardalos and all the Greeks living away from the Hellenic Republic. Sas agapame :)</fullReview>

New family member Elena Kamporis as daughter Paris looks more like she is doing a vampire movie then a Greek comedy.Everything is pleasant enough. Some of the humor works. It may not be nice to make fun of the oldest member of the family. The movie is almost too in your face on the big screen. It will play well on home platforms.

		<shortDescription>Another Big Fat Greek Wedding...14 Years in the Making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Portokalos family are that kind of family that joins the Parthenon of best movie families ever. A lot of us who are not Greek and come from different backgrounds can sometimes relate to this family. They are the kind of family that are big, loud, overbearing and sometimes obnoxious, but it's a lovable, wise and real family. That was part of the appeal of the genuinely funny and sincere "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" 14 years ago, which is still the #1 romantic comedy of all time, by the way, and it worked even more this time in the sequel to the surprise box-office hit. Here is a sequel that feels more natural than a simple cash-grab. It's a movie that brings back everybody (and I do mean, everybody) for another big fat Greek wedding, while also dealing with more situations that will surprise and even move your family. It's also the movie where I knew what was going to happen, but I didn't know how it will affect me in the end. In the first movie, we followed Toula, a 30-year-old Greek-American woman who got her life together and fell in love and ultimately married a non-Greek named Ian, which shocks her father, who wanted her to marry a Greek boy and make Greek babies. And, of course, in the end, Toula and Ian has a daughter. Now, in "MBFGW2", which takes place 11 years later, that daughter named Paris (now played by the delightful Elena Kampouris) is now growing up and is sort of fed up with her extended family constantly smothering her everywhere she goes and she really wants to go far away from her family. In the meantime, Toula (Nia Vardalos) and Ian (John Corbett) are struggling with their 17-year marriage. Are they missing the spark? Or is Toula busy trying to convince her daughter that she is making the wrong choice? The answer to that is quite an honest one. Since it's called "My Big Fat Greek Wedding", who's getting married? Well, turns out it's Toula's parents, Gus (Michael Constantine) and Maria (Lainie Kazan). When they were married 50 years ago, their marriage certificate was not signed. So that means everybody in the family comes back including the always reliable Aunt Voula (the hilarious Andrea Martin), sexy and feisty Nikki (Gia Carides), sincere Athena (Stavroula Logothettis), earnest Angelo (Joey Fatone) and muscle-bound Nick (Louis Mandylor) as they prepare for the biggest, fattest and Greek-est wedding since the first one. The success to these movies is the strong semi-autobiographical writing by Vardalos. Her screenplay to these two movies are filled with hilarious one-lines and visual gags that are sure to be quite memorable with people who've seen it more than once and sharp dialogue that can remind you of what your family used to say. But it's also honest (sometimes to a fault) and authentic. This wonderful ensemble cast is still remarkable and the charming chemistry between Vardalos and Corbett still resonates with me. Director Kirk Jones (taking over from Joel Zwick) who has dealt with an ensemble team before in "What to Expect When You're Expecting" and "Waking Ned Devine" keeps the brisk pace moving forward and makes sure that every single character gets their moments, including the kooky but endearing Mana-Yiayia (Bess Meisler), while filling the screen with enough hilarity and heart that all of us can remember the first time around. Sometimes movie sequels are viewed as "companion pieces". I don't usually use that term a lot, but "My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2" serves as a satisfying companion piece to the original. For one thing, it's great to see this family again because, for me, it feels like they haven't even left. They are still the same as they were before. They may have changed a little, but they are still who they are. Sometimes, I wished my family was like the Portokalos family. Do you think of the same question?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2Nowadays, when you attend a Greek wedding instead of a gift you are encouraged to give an austerity package. Luckily, the couple in this comedy isn't tying the knot near the Eurozone.Toula (Nia Vardalos) not only has to cope with her daughter Paris (Elena Kampouris) moving away to college, but also her husband (John Corbett) feeling neglected when her parents (Lainie Kazan, Michael Constantine) decide to get re-married, and expect her to do all the hard work.Meanwhile, Paris' grandparents pressure her to land a Greek boyfriend for the event.With a script that lacks a point and jokes that don't work in today's culturally sensitive world, this unnecessary sequel to the 2002 sleeper hit pales in comparison to the charming original, and reeks of desperation on the part of its creator/writer, Vardalos.Incidentally, Greece could be relevant again if only it was reimagined as a philosophical theme park.

		<fullReview>My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 was okay, but lacked the charm of the original. It focused too hard on jokes from the first movie, to the point of running them into the ground. The soundtrack was intrusive, and the pacing had serious, serious problems. It felt kind of pasted together. So basically? all very typical sequel problems. Spoilers under the cut.Nia Vardalos acted her heart out with an earnesty that was almost heartbreaking at times, particularly since John Corbett seemed to be phoning the whole performance in. Ironically, this added to the realism of their marital subplot, as Toula seemed like a still- lovestruck wife who couldn't understand why her husband was bored and dissatisfied, and Ian seemed? bored and dissatisfied. Even when he was the one asking Toula to put more effort into their marriage, his delivery was? well, script-like.Paris's teen pathos was just a little overdone, but then again, so was almost everything, so I'm not gonna blame that on Elena Kampouris. The shining star of the movie, in my opinion, was Bess Meisler as Yiayia. I still thought her sight gags were overdone, but they still carried most of the charm of the entire movie, AND she got a triumphant ending, which was nice to see.Seriously though, the way Corbett was playing Ian, I was 100% sure he was already cheating on Toula through the entire movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember I watched the 1st part of the movie a lot time ago and I loved it. I always liked Greek culture and as Greeks are close to Serbian people, it was natural that I liked it. So, I was happy to see the Wedding 2. I kinda do not remember the whole original film, but I do remember it was fun, just like this one.I was not disappointed. The film is very fun ( though not funny too much) and you either smile or you cry :) Yes, there were the scenes that were touching. And there were scenes which were hilarious.I liked how they made it about the 3 different generations. Also, it is very cool they had the entire cast from the 1st one. The coming out of N'sync boy was kinda cheesy and out of the blue - but done in fun way ( especially with all Mykonos references :) lol )The soundtrack could have been better. It could have been funny to hear some N'Sync song. Just two Greek songs at the wedding?! But, it is just my thought.All in all, quite a good movie. Feel good movie. I give it eight stars.</fullReview>

It's 50% plausible and another 50% made up situations and habits that don't apply. The movie had some nice elements and some really good laughs, but this is as far as it goes. The first one was really good. This one was not. Maybe you can have it playing while you surf the web and read through stuff. Nothing more... It was a nice scenario altogether but at some points, the characters are just too much. The only character that applies is the great grandmother. No one else. It was a really huge disappointment after the success of the first one, to see this kind of sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blurry plot and a disoriented focus creates one big mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The crazy Greek family living in the USA is back in the sequel My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2. Now Toula and her husband Ian are older and have a daughter about to graduate from high school. And of course her Greek family is still present in their lives and always have something to say no matter if it is about upcoming boyfriends or future school choices. The same actors are back which probably almost was a must for this sequel to even be made. I can't help feel disappointed. It is actually not impossible to make sequels to this kind of film. Yet they choose to step into the classic swamp of clichés and also play on the boring cultural and sometimes degrading stereotypes.The first My Big Fat Greek Wedding had its charm and sort of tried to catch some form of interesting cultural difference between Greeks and Americans. Toula then worked in a travel firm and met Ian. What I suppose they found so funny in the first film, the crazy Greek family, have now taken the absolute most central part in the film. The film begins quite easy with introducing us to Toula's present situation. She lives next door to her entire family and her daughter is about to graduate and wants nothing more than to move far away from their family. So far so good. The suddenly the film makes a quick turn when it turns out that Toula's mother and father are not married due to a paper technicality at their real wedding 50 years ago. Suddenly it is not about Toula anymore, but her parents. Huh?The blurry storyline is not the only problem with the film. Character problems such as Toula's inability to prioritize herself is not solved in any way during the film. She really hasn't that much of an own story at all. Other things such as the neighbours mean attitude towards the family is left strangely unexplained. Also throw in some half forced marriage within the same culture ideals and also a Greek conquer all attitude, and you've got this film in a nutshell. I think it could have become a nice sequel if they only would have dared to continue in the same way as in the first film. The crazy Greek family should be a side character and Toula and her family should be the main story. Couldn't she have felt distant from Greece and went there instead to recapture her identity. It is extremely nice to film in Greece, Richard Linklater showed it in his film Before Midnight, and also from the musical Mamma Mia. Instead of this they take the cliché, stereotype and at times demeaning way and place everything in strict cultural boxes. A bit cowardly and pretty boring actually. Come on, be bold and try something different. Couldn't the daughter have met an Italian? That would have been interesting.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was in the mood to watch a recent romantic comedy, so I chose this one. I saw the first film when it was released. Sometimes you need a break from seeing the latest blockbuster and My Big Fat Greek Wedding does break that monotony.All the characters from the first film reprise their roles as members of the quirky, oddball Portokalos family. So this time around the story focuses on Maria and Gus.While researching information to use for an ongoing argument with his pals, Gus discovers that he and Maria's marriage license is missing the signature needed for validation. That means they weren't married! This sets off a snowball effect causing hilarious situations between Gus and Maria because now they've been given a chance to get married after nearly 50 years of living as a married couple. Will they? Should they? Toula is kind of ditsy though. She acts like a mindless Stepford wife and she's overprotective of her daughter Paris who's like 17 and about to graduate from high school! Paris goes through a similar type of identity crisis as her mother, although it seems like Toula isn't going to find an identity. Ian is still as laid back as ever. His job is as principal of the high school. Unfortunately, Paris mimics her mom's insecurities and eventually chooses her own completely different path in life. Meanwhile, the rest of the family is still the same. They all get along well are good at solving family crisis even if they get distracted easily. There are other subplot as well. But definitely a strong ensemble. They experience the same trials and tribulations every family does like marital problems. They get through these issues with humor and love. I wish real life was so easy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not worth paying for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A sequel has arrived for the Portokalos family, but was not necessary and was poorly executed. This time the head of the family Gus, and Maria realise that there wedding license was never signed and is therefore an excuse to have another big fat Greek wedding. Meanwhile Toula and Ian's teenage daughter Paris is struggling to deal with her very close family and is being pressured to find a Greek boyfriend and choose a college. So it's not good.The first problem is that it's not very funny, there are very rare occasions that will make you giggle, apart from that, it's just humour that you've in any other comedy movie that's not funny at all. But the comedy wasn't natural, and it was ready to be joke, and not just occurring on its own, so you know the jokes happening and its drawing too much attention to it. This is pretty much the vibe of the film, which is sad, because the first film is really good and funny but it doesn't have a silly vibe all the way through it. This film just acts like a silly comedy film and knows that tit is, but is bringing much joy. But then it does try to have an emotional theme to it to draw the audience in, but it doesn't work because the rest of the film hasn't shown these themes seriously.But that doesn't mean everyone won't enjoy it, while watching it, there were many other people who laughed at every joke (even jokes that really weren't funny, and lines that weren't meant to be funny). I mean laughing out loud, but these people then surely haven't seen a lot of comedy films.The biggest problem though was the narrative. There were too many plots and subplots, we don't know which ones to pay attention to, and it feels really lazily written. Because it sets up different situations the character's war experiencing but then just sums it up in the next scene, with no context to how its resolved and how these characters have changed over the course of the film. There's too much going on to try and cram it in to an hour and half film.The only positives of the film were that it's easy to watch, and would be perfect for a Saturday afternoon on the telly, but that's it. It really isn't good, and is not worth paying for. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you come from a big, close-knit family (Greek or otherwise), you will LOVE this flick! And you will totally relate to it! If you don't, you may end up wishing you had. With the various age groups involved, there is something for everyone &amp; a few surprises along the way. This sequel picks up about 14 years after the original. Time has passed. Some things have changed &amp; others hilariously haven't. That's life; isn't it? Ian, Toula &amp; their teenage daughter are struggling with it all -- taking advice &amp; embarrassment along the way. The same realism that was in MBFGW is in this sequel. The characters are fun &amp; believable. The issues are, too. It's art imitating life &amp; doing it well. Wisdom with laughs. Sit back &amp; enjoy the ride!</fullReview>

Basically, if you liked the first one, please see this.The actress that plays Toula and Ian's daughter is excellent and very pretty. The family never wastes a chance to tell her how to run her life and you feel for her like we all did for Toula in the first movie.And there you go!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure it's true that this is not as good as the original, but I think it's still very entertaining. All the actors did a really good job, and I was very happy that everyone from the first returned to appear in this one. John Corbett and Nia Vardalos worked well together, just like in the first. The writing is funny and it's very cute and heartwarming at times just like the original. Now there are some clichés and a few jokes that just don't work, but they pretty much come far and few in between. Aunt Voula is just as hysterical in this one as she was in the first. Spoiler warning spoiler warning!!! I really like how they handled Toula's cousin being gay, and hiding it from the family for such a long time, it was sweet how they found out and that he was dating his business partner. This whole movie just has a very warm sweet welcoming and very nostalgic feel to it. Oh and John stamos does a pretty good job with his small role. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a joy and all people who love family and people generally should do themselves a favor and go to see it. For those who saw the original, viewing this reunion with old friends is a must. (You are cheating yourself if you don't go.) But this film works for newcomers as well. I was thrilled to see that the entire original cast was reassembled. The new cast members were great as well. My wife and I saw this sequel on our anniversary night. Frankly, I was prepared to be disappointed owing to the many less than glowing reviews. What a pleasant surprise! Some critics apparently place value on something other than the joy of sweet-hearted humble love. For the rest of us this film is a welcome homecoming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed the original and bought it on DVD. We watch it as a family about every other year. Sure, it's sitcom-y and very light entertainment but it's cute, fun and funny. I will say that this sequel is very much the same ... in the second half. I would give the film a '5' for the first 45 minutes and a '9' for the last 45 minutes, making it a '7' and a safe night of entertainment for everyone.The entire - and I mean ENTIRE - cast of the original is here along with a few new faces. There's a lot of setup in the first half and the payoff comes in the second. It's one of those happy movies where everyone gets a happy ending, all problems are resolved and you leave the theatre satisfied. That says a lot. I never laughed out loud but I definitely smiled and chuckled quite a bit. A great date movie for couples of any age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We planned to see this from the moment we saw the first trailer- date night on opening night and it did not disappoint... it was so much fun... a little bittersweet as Toula talks about how life has changed, and seeing how Gus has aged, but the family, THE FAMILY, still all loud and in each others lives and business... new relationships that you suspected might come out of the original, more kids, more loud breeding Greek eaters... it was like coming to visit old friends after years away. New "drama" and change and laughs and tears... it has been a long time since we laughed so hard at a movie that was fun and relatively clean and not so stupid you wonder why you paid good money to see it. This one will be a keeper once it hits DVD. A truly fun movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a bad movie at all. Even though it starts slow, it does pick up pace, and there are some comedic and also emotional scenes throughout. However, there is not as much comedy as initially hoped for and the plot seems rather unoriginal as if the story seemed forced in order to 'create' another Greek wedding (to remain consistent with the title). Could have been better; not as good as the original, but it does have some laughs and tears. I do praise it for its genuine characters and pretty good acting (for a generic comedy anyway). Worth a watch, but not sure if its worth the now very expensive cinema price.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original My Big Fat Greek Wedding was one of the big sleeper hits of the new millennium. A sweet and appealing comedy even though it played up certain Greek stereotypes. The belated sequel is set 18 years after the original. If you have not seen the original since its 2002 release then the film makes no concession that you might remember some of the characters or signature gags from the original such as the Windex/Windolene being a fix for everything.Nia Vardoulas again writes and stars as Toula happily married to Ian (John Corbett) they have a 17 year old daughter, Paris about to graduate and applying to go to college as well as prepare for her prom night. Paris wants to go and study in New York so she can get away from her suffocating extended family who all live near each other. Her parents would prefer if she went to a local college.Ian and Toula also feel they need to spend time together like they did when they were younger and not parents.The wedding element this time is that Toula's parents Maria (Lainie Kazan) and Gus (Michael Constantine) realise that the priest who married them never signed the marriage licence so they were never really married officially. How could not help thinking that Lainie Kazan had so much work done she looked like she should be Gus's eldest daughter.So this time Maria wants a big fancy wedding but first Gus must propose properly and after a few false starts she ropes in Toula to sort out the wedding.Basically that is the plot but to keep the large extended cast going there are side plots such as the prom night, Gus thinks he is a descendant of Alexander the Great as well as getting stuck in the bath.Many of the characters from the original film are present, although still exuding a certain charm this time it feels less fresh and funny. It really is a case of being an unnecessary sequel that is light on story and laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately this movie fell flat on its face for me. I found it too over-the-top and annoying.The first movie was quite enjoyable because we hadn't seen it all before with it's mix of sweet romance and the overbearing theatrics of Greek relatives. This time around, the theatrics were even more pronounced. I suppose to cover the thin storyline &amp; lack of any character development.Toula was like a deer in the headlights throughout most of the movie. The actress who plays Maria, Toula's mother, has made another visit to a plastic surgeon and now sports a face that is immovable as it is improbable (in real life, not in the storyline). I found it very distracting. The extended Greek family were their usual obnoxious selves, so nothing new there.There were a few good jokes, but most of it was been there, done that and done that to death. Pass.</fullReview>

I really hoped for something more interesting instead of passing her old wedding circumstances to her daughter. The cast is older now and more boring. Only John Corbett showed decent acting. Michael Constantine was simple too old for acting. He should have retired long ago. This movie was made for two reasons only. For the profit and for proofing that Vardalos has a future in movie industry. Those who haven't seen the original movie may find it a little more funny than me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What the movie has going for it is the entire original cast returning. It is a good follow up film to the original, as a stand alone film I don't think it would hold up on its own. It relies on reusing gags from the original film in new ways and needs that connection to the original to work. I don't think it will stand the test of time like the original has, the cast does reprise their roles well except John Corbett phoned in his performance in my opinion. It was funny, the story line though just kinda of got a little sloppy with the daughter going to school and the parents wedding it felt like an excuse to make a second one. Its a sequel we did not need but can watch and rediscover what made the first one so great.Source: http://www.huludb.com/movies/228668-my-big-fat-greek-wedding-2</fullReview>

Without prior knowledge of Godard, Fellini, Fassbinder and Bergman your foolish mind would miss the precise details hidden in every frame or shot. The framing and cinematography is C'est Magnifique, and every moment is filled to the brim with joy and wonder, as true film always is and always should and always will be. The direction is superb, any word otherwise is showing the true blue ignorance you possess and your lack of appreciation for cinematic arts such as this will truly rot your brain to a core. If you muster up the intellectual prowess to trek through the deep mystifying codes set in by the MBFGW2 crew, your life will change. Maybe not for the better, but it will cause you to think and relate the situations to your own life. Truly then you can connect your soul inside the hole of destiny peeking within the grains of the film. Until that day your feeble minds will fail to grasp the eloquent display put forth by this outstanding picture, but alas it is destined to be overlooked by ingrates who lack the proper understanding of life and art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Simplistic Sequel that Is Fun, Family Friendly, and Predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Family. It's something we all have in some shape or form. With family often comes traditions and customs that they hold dear to their hearts. And nearly fifteen years ago we had a movie that harped on all these qualities called My Big Fat Greek Wedding. This cultural romantic comedy swept many off there feet and brought fun to being Greek. After leaving us with such a nice ending you would hope the tale would end, but of course Hollywood can't help but find any opportunity to make a sequel. This weekend the family you love is back and bigger than ever. But after such a long hiatus, does the Portokalos family still have the magic or has it dried up like the olives. Please read on to hear my opinions. In terms of originality, My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 is certainly lacking in this department. Toula's story centers on a middle aged woman finding happiness as she struggles to juggle being a wife, a daughter and a mother. Throughout the 90 minute run time, the woman get many lessons in love, life, and family as she copes with the insane amount of stress everyone puts on her. Amidst the main tale are a few funny side plots that help develop a few of the supporting cast, all conveniently intertwined to involve our leading lady in some form or manner. Whatever tale you may or may not fall in love with, let it be known that the endings are all predictable thanks to the theme of growing up and moving on. Regardless of the predictability, the presentation of it is spot on. The importance of family, forgiveness, and love are well-represented in the scenes and sequences of the movie. Instead of the cheesy, over the top, fantasy bologna many films like to sell (aka Nicholas Sparks), My Big Fat Greek Wedding Two decides to show a more realistic side of things. The family is relatable, with a cast of characters that are certain to remind you of someone in your life. All the badgering, customs, and cultural references will surely make you laugh or cringe, as the family unleashes their unhindered pride onto the audience. Yeah there is some preachy moments that try to make you cry, but luckily these moments are shown for a limited time. For me, this kept the movie fun and allowed me to finally enjoy cinema romance once again. Yet what the movie lacks in originality, it makes up for in cuteness. My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 follows its predecessor in terms of R rated comedy presented in PG/PG-13 terms. They drop the aggressive rants and vulgarity for a wittier presentation of innuendos and let the actors delivery sell the lines. Aunt Voula (Andrea Martin) was a heavy favorite, focusing her jokes heavily on sex, but somehow making it classy. Grandpa Gus (Michael Constantine) brings the stubborn, elder charm you saw in the first film that is both frustrating and charming at the same time. And as for Mana-Yiayia (Bess Meisler) she was adorable and perhaps my favorite comedic relief. The small woman was a blend of modernism and Greek tradition that didn't involve corny one-liners or over emphasized dialogue, but instead a simplistic and well-timed approach was more than capable of maximizing the laughs, sort of like a silent Sophia Patrilla of the Golden Girls. Of course like many things in movies, sometimes the jokes get overdone and this film has its jokes that go a little too far at times to get stale. All in all though, things stay pretty well balanced and fun, which is perfect for most families. There isn't too much more to say on My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 except for commenting on the acting. Nia Vardalos leads the cast and does a great job playing the neurotic role she mastered, easily bridging the transition from girlfriend to mom. She's funny and erratic, which helps you fall in love with her again. Lainie Kazan reprises her role as Maria, and manages to make over the top, over accented Greek wives fun once more. And even the teenage Elena Kampouris manages to play her part well, managing to capture the teenage angst of a frustrated daughter without crossing over into the annoying territory. The rest of the cast does its job well, some better than others, but our casting director certainly succeeded in bringing a group together who really feels like a Greek family. And even more impressive is how everyone gets their fair share of screen time and involvement in the second wedding, without short sighting key characters. In all honesty, My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 is a fun movie that takes a step back into the family friendly zone. While it certainly isn't the most exciting or original piece of work ,this movie is a realistic portrayal of family dynamics. There is certainly something for most people to grab on to and provide them with the laughs that we grew up on. Those who have ties to Mediterranean culture are going to be the ones who enjoy the film. Is it worth a trip to the theaters? In my opinion, the answer is No. This movie could have fit right at home with a Hallmark or Netflix home. However, if you are looking for a cute group or family film, then by all means give it a shot, otherwise save your dough and reserve it for home.My scores for this film are: Comedy/Romance: 8.0Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0 (more so because the overzealous jokes, pace, and predictability took away points for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The longest 90-minute movie you may ever see. A blatant money-grab, with no redeeming social value. As far as sequels go, Godfather 2 should not feel threatened. This turd gets a two rating rather than a one because I chuckled briefly a few times before I bailed to escape the pain.The screenwriters stuffed this baby with a championship surplus of agonizingly transparent plot "twists," wildly implausible events, and trite dialogue. And, just when you think it's coming to an end, it continues...on and on. Trips from America to Australia appear to take less time.The money shamelessly generated by the mercenary producers and actors of this stink bomb contributes to giving capitalism a bad name.

		<fullReview>I loved the first movie, it's one of the ones that I still like to re-watch every couple of years. I suppose my expectations were too high for this film. Instead of the clever, heartfelt and surprisingly original story line we were treated to in the original film the sequel delivered a sloppy, poorly executed script by actors who seemed to realise how bad it was while they were filming. This might be because none of the characters had changed or grown in an way since 2002, it was as if they had suddenly aged 17 years physically but hadn't lived any of them. Nia Vardalos is a fellow Canadian and this was filmed in my hometown of Toronto so I would have been happy if I could have delivered a great, or even good review but honestly I wish I hadn't watched the sequel because now I have no desire to watch the original ever again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes, sequels are actually worth waiting for, especially the sequel to one of the highest-grossing, American romantic comedies in cinematic history. "My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2" qualifies as a charming but predictable sequel to its phenomenal predecessor "My Big Fat Greek Wedding." For the record, "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" earned $368 million plus globally at the box office when it came out back in 2002. As far as I am concerned, the litmus test for all sequels is the cast. Virtually everybody from the 2002 original about a dysfunctional Greek family residing in Chicago has returned for this follow-up film. Happily, Canadian actress of Greek descent Nia Vardalos, who wrote "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" initially as a one- woman stage play, has scripted the sequel. Vardalos earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Screenplay for the first film. "My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2" is every bit as entertaining and magical as its forerunner. In the sequel, Vardalos contends with three generations: the parents, her own marriage, and her haughty daughter. John Corbett, who played her boyfriend/husband Ian Miller from the earlier epic, is back. Simultaneously, seasoned Hollywood supporting players Michael Constantine and Lainie Kazan reprise their roles as our heroine's eccentric Greek parents. Predictably, Constantine's overbearing patriarchal character Gus still wields his spray bottle of Windex and brags that this cleaning product can solve any problem. If you've seen the original film, you'll easily spot everybody else, including Louis Mandylor, Andrea Martin, Joey Fatone, and Gia Carides. Rated PG-13, this ethnic comedy will keep you giggling at their screwball shenanigans. Indeed, "Nanny McPhee" director Kirk Jones maintains a lighthearted, breezy pace from fade-in to fadeout, with several amusing complications and a surprise or two to enliven the material. Amazingly enough, he doesn't slight anybody in the large ensemble cast. Altogether, "My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2" celebrates romance, love, marriage, weddings, and embraces diversity throughout its nimble 94 minute running time without wearing out its welcome. You'll have to search long and hard to find a comedy that neither insults you with its idiocy, nor soils its own material for comic relief.Some things have changed for the cacophonous Portokalos clan. America's ailing economy has forced Toula (Nia Vardalos of "Helicopter Mom") to quit the travel and tourism business, and she has gone back to serving as a hostess in her father's restaurant The Dancing Zorba. Meantime, Ian and she have been raising a daughter, Paris (Elena Kampouris of "Labor Day"), who at age seventeen is hopelessly obsessed with eyeliner. At this point in her life, Paris has had it with her parents and can see through their agenda. Of course, since she is old enough to apply for college, everybody hopes she will stick around Chicago and attend Northeastern Illinois University. Paris prefers to pack up, leave town and indulge in greater freedom from stifling parental supervision. Moreover, she puts up with Gus' criticisms about her status as a spinster as well as her encroaching decrepitude. Remember, Toula tolerated similar comments about her advanced age in the original. Meantime, Ian is no longer a teacher at the high school that his daughter attends and where Toula pitches in to help whenever volunteers are needed. Now, Ian is the principal, so the Millers have cornered prosperity of a sort. Gus still tells the same jokes, and he regales Paris and her friends with his outlandish etymological Grecian origins of any word. Toula's brother Nick (Louis Mandylor of "One in the Chamber") has married and has three little boys. Everything suddenly changes for the worst when Gus discovers that the priest who married Maria (Lainie Kazan of "Dayton Devils") and him forgot to sign the marriage license. Predictably, Maria takes this opportunity to learn how much Gus really loves her by playing hard to get when he proposes to her again. Indeed, everything that can go wrong does go wrong until Maria decides to accept his offer. Maria adds to their woes when she hires a wedding planner and the poor girl refuses to grant Maria's every wish for an over-the-top marriage ceremony. Maria's dysfunctional family throws up their collective hands in despair and they take over planning the ceremony. While Gus and Maria struggle to tie the knot for the second time, Toula and Ian endeavor to rekindle the passion in their own marriage since Paris is about to forsake Chicago for a New York City university.Does anybody remember the short-lived television series "My Big Fat Greek Life" with its seven episodes that the incredibly successful movie spawned? Star and scribe Nia Vardalos and director Kirk Jones behave as if the events depicted in that ephemeral series never occurred. Miraculously, they manage to bridge the void of the intervening 14 years and blend both films seamlessly together. Ian and Toula live next door now to Gus' mansion with its tacky plethora of Greek statues. Every morning dawns with Gus cruising up to each adjacent house to pick up family members for school and work. Mind you, like the original film, the producers of "My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2" show the savvy sense to serve audiences sloppy seconds of the first film. Basically, this amounts to a "Big, Fat" ethnic array of stock characters scrimmaging in a standard-issue sitcom. Believe it or not, Vardalos still gets a lot of mileage out of this wacky formula about their extended family. For example, when everybody realizes how late they are for the wedding, a family member in the Chicago Police Department arranges to transport the principals by careening patrol cars with lights ablaze to their Greek Orthodox Church. After the demise of the television series, it was difficult to imagine that the Portokalos clan would scale the same hilarious heights. Nevertheless, "My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2" emerges as a faithful and flavorful sequel that all sequels should emulate, and the ensemble cast hasn't lost a scrap of its charisma.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Sequel - Hits The Spot!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are Greek you'll get it, if you are not you'll learn! This is one of the best sequels ever made for a comedy. Very funny, with it's usual cliché punchlines that anyone with a sense of deep family ties will understand. Expect the same amount of laughter and emotional connection as the first movie, with a touch of modern! Same lovable characters, similar story that has some twists and turns and surprisingly did not get old after waiting 14 years. For all of you who loved the first Big Fat Greek Wedding, go see it, you will be crying with laughter and emotion that only Greeks know how to bring on. OPA!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare good sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is very rare that a sequel to a blockbuster movie is as good as the original. This movie could almost stand on its own if the original movie did not exist. A movie about a Greek family which is so large, so loud, so obnoxious and good natured that they cause laughter and delight for the viewer.For a few moments I was thinking the script was being forced and about to go over that line of no return where a terrible joke or awkward scene would ruin the movie. However the director never crossed that line as they teetered on the edge of a chasm.Most all of the returning cast was present, which allowed for a realism for the movie. I didn't completely "get" the main storyline about the grand parents not being married. I understand where the writers were going with it, but I thought it was a pleasant ending to the movie and it all worked. So you'll need to put up with the bad to get to the good.Overall I think this is an awesome family movie, not quite as good as the original but good enough. I'm disappointed that it didn't do as well in the box office, but I understand why considering its release date and that most people were bored with the same story.I highly recommend watching part 1 and 2 back to back. It sort of adds to the experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really good for a sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the first one, so I was excited to see the second. I am not a movie goer these days. I am an online/ streaming app movie person, because hey it is extremely cheaper and everyone has a big screen TV these days, ya. Yet my friends and I were wanting to do something different on a Monday evening. I was glad I spent the money to go and see this movie. Since I didn't watch the movie trailers I was utterly surprised about the wedding. I loved that they kept the value of family and the draw for younger generations to escape some of the chaos type theme as they had in the previous movie. The movie was well written probably a little more reserved than critics like but definitely entertaining. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I recommend it to the sentimental, nostalgic, family oriented individuals like me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweetest representation of a Greek family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fact that they have managed to bring back every single member of the original cast and still make them look and sound so authentic speaks for itself in this sequel. The bar was raised in the first movie and the sequel did not let me down! It was one of the sweetest, easy going, family movies I have yet seen. Gus (Kwstas) still gives us the good old Greek lines and heals everything with Windex, Toula is becoming like her parents, controlling and always around and aunt Voula is killing us with her sex stories. Loved every minute of it and it's sure one of the movies I will gladly watch again and again! Greek families are the best :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything is Greek.... like Alexander the Great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.A simple storyline where a big, fat, Greek wedding has been the igniter. Greek family is developing and creates a nice little feel good emotion running through this one. Could have been a lot more push to it to make it matter more. Now it lands within a little humble entertainment with some laughs here and there.... and Greek harmonic in the background. And a twist of compulsive relations forced upon everyone and everything.Giving the story 16 years to mature and go forward gives the movie a little fresh touch. Just the fact that there's suddenly a 16 year old daughter involved in the story is one of the examples.Everything is Greek... and sometimes a 16 year old girl want to spread her wings and apply to a college a looooong way from home... As the mother says: "Why do you want to leave me?!"There is a lot of subtle, mellow and nice both comic situations and dialogues. "You know the Greeks invented Italy!" Another example: "This is called a mouse" "Why?" "Just...just put your hand on it...... aaand a little less on it..."A nice little, big, fat, Greek nostalgia trip. Happiness.... relations.... and, for me, even some tears in the end. Hit the magical spot in the hope in the old mans love for his lady. The whole movie is like a feel good emotion escalating more and more. A gentle breeze of humanity and a good friend to hold on to.Jim Denault (cinematography) and Gregory P. Keen (production design) has done a great work on matching the little slow paced Greek family living a ordinary life with just a little touch of grey and weak colours all around. Gives the feeling a push in the right direction for the experience of the motion picture.The warmth and vicinity in this movie is, I think, credited to Nia Vardolos. She also stars as Toula. If she were given more scripts to write, I think that she could with right team reach very far and make big screen pictures. There's a little something in her way to write that is fresh and charming. The story goes in and out of so many different topics and treats them with respect and at the same time with reflection. Homosexuality, religion, family matters, love of and for the youths... well made and well woven together.Attention. And more attention. That's what this movie should have gotten. It has just passed by, and the 6.3 at IMDb is a little low. I would probably push for 6.8. ....and again.... put Nia Vardolos to write more with a great team surrounding her. She probably deserves it.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Solid. Just trustworthy and enough. Thumbs up! - The actors : Excellent, to be frank. Splendid and most believable. - The story : Nice Greek touch to a little weird and normal family. Twists here and there within the Greek joy. - Entertainment : Everything is Greek! Every word comes from the Greeks! Some warm laughs. Cozy piece of a movie. - Age : Every age. 6.8 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment. 6 Nice production. Good movie.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Cute Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is like saying hello to family and friends that never go away literally. As they all live together. One house from another.Toula the main protagonist played by the creator, producer, and writer Nia Varadalos is now having a daughter of her own with her husband, Ian played by John Corbett now a HS principal. But her own marriage is strain due to trying to fix her family's problems that she also needs to focus on their daughter as well. As the recession hit hard and she has to work with her father in the Greek restaurant he has had for ages. And their only child, Paris played by Elena Kampouris is deciding to go to college and trying to get away from the large family that she is "forced" to be in.But when it is found and revealed Toula's parents, are really not married over a priest that did not sign it on the day of their wedding. On the day they thought they were married due to a war. As her mother, played with a plum by Lanie Kazan wants her husband of over fifty years. Michael Constatine to propose for her officially and the "right way."It will take Toula not just to get things fixed for her parents, but in her own marriage and with her only child gearing up for college.It is a very cute movie. No cursing, no sex, no violence. It is the movie for you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'My big fat Greek wedding 2' is everything a comedy sequel needs to be. It was really good, very funny and touching. Nia Vardalos and John Corbett use their chemistry to the best. Since i'm Greek and i know how a Greek family reacts to family problems of course they over reacted but they make it look so funny. Just see the last last scene, hahah. Anyway, in my opinion i believe that this one could get a third movie which may be the wedding of Toula's (Nia Vardalos) and Ian's (John Corbett) daughter. I believe that this could be a pretty good epilogue to 'My big fat Greek wedding'.My score is 8/10, and guys i know this is not an Oscar movie but it's a movie worth seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The same formula with a different recipe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sequels are usually disappointing. This second film was well worth watching. Something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue. I was hesitant to see this because the TV series was promising, but didn't deliver. Greek Wedding 2 is a little more "drama" than laughs. The bigger budget of this film allowed some exciting scenes not present in the first film. This is a 2016 "PC" Politically Correct film, that's wealthy Hollywood for you, they have to insert a political agenda into everything instead of letting things be natural, they have to spotlight progressive shifts. As far as I could tell The original cast was all there they showed there age and didn't try to hide it. There are some fresh new faces. New themes introduced to the film. There is an excellent romp that had me laughing for minutes. Not a lot of substance until the end of the film. Still it was a funny "mostly" family film, with a lot of laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nobody can say it doesn't do "what it says on the tin"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As somebody who married into another nation and culture (admittedly not Greek), I got quite a lot out of the pleasant and occasionally hilarious film "MBFGW1". Now here we are 14 years later, and many seem surprisingly ill-disposed to a follow-up that did pretty well from the outset in actually reassembling the original cast in full.Clearly those who appear feel at least some commitment to the concept, but a bigger question is - should we? In this film, Toula - as played by Nia Vardalos (the brains of the whole MBFGW enterprise) and Ian (a somewhat "idle" though as ever sympathetic John Corbett) largely take a back seat to their daughter played by Elena Kampouris, and most especially to Toula's parents Gus and Maria (as well-rendered by Michael Constantine and Lainie Kazan). The story regarding the teenager is as much about the pressures - for parents and offspring alike - of starting university (if with a Greek twist) as it is about all the Greek stuff - and no worse for that, given the universality of the emotions and issues familiar to many middle-aged adults.The parental story - of a certain amount of trouble in marital paradise (a Greek word, of course) is more intriguing, given that 89- and 76-year-olds Constantine and Kazan steal this show. Perhaps that is not hard given the somewhat lightweight content here, but it nevertheless looks like a fresh approach - and one made all the stronger by the return of the marvellous (69-year-old) Andrea Martin as Aunt Voula.Now let's face it, in that fraction of all films in which old(er) people get to do something significant at all, a large fraction of that fraction sees them mainly present in the context of frailty, isolation and separation. The latter is key, given that, where oldies do indeed prevail in a film, it is usually because we've got a group of old coots together (as in the excellent "Cocoon"). Perhaps there are moments of all three failings of old age here too, but much more on show in MBFGW2 is the ability of senior citizens to continue to hold sway in a family in a way that goes beyond lip-service. Their influence is real. Perhaps that is cliché Greek, as are so many aspects of this film (to perhaps an even greater extent than its predecessor), but it still looks like a new, fresh message - of course a warm one, as there is absolutely no harm in this film, but also one that reminds the watcher how, economic crises notwithstanding, the Greeks do have this impressively strong, specific and unique culture and identity. They do it their way - and that way is the one that really does ensure that an at-times moody prom-going teen daughter of the family with newfound boyfriend nevertheless eschews a hotel room, alcohol, drugs or whatever, in favour of a return with beau to attend a grandparents' wedding at which family young and old dance in large circles holding hands together without embarrassment and experiencing seemingly genuine happiness as a result.Maybe nothing very dramatic happens in this pleasantly fun film, but it is going way too far to say it is without content or message at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laughter and Love in Every Scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 is the long awaited sequel of the 2002 film My Big Fat Greek Wedding that generated rave reviews and numerous awards. Nevertheless, the sequel, well it hasn't been received well.You're not going to see any of that negativity here because I loved the movie. It made me laugh and it made me remember everything that made the first film good. One of the common comments I've seen about this film sum up to this "laughs that depend on the broad stereotypes and predictable plot points." That's unfair. Are stereotypes cool? No, not really, but they do exist. Any large cultured family is going to be like that, it's nothing bad, large families just tend to be loud because they all want to be heard at the same time. They tend to be close, that's how they were raised. Of course, there are the ones that really try to escape it, like Toula and her daughter, but they love their family, they can't abandon them, no matter how much they drive them crazy.And that's part of what made this film so good: its believability. You don't need to have a big family to believe this, but anyone can appreciate the closeness of the family, and that it highlighted in this film, especially when it juxtaposes Ian's (John Corbett) relationship with his parents to Toula's (Nia Vardalos) relationship with hers. And Nia Vardalos doesn't down play it. It's clear that it is ridiculous, even to her, that it drives her crazy and makes her pity her own daughter, but it's family, it's what she knows, it's where her heart lies. Moreover, there is the strain it puts on the relationship with her husband. Nothing about this film is easy, the relationships need to be worked at, they need devotion from each other, attention from one another, and that right there is the heart of the film.The film is not just about some crazy family and their crazy antics; it is also about their love and devotion. Toula's parents discover that their wedding certificate was never signed meaning they were never married. However, they have lost their spark, and for them too, it's about finding that spark, finding the appreciation from one another again to show why they should be married. The same goes for Toula and Ian's relationship. It's a film just about finding their way to one another.That was the beauty of the movie and why the laughs were warranted: because they were based on something familiar, something the viewer can relate to. Young Adults tend to feel like their families are suffocating, parents worry about their children, no matter how old they are, it's natural for people to pull away while someone tries to push closer. It's a give and take, and that is what this film captured.Sure, this film did recycle some of the jokes from the first film, but it didn't use them to the point of over kill. Nia brought back the jokes briefly, fitting them in with the new jokes, wrapping them into the script wonderfully for translation.There was love in this film, there was heart and this wasn't a sequel for sequel's sake, it was a movie the writer and cast wanted to make together, it was a point in their lives they wanted to revisit and the audience can feel that making this a good film to watch. The story is there, the connections are there, you don't have to look hard for it to appreciate everything it has to offer. (&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; | A)</fullReview>

They have Kids!!! Paris (Elena Kampouris) is probably my favorite female role. Angelo (Joey Fatone) is my favorite male role. In this Joey Fatone's Character has a big surprise that will shock you!!! I didn't even suspect it. I went with my parents and they thought the first one was better. In that regard I agree. But, is not the first one always better than the second? If you like laughs and family all in one, check it out! Trust me it is way worth it. I know one thing for sure, when it is out on Blu-Ray, I'm running to get myself a copy.(;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being Greek I'm a little biased over such a movie, but as we Greeks have it, the bias could easily be against this movie. Having seen all the recent big budget movies I owed my wife to watch that one too, despite the predictable story and jokes and the extensive trailer.Still I really found it marvelous. The story was different than what the trailer had made us think. Despite the deja-vus, there was a great amount of sincere laughs intertwined by tear-shedding moments that affected me more than any other movie I can remember. Greek families are well portrayed involving themselves with matters that their members would prefer to be private, but at the same moment show how much can be provided by a family's (of any nation) strong bonds. We can only have respect for the older protagonists Michael Constantine and Bess Meisler who have still the strength to participate, only to add to our joy to see the rest of the cast united again.Nia Vardalos made a good job writing it, treating with subtle way international values and actual reality, while releasing it in Spring gives a great motivation for the choice of a particular summer vacation destination...! And as traditional comedies have it since the ancient times and as the title suggests, this could only end with a great marriage's feast</fullReview>

I loved the concept of family and at the same time the love every single one of them had for each other. The advice that the aunt gave may have sound all about sex but she was right in so many ways. This is definitely a movie I will be adding to my collection. And the wait was definitely worth it. I recommend that people watch this movie. Especially if you like romantic comedies.

		<fullReview>It's been so long since I watched the original My Big Fat Greek Wedding that I barely remember it but this sequel I just watched with my movie theatre-working friend was very funny and touching to both of us. I mean, it's nice to see the Toula and Ian characters rekindling their romance with their now-17-year-old daughter now preparing to go to college. The revelation that Toula's parents may have lived in sin all that time seemed a contrivance to propel a story but it worked! Oh, and Andrea Martin is perhaps the funniest of the supporting characters like she was in the original but then maybe I'm biased because I remember liking her since the first time I saw her on the classic series "SCTV"! Anyway, that's a high recommendation for My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been 14 years since Nia Vardalo's warm comedy about her big Greek family became a blockbuster and this one I think, is mostly made for the fans of the first flick. There are many amusing moments and comic performances, but on the whole, this is an instantly forgettable experience. But despite a lot of negative reviews, I really liked this sequel and I enjoy it while I was watching it. It was very well done unlike a lot of sequels that can't hold up to the original, fun, emotional, nostalgic and... stereotypically sweet, especially for a Greek viewer like me. And just for your information, Greek weddings are not made anymore like this ones on Vardalo's movies. Ante gia mas!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having watched the DVD of the first movie several times, I was excited to take my wife to this one at the cinema, and we were *not* disappointed. Perhaps it is because Toula is a "fixer" and I've watched my wife and her mother try to take on the same role in their family - there is no peace in their lives because they are always trying to make sure everyone *else* is happy, and things fall apart anyway because the tighter you try to hold people close, the more they seem to slip away.Don't expect anything original; expect another chapter in a well-told story that will make you laugh, swoon, cringe, and maybe even cry. Expect to see people hitting middle age who suddenly realize that they are there and that life is changing, no matter how much you want to stop it. It's not the heights of comedy, the lunacy of farce, or the depths of tragedy. It's just fun.And when the whole theatre (and yourself) go "Awwwww...!" (you'll know when), you know everyone's following and enjoying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Universal Studios, Hollywood's Pre-Eminent House of Horror . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . pioneered the concept that any Fright Franchise is only as good as its potential for sequels with its FRANKENSTEIN Trilogy. That's one of the main reasons why we can all quiver in anticipation of MY BIG FAT QREEK WEDDING 3 (hopefully in 3D this time, to do justice to all the horizontal facial obelisks on display here). Not content to settle for the Bridezilla Attack of MBFGW1, TWO features BOTH a Bridezilla (or 2), with at least 3 Momzilla Creatures. Any good horror flick should leave you traipsing out of the Multiplex thankful for something. MBFGW2 does this even better than its predecessor did, if the party in front of me is any guide. One chick exclaimed, "Thank goodness, I'm not Greek!" as soon as she reached the concourse. Her dude responded, "Thank goodness I don't even KNOW anyone who's Greek!" Then the other gal in their party blurted, "I'm thanking my lucky rats that I've never even tasted Greek Yogurt!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ethnic families can be overbearing. We're the best, not like the rest. Stay away from those others. Then they marry each other. That happened in Barre, Vermont. Italians and Spanish despised each other and the Irish and the Norwegian others. Then the children went to school together, then married and had children with Italian-Spanish, Irish-Italian, Norwegian-Irish, Scots-Italian. One of those was "Crip" Polli who pitched for the Yankees in the 1930s, played cards with Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, and married a Scots woman, unheard of in those days.I had an Italian friend whose immigrant parents said he could not attend his prom unless he took his Italian cousin to her prom. They did not like each other and would have been happier with someone of their own choice. In fact, his sister married an Irish-American.My mother in Ireland in the 1910s would trade stories with her friend outside of church on Sunday about the antics of the old people. The young people had to go underground to do any dancing. The puritanical Catholic Church saw it as the Devil's work. The young people could not get enough of it. And if the Irish like music and talk, the people in Kerry are mad about dancing.Paris is like any young person who just needs allies in her perception of being stifled. The young always like the other, the fascinating different. Islam is an extreme example, in parts of it, of rejecting the outsider, of marrying within a specially chosen people. But God is universal, the Creator of all, and calls all of them good. You can find the same insularity within any group or religion. Sometimes you have to step away from your tribe. Having said that, the wedding ceremony in the Greek Orthodox Church was just right. All the ritual was geared toward being awake to being a conscientious human being.So we liked it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The return of the greeks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the long awaited sequel to the popular classic, Toula and the rest of the portakalous family are back and thus time around there is an even bigger wedding. One part of the story deals with Toula an Ian facing some struggles I their marriage while also raising their teen daughter Paris who is going off to college in hopes of getting away from her overbearing family, meanwhile Gus finds out that his marriage to Maria was never finalized due to the priest that married them in Greece never signing their marriage certificate. So the duo decide to get married again which leads to hilarious antics in the family, I will say while the sequel isn't new, but it does offer lots of laughs and leaves it open for a third film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will make this simple, is "MBFGW 2" on par with The Godfather? Of course not! Are you expecting it to be on par with The Godfather? I HOPE not! Do the Portokalos believe in family like the Corleone's do? You bet!! Like the Corleone family, the Portokalos are so flawed, but so endearing and devoted to each other you pine to be in their circle. In the sequel their charm picks up exactly where it left off. The plot really doesn't matter because whatever it is, this family will see it through in their own misguided, but loving way. Some of the familiar laughs are back...the Windex...Greek word origins...and some relatives are given more screen time than previously to ham it up. Is it as good as the original? Well, the original had the advantage of a no expectations sleeper. A little different this time around. Big bucks and big expectations. As they say "It is what it is." And what it is is a nice time out with the family. The critics tore it to pieces. They said it was lite, brainless fare...yeah...and??? Don't listen. Go see it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great sequel for fans of the first film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very excited to learn that they were making a sequel to the successful My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002). As someone who comes from a similar ethnic background, it was easy for me to relate to the trials and tribulations experienced by our protagonist, Toula, as she breaks away from the conventions of her Greek background and family expectations. This sequel finds Toula as the mother of a teenager who is experiencing her own struggles with her crazy Greek family. Toula finds herself torn between maintaining a healthy relationship with her husband Ian, a changing relationship with her fiercely independent daughter, taking care of her aging parents and other issues that arise with being part of a large family. I don't give away plot details in my reviews, but I will say that for a sequel, this movie delivered the same humor and heartfelt moments we felt in the first film, with the welcome additions of some new witty characters and guest appearances from Rita Wilson and the handsome John Stamos. I enjoyed the fact that, this time around, we received more screen time from characters like Theía Voula and Mama Yaya who really give the movie its tone. Quirky Theía Voula brings some great laughs and notable words of wisdom, while Mama Yaya shines as the matriarch of the Portokalos family. Replete with cheesy moments, family values, life lessons and barrels of laughs, My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 reunites the lovable members of Toula's family in a welcome sequel that will make you laugh, cry and wish you knew how to bake baklava.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a sweet sweet movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nia Vardalos took all the ingredients that made the first big fat Greek wedding such a joy, put a little bit more of this and little bit less of that, added a little extra, stirred and the end result is a sweet, funny and touching movie.Toula starts the second movie just like she started the first one - stuck. She is just stuck in a different place. And as she faces her daughter's imminent departure form the nest, her crazy family and the fact she doesn't seems to be able to find time for a date with her husband, she will yet again have to take her life into her own hands.The movie is about importance of family without ever being preachy. And you do laugh at the ridiculousness but from every word and look and hug it is clear that while the family is driving both Toula and Nia up the wall at times, they both love their families fiercely. And that is what makes this little movie so different from others. It is not meant as a joke about an overbearing family. It is a little exasperated love letter to them.And yet again, it works.</fullReview>

I also love love love how all the actors and actresses are the same from the 1st Big Fat Greek wedding!!! From the beginning to the end is just a joy. I have to be honest when I first saw the reviews for the movie I was disappointed because my family and I are such huge fans of the first My Big Fat Greek Wedding and then finally we said we don't care about the reviews we have to see it for ourselves! I am so glad we did!! It's the kind of movie you can just watch over and over again! This is the first time I ever reviewed a movie in my life because I really just needed to set the record straight, this is a great movie! 4 women ranging from the ages 13-71 and every one of us loved it!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gentle, funny, and quietly profound</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Toula has a happy but messy life. It's messy because she lives in close proximity to her extended Greek family, and there are currently two problems: her daughter, 17, is at the age where family embarrasses her (especially her grandfather, Toula's Dad, who regards it as important to hook up with a Greek boyfriend), and her father, in the course of trying to prove he is descended from Alexander the Great, discovers that his marriage was never formalised and, in trying to rectify this, he drives a wedge into his relationship with Toula's mother.I saw this simply because it was the only film I hadn't already seen at my multiplex. I'm glad I did. This gentle comedy makes a big thing of its Greek-ness, but the points it makes are universal. Letting go of your kids is one of them, and not letting years of familiarity make you take your partner for granted is another. The audience was not young ? neither am I - and there were heartfelt chuckles throughout this warm-hearted film as everyone recognised the humour and truth in problems we have faced, and still face.This is not a side-splitter, but I smiled all the way through and chuckled often as I recognised myself in most of it. The script is knowing and compassionate, and all the performances from the ensemble cast work. Well done Nia Vardalos for writing and the least performance ? I never caught the predecessor to this, but I'll definitely look it out now.</fullReview>

Everyone in the theater thoroughly enjoyed the movie.Though it is different than My Big Fat Greek Wedding it has the same wonderful Greek flavor and fun. It was really fun for me to see my family members portrayed up there on the big screen :) Who doesn't like to relive the fun times you've had with your family?No matter what ethnicity you are, I'm sure you too will find many characters that remind you of members of your family. Don't listen to these critics who have said it is not worth watching. They evidently have no sense of humor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Loved it. It was as funny and lighthearted as the first one. It's truly about being a family and caring for one another. It had some great funny scenes, lines and a lot of love. Even if you haven't seen the first one, you still can see the sequel without getting lost about what the movie is going to be about. I was happy to see the entire cast back plus a few new ones. Overall if you want to see a fun lighthearted movie this would be it. You don't have to be Greek to relate to this movie/ story. You can be from the middle east or Italy and will still understand it because that's what family really is to people from different cultural backgrounds. Family who will suffocate you with their love and who will always be in your business whether you have asked for it or not!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cloying glurge at its worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What did you like about the first My Big Fat Greek Wedding? The off beat characters? The wonderful sense of humor underlying it all? The story line - WASP boy meets Greek girl, love ensues? The funny supporting characters, like Windex-touting grandpa, headstrong Mom, wacky aunt? The family interaction that was quirky, at times dysfunctional, yet ever so believable and lovable?Forget all of that. Imagine Home Alone 2, or any other really bad sequel you have ever seen - the kind where we have to go over the top to try and make everything bigger, better, cuter and (gag) Greeker than the last time. Now you have this travesty - all 94 painful minutes of it.Everything is "bigger, better, newer, improved-er and funnier" than last time, you are supposed to believe. What really has happened here is a train-wreck of stilted acting, forced laughs, bearable tiny bits, a predictable and oh-so-awful plot designed to allow each of the original characters plenty of screen time to come back and prove they are still just as "ha ha" funny as last time - except, they're not.Grandpa still has the restaurant and his bottle of Windex. Rebellious WASP son in law (John Corbett) is now the principal at the high school he used to teach at. Nina Vardalos (who wrote this heaping helping of utter glurge) is still Toula, now as the overachieving, overcompensating "soccer mom" to the beautiful Elena Kampouris (daughter Paris - why so named - possibly because she was conceived there? Never explained...) who is a senior in high school.Take the old plot, add years to it and more obnoxious cutesy-wutesy Greekness along with several ridiculous subplots and there you have it - a giant opportunity to reprise roles that we wonderful but would have benefited more from being laid to rest permanently than from this schlocky piece of clap-trap. The personal highlight of the movie for me? When Ya-ya gets to speak - one whole line. The rest would have been better off going straight to DVD or cable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From comedic standpoint, MY BIG FAT Greek WEDDING 2 is not as strong and definitely as effective as the first film which gave Nia Vardalos her Oscar nomination for best original screenplay category. But this sequel does have enough family antics and lovey-dovey romance to keep the fans from wondering why they're not enjoying this as much as they had hoped.It's been 14 years since the first film and not much has changed in the Portokalos family except for the fact that Toula (Nia Vardalos) and Ian (John Corbett) now have a teenage daughter named Paris (Elena Kampouris) who's considering going to a college located far far away from her Greek family, and I don't blame her, I too came from a culture that's family-oriented, not that there's anything wrong with that, but it can get overwhelming for a young person who feels that the world is much bigger than just the neighborhood she grew up in. Meanwhile, Toula's parents find out that their marriage license was never signed, they were never legally married and that is why another big fat Greek wedding is in order.For the fans, it's nice to see the gang back together after all these years, familiar faces, familiar characters, the story does remind us why we loved the first film. There are cases out there in which the sequel may have arrived way too late, like "Sin City: A Dame To Kill For" but in this case, I think it makes sense that it took this long for MY BIG FAT Greek WEDDING 2 to arrive, because if they ever made the third installment, they could then focus it on Paris' wedding.Again as a comedy, MY BIG FAT Greek WEDDING 2 is rather weak, mainly because there's nothing fresh about it, no surprises, and many of the Greek-centric jokes fall flat, I'm sure Nia Vardalos tried to throw anything she could into the mix but there's only so much you can do until they get old. This whole overbearing family that somewhat breathes down your neck can work once or twice but it gets played out in MY BIG FAT Greek WEDDING 2, as if that's the only thing it's got going for them.I also feel the Paris going to college part of the story is much more interesting but since Nia has to juggle that with Toula's parents trying to get married aspect, so the whole relationship between Paris and her parents is only halfheartedly explored. Audiences will be divided over MY BIG FAT Greek WEDDING 2, some would wish they have their own Greek family that cares about them, some would be thankful they don't have such family, but all of them would agree that the first film was better by a mile. But you gotta give credit where credit's due, this franchise that Nia Vardalos created gave these Greek actors a platform to showcase their talent, otherwise you wouldn't see them much in anything else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alexander the Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st movie was far better and funnier than the 2nd one. I found it amusing that they constantly made references to Greeks being direct descendants of Alexander the Great, which is absurd in this day and age. Everyone knows that Greek was like the English language back in ancient times. Even the great Athenian orator Demosthenes attested that Philip II of Macedon, Alexander the Great's father, was not Greek. It is so funny to hear someone claiming direct blood heritage of ancient peoples. I do however think the movie makes a joke about this when Nia claims she wrote the ancestry letter to her father making him believe he was a direct descendant of Alexander the Great. Meaning anyone can write or rewrite history - something the Greeks have been known to do for centuries.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Ian and I are just looking for time to ourselves." Toula Portokalos (Nia Vardalos)My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 would be hard-pressed to outdo its original from 14 years ago (the highest grossing romantic comedy of all time), and it doesn't. Let's just say you'd be better off seeing the Indian Monsoon Wedding or American Wedding Crashers for more original wit. But Big 2 has a conceit of elderly parents having to wed again because of faulty paperwork 50 years ago that is original and at times amusing. Other moments of ethnic humor, when extended beyond the expiration date, are simply stereotypes and clichés.Director Kirk Jones and writer Nia Vardalos guide the action from Greek family tropes (Yes, they live close to each other; yes they nosy into each other's business; yes, they want to marry someone Greek, blah, blah, blah.) to any family 's challenges (yes they have a snotty teenage daughter, Paris, played by Elena Koumporis; yes, Toula played by Vardalos and Ian played by John Corbett, have not been romantic lately because of the family dramas; yes, Greek aunts , uncles, grandparents and everyone else are eccentric, fun loving, and full of mischief, etc.After you accept these clichés as part of a recycle, then you can enjoy some poignant moments of humor based on humanity's capability of being goofy no matter what your family lineage. Toula and Ian's struggle to accept gracefully Paris's wanting to go away from Chicago for college is real and underplayed although the bit runs too long like the Greek family's penchant to be collectively at every moment, no matter how personal.Other moments are either repetitions of previous comedic bits or plain corny. Grandpa Gus (Michael Constantine) is still claiming ad nauseam that all good things have Greek origins and that Windex cures all. Gus looks old enough to croak on a second honeymoon, and Lainie Kazan as grandma looks like she would crush him in that activity. Nevertheless, Vardalos brings a charm, emphasized by many medium to close up shots of her looking dazed and confused and unremittingly loving. She has given herself and her husband little to do other than that.But as this time of year yields few winners, I have to say My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 is minimally enjoyable enough to make you think a second marriage could be fun.</fullReview>
