		<shortDescription>overlooked gem shows what a modern war really is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to really adequately describe this movie. Let me try.For starters, in spite of the advertisements, it's not merely a remake of "Kelly's Heroes". Yes, we are in a postwar situation, where a bunch of Americans are trying to "recover" gold stolen by the enemy, but that's the end of the similarities."Three Kings" does an excellent job of showing just how gonzo modern warfare has become. You've got unemployed reservists going to the Middle East for kicks fighting Saddam, who uses gas attacks, electric shock torture and other atrocities to fight the rebels. Thrown in the mix are a U.S.-educated Iraqi whose businesses were destroyed by the Americans, a bunch of rebels and refugees living in bunkers, a CNN-type correspondent facing the threat of younger reporters, and Mark Wahlberg's character finding a cell phone in the Iraqi bunker and using it to call his wife in the U.S.The movie is extremely funny at times, graphically violent at times, but always on target. It provides a lot of insight into how non-Americans view the U.S. I cannot think of another major movie which showed people in a third-world country as modern people without patronizing. Even the soldiers shooting at our heros, gassing the refugees, and torturing Mark Wahlberg's character are shown as human beings.Somehow this movie got lost last year amongst all the hype for "American Beauty". "Three Kings" looks to have much more staying power. George Clooney continues to shine in yet another under-appreciated performance. For somebody with a Hollywood legacy, he really seems to have pushed some of the wrong buttons in Hollywood. I cannot think of any other explanation for why he has yet to achieve the acclaim his performances deserve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Russell steps up to the big leagues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1994 and then 1996, David O. Russell proved himself to be one of the few original voices in American comedy with his films SPANKING THE MONKEY and FLIRTING WITH DISASTER, respectively. He could have continued in that vein, but instead he seemed to be going mainstream with a studio film, starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, and Ice Cube, which seemed to be an action/adventure set in the Gulf War, at least if you only saw the trailer(which left me going "Huh?"). After seeing the film, it's clear to me that Russell is now one of the major talents to emerge from the 90's, as this is a masterpiece.As I mentioned before, the trailer was confusing, but while the movie is clear, Russell(who re-wrote a script by John Ridley, though there's a lot of contention over who exactly did what) makes clear from the beginning his intention to throw curves at us whenever he can, starting with Wahlberg asking as he draws his sights on an Iraqi soldier, "Are we still shooting at people?" He shoots the soldier anyway, and is immediately remorseful when he sees the soldier was holding a white flag. The movie goes from there to soldiers who, although in a celebratory mood, are still somewhat puzzled as to why they're there, a reporter(played well by the underused Nora Dunn) who can't help but talk in cliches, a tanker which, when shot, turns out to be holding milk, and Iraqi refugees who thought Americans were going to liberate them from Saddam Hussein and now are suffering because of it. It's this attitude which makes the otherwise normal-sounding plot - Clooney, Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and Spike Jonze play soldiers turned thieves who end up with a conscience - play as anything but normal-sounding.Another thing which helps is the photography(I forget the guy's name, but he also did THE USUAL SUSPECTS). Far from the clear-looking photography we got in the telecasts, this is rough, dangerous, and, just like the plot, constantly putting us off our guard.Finally, the performances. Clooney I think has long been underappreciated not, as most people assume, because he's a sex symbol, but because he, like Harrison Ford and others of his type, make it look easy. There's nothing easy about his character here, and Clooney doesn't take the easy way out here. He doesn't coast on his charm and try to make the character likeable, but goes through the journey his character does, and even without a lot of dialogue(at the end, his face when he signals to Wahlberg and Ice Cube says all we need to know, as does their nods back). Wahlberg is fast becoming one of our better actors, and this proves it. He even finds comic potential where you wouldn't expect any. Ice Cube has had a mixed career since BOYZ IN THE HOOD, but this ranks up with that performance. Finally, Jonze has been criticized for playing a hillbilly stereotype, but the key is how he's more like a lapdog hungry for affection rather than just plain white trash, and he plays it as such. This is the best film I've seen so far this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film for anyone who ever relishes the triumphal note of western war films, who gets carried away by the moral high of being on the winning side. For those who saw the good in the Gulf War, saw how many people America helped and was proud to live in the Western world.Three Kings is an anti-war film. Its opening scenes are not the declaration of war, but soldiers celebrating its end. Then coming to grips with its consequences.Of course, Saddam Hussein is depicted in the customary role of the villain, but then so is George Bush whose abandonment of the Iraqi people he had called to rise against Saddam is illustrated with examples of human suffering - emotional as well as physical.Don't get the idea that this is a bleak and 'worthy' film, in many ways it is, but it does it with such style and black humour - that forces you to laugh even while being disgusted or perturbed - that it is eminently watchable. But still edgy, I was pleased to see one couple walk out (though they might just have gone to the toilet, who knows, I was absorbed by the film and didn't pay enough attention).Director, David O Russell, ensures that the film never gets carried away with action scenes - bullets have consequences (good and bad) even when fired by an all-American soldier. There is some stunning cinematography. Particularly shocking to me was when Iraqi soldiers fire at a tanker. Nothing's more shocking than the unexpected and dramatically understated (I didn't see the trailer, though I believe that scene was actually in it).There are some interesting cinematic devices in the film. The next time that sepsis comes into conversation I'm sure anyone who has seen the film will call to mind scenes of a bullet travelling through the body. I've seen less violent films than some people, but have been swept away by their power many times - become blasé about bullets and cinematic death. I've seen it all too often before to care about nameless victims that stand in the way of the power, wit, and understanding of the hard-bitten, long-serving soldier, wielding a justice in the shape of a gun.Russell claimed to make every bullet count in the film, and in one memorably calm scene of confusion and crossfire, he certainly does. The style of the film however doesn't detract from its content. Three Kings doesn't have pretensions of addressing difficult issues by showing the manly, serious face of George Clooney looking a little concerned after killing a few dozen of the enemy. It has intelligent dialogue and moving scenes of confrontation between the opposing ideologies of the Americans and their 'allies' and 'enemies' alike.Not the best date movie in the world. Funny, shocking, thought provoking and honest, 8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the freshest and most subversive Hollywood movies in years! A modern classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I spend most of my time bitching at just how mindless and cliched most movies released by Hollywood are, so it's always a pleasant surprise when a 'Pulp Fiction' or a 'Boogie Nights' or an 'American Beauty' gets released and makes me eat my words. 'Three Kings' deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as those very fine movies, but what a left field surprise this one was! As much as I enjoyed David O. Russell's previous movies 'Spanking The Monkey' and 'Flirting With Disaster', I never would have expected him to be capable of making a movie as fresh and original as this! Easily overlooked, it very cleverly manages to work simultaneously as an action/adventure, and a comedy, and a wonderfully subversive lesson in recent political history. Who would have thought? The other surprise is just how fine the motley cast is. TV heart throb Clooney, rappers turned actors Wahlberg and Ice Cube, and video director Jonze. All are much better than anyone would have the right to expect, and are supported by some strong performances from the likes of Cliff Curtis ('Once Were Warriors'), Nora Dunn ('The Last Supper'), Jamie Kennedy ('Scream') and especially Said Taghmaoui ('La Haine'), the latter in a role that should have made him an international star. 'Three Kings' is in my opinion a modern classic and one of the very best movies of the last ten years. I can't recommend this one highly enough!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the Best of 1999</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the exception of 'Magnolia'and 'The Green Mile', I don't believe that there was a movie as great as 'Three Kings' last year. It was a brilliant look at the Gulf War and stretched beyond the boundaries of all war movies before it. David O. Russell did an excellent job writing and directing this movie and George Clooney gave one of the best performances of the year. Mark Wahlberg proved that his work can go beyond that of Dirk Diggler. Spike Jonze was hilarious as Wahlberg's lacky. Watching the movie is a memorable experience. It's way out there with it's comedic sense of timing, awesome action sequences, and morals to match. It dealt with the political issues of the Gulf War which was seen as a pretty harmless war from an American's standpoint. Russell showed us the plight of the freedom fighters in Iraq and told a very serious story, but did it with a sense of humor that was neither tasteless nor melodramatic. Russell kept an even tone throughout the entire movie and perfectly blended the action,black comedy,and war genres into what was one of the year's best. An entertaining movie that never ceases to amaze me. I still am trying to figure out why it didn't get nominated for any Oscars. I hope that one day people will see this move for what it is...a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful war movie, if that's possible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit first I was born without the gene that understands why countries go to war. I don't understand who is fighting, why they are, the whole concept is a mystery to me. On a moral level its extremely offensive and completely unpleasant for all involved. So by extension its hard to watch a war movie because I go in already confused.But I know a good movie when I see one, and this is a very good movie in many ways. This movie has a heart, some fantastic acting and something worthwhile to say. It was not hard to watch or understand, especially since, like I said, I don't always get it. But I will be watching this one again. At times it felt like a documentary. All the acting is so natural, no one makes a false move and you can't say that about most movies.And I also didn't know Infiniti made a convertible!8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not really a masterpiece, but very original and fun to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is one thing you can't accuse the makers of this movie of, than it must be that they weren't original. I don't think I've ever seen a 'war movie' that is sometimes shocking, but also funny, one that criticizes the politicians for what they did during the war, but also offers a big adventure at the same time...The story goes like this: A few days after the first Gulf War has ended, a group of American soldiers come across a secret Iraqi map. This map reveals where the bunker can be found in which the Iraqi's have stored the gold and the treasure that they had stolen from Kuwait. But they aren't thinking of giving it back to the Kuwaiti's. They want to keep it for themselves and get as rich as kings and so they go on a trip full of adventure. Even though they are very egoistic at first, they aren't blind for what is happening around them. They soon learn that the Iraqi's have been encouraged by the U.S. government to rebel against the regime and fight Sadam Hussein. But the U.S. military refuses to help them with their uprising, which means that the rebels are facing certain death. What should they do? Take the money and run, not caring about the fate of the civilians or helping them across the border into Iran and risking to loose all their wealth...Calling this a war movie isn't exactly right. It's true that its story is told during the first Gulf war, but the war isn't the most important thing in this movie. Personally I think you better call this an adventure movie, because that's what it really is. They go on an adventure to find a lot of gold.The acting and the story in this movie are really good and more than just worth a watch. It's an original movie that blends drama, comedy, politics and war together into a fine mixture, but I wouldn't call it a masterpiece. Nevertheless this is a good movie that is certainly worth a watch. I give it a 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Was Surprised</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I avoided this film for some time because I have a strong dislike of war films, particularly relatively recent wars. Too bad for me. I finally rented it because of the impressive works I've seen by Mr. Russell. This is not a war film, even though it takes place during a war, and in a war zone. This is a film of humanity. Like many other films that I find excellent, this film deals with the human condition on many levels. There's pathos, humor, love, violence, ad infinitum. You'd get a sterilized version of what this film shows on the evening news. It shows that our soldiers, just as ourselves, are human, with all our frailities. And, I believe, it gives an honest account of what life is like for the people of the Middle East.Fine acting by truly fine actors, great cinematography, and a very intelligent script make this a must see film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine movie set in the aftermath of the 1991 "Gulf War".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember the 1991 Gulf War well, and in fact visited the area in late 1991. After looking at the "extras" on the DVD version of Three Kings, you realize how accurate the movie is, having used USA veterans as consultants, and some of the extras were actually Guld War refugees. I rate it "8" of "10".The movie is action-packed and well-acted. The only thing that threw me off a bit was the sometimes strange mixture of humor and tragedy - people graphically getting killed in one scene, and characters being in humorous situations the next. Still, it is an entertaining movie overall, and gives a great glimpse of what the Gulf War was all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly anti-war for a mainstream American film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the aftermath of Desert Storm a group of soldiers find a secret map showing a bunker containing Kuwaiti gold. When they begin to go for the gold they find little resistance from an Iraqi army more concerned with killing civilians than protecting gold. The uprising had started when the US army had encouraged civilians to rebel but now will not support them.When I first saw the trailer for this I knew nothing about it ? from the way it was marketed I had assumed it was going to be a modern day `Kelly's Heroes' with bright comedy and good action scenes. On first viewing I was disappointed but interested. On second viewing I now see what this film was about and how badly marketed it had been. The plot is no comedy but is really an extreme anti-war film that condemns America's approach to the Gulf War.When our characters go after the goal they go in a gung-ho manner, seeking only riches and not interested in the plight of the people. This is how America went in ? not to protect the people but because of the impact the invasion was having on oil prices and reserves. The anti-war message is also hammered home in the gross close-up shots of how a bullet damages a body.It's only in the final half hour that the film goes a little wrong ? looking for an ending that isn't depressing in a subject that really can't have a `happy' ending and please American audiences. It has other weaknesses ? some of the scenes are off subject , meaningless or just don't work. However for the majority this is a surprisingly good film that makes points that aren't seen in Hollywood films (and if this whole flag waving thing continues much longer, we won't see a counter opinion for quite a while).The cast are good and deserve praise for choosing this film. Clooney and Wahlberg both add a large box office draw while for Jonze this made up a great summer of exposure. Ice Cube again shows that not all rappers have to do rubbish hip hop comedies to get into movies.Overall this was betrayed by it's own marketing department and many people may not have liked it for that reason. However this is an intelligent anti-war film that has flaws but should be given respect for it's honesty and bravery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Art of trailer misdirection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just watched this film two years after umming and arring about going to see it at the flicks when it was released. Two years ago I stayed in with a pizza thinking that George Clooney looking gritty with a load of gold wouldn't be up to much. Then friends started to talk about it quite positively without really saying much about the content. Then I saw it in a buy 2 get 1 free sale at HMV, and now I know that I needn't have to gone through all the bother of digesting a pizza.I should also add that I'm seeing this after 11/9/2001 and that even with the new perspective world events have cast over films with themes involving the US and the middle East, this film stands up very well. A positive portrayal of Islam, a positive portrayal of the people of Iraq, a sort-of-positive portrayal of the US army abroad, hell even a sympathetic portrayal of a lapdog of Saddam (I'm kind of reminded of Happiness for the sheer taboo-bustingness of this portrayal).The plot is easy on the mind, the acting is satisfactory, the ending is purest Hollywood and the cinematography is sub-Lawrence of Arabia despite having access to a perfectly adequate desert. What makes this movie stand out is how at ease it is with its subject matter; letting comedy mix with the sort of serious politics that make a lot of people pick their words with great care.The misleading trailer for this film fits in perfectly with what it's trying to achieve. Pretending to a be a gung-ho, guns and gold, go gettum boys film, it gets those into the cinema who need to hear its message not just those who want to hear. It attempts to slip complex issues through just about all the unthinking jingoism that lingers outside movie theatres on a regular basis and for that I salute it.Go see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seriously lame remake of Kelley's Heroes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SpoilersThis was a sorry, misguided remake of the much more enjoyable Kelley's Heroes, one of my favorite war movies ever. At least the slow-motion bullet penetration scenes were interesting. I'll spare you the dramatic shortcomings covered by other people and go straight to the glaring technical flaws. These alone put it up there on my "worst of" list. I'm one of those people who simply can't enjoy a movie if the technical flaws make it technically impossible, like astronauts traveling to the Sun by night so they don't burn up. There has to be a grain of probability or at least possibility to it before I can suspend disbelief. I'm a cynic. Sue me. Here are some of the technical flaws. 1. The soldiers drank absolutely no beer at all in Desert Storm, except on ships in international waters. But the Arabs didn't allow it EVER on their land, not even in a US Army barracks filled with soldiers protecting their country. Scratch drinking from the celebration scene. 2. There were no shouts of joy when Iraq lost the war. The soldiers were still there to clean up long after the war ended. Nobody celebrated. Everyone was just confused at not striking Baghdad, and angry because they still couldn't come home yet. Scratch the remainder of the celebration scene. 3. Nobody EVER wandered out of the camps without a Humvee. It's the desert. You would die. You don't just walk around outside the camp. Scratch the Lone Iraqi Screaming in the Desert scene. 4. If you somehow did wander out, and there was an armed Iraqi soldier screaming and waving, you wouldn't ask around to see if you should shoot him. You would just shoot. He is the enemy. Scratch the disillusionment. 5. An Iraqi soldier at the time would NEVER tell an American soldier where he was allowed to go, under any circumstances. They were a broken enemy. We owned them. There were only three things an Iraqi would say to an American soldier: a. Yes, sir. b. No, sir. c. Three bags full, sir. If the Americans wanted to go to village X, any surviving Iraqi soldier would just shut up and humbly get out of the way. In the real world, an Iraqi tank crew would surrender to one American soldier in a jeep with a flat tire. They simply had no fight left in them after the war. Scratch the defiant Iraqi soldier scene at the village. 6. The Iraqis had precious little left to fight with after the war (especially near the front lines). Anything they did have was well hidden to avoid getting bombed. They would not have used any weapons until after the bulk of the Coalition forces left the area. Scratch the fight/chase scene. 7. All American soldiers had their belongings inspected thoroughly before leaving Iraq. You could not get out of Iraq with a duffel bag full of gold. It wasn't even worth trying. An intelligent commander would have never tried this. Scratch the original plan for getting the gold back to America. 8. Did Saddam Hussein even have any gold? Most countries keep their gold in the Federal Reserve vault in New York. And the terrorists who don't use gold just counterfeit up a few million in American $100 bills. At least they used to before we redesigned them. This was the case in 1991. Saddam Hussein was after oil, not gold. Scratch the whole movie.If you get the DVD, you will see the making of Three Kings in the special features menu. They hired some Lieutenant Colonel as a technical expert to make sure the movie was 100% accurate. It's a good thing they hired that guy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Absolute Mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when THREE KINGS was released in Britain it got a lot of great reviews from the press and remember one of these reviews described it as " The best war movie since APOCALYPSE NOW " Well after watching THREE KINGS I`ve got to ask if this newspaper film critic has actually seen APOCALYPSE NOW ? She might have seen THREE KINGS but in no way is it " The best war movie since APOCALYPSE NOW " . How can it ? It`s not even a war movie.A caper movie is what THREE KINGS is , and a pretty poor one at that . In fact it`s a bit of a misnomer to describe it as a caper movie anymore than it`s a war movie and that`s the problem because one minute it`s trying to be a cynical comedy , then it`s a farce , then it`s an action adventure , then it`s back to cynical comedy. I kid you not , the only genres not represented are hardcore porn and the musical . And the most offensive thing is that this film even tries to have serious discussions on war in general and the 1991 Gulf war in particular. Oh and Michael Jackson is also discussed , yup nothing like bringing MJ into a serious discussion on the horrors of war.So if this film is so bad ( Make no mistake it is bad ) why did it get so many good reviews . Well I do remember that the woman who described it as " The best war movie since .... " was a woman , and most of the reviewers who liked it were women and I`m making a very good educated guess when I say George Clooney might have had something to do with their opinions of THREE KINGS . Being a hetrosexual male I judge an actor on their ability and range , not on their looks and I`m afraid Clooney is an actor without much talent , the character he plays in THREE KINGS is basically the same one he plays in FROM DUSK TILL DAWN and OCEAN`S 11 . He also shoots some bad guys just like he did in THE PEACEMAKER and he gets to do some emergency surgery like in ER . Sorry to break your hearts girls but there`s three certainties in life: Death , taxes , and George Clooney never ever winning an Oscar .Maybe someone will do a remake called THREE BIMBOS in which Salma Hayek runs around the Afghan mountains looking for some gold hidden by the taliban wearing nothing except a tight skimpy bikini ? I can imagine the reviews now with every hetrosexual male film reviewer saying " This is the best war film since APOCALYPSE NOW . - No strike that . THREE BIMBOS is the best film I have ever seen "</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Say what you will about the director, or Mark Walhberg's acting, this is a really good movie. The bleach bypass process they used in the film gives it an instantly unique looks and sets it apart from other 'Hollywood' movies.The film handles both drama and comedy really well and never confuses the two, the style of the film is what makes the film so interesting. It is incredible funny at times, and of course violent when needs to be. Russell is a good director and this is his best film, to date.The bullet traveling through the body sequence holds the viewer in awe and the way Russell decides to depict the action sequences in some scenes. Specifically when they first leave with the gold, the shoot out is not your average shootout. It's instead played up with simple camera movement and audio. You see the shooter, pan over to the victim, and you hear the sound of the bullet hitting them. No flash or over the top styles, simple and effective.Clooney gets billed as a movie star and sex symbol, but rarely gets praise for his acting ability. Here he shows what he can do, along side Wahlberg, who usually annoys, and Ice Cube, who usually bores. Spike Jonze makes an appearance as the fourth tag along as well.Watch this film, it's one of the best of the recent years. It was what Jughead wanted to be before Jughead was even around. This film is technically pleasing with both a message and entertainment value. don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three Kings is an American film directed by David O Russell who is neither a Hollywood big shot director nor an iconoclast of American independent cinema.The best thing about him that can be said is that he has his own style of film-making as evident in comic films like "Spanking the Monkey" and "Flirting with disaster".Three Kings is a light hearted attempt by David O Russell to fathom the complexities of a war and the humane issues involved to it."Three Kings" appeals to viewers as it has elements of both comedy films as well as drama films.The comic scenes reflect American sense of humor whereas dramatic scene are likely to have universal appeal.Three Kings is also a multifaceted film which talks of various things which make sense to us in our daily lives such as alien culture,greed,media and war.The key focus is on the lives of soldiers of all kinds who have to perform all kinds of tasks including some bad,mean and wicked tasks.It is because of this that there are umpteen moments of pleasant surprises in this film.If somebody wants to remember "Three Kings" then it can be said that it is one of the best films which reveal a lot about the mental and emotional buildup of army men albeit in a comic fashion.David O Russell has made a truly enjoyable film with hardly any moment of boredom.PS: any similarity to "Kelly's Heroes" must surely be construed as a pure coincidence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thought-provoking war movie, an exciting action film, a hysterically funny comedy, and a moving drama... what more could you ask from Hollywood?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Regardless of any backlash you may have heard, this film is a flat-out masterpiece. It's blend of action, comedy, and drama is perfect enough that any moviegoer can find ultimate satisfaction with it. The story is fun, the dialogue is hilarious, and the situations range from hilarious to shockingly emotional and intense. In fact, the film is something like watching humor and seriousness fight it out. By the end, you're exhausted.The film's plot begins once the Persian Gulf War is over. Soldiers are celebrating, and a peace treaty between the U.S. and Iraq has been signed. Everything's cool. The morning after the celebration, three of the soldiers, Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg), Conrad Vig (Spike Jonze), and Chief Elgin (Ice Cube) come across a map in an Iraqi POW's ass. It is a map to millions of dollars worth of Kuwaiti gold, stolen by Saddam. The soldiers, not entire;y satisfied by the lack of action in the war, decide to steal the gold to make the time served worthwhile. A greedy special forces officer, Archie Gates (George Clooney) steps in, declaring himself the leader, and off they go. Shortly after they find the gold however, things quickly go wrong. Saddam's soldiers begin slaughtering Iraqi civilians, whom Bush had advised to rise up against Saddam. Putting humanity before greed, the men decide to help the civilians...The plot moves at a fast pace, and every scene is entertaining. The dialogue is a joy to listen to, and is chock full of hilarious lines and witty insight. The comedy ranges from clever, and/or silly one-liners, and some of the most surreal situations ever filmed. A cow steps on a hidden bomb, and blows up. Mark Wahlberg's character contacts his wife while briefly imprisoned in a bunker that is stocked full of cordless phones. And don't even get me started on the ambitious reporter Adriana Cruz (Nora Dunn) and her dimwitted escort (Jamie Kennedy)... Moments like these come frequently, always hitting their comedic mark- and after the first half hour, are usually followed by stuff like a woman being shot in the head in front of her young daughter, and a torture scene that ironically brings much humanity to the Iraqi soldiers. The scenes often cancel each other out. Comedic scenes usually end in, or involve something serious, and much of the serious stuff involves, or ends in something funny ("what is the deal with Michael Jackson?). And yes, the film is quite violent, and though not nearly as gory as war films such as Black Hawk Down, and Saving Private Ryan, there are still plenty of scenes that may churn the stomachs of squeamish viewers (the demonstration of how a bullet effects the body from the inside made me kind of nauseous).The performances are also great, and with a cast like this, I'm surprised that the movie doesn't have nearly as much recognition as it deserves. George Clooney is perfect as Archie Gates. He is sarcastic, greedy, and often rude, yet you take him seriously when his more selfless side emerges. Mark Wahlberg is funny in a strangely emotional way, as Troy Barlow. Spike Jonze is flat-out hysterical as the annoyingly lovable, poorly educated redneck, Conrad Vig. And Ice Cube, who is a great actor when given the right roles (Boyz N the Hood), is great, though he is given a bit less to do than his co-stars. After the hilarious first half-hour, his role rarely requires too much "acting".The film is shot in a style that gives it a realistic look, and leaves you in need of air conditioning. The color appears to be on the maximum brightness level, and everything seems to have a reflection, even if all it reflects is bright light. The look gives the film a gritty and downbeat tone, which in a way makes the film even funnier, as the absurd humor almost comes as unexpected in such a real, and harsh looking film. Don't sit too close to a TV when watching this.The film is a masterpiece, one of the greatest films ever made in my eyes. It provides more sheer entertainment and pleasure than half the movies made these days. Watch it as the entertaining action-comedy-drama that it is, and don't worry too much about the political content, which is irrelevant compared to the fun. Three Kings is on of the most exhilarating, downright brilliant movies I've ever seen, and I give it my full recommendation of 10/10.Three Kings is rated R for Graphic War Violence, Language, and Brief Sexuality.Sex- 5/10 Violence- 9/10 Swearing- 10/10 Drugs- 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First Great Post-Viet Nam War Movie About Post-Viet Nam Wars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Three Kings" is not only a post-Vietnam War movie about a post-Vietnam war but it's post-movies about the Vietnam War, where we already expect that the GIs are lost in the internal politics of the land they "save" and their biases and perceptions are not only useless but dangerous as well. It reminded me of the Thomas J. Friedman's insight in "From Beirut to Jerusalem "where he said the GIs in Beirut were like "Betty Crocker in hell." George Clooney again plays Bogey much as he did in "Out of Sight." Once again he has to make the crucial decision of personal benefit vs. altruism with the plot building in a complicated but inexorably convincing way for us to see how he got to that crossroads and why he makes his choice.Ice Cube and Mark Wahlberg were also surprisingly good (including a opening shot of Marky Mark that refers to his previous career). The cinematography is intrinsic to the story, blinding us with the desert sun and the claustrophobia of bunkers.This is certainly a thinking person's action movie. My 15 year old son and his friends got around the "R" restriction by having one of the kids use a credit card to buy the tickets from a machine. This is one of those times where I don't mind him watching the violence because the violence was subservient to important themes and moral conflicts, particularly as all the violence had specific physical consequences.(originally written 10/18/1999)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take it from a prior US Intel Soldier: This movie will blow away your perceptions of the Gulf War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Minor spoilers ahead . . .While the overall plot is fiction, the background story is absolute fact. The US government abandoned the Iraqi resistance fighters. In fact, the death toll in Karbala alone (the place where the Iraqis are rescued from in the movie) is estimated to be over 20,000! Those were people -- soldiers, men, women, children and the elderly who were all slaughtered when they did as George Bush advised and "rose up against Saddam."Michael Moore, of Roger &amp; Me, TV Nation and Awful Truth fame, commented that this was the best film of the year, certainly the best film about the Gulf War so far, and that he was amazed that it ever got made.For those who dislike this film, do you realize how much it took to bring this story to light? Just the fact that it was made makes it one of the most heroic movies created in the past decade, perhaps in the entire history of film. US citizens were spoon fed media reports -- just as the film shows. The collusion between the media and the US government was absolutely frightful. And the story of what the US is doing to Iraq continues to this day. The economic sanctions are doing to the Iraqi people what the so-called cease fire did to the citizens of Karbala -- they give all the power to Saddam while weakening the very people we want to overthrow him!This film is chock full of stupendous metaphors. The oil being poured down Troy's throat just sank the point home. We weren't there for human rights, the preservation of democracy or to overthrow Saddam. And that's just one example.This film should be viewed by every American citizen. As a prior US Army Intelligence Analyst, I salute everyone involved in this film for having the courage to present the truth. Now it's up to us -- the viewers -- to do something about what we've known all along about the Gulf War and the sanctions against Iraqi civilians. If this movie doesn't make you care, then I don't know what will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rather kinky movie, with a great message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had this movie lying around in my basement, and since i'm such a film fanatic i watched it and was absolutely amazed with the many existing issues of our current government that it addressed, set directly after the cease fire agreement between Allied forces and Iraqi troops during the gulf war, many stolen goods are scattered all throughout Kuwait including some valuable Kuwaiti gold. So, in the spirit of simple minded greed, these four troops set out to retrieve the gold and reside in the "wealth" attached to it. However when they come in contact with the one of the many civilian towns left to Saddam's control that are falling into a wave genocide by the hands of his troops; The four decide to do whats morally right and save these innocent people from this clench of oppression. I was blown away by this powerful commentary upon the imperialistic and selfish nature of our own government, that in these many chronological foreign conflicts, we simply always are trying to secure the "boundaries" and the major "economic entities" but that we have never tried to take a closer look at the people and the innocence in these boundaries, the innocence thats interwoven with the actual evil forces in the country. Really this movie is a great commentary and somewhat a satire upon the rather repetitive actions taken by our government that are always general and never focused to what the naive perception would be which is to save lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My New Number 3 fave movie (may be Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those strange films. Try describing it and you are like "Well.. it's about the gulf war and they try to find some gold but people get shot and gassed and so they rescue them" "Oh.. right, so it's a war/action film?" "well... more of a war/action/satire/comedy/thought provoking/heist/adventure movie" "Huh? Sod that, Let's watch the Terminator"I think the reason a lot of people resist watching this is because this movie is a contridiction in terms. War - Satire, Thought Provoking - Action, Comedy - War. Very Confusing. But once people watch the movie.... they are like "DUDE!!! Let's watch that again!! (My mum did at least.... ;)The Gulf War - War of the media, War on oil prices, War on Saddam, Whatever it was, it was a war unlike any other. "What did we do here, Tell me what we did here!" as Archie Gates puts it.To begin with the film begins like any other war/action adventure movie. You have the Dumb guy Conrad Vig (Spike Jonze) The Black religious guy Chief (Ice Cube) The Simple decent hearted family guy Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg) and the selfish disillusioned Leader Archie Gates (George Clooney). As well as the other obligatory characters - the bull headed Army leaders, the determined pushy reporter, the dependant adoring wife. Cliche!But so what if it is a cliche? You soon come to realise that that is how they start out but come the end... everyone of them is changed due to circumstance... maybe they are that way to begin with due to circumstance. Orphaned Conrad, no high school, no job. Chief, Years of racial abuse and dead end jobs. Troy, school sweetheart, working a dead end job just to get by, heck, he only joined the reserves to make money and never dreamed this is where he would end up. The same with Chief... to make money. For Conrad it was a chance to escape his life... and to shoot some people. Archie... Years in special forces... Very cynical and determined. And heck, he's retiring anyway.So when they find a map and off they go ("we three kings be stealing the gold.."). So what is the most important thing in the world? Love? Respect? Gods Will? Or even Necessity? Or is it life itself, survival, living, dignity and safety? is it material possesions? the gold, the convertable, the computers, the blenders, jeans or jewellery. Or is it being free. To live in a democracy, free from Saddam and his army. To go somewhere where there are no soldiers, where business can take place, where children can play. Liberties most of us take for granted.During the course of this movie, Necessity changes. But it doesn't change for them all at the same time, as one might expect.... there is no defining moment. Even when a woman is shot Troy still doesn't want to get involved Troy - What Happened to Necessity?! Archie - It just changedNecessity for Archie changes at the moment she is shot. He feels he can achieve both... "No bullets, we know what bullets do don't we Conrad?" however, at the end of the most amazing shooting sequence, unlike anything I have ever seen before, they are all scarred by war, all have killed. But has Necessity changed? not for all of them. Conrad - "You had a choice out there and now we've lost Troy" Archie - "I had No Choice" Conrad - "You had a Choice!" Archie - "I had no Choice"But in the end necessity is the same for everyone. The basic human instinct, Survival. This film takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotions. Laughing one second "What is wrong with michael Jackson" and shocked the next when he describes how is child was killed and his wife lost her legs. then laughing then crying then laughing.... this movie is a serious clusterf**k in the greatest possible way. A mash of everything thrown in for everyone and yet for no one in particular. Such is the nature of war. 5 Stars. Genius.</fullReview>

The whole film is far too contrasty without producing the desired desert-heat effect. Not to mention the content. The film advertises itself as a comedy (especially with it starring George Clooney) and tries to be funny but at the same time deals with subjects far too serious to be made light of. It comes off as making fun of the innocent deaths. He combines realism with fantasy in the flashbacks and close ups of wounds. This movie just doesn't work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four Jacks Off Iraq</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Absurdly comic, highly kinetic, at times shockingly emotional, 'Three Kings' begins when the Gulf War is over. Amid the partying and confusion, four American soldiers (George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and Spike Jonze), determined to take home more than sand fleas, go off into the Iraqi desert to find millions in stolen Kuwaiti bullion. They are plunged into the heart of a democratic uprising that spins the day and their lives out of control. David O. Russell's unique tapestry of humor, violence and history" is noted by critics, on the DVD sleeve, as one of the best films of the year."Three Kings" starts out by being satirically funny; but, it eases away from the comedy genre during the running. Director Russell smoothly orchestrates it into a film of unexpected depth. The prize starts out as a stash of gold bullion (backed by oil), but ends up focusing on the greater worth of human lives. From the generation of "MTV", "kinetic", and/or "hand-held camera" short film crowd, Russell is one of the few able to translate that energy into a full-length feature film with substance and sustenance. The surreal sequence, beginning with the shooting of the Iraqi mother, recalls Sergei Eisenstein's "Potemkin" (1925).Contrary to the title, which is taken from the Christmas carol, the film focuses on four American soldiers - handsome "E.R." star George Clooney (as Archie Gates), "Good Vibrations" hunk and underwear model Mark Wahlberg (as Troy Barlow), ex-"N.W.A" and "It Was a Good Day" rapper Ice Cube (as Chief Elgin), and "MTV" video director Spike Jonze (as Conrad Vig). The quartet, supporting cast, and crew can count this film as a career high. Hopefully, Russell will work on films more regularly in the future, with photographer Newton Thomas Sigel and editor Robert K. Lambert, if possible; they are an exemplary team.********* Three Kings (9/27/99) David O. Russell ~ George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, Spike Jonze</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three Kings: 7.5/10The trailers made this 1999 look like one of those "Americana 4 ever, Arabs suck!" type propaganda movies, but it was actually a lot more. The cast seemed a bit so/so, but this was actually a really good movie. Set in Iraq after the Gulf War, a band of men go looking for hidden gold in some bunkers. Naturally, it's not that easy, and so the gunfire, hostilities, civilian connection, and so on, begins. Clooney is really good as the hard-up leader of the squad, and the movie tells a story and isn't the clutter that so many of these sorts are. The ending is very good too, without giving anything away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Throwback Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[Warning: May Contain Spoilers]The "good hearted" greedy g.i. as a vehicle for story has been around a long time. Its a harmless tonic that serves from WWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam, and alas the Gulf War. This movie was no different except in one regard. It resurrected the genre and gave it new life. "Three Kings" is a solid film.Stealing gold from Saddam is just as palatable as seizing it from the Nazis. This is why we are behind the protagonists in their illegal endeavor.The "kings" use the imposing weapon of American intimidation in a very real sense. It is believable.Of course, the Iraqis slowly realize that the "kings" are actually renegades and that is where things get tricky. Intimidation turns to deadly force and our heroes are forced to back up their actions with killing.The greedy Americans rehabilitate themselves by finding a moral cause. The rest makes for good cinema. I won't give away anymore.George Clooney, not one of my favorite actors, delivers a strong performance. Ice Cube, Mark Wahlberg, and others also do a good job.The Bush bashing, which is founded on valid arguments is somewhat disingenuous. Face it, if it were up to the Hollywood crowd, Kuwait would still be under Saddam's thumb. Sure, maybe we didn't do enough, but if it were up to them, we would have done nothing. Despite the annoying moralizing of not doing enough, "Three Kings" rates 7 out of 10. Not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1999 was some year of movies. Fight Club, The Matrix, The Sixth Sense, American Beauty, THE INSIDER !!!!....and then this as well. I got a chance to see this properly from start to finish yesterday, and boy is this some movie ! A flawed masterwork, and a good candidate for the strangest mainstream movie we've seen in some time. Very weird. I have no clue how this got a $70-million financing deal. So good is the final cut, Roger Ebert actually thought director David O' Russell was here to stay (snigger). At the time of its release he didn't know of the suicidal amount of trouble that went into making this film, very nearly bringing the project crashing to the floor. More than anything else, Russell filmed it on-the-fly, deviating extensively from the original story. And it shows. AND this is really the only way that some truly spontaneous creative work takes form. Not always, but occasionally.The story is about three US soldiers at the end of the Gulf War, who are out on a spree to uncover hidden Kuwaiti gold. Biting humour, some politics and a LOT of high-voltage action ! The film has some eye-popping photography, filled with dreamlike images and some mind-numbing action sequences. Understandably there are people who find the off-kilter mix of war and action-comedy to be un-funny. Thats fine ; the oddball blending of genres here creates a palpable sensation of being in an insane world. The political commentary stops short of going all the way, but its still a tall order for a major studio film. Russell might be a madman (see him on youtube), but the guy is not boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A relevant, insightful, moving film experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the previews back in 1999 for THREE KINGS, I thought it was some kind of buddy action comedy flick about 3 soldiers looking for gold that happened to be set during the 1991 Desert Storm conflict. But this film is so much more. It is (still, and will probably always be) relevant film about modern warfare, Iraq/American relations, the tyranny of Saddam Hussein, and the greed and negative influence of American principles on other nations. The film is most probably at its core a dark comedy about the idiocy of war and the toll it takes on the lives of soldiers and civilians caught up in it.Although 2 hours in length, THREE KINGS seems to fly by thanks to great editing, snappy dialogue, solid acting, and fast-paced direction. The film is extremely funny (not really laugh out loud funny), but more smart, witty funny. There is a lot in this film that still sadly rings true today and it is those moments that make you laugh at the irony that Iraq is even worse off now that it was back in 1991, thanks to the current events of the times. Even though Saddam is gone and virtually every Iraqi portrayed in this film lives in fear of him and wants him out of power, look how bad things are now with him gone. Ahh, the irony! Hindsight is a b*tch, isn't it?! The acting is fine here. I'm not huge fan of George Clooney, but he pulls off his role as Maj. Archie Gates. Clooney is very understated here and makes you forget for 2 hours that he is George Clooney. Mark Wahlberg of course is outstanding as Pvt. Troy Barlow. He was on a roll in the late 90s with this film and BOOGIE NIGHTS which came out in 1997. Ice Cube is excellent as Chief Elgin, the 3rd King if you will. Actually, there is a 4th King, Spike Jonze who ends up being the most sympathetic character of the group that wants to steal the gold. Also, Nora Dunn delivers a terrific supporting performance as an American reporter who is in the middle of all this action.And the movie actually tells the Iraqi point of view as well. Cliff Curtis is great as an Iraqi businessman who is trying to get his daughter and others across the Iraq-Iran border to safety and Sa?d Taghmaoui is memorable as Iraqi Capt. Said, who captures and tortures Barlow. The Said-Barlow scenes are the best in the film as it brilliantly shows the culture clash between Iraq and America.With its dark humor, great action, political satire, and vivid characters, THREE KINGS may be one of the top 5 films of 1999 in my opinion. Director David O. Russell has created a refreshing, entertaining, enlightening film that remains incredibly relevant today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie shows intelligent Iraqui people who want to be free but they cannot as long as Saddam Hussein remains in power. Several American soldiers of different race and religion- it shows the American diversity- go in search of gold into the desert.They find people who are living under the oppression of the Baathist regime and they decide it's their duty, as Americans, to help them. George Bush had abandoned Shia people because he followed UN resolutions instead of listening of the US General's advice. We know UN is not going to do anything to protect innocent people, so the US soldiers like Major Gates (George Clooney) and his squadron are the only ones who can help these poor and innocent Muslim people.Thanks to the American soldiers they could save their lives. Also Mark Wahlberg plays an important role. He says the truth: Michael Jackson changed his color because he wanted to.George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg are too handsome Americans who make this movie very interesting.</fullReview>

The story is far-fetched and George Clooney has always annoyed me (every performance he gives is the same!) and some of the violence was TOO extreme (a mother gets shot to death in front of her children). But the acting (with the exception of Clooney) was good, the script literate and intelligent and the direction was stunning. Different types of film stock were used for various scenes and the violence is shot so you can actually see how bloody and painful it is(this film has lots of violence but none of it is glorified). It all works but by the end of the film you're exhausted. So much is thrown at you in some many different ways that you never get a chance to stop and catch your breath. Still, well worth seeing...just brace yourself for extreme violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has always been one of my favorite movies. But please note that favorite in my book is still something totally different than best. It's just so that this is one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen.Basically this is a movie about a hunt for treasure/gold but set in modern times and in the midst of a modern war situation. Seriously, how many other adventure for treasure movies are out there, set in modern times, in the first place. This alone already makes this movie a real original one. But it's an original and unique movie, in so many more ways.It's also a war movie, dealing with some serious and heavy issues at times but yet the movie overall is still being a very fun and entertaining one, due to the approach by director David O. Russell, that turns this movie into a subtle comedy, combined with some heavy moments and a strong anti-war message beneath it all. Really, it's one of the best anti-war movies I have ever seen. It shows the craziness of it all and in particular that of the whole Gulf war. It's a movie that is definitely not afraid to criticize the American involvement and show how some poor political choices made a lot of innocent people suffer. It's really making a statement about this but without shoving things down your throat or constantly putting too much emphasis on it, so it never becomes a distracting or annoying thing. Expect for its ending maybe. Lets just say it's not my favorite part of the movie but oh well, it obviously didn't ruined the whole overall movie experience for me.It's not the biggest movie in terms of its action but yet the movie still feels like a real spectacular one. It's because the movie always a good quick constant pace and style to it. It literally never slows down and it makes sure there is always something happening on screen.It also really was the movie that introduced Mark Wahlberg to most of the world, as a serious actor. It also probably still is one of his best and most fun roles. But basically everybody is great and fun to watch in this movie. And with George Clooney playing the lead role, little could go wrong really.A truly unique and original movie, even still now days, that works so well, on many different levels.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An odd gold chase</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This half funny half serious and tragic (much more tragic than funny) crazy movie makes you think a lot after all. In fact its ingredients contain besides a lot of action and adventure also a lot of stuff that will make you reflect upon the Persian Gulf War and what was behind it and at stake there. Since the first scenes we see a lot of US troops behaving crazily and tumultuously in their camp and we also witness the work of women TV reporters there, looking like they used to go to bed with officers to be allowed and able to make good reports. Amid all this half crazy universe a major and three other lower rank soldiers decide to use a map found in the body of a dead Iraqi to go searching for Saddam's gold stolen in Kuwait which is hidden in some bunker in the middle of the desert. It goes without saying that they want to keep that gold for themselves. But at this point things begin to get much more complicated that they thought at first and that's where the viewers are confronted with all that is related with that war not only in military but also in political and even humane terms. That's where our bunch of gold chasers become also conscious of those harsh realities. In that respect there is a superb dialogue between one of the soldiers (after having been made prisoner by Iraqi troops) and the Iraqi officer who is interrogating and torturing him. The realities which they have to face will change their minds little by little and in the end of the movie they are different men. The protagonist roles are very well performed by the respective players especially by George Clooney in the role of the major.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is quite simply the best anti-war movie since Catch 22. Wild, whacko, irreverent, chaotic, you are never sure what will happen next or where your loyalties lie. The innate utter stupidity of war is beautifully exposed, as are the often all too ordinary motivations of those who participate in it - lust for adventure, fame, promotion, wealth, but also sudden compassion, honesty and reflection. A roller coaster ride of action and thrills with sudden counterpoints of instant horror that make you think and ashamed of yourself for laughing out loud just a moment before. If this doesn't shake some holy beliefs in the truth of what we are told, and the justification for what we are doing, nothing will. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this film three times in the past week I am that fond of it. I expected your more than average war film attempting to recreate the gulf war but I was pleasantly surprised.The film tells the tale of George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube, three men intent on 'taking back' Kuwaiti gold for themselves. However on their quest they realise the people of Iraq are greatly at risk, and after suffering a severe conscience bash they decide to help a group of Iraqi villagers across the border.The plot and script are superb, with some genuine funny lines inserted into the film. George clooney is on top form as the sly and laid back Archie Gates- the mastermind behind the whole idea.The film is very well made with some unique camera angels and film techniques. The one which sticks predominately in the mind, is the little clip where they show how a bullet affects the internal system.Definitely worth a view, great entertainment and many great songs littered about. Get around by the beach boys probably being the most memorable as the troops storm the village.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't heard an awful lot about this film before I saw it, so I only really had the fairly positive impression of the trailer in my mind as I watched it. I can't quite put what I think of the movie to words... can't commit it to writing. I suppose you could say that I'm torn. It doesn't have the sense of danger and intensity that Black Hawk Down had. It doesn't have the psychological undertones that Full Metal Jacket mastered. It doesn't have the perfectly conveyed anti-war message of All Quiet on the Western Front. It does, however, have the most stylized direction, most effective visuals and most satirical tone of the bunch. I read about how they affected the color of the film stock, and I must say, it looks very nice in the film. The plot is quite good, and takes off... well, immediately. I don't think more than a few minutes pass before the main characters are well on their way towards their destination. The film wastes no time, yet doesn't seem in a hurry to get where it's going. It takes you on a ride, but it has the sense to keep the speed slow enough for you to be able to take it all in. The acting is very good, with no or few (major) exceptions. The characters are well-written and credible. The humor is great, and in surprisingly good taste, for such a touchy subject. The stylish direction makes it seem closer to home somehow, easier to relate to. All in all, a very good and well-made film, but I'm not entirely sure if I really enjoyed it or I was manipulated by political propaganda. Still, to give credit where credit is due, I can't claim that I think this deserves any less than a rating of 8/10. On a final note... Spike Jonze can act! Who'd have thought so? I recommend this to fans of the people involved in making it and fans of stylish and satirical films. It does require you to have a stomach for graphic and uncensored violence, though. You have been warned. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A controversial film about four US soldiers who enter Iraq after the Gulf War in order to steal gold bullion that Iraqis stole from Kuwait. The repatriation of the extravagant Kuwaiti wealth that Iraqi forces looted during their invasion of Kuwait is rather cynically portrayed here as a reason, among many(?) for the 1991 Gulf War. Whatever the real causes were, this is an outstanding film about the ambiguous aftermath of this conflict, with US and Iraqi forces under a cease fire agreement that left the nascent Iraqi insurgency against Saddam swinging in the wind. With George Clooney as Major Archie Gates, and Mark Wahlberg as Sergeant Barlow, Ice Cube as Sergeant Chief Elgin, and Spike Jonze as PFC Conrad Vig, all intent on pushing their way north into Iraq to find a stash of Kuwaiti gold buried by the Iraqi army near the city of Karbala. Steal from Saddam what he stole from Kuwait and in the process get involved with Shia who are now facing Saddam's wrath after staging an uprising with the encouragement of the US government but are now helpless in light of the cease fire that left Saddam and his best troops in power. Smart and cynicial, with biting humor and outstanding cultural portrayals as well as a great performance by Wahlberg as the super patriot who gets a real education about the human price of this war paid by innocent Iraqis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apart from the great direction and superb actors the script shows to be timeless; it's not - like many a war movie before - dated a few weeks after release but remains topical to a point where the fiction and deliberate satire becomes reality.Not that a movie could hold off political decisions, but isn't it funny that everything we see in *Three Kings* is re-enacted for real in the Persian deserts?Sad that there haven't been many critics and moviegoers seeing the potential and quality of this film when it came out first; perhaps in Europe this film was even more ignored than in the US, many a critic shunning it as "just another war movie". And that in the light that Russell did include a standard "Saul-to-Paul" happy-ending - and making it believable and original.But that is one of the main points for the film: The director took many a standard seen, one would expect in a war film, and gave them original twists.Belongs right at the top together with *M.A.S.H.*; much better than *Saving Private Ryan* (which isn't half-bad either).</fullReview>

Although there is rather too much violence for me, I wouldn't mind my children watching it because there is more to see than just the shooting. As a violent introduction to the benefits of Peace and the demerits of War it definitely deserves to be watched, although Peace purists are unlikely to enjoy it much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Entertaining sophisticated blockbuster without being pretentious, irritating or sleep-inducing. The straightshooting viewpoint of the absurdity of war and America's role as World Boss Number One is mixed with Catch-22 stylised touches/juxtaposition. The 'Audience Applause' cue-scenes are light-handed and well paced. The limited caricatures displayed by the distinct characters (US, Eye-rackees, civvies) interact well in the tight script, from the NRA-associate hickster to the logical/widower gentleman/psycho Iraqi officer to Major "Necessity". Despite a simple plot, the interesting things are in the details and in the excellent execution of the script. Even the technical details, from the military actions to Arab-looking people (unlike True Lies etc) and authentic looking gold bars (they look like real gold-plating) help to maintain a sense of quality in throughout the movie. Classy work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the greatest war movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think of this movie as such a classic that sometimes I forget it was only made 3 years ago. I blame its relative obscurity on a combination of American Beauty and mis-representation, and even with that accounted for, I still don't understand why this movie is as unrecognized as it is. This movie has loads of great scenes, images, characters, and lines that have never left me- Ice Cube listening to easy listening music on the way to a battle, the gangrene shots, the Iraqi attack on the village, Mark Whalberg's interrogation, with the Iraqi describing his family being bombed, and pouring oil on Mark Whalberg's face, shooting clay pigeons while listening to the Beach Boys, the news reporter encountering the huge oil spill. This is one of the most intensely and realistically violent movies I have seen. Like Bonnie and Clyde, and some scenes in Saving Private Ryan, it doesn't dumb the violence down, or overdo it, and for that reason it is all the more disturbing. We see a character, they get shot, the camera watches them die without flinching. Its style and substance alone are masterful, but on top of that, Three Kings is also a look at a part of history which is ignored by many. Vietnam is recognized by many people to be an unnecessary and immoral war, while many people who lived through the Gulf War and its consequences (my generation) have no opinion of it. My only problem with the movie is that the happy ending seems to leave the rest of the movie behind it. It seems as if David O. Russell was afraid that the rest of his movie was too disturbing and uncompromising, and then he compromised by ending it on a totally happy note, complete with a U2 song. It would have been just slightly greater if it had ended with them still in the Middle East. But it is still one of the greatest and most important movies of recent times- it is especially relevant now, as our commander in chief may send our forces back to Iraq to finish what Three Kings suggests shouldn't have even been started.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three Kings is certainly one of the better war films out there, unless of course you are one of these people who wants nothing more than 90 minuets of carnage, but for those of us who actually want films with some substance to them, this is pretty dam good.The camera work in Three Kings is different to say the least, and it does grab your attention from the off because of its unique style. However we all know that flashy camera work does not make a good film. (look at Vertical Limit - it has OK camera work but was basically pap). One thing Three Kings does very well is to get across the complete madness of the period (although I must admit I know nothing about what it was actually like!). The Americans (for once) are not just the good guys.... the Iraqi soldiers for once aren't just portrayed as bits of cardboard to be shot at (well, the ones you get to know aren't). That it another interesting thing about Three Kings, there is hardly any shooting in it, yet it is always completely interesting (note to hollywodd film makers: do not just need lots of explosions to make entertaining film!).There ae some nice moments of humour in there too, the exploding cow and the "you mean the little square cubes you put into soup" gags being pretty good.The ending is good aswell, for once not a brainless shoot out where the hero inevitably comes face to face with villian - hero almost dies - at last kills villian etc, no, thankfully we get something different here.This probably hasn't been the most.... informative.... review possible. But in short Three Kings is a very good film and a break from the typical Hollywood norm of invincible heros with faultless morals............ well worth a look!</fullReview>

Maybe it's the soundtrack, or the way the film is shot. Anyway, this adds to the films appeal. Clooney and crew are off on an adventure to nab some gold that was hidden in the desert. Along the way though we see the confusion and horrors of war. Bullets and wounds are depicted in slow motion. Torture scenes. I thought this movie would just be another Arnold type action flik, but it's a lot more. It makes you think. About war, about world politics, even about what is important in life. Gold or freedom?

Like the movies mentioned above it shows the horrors of war. And this best thing of this movie is (SPOILER AHEAD), that the word oil isn't mentioned, but when a soldier has to illustrate to Mark Wahlberg what the Gulf War is really about he takes a can of oil and stuff it down Mark Wahlbergs throat. This movie is as strongly against war as any of the classic war movies, and it is worth watching and it gives the wiever a good impression of what the Gulf War was about, and how it was to be a soldier in a war that was over before it started.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my personal top 10.I won't re-hash the positive aspects that others have already presented. I will respond to one criticism I've read. To the notion that Iraqis were stereotyped, my reaction is yes. But only as much as the americans were. You've got your prototypical white officer, your rap loving inner-city african-american muscle, your red-necked slacker cornball and your everyday, all american hero. At least in this movie, you get to here the Arabs voices, look into their eyes, know there are people at the end of your guns muzzle, that there is value in that life as well as yours, and there better be a pretty good reason for pulling the trigger.The movie tells it like it really is. We didnt go into the war because we wanted to liberate an oppressed people. We needed to keep the oil flowing. Hey, that's cool. There have been worse reasons to go to war, and we didn't start the hostilities. Remember - the heroes go in for the money, and while they're there they have a chance to do the right thing. When the "cavalry" arrives at the end they really don't give a damn about doing the right thing until there is money involved.Three Kings is not an attempt to realistically portray the American soldiers gulf war experience. It is not meant to be Platoon or born on the 4th of July. It is an analogy of the U.S. motive portrayed at a personal level. In this the movie is right on. It opens the mind of the viewer to see and question motives both individually and as a collective people.However, if none of this ever dawned on you, it's still a funny, action-packed and entertaining piece of cinema. As bubble-gum level entertainment or as social/moral commentary this movie shines at all levels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Entertaining Movie of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The major reason Three Kings is one of my favorite movies of the year is not because it is the first film to deal with the only war of my generation, nor is it because of the interesting and heartfelt story that comes along with it. Although film has become the most important art form of our time, there is still a part of me that goes to the theater to be entertained.Three Kings plays like a two hour MTV video. It keeps you interested because it never sits still. I was genuinely happy to be a part of the film throughout. Now I know there are some who will say, "MTV sucks," and "MTV is what is wrong with this generation," but understand, that was a factor in the war. The media attention during the Gulf War made it an entertainment spectacle, therefore, a film about the war should only be made in such a kinetic and stylized manner.I have read many reviews, and it seems that most people do like this film, so I do not have to sit here and preach about its greatness. The point I am trying to make is that sometimes people become too involved in the plot or the characters. To get too caught up in such often lessens the entertainment value of a movie. Allow yourself to be entertained by this movie. Become immersed in its pace, its colors, its music and its overall feel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There... there are no words that I can use to discribe this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are movies that I think are great. There are movies that I love. There is a difference. The Godfather is a great movie, but it isn't really one of my personal favorites. You get it? Well, Three Kings is both. Not only is it my all time favorite movie, I think (in my own twisted little mind) that this is one of the greatest movies ever made. But did it get nominated for any oscars? NO! Why? It is too different from normal movies.Three Kings was advertised as an action/war movie. The plot was described as, "Three guys in the Gulf War go out and hunt for gold". Well, that is how the movie begins. But it doesn't stay that way.The Gulf War was a weird war. Not as weird as Vietnam, but pretty weird nonetheless. The biggest problem with the war was the media. They covered the war a little TOO well. When our soldiers got sent home, we back in the states thought the war was over. Ohhhhhhh no it wasn't.Most war movies (the good ones anyway) try to capture the feeling of the war they are about. For example, any Vietnam movie is going to be filled with bizarre, craziness. Why, because it was a weird time. Everything was screwed up in that war. Well, Three Kings starts out the way we all thought the Gulf War was. Then, as the movie moves on, it changes into the way the war REALLY was.Everything about this movie shows genius. I said earlier that the movie changes, well, it changes in more ways than one. As the movie moves forward, the visuals change. The look of the film starts out pretty normal, then it warps and twists. The colors go crazy. The entire movie changes! All of it!This is a movie that many won't understand. It's not that it's that hard to understand. It's a really straightforward movie. It's that most people will watch this and say, "I don't remember that happening". Well, technically, this movie is historical fiction. But, so was Saving Private Ryan.I highly recommend this movie to everyone. It's funny, touching, and filled with get action scenes. This is a plot driven movie, so the characters take second billing. That's not a bad thing. I love movies about guys who go in expecting a simple job, and end up in a whole 'nother world. These guys aren't heroes. They're people with families and lives like us. They went looking for gold. What they found was a war. Hey, that would have made a good tagline!10/10Oh, one extra thing. There are these shots which explain what happens when the human body is shot with a bullet. Many of my friends thought these scenes were unnecessary. I thought they were very important to the story. Most movies have the main guy get shot in the gut, yet he lives somehow. This movie explains that living through a bulletwound in the gut is close to impossible. Not many movies say that and prove it too.I would say more about this movie, but, like I said in my summary, I don't have many words that can do this work of art justice. I highly recommend this movie... to EVERYONE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Gulf War is a subject that has not been explored in films, despite its importance in modern history. It was the first `media war,' it was the first military crisis after the Cold War, and its target, Saddaam Huisein, is still causing problems today. While the war has not been depicted in many movies, after Three Kings, there is hardly a need for another depiction.Three Kings bursts with energy. The film has a frantic pace that only lets up when we start to realize there is something deeper going on here. It is not an easy movie to categorize, so I will not attempt to place it in a category.The opening scenes give a hint of the confusion facing the American soldiers at the start of the cease-fire. Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg) is seen running across the desert, only to come upon a man waving a flag. `Are we shooting,' he yells. There are elements of great satires from the past, such as Dr. Strangelove and M*A*S*H, at play here, and Three Kings holds its own in this toughest of comedy genre. It is seen most prevalently in the form of Adriana Cruz, a news reporter, played by Nora Dunn in the film's best performance.The rest of the cast is very effective. The four soldiers played by George Clooney, Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and Spike Jones, have great chemistry as a group.The plot is that of a basic heist movie: four U.S. soldiers steal gold bullion from a bunker in Iraq. After witnessing the conditions of the citizens of Iraq and seeing the cold-blooded murder of an innocent woman, they decide there is something more important to be done. The result is a completely original shoot-out. Here we are not shown people shot completely randomly, but instead David O. Russell puts the fight in slow-motion. We see a strategy emerge, and each hit is as shocking as all the blood and gore of Saving Private Ryan.How is this possible? Russell puts an ingenious sequence in the film where we see a bullet enter someone's body. It is explained exactly what the effects of getting shot are. So when we see people getting hit about five minutes later, we know exactly what is happening to them.What is most poignant in the film is the way the Iraqis are portrayed. They have their own stories. They are rebels fighting a dictator. Two of them just want to open a barbershop. Even a member of Saddaam's army is given an incredibly heartbreaking scene where he tells the story of the death of his child. There are no villains here, just people trying to live their lives.The soldiers' change of mind and heart is truly touching. They learn the importance of human life and see the horrors around them to come to the conclusion that our government made a grave mistake in the Gulf War.Three Kings is the high point in a great year in film. Its satire is brilliant. Its emotional scenes are profound. It shatters our stereotypes. It makes us look at an important part of our recent history. It is the best film of 1999.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People may think I'm a weird person for saying this, but after I saw this movie, I had a big, cheezy grin on my face. Never before has such an intense movie made me feel so alive and happy. It generates positive energy while covering serious subject matter. It is a weird movie. It is a sick movie. And it is a brilliant movie.War has never been handled like this before. "Saving Private Ryan" showed us what war is like for those who fought it. "Schindler's List" showed us a story that took place during a war. This movie shows us a very recent war, a war that is still fresh in everyone's mind and so handles it in a modern way.The film is set after the Gulf War and concerns American soldiers in dispute with Iraqi soldiers. "Three Kings"(I finally said the title!) does not have a very original storyline - which I would not dream of spoiling here - but the way it is done is unlike any movie I have previously seen. Roger Ebert said that most movies droll on in formula, but "Three Kings" is "awake and hyper".The photography, to me, makes this movie. Never before has a film looked like it was shot on home video. This is documentary-style taken to a new extreme. An extreme in which we are taken into the most controversial insides of the movie(and of a human being!!).The subtext in "Three Kings" is of an elaborate degree(my favourite moment is when we see a Bart Simpson doll on the front of a car). You have to see it to believe it! Be warned, though. It is sickly violent in parts."Three Kings" was not nominated for any Oscars this year. If you ask me, it should have been nominated for nearly every one of them!10/10</fullReview>

Their plan doesn't go so well when shots are fired and Iraqi soldiers are killed and that breaks the cease-fire.

I recommended it to two Iranian friends because it shows Americans do realize the situation is more complicated and human than "us versus the evil towelheads". It's a great movie, not to be missed.

		<fullReview>This movie was sorely underappreciated upon release. Its jarring camera work and clever use of the standard "western" storytelling is at once both deeply insightful and conveys deeper spirtual understandings of both our own middle eastern policies and the roles of the men we have asked to fullfill them. Wonderfully cast and acted, it is an underappreciated gem. The DVD features are excellent. If you like to think and enjoy action films, this film offers much opportunity for both.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Three Kings" isn't like your ordinary run-of-the-mill action film; in fact, to even call it an action film would be unfair. The film's aim is not to show just how many explosions and car chases it can squeeze out of its budget, its aim is to show the politics of a modern war and the repercussions a war (in this instance the Gulf War) can have on the lives of those involved, and the film takes care to emphasise these points throughout. George Clooney plays Archie Gates of Special Forces who leads a small group of soldiers to find a horde of gold hidden in one of Saddam's bunkers. However, all does not go to plan and they are caught up in a moral dilemma of sorts: Should they take the gold and be on their way, or should they help the desperate rebel prisoners who have fallen into Saddam's hands? David O. Russel's direction is innovative and serves to enhance the film's message without detracting any from the entertainment value. The casting of the film is particularly good and became the base of George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg's strong working relationship. Clooney shows with Three Kings (and not to forget Steven Soderbergh's "Out of Sight" in which he excelled) that he can choose a good movie from time to time after the unsuccessful "The Peacemaker" and the horror that was "Batman and Robin". Wahlberg added to his already growing reputation with his performance as Troy Barlow and there are surprisingly good performances from Ice Cube and fledgling director Spike Jonze of "Being John Malkovich" fame. Back this combination up with fine support from Mykelti Williamson ("Con Air, Forrest Gump") and Jamie Kennedy ("Scream", "Enemy of the State") and you have yourself a promising movie on paper. The thing about "Three Kings" is that it more than satisfies on screen, too. A gem of a film and one of the best of 1999.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't expect this movie to be as good as it was. Then again, I wasn't sure what it was going to be about as all I remember from the reviews of it were that it was good, that many critics thought it should have been an Oscar contender, and to expect to hear about the Bullet Wound Scene. Well I didn't hear any other word of mouth besides that so I rented the movie and watched it not knowing what to expect, which I've found tends to be the best way to enjoy a movie anyway.If I may endulge in slang from around the period of the movie, I have to heartily exclaim that this movie was radical! There is a great deal of dark comedy in it that I hope I'm not the only person to appreciate. And it all builds to an exciting finale (I won't say how, because this was the part of the movie I had no idea about). Please don't overlook this one! Just one last thing, in case "Boogie Nights" didn't convince you: as a rapper, Mark Walburg is a great actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but improbable action flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Three Kings' was an entertaining but improbable action flick. It seems to be a war movie, but it is really a story about a gold heist. The characters just happen to be soldiers in Iraq in the aftermath of operation Desert Storm. Major Archie Gates (George Clooney) learns of a map found by Sergeant Barlow (Mark Wahlberg) and Chief Elgin (Ice Cube) and upon investigating, deduces it is a map of bunkers where Kuwait's gold is hidden. Together they set out to find it and steal it for themselves. This is a mild purloining of a similar plot from 'Kelly's Hero's', just changing the war (A bunch of soldiers learn about a German bank with gold bullion during WWII and decide to go into enemy territory on an unauthorized mission to steal it for themselves). 'Three Kings' attempts to take itself a lot more seriously than 'Kelly's Heroes' did, though there are numerous light moments throughout the film.The story required a lot of contrivance to make it even remotely believable, but as action films go, it wasn't totally outrageous. The comedy worked well and there were a lot of interesting insights into American perceptions of the war versus the Iraqi perspective. There were a number of reminders of the human toll that war takes on both sides and that the enemy is comprised of real people with feelings much like our own.The direction by David O. Russell was good, but he tried to get a bit to artsy with what was really a straight action flick. His opening explanation of the colors and exposures came across as insecure; almost apologetic. To his credit, the action scenes were well done, except we really didn't need to track the path of each bullet in super slow motion during that one firefight. I think we also could have done without the organ cam peek inside Barlow's guts.The acting was well done all around. George Clooney gives another fine performance as the smart, hard nosed action hero. His deadpan style works well in this type of film. Despite his no nonsense demeanor, he is effective in subtly letting it be known that beneath the tough self centered exterior, there is compassion and a sense of what is right.Mark Wahlberg also delivers a strong portrayal of a regular Joe reservist, trying to be the tough soldier. Wahlberg walks a fine line between vulnerability and machismo and pulls it off admirably.Overall, this is an entertaining guy flick with some credibility problems that are easy to overlook. I rated it a 7/10.</fullReview>

Looks like Clooney may be one that makes it. He had enough presence to command the lead role. Interesting story. Had to tread a thin line of how Iraqi's are portrayed (didn't go the route of trashing all Iraqi's). I can tell digital editing and processing is becoming much more widely used, based on various scenes that screamed digital. Wahlberg and Ice Cube carried their roles well as did Spike Jonze (although I found his character nearly intolerable). Could have been just another dumb buddy movie, but it's not. It has a lot more to offer. Catch this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The american soldier...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot shows four american soldiers who find were the Kuwait gold, stolen by Irak, is hidden, and set out to grab a share for themselves. While doing this they manage to break the cease fire agreement (the war was officially over), get caught in all sorts of trouble with Saddam loyal troups, and end up helping a group of civilians find refuge in Iran, after going through further "adventures"...Definitely the film's strength doesn't lie in the plot (they load a truck with gold, helped by two dozen other people, but they aren't really concerned about how they'd get it home, to US?!! I guess they knew the director would not let them get to this point) but rather in the way the american soldier is depicted. It's basically a mix of how the rest of the world sees US actions (hypocrisy and self interest being the keywords here) and the classical "american hero" view. The characters are by no mean heroes and their correct decision in the end is merely the natural one, not one to be hailed and praised as a great act of courage and heroism.However, the film is one of the rare (if not the only) who tries to put face to face the two "images" of the american soldier and actions in foreign military interventions. I would have appreciated a clearer statement rather than letting the viewers get what they want out of the movie. Some people will just see another display of american altruism, while others will just complain about this not being Saving Private Ryan.Maybe the war in Kossovo will inspire another movie of this kind...</fullReview>

In fact it showed Americans the way most of the world sees them, cocky, arrogant, and way to sure of themselves. It also did not give us all that crap about liberating Kuwait for a noble cause but instead for the real reason, Western interests were in at stake.So I liked it for that reason, it was real, it was not the usual Hollywood America saves the world rubbish, it showed what normal men may do during and after a war if the opportunity presents itself.

		<shortDescription>A screwball action-adventure film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would call Three Kings a screwball action-adventure film. It continually defied my expectations, which after I got used to it, I kind of enjoyed. Almost all of the moments were topsy-turvy. Where I expected violence, there would be a moment of rough tenderness or compassion. Where you expected thug-like torture, we heard a real cultural exchange. Where we thought Barlow was over the edge, he wasn't, but when we thought he was fine, he wasn't either. The doubters transformed into sometimes skeptical believers; the believers in simple certainties learned to appreciate complexity and ambiguity. I guess I would have to see it again or more times to properly evaluate whether it really is a good or great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apparently 75% of the viewers thought this movie was an 8 or better - #133 of all time. I have to say that seems too high to me.Actually, I thought the movie was almost always entertaining. There were a few times when I would have looked at my watch if I was wearing one, but not because I wanted it over, just a lull in the action. At about 2 hours it certainly was long enough. The action was plentiful and generally realistic. There were a couple times when the "Tommy Gun fallacy" reared its head. You know, that's when 30 guys with tommy guns are all shooting at each other from 30 feet and nobody is getting hit. But, as a rule, I thought the attention to detail was fairly good.The acting was fine, but in a "war" movie, acting isn't always the number one issue - except in Saving Private Ryan. The goal was to steal $23 million in gold and 4 weekend warriors were going to try to do it. They failed - of course - duh! But, my problem with the movie (though it's not a movie that provokes a great deal of thought) was how in the world did they think they would get it out of the country and back to the U.S.? And, even if they did, how could they possibly spend it? They would have been better off stealing about 5 bars each - roughly 500K and try to smuggle that much out. At $23 million, they would have had to carry over 500 pounds ... EACH.There were a few interesting side bars going on - not the least of which was how the movie portrayed the Yankee to the Arabs - not good. And, I can't say that I blame them given the assumptions in the movie. Fun entertainment, but that's about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"THREE KINGS" is virtually the only cinema fodder about the conflict that started this decade with a bang. TV doc George Clooney, rapper Ice Cube, and former underwear god Marky Mark Wahlberg head up this twisted tale of four Desert Stormers who decide to eschew two of the three gifts of the magi in favor of raiding Saddam's booty-filled bunkers for all that glitters - that tooth-filling commodity - gold! With M*A*S*H-like black humor and George Bushian cockiness on their side, our boys plow through sand and bullets looking for mister gold bar.Flick only goes too far when camera actually follows the path of a bullet once it has ENTERED the body. Yuk and double yuk! Gross me out of the storyline totally. SNL alum Nora Dunn does a nifty turn as a network news gal talking head in Clooney's charge who gets shuttled off on a wild camel chase while Clooney turns shameless gold digger. Midway through, THREE KINGS turns into a bit of a snore when a hostage situation takes center stage. But film has good ending with moral queries raised and responded to nicely. This is definitely the best, if only, flick on our decade's major call to serve.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Decent enough of a film. It's being called a "Western" instead of a war movie -- if so, it's a Western with an attempt at a conscience.I appreciated the brief acknowledgements of the devastation caused by the Iraqi invasion, looting and burning of Kuwait, including its environment, although incredibly more destruction resulted than just a few birds dying agonizingly in tar pits. I was happily surprised that the film blew the "collateral damage" myth out of the water -- the American press, which was totally muzzled by the U. S. Army throughout the conflict, bought right into that lie, so its citizens didn't have to fret over the civilian toll of U. S. bombs on Iraq. Islam was treated with uncharacteristic respect for an American film. The irony of the U. S. having previously equipped the Iraqi army (including training it in torture techniques) during the Iran-Iraq war was nicely noted.Finally, it was quite unexpected that a Hollywood film would tell the truth about the cynical U. S. government encouragement given to the Iraqi people to rise up against Saddam Hussein -- these people did rise up and are still paying the price for their betrayal by the indecisive Mr. George Bush, who apparently thought Kuwaiti oil (and a few hundred autocratic Kuwaiti oil sheikhs) were pretty important, but a few million ordinary Shiites in Iraq were not. They were left hanging -- thousands of them quite literally -- as a consequence.The acting was fair to good, but not IMHO "Oscar material" as some people are suggesting, and the film can't compare on any level with "Besieged", "Eyes Wide Shut" or "American Beauty" as far as Academy Awards go. Oops, there I go again, imagining that the voters for the awards have functioning brains... Sorry.The Hollywood ending cost the film some points in my rating -- without spoiling the ending for those who haven't seen it, I'll just say the finale was unrealistic. Also, it's tiring to have so many films telling you what happened to the protagonists after the end of the story ("Joe Blow now sells real estate in Guatemala", etc.).Worth seeing; 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good movie. The story of four AWOL American soldiers in the aftermath of the Gulf War goes through laughs, tension, violence, and boredom. The story gives an interesting look into the strange world created by America's defeating Iraq's military but not deposing Saddam Hussein and fundamentally changing the country's internal politics.The director and cinematographer have a fun time with the film, from mini-shots showing what's running through a character's head or what happens when a bullet hits someone's gut. They also have some surreal overexposed and time-altered shots to add to the mix.The movie is also unusual as a war film because many of the soldiers are army reservists rather than professional soldiers, and their inexperience and foolishness adds to the tension and threat of violence.That said, I did feel like the movie dragged through the middle. And although I cared what happened to the characters, I didn't really empathize with them. I think part of that was caused by their bad decisions, but also the fact that I didn't really single out one of them to be the main character the audience is supposed to follow (though I believe Mark Wahlberg's character would be the closest approximation).The acting isn't anything special, and the movie gets overly sentimental at times, but I think the story and filmmaking are enough to make it worth a look.And not to forget, the babe factor: Clooney and Wahlberg, including one shot of Mark in his Calvins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rousing adventure with a definite edge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David O. Russell, director of `Flirting with Disaster' and `Spanking the Monkey', now delivers the goods with "Three Kings", a big budget action adventure with a definite edge. It is the end of the Gulf War and three soldiers, Archie Gates (George Clooney), Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg), and Chief Elgin (Ice Cube) decide to liberate millions of dollars in gold bullion that Sadaam Hussein has stolen from Kuwait. Their odyssey through the destroyed desert towns, bunkers and lives of Iraqi refugees is brought to vivid life by Russell. Slow motion and creative use of different film stocks adds texture to the feel of the film. There is a visceral use of surround sound in both action sequences and quieter interludes. The script portrays these three characters as three very different types. You really care about what happens to them. There is abundant humor, which turns to gut wrenching violence and pathos as the tale wends its way to a moving climax. Supporting roles are ably acted by Spike Jonze as the soldier who idolizes Barlow, Nora Dunn as a CNN-type journalist, and Mikelti Williamson as a strict commanding officer. You'll feel as though you've been there after spending two hours with these guys who start out as mercenaries, but end up as? Well, see it and find out for yourself.</fullReview>

It was by no means a conventional war film, though it was very "hollywood". There are very few bullets in this movie but as director David O. Russell said in a recent interview that they make each one count. The acting was very good, not exceptional with Mark Wahlberg providing the best character. He is the most serious of all of the four men searching for the gold Iraq stole from Kuwait. George Clooney does not play the typical charming character he normally does, in fact he is anything but, and it now seems as though he is taking some better roles for himself. Of additional note is cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel who also did camera for "The Usual Suspects". Again he proves a master behind the lens and should be classified among the greats. I am very surprised he has not found more work. This is a movie that is definitely worth the 8 bucks, though I saw it for free.

But there she was at a party, telling everyone how AWFUL it was, all violent and irreverent, with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. (This must surely be the exception to the rule that states everybody is entitled to their opinion.)It's true, the first chapter is mostly greed and machismo. But once our protagonists find themselves in the midst of atrocities unfolding in Iraqi territory, their apathy is put to the ultimate test. Suddenly, the film has a very strong moral compass and everything from the first act goes completely out the window. All factions get a voice (even the dreaded Republican Guard heavies) and there's plenty of food for thought.Ethical-correctness aside, I found Three Kings was plenty entertaining. The cast is great and there's quality humor interspersed at just the right moments. Director David Russell did a fine job, weaving together the various elements into a tight, satisfying package.I highly recommend this film. But don't see it if you're squeamish!

		<fullReview>We certainly know after Abu Gharib that wartime atrocities often occur because we cannot expect every soldier (American or otherwise) to operate by the book. We see that in this film with Americans killing a surrendering soldier and a steady stream of racist comments.While George Clooney and company - Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and Spike Jonze - hunt Kuwaiti gold after the cease fire, they realize (at least Clooney does) that there is still a war going on. Iraqis wanting to be free, and believing George Bush's promise to help them, are being tortured and slaughtered by Saddam's soldiers.Gold becomes a secondary goal, and eventually is completely traded for the freedom of a couple of dozen civilians. In this way a few soldiers redeemed American honor and made this an outstanding film about understanding and peace and the evils of conflict.This is one of those hidden treasures of Clooney's.</fullReview>

John Ridley and David O Russell's script is peppered with smart-Alec dialogue and scenes that make you go "Hmmmmm". In-between all the action and black humour, "Three Kings" is a serious anti-war, pro-humanity film that manages to avoid lecturing the viewer.Apparently George Clooney and director David O Russell didn't get on at all well during the shooting of "Three Kings". Fortunately this doesn't show in Clooney's portrayal of a cynical soldier who gets his moral compass forcibly re-aligned. Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube and Spike Jonze provide solid backup to Clooney. Well, perhaps "Solid" is the wrong word to use, as their portrayals of self-conscious army reservists shoved into combat are spot-on.Ignore the negative comments and make your own mind up about this unconventional war movie.</fullReview>

Their exposure to the citizenry of the country begins to transform them by largely supplanting their self-interest with a genuine concern for their fellow human being.This masterpiece should have scared Americans out of their voting stupor and overwhelming sense of political apathy prior to the last elections, but apparently failed to register with the red states.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great underrated film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David O. Russel's satirical war story based in iraq in the early 90s after saddam invaded Kuwait is both hilarious and also thought-provoking. I love the characters, irony, story and direction in this film. The screenplay is brilliant, Oscar worthy in my book (it was written better than films such as Being John Malkovich, Topsy-Turvy, Magnolia and even the sixth sense in my opinion), all of those films got nods, but anyhow... THree Kings features some great performances as Clooney is perfect in the lead and Ice Cube and Spike Jonze both have hilarious characters. Mark Wahlberg was decent. The supporting cast includes Cliff Curtis and Said Taghmoui showing 2 different sides of Iraqis, one being a rebel leader and the other one of saddam's guards. This film is perfect and one of my favorites. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not sure why, but this is my favorite movie lately</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is definitely a roller-coaster ride of graphic action, serious drama, and often times hilarious situations. David O. Russell does a fantastic job directing a cast which I believe is perfectly suited for their respective roles. George Clooney plays a very convincing soon-to-retire special forces major leading his team of reservists on a quest for riches in the Iraqi desert. If I had to classify this movie, it would fall under action-comedy, but beware not to watch this movie expecting to laugh the whole time. It is just shy of a full-blown "action-drama". I would recommend this movie to anyone with interests in the current war in Iraq, or perhaps the Gulf War. I felt like I actually learned something about our current conflict from watching this great movie. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ahead of Its Time...One of the Most Under-appreciated Films...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great favorite film of mine that is complex in its analysis of international relations, war, etc. and offers excellent and remarkably in-depth understanding and accurate critiques of American foreign policy.Especially relevant film for those who are looking for a better understanding of the current situation in Iraq. The film is ahead of its time in many ways such as the aforementioned analysis of foreign policy as well as technically in terms of cinematography, writing, etc. Perhaps one of the best parts of the film is that it deals with its serious subject matter with sharp dialogue and comedy. The comedy is a great strength in the film that sets it apart from other films that tackle the same sort of issues but without the invaluable laugh-out-loud comedic aspects which help to make the film a enjoyable experience.A hugely under-appreciated film. A must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a dull moment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in the remnants of the first Gulf War, Three Kings is a fantastic and original story about humanity and politics. It follows a group of soldiers as they set off to steal gold from a Suddam Hussein bunker, who stole it from Kuwait, intending to use a map found on an Iraqi captive to hunt down the hidden treasure. The rushed plan leads them into all sorts of trouble, and in the end they give it all up for the freedom of innocent prisoners.The humour entwined into this tale of morality is what makes the film so solid. All of the leading cast are outstanding, especially Mark Wahlberg, who can only do good under the instruction of director David O. Russell (see I Heart Huckabees). The glary contrast of the Iraq desert makes for an outstanding setting, and the use of Iraqi soldiers and civilians in the dialogue adds to the film's integrity. The movie is accompanied by a varied yet fitting soundtrack, a lot of it giving the audience a feel for the time the movie was set in, and it helps to impact the significant mix of culture with American troops on Iraqi soil.Three Kings steers clear of most, if not all, expected clichés, and because of that, it does not fall down once. The comedy aspect, including cows blowing up from land mines and footballs wrapped in gelignite, is the glue that keeps the movie going strong, but it is the touching final scene that you will remember.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the many excellent movies of 1999</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1999 was truly a year crammed with fantastic movies, three kings being one of them. Three kings isn't a war movie, at least not in the typical sense. It's more of an action movie charged with intelligent satire. It doesn't pull any punches when it comes to portraying the U.S. government's attitude in the first Iraq war, or even when it shows the half-stupid, half-innocent ignorance of the average U.S. soldier. It manages to make you feel sorry and sympathies for both the American "heroes" and the Iraqi characters. Which is exactly what war's all about - everybody that's fighting it is a victim of something.This movie is not about acting, not about lengthy dialogues. It's about the story, shot in a frenetic pace, in wonderful, sometimes colourful, sometimes greyish tones, full of great action sequences. But these sequences never are there just for being there, they're truly a part of the story.The acting is competent and the actors were really well picked. The dialogues are sharp, funny, and to the point. Thanks to them, and to the story, with its political content that rings very true today, and has some haunting premonitions ( "What do you want us to do? Invade Iraq and have another Vietnam?" ), this is not just a guy's movie. It's a movie for anyone who enjoys having a blast at the movies and at the same time leaving them with some food for thought.The only flaw is the ending, which is too quick, and doesn't really leave you feeling like there was a strong climax. But after the such a great ride, I guess it's not that big a problem.</fullReview>

When i saw it i was amazed.Now everytime i see it i'm amazed.Oh i have seen it about 10 times now!Its just that good.It gets better to me every time i see it.Sure it is extremely violent but it has to be.The acting is great and so is the story.Most war movies are very serious [they should me]and thats part of the reason there not my favourite kind of movie. But this at times can be so funny and then go right back to being serious.The hole message of this movie is why i like it so much.I'm not going to tell you the message,it would be better you see it on the movie yourself.The one thing i found wrong with this movie would be the ass map.Even though this is pretty funny it is also gross. all i have to say is see this movie.It is by far one of my favourites.5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This may not be the best film, but it is my favorite. Having seen the misleading trailer, I assumed this would be a rather dull heist movie with a Gulf War backdrop. What I got was an amazing surprise as it was so much more. The film has a heart and it makes you develop a strong bond with the characters. Normally, films hardly ever influence me to relate to the characters, to care for them. I saw 'Lord of the Rings' the other day and I couldn't of have cared less who got killed and so forth. However, in Kings, I was glued to my seat, anticipating what comes next. That's a sure sign of a tremendous film, and I have seen many films. The Direction flawless, Cinematography amazing and the acting just sucks you in. Thoroughly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different type of war movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The words used in the advertisements for this movie are very overrated. It may be a "thumbs up" movie, but its a long way from a "thumbs way up" one. I disliked the grainy look sometimes making me feel it was a movie made for TV, not for the big screen. The story is good and probably true to life, and although its a typical "we-good side/them-bad side" story, the main characters are portrayed much more human, having a greedy side. The acting is lacking, but the action scenes are good. The best actor was the Iranian character who takes a U.S. Serviceman (one of the main characters) as prisoner but it was a very small part in which there was a discussion (if you can call that a discussion) of the pros and cons of our Desert Storm involvement; the rest of the acting, I felt, was somewhat below par. However, the action scenes, especially the explosions are superb. I read an earlier review which stated that this movie was a humorous movie. A couple of laughs a humorous movie do not make! The humor was in keeping with each situation and blended nicely. If you are one who likes war movies or action movies you will enjoy this one. Just don't go if you are looking for an Academy Award winner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated film that reinvents its genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Three Kings" is a rare and unusual masterpiece that rarely comes along, especially from a major studio like Warner Bros. In fact, if auteur writer-director David O. Russell had made Three Kings a year latter when the studio had founded its own art house division, the movie would indeed have been a major contender at Oscar night. Instead it was marketed as a summer action-comedy and wasn't well received by audiences expecting something light and uncontroversial.Russell's third feature length film ("Spanking The Monkey", "Flirting With Disaster") is humor and action angrily fused into a political outcry. It takes place at the end of the first Gulf War, with the truce so fresh that American soldiers aren't sure if surrendering Iraqis are still trying to kill them. At an American military camp an Iraqi POW refuses to follow orders and remove his clothes. Three Americans manage to hold him down and strip him but discover a piece of paper sticking out of his behind. Sergeant Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg) offers Private Conrad Vig (Spike Jonze) a rubber glove and orders him to remove it. The paper object turns out to be a map leading to one of Saddam Hussein's bunkers in which lies the plunder from Kuwait, including millions in gold bullion. As Troy and Conrad secretly study the map in their tent with SSgt. Chief Elgin (Ice Cube) they are caught by Major Archie Gates (George Clooney) who tries to take the map. Troy threatens to report it to his commanding officer, but Archie sees no benefit for either side in such an outcome and convinces the three to briefly go AWOL with him to find the gold. Before leaving he orders the goofy Private Walter Wogaman (Jamie Kennedy) to keep Adriana Cruz (Nora Dunn) busy, since she is the reporter he has been assigned to in what has become a "media war".Their adventure unravels with explosive energy and hilarious yet smart dialogue that strikes a contrast with the violence around them. The violence however is not the center of the plot. Unlike many big-budget action movies, the action in "Three Kings" could not happen without the plot it heavily depends on, which goes by with lightning speed so that we never question the plausibility of it all. Every explosion or shot fired is a result of the storyline, something Hollywood tends to get backwards. The soldiers encounter Iraqis. I say this so bluntly because many films before "Three Kings" simply ignored their Muslim characters and treated them as clichéd bad-guys for their heroes to trample. "Three Kings" not only shows Iraqis that resent America and yet fight Saddam, but it also shows Iraqis who hate Americans for bombing their families. There are Iraqis who do not hesitate (and even find satisfaction) in killing innocents, yet there are also Iraqis who wince with regret when ordered to torture an American prisoner. Russell brilliantly portrays all shades of gray, from every side. Through all this, which can be very confusing for any American soldier, our three "kings" (actually four) encounter moral dilemmas. They must decide whether to help innocent Iraqis fighting a corrupt regime. They realize they already broke military orders by leaving the base and killing Saddam's men (with whom America had made a truce). Should they go further to help innocent people or sit on their hands as they are butchered? Is the gold more important? Should they follow the example of their leaders in Washington, who saved Kuwait for its oil yet left their fellow Iraqi neighbors to die? Though the premise of the story may sound familiar, the tone and attitude of the script is wholly original. We've seen people get shot, yet here we follow the bullet into the body and watch the infected organs as the wound fills with bile. We've seen the likable soldier get shot, but have we ever seen him with a valve hammered into his chest to keep air in his collapsed lung? We've seen the deserts of the Middle East, but we haven't seen it on Ektachrome film, which gives a high contrast and bleached out look to enhance the portrayed emotions and heighten the surreal landscape. As chaos ensues around them, our kings argue about Lexus convertibles, show mercy to their torturers, save innocent Shiites, ponder about their purpose for being in the Middle East, and still find time to do target practice on footballs vamped up with C4 (explosives),. Remember, it all happens in less than two hours and leaves you breathless.My only complaint is the ending which doesn't live up to the rest of the film. We learn what happens to the characters after the war through short blooper-like scenes once the credits roll. I found it to be out of place.Whatever your political convictions are, you can no doubt understand this film's subversive message to Americans, which was still as potent in 1999 as if it was right after the war, and probably more so today. "Three Kings" disgusts, humors, and even possibly makes us cry.An underrated film that reinvents its genre. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had watched this movie when it was first released at cinema and I also watched it a while ago on TV. My opinion hasn't changed. It's a very good and pleasant film, a great way to spend a couple of hours!The way it presents the first Gulf War is very ingenious with the satire of the soldiers' presence there and of the media coverage. The plot is also pretty nice, although not that original (I recall that film with Clint Eastwood and Hitler's gold) but all is well done. The characters are great and they give some very good laughs!As for the cinematography I liked it a lot. I was pretty small during the Gulf War but I remember very well how the TV images from there looked like and I've also done a little research of my own on the subject. Well, this film recreates very well the atmosphere that the whole world lived back then while watching on the screens (let's not forget that the Gulf War was the first "tv war" ever) and I can't understand why some people complain so much about it.Also, a higher vote is given from me to this film because it mentions Judas Priest (a few months before the story is set they had just released their legendary album "Painkiller")! Well, OK, it was about time they were mentioned somewhere :p Anyway, all in all, this is a very enjoyable film and I would advise everyone to rent it if they come across it. They won't regret it.</fullReview>

It is one of only 4 movies I have rated as '10'.It entertains throughout while still maintaining a serious plot. The characters help make it a believable movie with excellent performances all round - especially Clooney and Wahlberg.There are many scenes in this movie which are great fun - one that springs to mind is the scene where Gates (Clooney) and Elgin (Ice Cube) are trying to persuade Iraqis to lend them a fleet of Mercedes Benz cars without any success.Although I love the typical war movies such as Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, Apocalypse Now and so on, this is refreshingly different.

It has a magnificient blend of comedy and tragedy. The use of the different colors to make it seem more desert like is awesome.I personally bought the vhs a year ago from walmart for 5 bucks. Since then I have bought numerous movies such as pulp fiction, shawshank, snatch, etc. However, I always seem to go back to Three Kings and watch it. The movie seems to never get old.

		<shortDescription>What does this movie want to be?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot-outline to this movie sounds like it might be a lot of fun. A treasure-hunt in a post-Gulf-War scenario. Probably not a real brain-tickler but lots of cool jokes and over-the-top action to make up for it. Of course such a movie could never be politically correct since it would have to completely ignore the fact that a war is a deadly serious thing and not funny at all - but Hollywood has a long history of movies that go to war just for the thrills of it and get away with it splendidly. So why not this one?Because, unfortunately, it does not want to - that's why.Half way through the movie the authors for some reason decided, that they wanted it to be politically correct. Even worse: they wanted to offer serious insights into issues such as the questionable politics of the US and its consequences for the civilian population of Iraq. Normally this would be a perfectly honest thing to do and you might even get a rather good movie out of it. But then you should go there from the first minute on and not start out like "Three GI's find the map to a huge gold treasure in the rear of an Iraqi soldier and decide to go into enemy territory in order to single-handedly steal the gold." At this point you have definitely missed the train to all serious considerations of politics or ethics. If the plot outline of your movie is that silly, you have to bear with it. Make an action movie. Write something like "True Lies" in the desert. Otherwise you get what "Three Kings" has become: a movie that is too shallow to be taken serious and too inhibited to be fun.

		<fullReview>The Review"Three Kings" is a grand movie. It's got superbly choreographed action sequences, a hilarious dark side, and one of a human side, as well. Its characters stand on their own and make up their minds about what they want to do, and a lot of the time it's not the best decision. They are on a quest by themselves and they must carry it out. But their human nature may stand in the way.The Setup"Three Kings" is set in the aftermath of the first Gulf War. It involves about four men from the U.S. army finding out where gold is hidden in Iraq, and their mission as they go out to find it for themselves. But before they can take the loot, their human nature gets in the way as they see innocent civilians in a small town being killed by Saddam's armies. So they decide to help the people of the small town, and in the process must choose to take the money and run, or help out, go AWOL, and cross the border with the people to take them to freedom.The Plus ( + ) Side"Three Kings" is a wickedly funny satire on the Gulf War. Only I wouldn't exactly call it a satire. It is more of a dark film with a dark blend of on-the-side humor. And the humor must be acquired; not all people will find this movie funny. If you do not think a cow being chased around by three military officers in a Humvee and being blown up by a landmine in a bloody mess is funny, this movie is probably not the best choice for you. But it is filmed darkly and is the definition of gritty; yet, unlike the film "Fight Club," it still manages to have a wickedly funny dark side of comedy that I found is one of the best elements of the entire film. I particularly enjoy one scene in which George Clooney threatens three men, by saying "would you like to return to your day job?" All three start thinking about their day jobs back home. One man remembers his job at an airport. Another as a penpusher. Then, one man remembers shooting stuffed animals with a shotgun. He turns to Clooney. "I don't have a day job, sir." You've got to see it to get it.The Down ( - ) SideThe length of the film in some areas got in the way of my enjoyment, including a scene in a shrine that turned boring and overused pretty fast. But it pays some importance to a character later in the film, so I guess I can't complain. Other than that, the film doesn't really have anything wrong with it. The actors are great, the script is great, the directing is great. The movie is great.The Closing Paragraph"Three Kings" should be witnessed by everyone. Especially if you like dark comedies, violent comedies, dramas, romance movies, and "Fight Club." You've gotta like one of those, and if you don't, steer away from "Three Kings." But if you're open to one of the most dark, humorous and gritty war films in recent years, open your ears, shut up and watch the movie. Shh, your popcorn-chewing's getting on my nerves.Evaluation: 4/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A friend of mine advised me to watch this movie, and didn't tell me anything about the movie. I took a leap of faith if you will.I am a huge action/comedy movie fan. Though after 45 min. of the movie I decided to do some research to find out whether this is a serious movie or a complete joke (I didn't even bother pausing the movie, it is playing at the background as I type). When researching I found out that it was an action/comedy movie, which was quite surprising for me. To my opinion this movie is so lame, and the storyline so uninteresting. I do not advice anyone to watch this movie who has at least a little bit of an developed movie taste. I honestly cannot believe George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg agreed to play in this movie. Of course when I recognised Ice Cube, I should've known.Btw, to make my advice relative. I'm not that picky, I even liked the movie "dude, where is my car" which is completely dumb but hilarious for it.If there is even a single person reading this review, and also happens to think "sh*it, what SHOULD I watch then?".

		<fullReview>It is called Three Kings, because presumably, that is how these soldiers view themselves, strutting in their gear, towering over the common foreigners and by waving a piece of paper, able to stroll in any camp or village and take what they please. One is a party animal. Another is shameless womaniser. They all stink of the same material greed and unethical practice that dries them towards the stash of bullion gold that will make them rich if they can just sneak by unawares and avoid a court marshalling. But by the end of the film they have been struck by their innate goodness, heart and compassion and therefore give up (most of) the gold so that their refugee friends may cross the border.Is this change gradual? Not exactly. Grit is not so easy to pull off, especially in a such a politically precarious situation like the American military presence in the middle east, so Russell has gone in the completely opposite direction. The entire film has been cross-processed to produce those hyper-saturated, eye-popping colours that give the war zone a comic dreamland feel. Great billowing oil fires become little chimneys puffing up cartoon pillars of smoke. The sky takes on a garish, bubble-gum shade of blue. The never ending plains are not a desolate, parched wasteland, but rather a brightly lit playground. This might have worked if Russell had gone all the way with it and embraced his zany, ultra-stylised approach with a satirical relish. But for every kinetic, high-flying action sequence with whip pan and smash cut galore there is another that uses the same intense style but without a hint of irony. Russell can't expect the audience to laugh along when a truck is flipped on its side and skids to a grinding halt just centimetres from a mine, and then suddenly appreciate the gravitas to the silenced, slow-motion shootouts and the cold-blooded execution of a mother. Another example - Barlow is captured by the Iraqi army and tortured viciously. They are not necessarily bad people, but they are angry at this war and how the Americans have made promises they have not kept and left their country in disarray. The interrogator simply talks - he asks Barlow how he can answer for the mass bombings and how they have taken away his wife and child. He appeals to their shared fatherhood. Barlow has no answers to these difficult questions, of course - the segment is deliberately posed to force the same reflection in the audience, and although it's a little on the nose, it works. But this is coupled with the most ridiculous spiel about Michael Jackson and a American racial conspiracy about the colour of his skin that is so obviously designed to make us laugh, and on a second level, take the interrogator less seriously. The entire film Russell is leaning on these moments, hiding behind the comic absurdity that he creates himself and hoping no one will notice that he has posed the hard questions, but given nothing in response but the simple morality behind that saccharine, Hollywood ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bold and spectacular experience with plenty of violence and humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Persian Gulf War is the one of the least touched topics Hollywood has brought to the war genre, the war intended to bring down the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein who was running domination over Kuwait. So there aren't a whole lot of films out there centering on the Gulf War, with 'Courage Under Fire' and Jarhead' to name a few. David O. Russell, however, dives deep into height of the Gulf War with this dark comedy set in 1991 during the aftermath. With the war reaching a stopping point, four soldiers: Major Archie Gates (played by George Clooney), Troy Barlow (played by Mark Wahlberg), Chief Elgin (played by Ice Cube), and Conrad Vig (played by Spike Jonze), are delusioned by the lack of action they face during active duty and are on their ways of retirement. This is until one day where they capture an Iraqi prisoner who has a secret map hidden where the sun don't shine. These four soldiers discover the map leads to a hidden gold stolen from Kuwait. They embark on a quest in search of the stolen gold inside the bunker of a base camp filled with Iraqi refugees, but witness a violent uprising by rebels sent by Saddam Hussein. The foursome must make a desperate decision to run off with the gold or save the refugees from the atrocity. This picture isn't your average, everyday war flick that shines the spotlight on the horrors of war and how its dehumanizing effects on soldiers, although there is plenty of combat and death. This film takes a lighthearted turn on portraying the Persian Gulf War, while conveying many liberties. What director David O. Russell makes of this war film is a dark comedy sprinkled with violence, surprising humor, and plenty of liberal political commentary. The plot sets in on the main characters' departure to the base camp where they quickly witness the sadistic rebellion of Iraqis associated with the cruel dictator who has Kuwait under his domination. Mothers, fathers, and children are seen suffering starvation, torture, and vicious beating that become eye sores to the main characters who develop the heart to push their mission aside and save help these poor victims from the atrocious acts. And these scenes lead to some thought-demanding political discussions, including a suggestion that the Iraqis were told by our government to rebel against Saddam Hussein. So the characters express anger against George H. Bush who was the president at the time of the setting that some viewers, particularly Bush fans could take offense to, but at the same time, it generates a bold and powerful political undertone with plenty of surprisingly funny dialogue thrown around as well as some intense, bloody gun fights between the characters and the rebels.The cinematography functions as a great aspect of the film. With the Casa Grande desert in Arizona serving as the backdrop for the Iraqi desert, the film features a oddly saturated picture with high contrast in the bright colors and dark colors to give the the film a look of a film reel lost in the desert. The camera-work really fits the themes of the plot and an inspiring aspect. The cast however, really steals the show here. George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and Spike Jonze give off some spectacular performances. Spike Jonze delights his presence with plenty of comic relief and probably delivers the most comedic lines out of the whole cast. These four actors are very convicted in their roles and demonstrate some great chemistry together. Nora Dunn who plays a journalist who is also an eye-catcher here and perhaps slightly underused. Three Kings is both a bold and spectacular experience sparkled with sheer violence and shocking humor along with a intensely talented cast who knocks the ball out of the park. This is honestly one of the most underrated films by a very talented director, and definitely doesn't quite get the attention it deserves. If you come across this film, this one may be a good pick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Benefits from humour and strong camaraderie, but suffers slightly from weak characterisation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the end of the Gulf War, 4 soldiers acquire a map from the most unlikely of places and discover that this map may contain the whereabouts of some hidden gold close to one of their bases. The 4 men set out on a journey to find the gold, but this is less than straight forward and the 4 men encounter both danger and some unexpected assistance along the way.I haven't read John Ridley's novel (upon which this film is based), but it seems that Russell's has given Three Kings a very tongue-in-cheek feel - this is perfectly fine with me as I'll always prefer a serious film that's laced with humour as opposed to one that is deadly serious throughout its running time. The humorous tone that Russell adopts through most of the film serves it well and the camaraderie is top-notch between the likes of Clooney, Wahlberg and Ice Cube. Although I like serious films with humour thrown in I do think that filmmakers should be careful about how much humour is injected into a film - using war as a backdrop gives the film serious undertones and these undertones shouldn't be forgotten. I personally felt Russell may have overdone things slightly here, but I definitely felt it was a case of more being right than wrong. The soldier's camaraderie is a major strength and it's therefore a shame that Russell makes very little attempt to develop their characters - there is a little insight into Wahlberg's characters life, but nothing is afforded to any of the other characters. Had their characters been developed a little more then it probably would have made it easier to invest in them as people.Despite the picture having a generally humorous tone, Russell still manages to deliver the goods when it's time to get serious. The film has a very realistic feel to it which is probably helped by the fact that some real-life refugees were used in the film's production. I also noted that Mark Wahlberg was actually electrocuted in the scene where he is being tortured - you can't ask for much more realism than that!!! This is perhaps the reason that the film feels so realistic and despite seeming silly at times Russell also remembers to give it a sense of realism as well.Although war and politics play a part in Three Kings it is a film that is more about human values and common decency and whilst it does have some minor weaknesses its many strengths more than outweigh these weaknesses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie after watching the Hollywood Reporter's Director's round table with David O Russell, Quintin Tarantino, Ridley Scott, etc (highly recommend) and was incredibly surprised that I hadn't seen this film before. It has the humour of George Clooney's, The Monuments Men, yet the historical context of a very real issue that faced Iraq in the late 1990's. I love Mark Wahlberg now and in his early years and his performance stood up to my expectations. The outlandish series of events that happens to the protagonists leaves you laughing in your seat without being overbearing. Ice Cube plays his usual comedic relief character and rounds out the cast wonderfully.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three Kings (1999): Dir: David O'Russell / Cast: George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, Mykelti Williamson, Cliff Curtis: Blazing with excitement and suspense circled around three soldiers who accidentally make a difference in the lives of slaves. George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube play three American soldiers who break away from their force and move into occupied Kuwait. They follow a map that leads to a base. They intend to steal gold until harsh treatment towards slaves causes them to take a stand. Director David O'Russell showcases an exploding milk truck and a cow that is in the wrong place at the wrong time. There is an interesting sketch showcasing a bullet in the body and the effect it has. Clooney, Wahlberg and Cube are well cast as three soldiers out for the big steal but end up accepting the consequences for doing right. Clooney leads the mission and Wahlberg ends up a prisoner in a complication that heats the situation even further. Its one weakness is perhaps its flat supporting roles that are overshadowed by the three leads and never develop into anything beyond the surface. In particular, it lacks a strong villain. The film exists more for experience than for themes but it does carry a strong message regarding hope, which indicates that it takes its subject matter more seriously than many films of its kind.

		<fullReview>"Three Kings" is all over the map - sometimes funny, sometimes harrowing action, war/heist movie - and that erratic behavior works in its favor, up to a point. I was onboard and entertained for the movie's first 45 minutes, but then the movie becomes a bit too top-heavy, mired in its anti-war message and the racial tensions. Basically, once Mark Wahlberg is captured, it just sort of slogs. It feels like it's flavored by "Apocalypse Now" (sure seems as long). There's an uplifting (Hollywood) ending that gives the movie back its step, but between those bookends when the gold's in our main characters' possession, it's not nearly as interesting.I get the feeling this would've been a lot more subversive had I seen it 15 years ago. That's on me.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three Kings General Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story follows three soldiers during Desert Storm in Iraq, where they test the ethics put upon them by the US military. They test the morality of themselves when a moment was created of "us or them". They lie, they steal because of greed, they don't follow orders, and for what? In the end to save innocent people from Saddam's dictatorship? Is human life, unknown human life, worth the sacrifice of your life? These are the questions that make you think in this movie and what it makes you face in that moment. My first impressions of the movie were not in favor of the rating you see above. The filmography seemed like a student trying to express their artistic abilities; it did not impress me. Just some shots seemed unnecessary or not appropriate for that particular scene. Some of the satire seemed really inappropriate. This was a time of total unrest and injustice among the Iraqi people. And so to try and make that traumatic experience "light", is honestly a very "white privilege" thing to do. One thing this film captured very well was the political unrest. While you had the peace treaty signed by the two nations, USA and Iraq, it was very hard to trust that as an American soldier or an Iraqi soldier. You had to put all your trust and faith that the other person would uphold that treaty with you. That is one thing the three main characters challenge, is the ethics of the peace treaty, and ultimately it being "us or them". Overall the movie is very good because of the political aspects, and the moral aspects; the testing of right and wrong and does that change depending on the situation? Acting was average, fight scenes were good. Although film will never truly capture the horror of war, this movie gives us a taste of the ability of man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Over the past few years Director David O. Russell has struck Oscar gold with "Silver Lining Playbook" and "American Hustle". Attaching rising mega stars Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper to both hasn't hurt either. Back in the late 90s Russell's first commercial hit was the Gulf War action/satire/adventure "Three Kings" starring a platoon of rising stars including George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube. Obviously they were all known but Clooney was coming of TV's "E.R." and Wahlberg and Ice Cube we're mainly known for their music careers.The story is stationed in Kuwait at the end of the Gulf War in '91. Saddam and his forces have been sent packing. With no major fighting the American troops are painted to look like a bunch of bored teenagers looking for any action they can get into. Many wondering why were there in the first place. Here's a not so subtle hint, they have a lot of oil, and the first President Bush was protecting his investments. American forces are preparing to get the hell out of the desert when Barlow (Wahlberg), Vig (Spike Jonze) and Elgin (Cube) find a map to one of Saddam's stolen gold bunkers hidden in a surrendering Iraqi man's ass.Clooney plays Archie Gate a special forces guy who when not screwing the media, literally, is just waiting out the war so he can retire from active duty. Gates come across the guys and the map and decides they can make a quick and quiet in and out strike to snatch the gold. But of course things happen and they underestimate the danger of their secret operation. Their plan to just grab the gold and run hits a snag when they witness Saddam's Republican Guard soldiers brutalizing and killing civilians. They can't help but get involved in their struggle, but being only a small unit they quickly get in over their heads. They eventually find the gold, but gold is really heavy and can be quite cumbersome to transport. Things get serious were Barlow is taken hostage and Vig is hurt. They get help from the locals but its going to cost them. The action is amazing as well as the visual style from overly bright and bleached out colors of the desert to the sound design. There is also a dark satirical thread throughout as well as more overt humor. It's a fun film all around."Three Kings was the pinnacle of the first part of David O. Russell's career as his next film was the unbelievably awful existential film "I Heart Huckabees". It took six years for his next film and a return to form with "The Fighter". Russell is an extremely talented director and will always be interested in his upcoming films.</fullReview>

However things don't go as planned and complications arise.Spike Jonze and Cliff Curtis give solid support, but for me the stand out in the supporting cast was Sa?d Taghmaoui as Captain Said. His transformation from eager to help the Americans to torturing one, was simply fascinating to watch!! The calmness of his interrogation as he paced calling his captive things like "my main man" and "Bro" was chilling. Some great performances all round, some well shot action scenes, and a good sense of atmosphere all make "Three Kings" a more than above average war time action flick</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Confusing evolution of a relatively simple plot line. Lots of gratuitous violence and strong language. While there were plenty of Saddam's treasures hidden around the country and some GIs may have been tempted by their recovery, the story is essentially far-fetched and grim. A liberal political message, albeit uneven, runs through the dialogue and can be summed up as pretty na?ve. Having spent several weeks in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and along the Iraqi border (in the oil fields) on business days after the conflict ceased in Spring 1991, I found the film basically unpleasant and of minimal entertainment value. Given the intensity of the action, it was hard to judge the individual performances by the key players. I would not wish to see this film again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set amid the confusion at the end of the Gulf war initially I found Three Kings to be really obnoxious, it just left a bad taste in my mouth with all these American soldiers acting like a-hole cowboys, using their guns as toys because they hadn't seen any combat action, shooting stuff up, being racist and running around like they own the country. Hard to find that humorous. I've come to realize though, that may have been the point here.This did get better for me as the movie went along and by the time GI's George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube had sufficiently "disappeared" into the desert with their audacious plans of stealing the stolen Kuwaiti gold, experienced one ridiculous screw up after another so that now their mission is actually helping refugees (Cliff Curtis) and running for their lives. When the obnoxiousness took a back seat, I began to really enjoy this movie and admit to getting several laughs along the way.Ultimately this ended up being much deeper with a bigger message than I had counted on. 9/24/14</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three Kings is a war film that's decent yet formulaic and easy to forget.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film follows Archie Gates (George Clooney), Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg) and Chief Elgin (Ice Cube) as they look for a stash of gold after finding a secret map lodged in a prisoner of war's anus ? the premise is removed from reality to an extent where it loses credibility as both a war film and a piece of drama. The synopsis on the Blu-Ray case says that Three Kings is 'a surreal comedy and a powerful drama of human compassion'. That is the problem with the film, it strives to be two things at once and ultimately fails in succeeding at either.The foundations of its trite, formulaic narrative are laid in the film's early moments. Gates stresses that once they get their gold from the bunker they're getting straight out of there, but naturally their swift plan goes awry when the men's conscience throw them into a union with the noble Iraqi rebels and a bloody conflict with Saddam Hussein's army. This is second-rate Rambo territory, yet it gets over 90% on Rotten Tomatoes.There are moments of style and surrealism, for example there are several scenes that show what happens to one's innards when a bullet passes through them, the effects are terrifically grisly and macabre. The first gunfight is also in a strange, choppy slow motion that's silent apart from loud, single gunshots. However, when the tension, of which there is some I admit, is broken by the sound of American and Iraqi rifles, there is a palpable sense of safety amongst the Americans; despite the overwhelming numbers of Hussein's troops, I never felt that the Three Kings were truly in any danger. Even when Troy is captured and subjected to moments of nasty torture, I wasn't particularly bothered because I knew he'd be rescued. It is Troy's capture that, with a few exceptions, signals the steady decline of the film.Jean Baudrillard said that 'the Gulf War did not take place', referring to how the United States-led coalition engaged in a war of safe distances with vastly superior technology. Baudrillard also believed that the media coverage was mere simulacrum, a sanitised recreation of events that ignored Iraqi suffering and championed US objectives. Seasoned journalist Adriana Cruz (Nora Dunn) is a personification of this, she's depicted as being self-centred and interested only in her career rather than her subject. There's a scene where she cries at the sight of oil slathered animals, however it's quite apparent that she's really mourning the absence of a good story.Baudrillard's notions are corroborated in exchanges between Troy and Iraqi Captain Said (Said Taghmaoui) that serve as the film's main moments of war moralising. With Troy bound to a chair and wired with electric cables, Said tells him that his son died in the bombing of Baghdad, asking Troy how he'd feel if his daughter was killed in similar circumstances, a thought that he acknowledges as sheer hypothesis 'Very nice for you bro, she's safe in Arizona without the bombs and concrete'. The impact of this scene is intensified by cutaway clips that visualise their dialogue of war and death; despite Said's torture of Troy, the scene highlights fundamental similarities between the two men, giving Said humanity. Indeed, the film succeeds in giving many of the Iraqi characters a sense of identity. Despite of all this, I felt the film was following the well trodden path of Hollywood war moralising in a rather hackneyed manner.After what feels longer than 110 minutes, the film confirms just how formulaic it is when its farcical story is wrapped up so very neatly, it sucks out any modicum of credibility that may have remained. What's left is a film that is by no means terrible but a rather mediocre affair with the odd flash of political commentary and explosive spectacle that has been done better elsewhere. I shouldn't be too surprised by its mediocrity, after all who talks about Three Kings anymore? It certainly hasn't entered the pantheon of great war films, it didn't make the impact that The Hurt Locker did. Many would forget that the director of Silver Linings Playbook (okay) and American Hustle (hideously overrated) once made a war film, and I may do too.64%www.hawkensian.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty decent war romp.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Gulf War is a neglected subject for movie making, with most choosing to avoid the messy politics of the desert engagement against Iraq. David O'Russell dives head first into a witty satire that simultaneously lampoons and chastises American involvement in Kuwait. In the most recent Iraq war, there were stories of US Military taking advantage of Saddam's wealth in the confusion of the 2003 invasion. It is somewhat fitting then, that the screenplay opens as a gold hunt in the prequel to the recent Gulf War. When Sergeant Troy (former rapper Wahlberg) and his squadmate Conrad (director Spike Jonze) find a map shoved up the backside of an Iraqi prisoner, deciphering out it leads to Saddam's stolen stash of Kuwaiti bullion in an underground bunker. Soon, Special Forces operative Archie Gates (Clooney) and Chief (former rapper Ice Cube) join to lead a secret heist mission on the stash before they pull out for good, and before their commander finds out. Right off the bat the premise is intriguing and the actors do a fine job as a rag tag group of thieves. Even better is the sardonic tone of the film, with screwball jokes and inventive, shocking imagery that dispels the myths of the '24 hour news channel war' as it was shown in the US. Unfortunately, caper plot is soon ditched in favour of a more Hollywood message, and with it goes the pacing, replaced with overt social commentary that doesn't always work. There are still a handful of great scenes in the second half; Wahlberg being captured and tortured by the sadistic Iraqi Guard, and asked why America made Michael Jackson white... Another scene shows the gory effects of what air pressure can do to a collapsed lung... But from then on, the film slows to a crawl in a feel good sentiment for your fellow man that seems out of place compared to the first half. Still, worth watching for the black humour and farce that is so enjoyable in the beginning.</fullReview>

Surprisingly this simple attitude seems to lead to an almost perfect ending even in the middle of a war. Perhaps the world will be a much better place with no wars if all of us can think in that way, and has the courage to carry it out. Btw U2's "in God's country" is a fantastic choice for the ending song.

		<shortDescription>A harsh and critical look at the first gulf war.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably the first decent movie set in the Gulf War. There have been others, but they have been B grade movies simply for the action and showing how bad the Iraqi's were and how good the American's were. Three Kings gets to the heart of the war and explores numerous things that were criticised about it. In fact, Three Kings is a black comedy that has some very critical themes about a war that has been heavily criticised.The movie is about three soldiers who find the map to a bunker hidden on an Iraqi prisoner, so they decide to go and find the gold hidden in the map, and are found out by an officer, who decides to head up the expedition. They find the gold and take it, but are watching some poor villagers getting severely abused by Iraqi soldiers. They decide to intervene and thus find themselves being chased by soldiers who know that they are doing things not sanctioned by their government, and are also forced to escort refugees across the desert to Iran.The movie's main focus is on the plight of these refugees. When the war had ended, George Bush encouraged the Iraqi people to revolt, but when they did, they found that the Americans were not going to help them. As such they found themselves being slaughtered by Iraqi soldiers. I remember when that was happening, except George Bush's commands were not emphasised. What was emphasised was that the Iraqi's were attacking poor innocent villagers, and nobody said anything about these villagers revolting against Sadam at the urgence of the Americans.This raises the question of the right to sovereignty. This same question arose during the Bay of Pigs episode, where the Americans encouraged Cuban refugees to storm Cuba and take back their land, only to pull out at the last minute. The US was criticised heavily in regards to their actions here, and what this movie is showing us is that the US betrayed the Iraqi people, and then denied any claim (as is seen by the later new reports that neglected to say anything about it). Then they went on to accuse the Iraqi's of genocide, when they were only responding to attacks made by rebels (though the Iraqi soldiers are not portrayed in a very favourable light in this movie anyway).Another thing that is emphasised in this movie is the lack of actual fighting. Though people are shot and killed in the movie, there is an emphasis that fighting is not wanted, and the effects of bullet wounds are drawn out to a squimish level. Even then, at the beginning we get the idea that many of the soldiers never even saw action. The only fight that the main characters got into was when they shot a surrendering Iraqi, and even then it is exaggerated at a later date.There is one scene where the whole purpose of the war is debated. It is a debate between an Iraqi and an American. The American is talking about sovereignty for a state and that it is illegal to invade another country. To this, the Iraqi replies that the only reason the Americans came to help Kuiwait is for one thing, and then pours oil into the soldier's mouth. Very brutal and gruesome, but it is a point that is trying to be portrayed. No matter what is said, countries that have been invaded in the past, such as Tibet, have been completely ignored while Kuwait, with an important natural resource, is helped out almost immediately.This discussion between the Iraqi and the American soldier is also interesting on another level. In a way it shows that while they are on opposing sides, they are in fact the same. This reminds me of the scene in All Quiet on the Western Front where the German and the French soldier are caught in the crater together. Both joined the army for extra money for the families, except the American's family is back home, living safely on the other side of a moat, while the Iraqi's family was killed in a bomb strike. The way that such scenes are used, where the ceiling falls on to the sleeping child, is another way that this film impacts us.It is also ironic, with all of America's military technology, that they could not assist the people of Somalia.</fullReview>

From the beginning that is the end of Gulf War I (why do we insist on numbering Wars?. It is such a surrender) we are injected into a chaotic celebration/complacent situation and it sets the tone for the duration. Nobody really has a clue. "Are we shooting People or what?", asks a slightly befuddled American Soldier. From there we are on an over the top of the desert dune heist romp that draws from the best Anti-War Movies and Real Life Headlines. The burning oil fields, the oil-soaked Pelicans..."I have done that story to death", says a TV Reporter. Yesterday's carnage and mayhem along with Eco-cruelty are only good for a News Cycle or two.Everyone is in a manic mode here and all the Performers seem to be clicking away at the same speed. Even the Arab Characters, Good and Bad. The writing is quick-witted and off handed enough to get Isolationist applaud. But Politics are secondary in this more personal Story of Soldiers and refugees.This is an offbeat and truly effective Movie that is timeless. Probably will gain even more in reputation as the Years unfold and more Folks see this almost forgotten satiric Gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happens when naivety and cynicism are forced to confront a more complex world. . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three Kings takes a quirky, unpredictable look at the aftermath of the first Iraq war, and shows what happens to cynical selfishness, dumb innocence, and dogged obedience when the soldiers who embody these qualities have to face the truth of what they were involved with. At first, for the characters played by Mark Wahlberg, Spike Jonze, Ice Cube and George Clooney, a chance to score some of Saddam Hussein's Kuwaiti loot looks like nothing more than a way of adding luxury to life after this last duty tour comes to an end. But as the four follow a grotesquely-discovered map to find Saddam's bunkers, they encounter the complex truths of the conflict between the ruler's Republican Guard and ordinary Iraqi citizens, they discover a morality greater than their own plans for material wealth. Finally, they make choices from a clearer understanding of what really matters in life, their choices made clearer, if not easier, by what they've seen and learned. Newton Thomas Sigel's cinematography is superb, and amplifies the purpose and effect of George O. Russell's direction. The barren heat of the desert, and the vulnerability of soldiers and civilians trapped in the sands as enemies advance, is captured with lurid clarity. And the jagged violence erupts shockingly, visually and aurally, from moments of banal interaction, in a way which Sigel records masterfully. Like all excellent films about war, Three Kings makes its audience confront the ambiguity of what everyone wishes was a clear-cut clash between good and evil. For American audiences, I suspect, it presets an uncomfortable vision of a nation's obedient soldiers led into war by a trite, empty rationalization, and the dramatisation of uncomfortable truths about the collateral damage inflicted by imperialism. Only Clooney's character has a larger perspective at first, and even he's bent by a predilection for the main chance. The others are innocents abroad, and that's a vision which can easily end in tears. There is redemption in this film, though, and the soldiers who exchange solemn waves with escaping refugees at the end of Three Kings are men who will live different lives when they return to the States. This is a surprising film, a must-see for everyone interested in the difference between simplistic ideology and the complexity of human experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At Junior School in the UK it was an occasional treat for teachers to take the entire class of youngsters to the cinema to see supposedly morally uplifting films. This was broadly interpreted as any old tat so long as it featured Baby Jesus and/or Adult Jesus. Bonus points were added if gruesome crucifixions were also present. A good example of this was "Ben Hur". It was convenient to ignore the fact that well-oiled scantily-clad men in homo-erotic situations were the mainstay of these films or that gyrating scantily-clad women of ill virtue filled the screen for long lingering minutes whilst we were supposed to reflect on what bad lots they were. A good crucifixion always cancelled out other ultra-violence such as body mangling in chariot racing or mauling by stuffed lions. How can we ever calculate the damage done to impressionable minds by these mad educational policies?Anyway, I propose that Three Kings be given the same treatment i.e. all American children between the ages of 5 and 11 should be compelled to go to a movie theatre and see this film. Why? Because hidden in this load of old tat is both an adventure film that they would enjoy and a couple of morally important messages (Viz. i) America doesn't give a toss about democracy and acts only out of self interest and ii) violence is actually pretty horrible and has bloody consequences which are graphically portrayed here). No one will ever notice that these messages get hopelessly tangled up in a nutty screenplay that definitely wants to have its cake and eat it too.George Clooney (for it is he) leads a team of Americans in an attempt to steal gold belonging to Saddam Hussein. This is all for personal profit. But the team gradually realise the consequences on the locals who are being oppressed by Saddam's soldiers and suffering even though the war is over and they expect the Americans to pick up the pieces. It all ends with the gold being shared out with the locals and the lot of them being escorted over the Iraqi border against express US wishes. Although it seems to me that the film conveys a clear anti-American sentiment I'm not convinced people will get that unless they want to get it. For one thing the oldish guy behind me in the theatre kept muttering loudly "kill 'em, shoot 'em!" whenever ANY non-American appeared on screen. Obviously it was too subtle for him.Anyway, Clooney is good (surprise!). In "The Peacemaker" I was convinced that Nicole Kidman should have been cast as the tough guy and Clooney as the one who hangs back and looks decorative. But he's been working on his designer stubble and gruff voice and this time I could believe he was a Special Forces vet. The Wild Bunch shenanigans are well orchestrated and the twists in the tale well executed.What's weird is the odd mixture of techniques and ideas that get thrown in. At one point slo-mo is used to track flying bullets. Elsewhere fantasy flashbacks occur, interior damage caused by bullets is animated, cows explode, heads roll, jokes come thick and fast. This film has everything. I'm just not entirely convinced that it should have everything. Despite the usual ultra-violence Clooney still manages to have the kind of sex with a woman where she doesn't take off either her knickers or her bra and he doesn't even bother with a stunt butt. They just do it in their clothes and presumably no bodily fluids are ever secreted, let alone exchanged. Seconds later limbs fly, blood gouts, killing occurs. You have to admit it's a funny old world, don't you? No genitals allowed but might consider it if they are briefly shown whilst being shot off in military action. No wonder the world's screwed up.So in summary this is a completely deranged film with a worthwhile message that many will miss. It uses many interesting and innovative techniques. The adventure is adventurous. Clooney is cool. It's absurdly funny in places. It's a mess. It didn't ought to work but it does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quirky war movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This political thriller is pretty much the last word on the whole Gulf War shambles. Along with that, it also manages to be frequently funny, tragic and exciting. Personally, the only movies I've seen that have dealt with the Gulf War have been superficial "action man" stuff, boring and predictable. This movie takes a simple gun battle and shoots it in a way that makes it unique and totally original. We watch the bullets fly in slow motion to their victims, a bullet's p.o.v. shot if you will. Back when I first saw this over a decade ago, it made me sit up and go "wow!". Nowadays such stylistic tricks are passe, but it was still hip and fresh when they made this film.As was the case with THE LIMEY, the weird style of the film takes some getting used to, but once I was settled in I enjoyed this immensely. What starts off as a predictable treasure hunt becomes something much more, an intelligent film which isn't afraid to portray America in a bad light, and something with real characters who you care about.George Clooney has just the right looks and easy, leading man personality to carry the film if needed. Mark Wahlberg (a hot property thanks to BOOGIE NIGHTS) is solid in a victimised role. Elsewhere, Ice Cube puts in a good turn as a god-fearing soldier, while Spike Jonze is funny and endearing as a backwoods hick.THREE KINGS offers up just the right balance of humour, pathos and action to make it a film for all the family. While it may be occasionally explicitly violent (the shooting of a female refugee is particularly shocking), this is in reality a film which appeals AGAINST violence. With a great story and script like this, it couldn't really lose in any case. It may not be one of the best films of 1999 (in itself a great year for good movies) but it comes pretty close.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though David O. Russell chose a subject that has already largely been transcribed on screen, he deserves credit for developing an unusual story and from an angle that stands out from one could have expected, kind of like the more recent Jarhead.Three Kings mixes up more or less skilfully and ironical aspect and a more serious tone. It is a laudable attempt but the result doesn't match the expectations and this mixture of genres turns out to be counter-productive as the viewer doesn't really know where to stand.The movie also suffers from a big dynamism problem: it starts well, but once the hour is reached, the script struggles and a false rhythm sets until the final 15-20 minutes where it regains interest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War isn't hell, stupid! It's quirky, wacky, surreal fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you know nothing about the first Gulf War, then you should see Three Kings. It's true that after watching it, you won't know much about the first Gulf War, but you will know that during that war, more milk was spilled than blood, explosive cows were a very real threat and you couldn't be a journalist without landing yourself in some downright wacky situations. Films like Platoon, Full Metal Jacket and Saving Private Ryan have showed us that war is hell. But what those movies don't show us is that sometimes war is wacky ...and quirky ...and charmingly surreal. War is not filled with traumatic events that make you contemplate your own existence. No sir! It's filled with unusual events that make you reflect on modern age confusion in a world so globalized that Iraqi soldiers stockpile blue jeans and cellular phones. And as the quirkiness unfolds, we witness Ice Cube throw an explosive football at a helicopter. A truly cubular throw, sir! We delight in the antics of a redneck idiot put in place for comic relief and oh jee wiz, he is so funny that we forget that he's an ignorant manchild who never had any place holding a rifle. Watch as Ice Cube tries to convince this Judas Priest loving trailer trash that easy listening is the best pre-game music when it comes to engaging the enemy. And if we're not listening to Air Supply, we get a bit of Beach Boys as the three kingsized egos roll into a town where you half expect Tusken Raiders to jump out and bark like sea lions. But that's only if John Wayne doesn't rise from the dead and say "This is my kinda movie." Did I mention we also get to see Marky Mark's internal organs? If you like films that constantly wink at you, then sit back and enjoy as infamously egomaniacal director David O. Russell proceeds to give wink after wink while trying to convince you that he is so much more subversive and challenging than Michael Bay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A action-heist-comic-zany hybrid of a war movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lets gets this straight first, do not expect the usual fare you would take from viewing your average war movie. The fact this movie takes place during an actual period during the American militarized intervention of the Iraq/Kuwait conflict, specifically the end of it, should be taken as a hint for off-beat things to come. But do expect to be entertained in a completely different and truly unique way, especially for a war film.The storyline is a highly interesting premise. Simply put, "A heist movie during a war" I believe is the most popular way to get the films plot line around if the goal is to use one sentence. But I'll give a little more detail.Firstly the intro to the film allows director David O. Russell to prove to you, the viewer, that this is not your garden variety war/action film as a confused soldier (played by Mark Wahlberg) spots an Iraqi soldiers in the distance during a scouting movement, and whilst trying to find out if he is actually allowed to fire on enemy soldiers (he gets little confirmation from fellow confused comrades) he possibly mistakes the Iraqi's hand gestures as a threat and promptly fires on him, killing him with a wound to the neck. The confusing scene highlights a dark comic edge that prevails throughout the film, and casts light on the many problems that American troops dealt with in the war, namely confusion.The Plot - During the final days of the Gulf war a quartet of soldiers, through chance, come across a map which divulges the secrets to the whereabouts of stolen Kuwaiti gold safeguarded by still present Iraqi troops. They are led by disillusioned Special Forces trooper Archie Gates (George Clooney) whom devises a plan to steal it, manipulating the men into doing so by promising an end to their "day jobs" and using his authority. Amongst his band of merry men are new parent and homesick straight man Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg) and his smaller southern pal Conrad Vig (Spike Jonze), whose childlike precociousness, hero worship of Troy Barlow and general American bravado falls flat against the realities of actual war and prove comic highlights for the film. And rounding out the group is the religious and pragmatic Chief Elgin who is on an apparent "paid vacation from Detroit". While the heist (after some initial failure) works, the groups plans are veered off course when conscience gets the better of the men when they learn of the brutal fate local villagers will be subjected to by the Iraqi soldiers who were guarding the gold once they leave. This in turn kicks off a chain of events that leads to a standoff between the combined forces of the American thieves with the aid of local militia against the Iraqi army.The movie is full of scenes and situations that are surreal in nature (Cow go boom, for example) and downright absurd for a film set in a war. You will literally take at least 5 personal favourite tidbits from the movie which will undoubtedly pop into your head at the oddest of moments. The film is shot is a very unique style, so unique that a preface is added to the start of the film to explain it, plus lots of odd angled camera-work and colour correction. But don't worry, it is nothing too experimental and suitably will add to your enjoyment of the film. The quality of the writing is also on par with the style and story of the film and you will be surprised how many one liners the characters manage to get out, as even they are as perplexed by the situation as it spirals into zanier tangents, even in the heat of battle. Also of note is the acting, needless to say there is not a dud amongst the bunch, and the supporting cast all play finely in tune within the film, of special note are Judy Greer, Nora Dunn and even Jamie Kennedy (whose performance as a inept soldier is funny enough to make you wonder why he went down the current route that is now his career).David O. Russell makes clear his feelings on war, and this is without a doubt an anti war movie, albeit one where the theme of anti-war is hidden amongst a wild storyline merging with realistic characterizations. As always the film depicts those who suffer as the innocents who happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, villagers starve, political prisoners are tortured, fear and intimidation are used to dominate, even violence is part of the world these people inhabit, a world with little chance of thriving and less so of escape. Americans on the other hand are portrayed as juvenile or un-caring jobsworths whom are happy to leave the downtrodden to their plight as long as they get to go home to their day jobs. And the Iraqi troops are portrayed as idiotic, backward, sadists. You really get the feeling that although the Americans are portrayed in less than positive light, the Iraqis are foolish plebs taken in from the outskirts of Nowhere, Iraq slapped with a uniform, gun and mission and simply left to their vices during downtime. Although they are fleshed out by one character, an "interrogator" whom although American schooled, now fights for the Iraq National Guard, reveals a deeper pathos to his cruelty than one would suspect or attempt to identify with.To finish, don't expect a good war movie, or even a war movie, this film has a deeper sense of itself than that, although there are a great number of highly suspenseful action filled moments. David O. Russell is known for his temper and I can only imagine him in a desert, but this film is a brilliant and kooky picture that's sure to stay with you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>KELLY'S HEROES without the ragtag.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>War is not just Hell. In THREE KINGS, it is confusing as Hell.Four American soldiers behind enemy lines on a mission; they're not here to win a battle, they're here to rob a bank.If the plot sounds familiar, it is KELLY'S HEROES for the morally ambiguous generation. THREE KINGS is a stunning, ferocious black comedy; heavy action, heavy emotion, heavier incongruity, as a troop of American soldiers in Iraq attempts to steal Saddam Hussein's gold.March 1991. "The war just ended." That's Iraq 1, Bush 1. Troops don't know what to do with themselves; they have no orders, they have no clue. Everything is not as clearly defined as WWII, where "Ze Chermans" were the unequivocal bad guys. This is Father Bush's idiot war of choice (as opposed to Iraq 2003, Bush Jnr's idiot war of choice).Across a flat expanse of desert, an Iraqi appears in the distance, and an American soldier calls to his distracted peers, "Are we shooting?" No one knows.During a roundup of Iraqi prisoners, a map is pulled out of an Iraqi soldier's butt. Soldiers Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg), Chief Elgin (Ice Cube) and Conrad Vig (Spike Jones), led by cynic soldier Archie Gates (George Clooney), formulate a plan to go AWOL for half a day to steal what's on the map - Saddam Hussein's gold bullion stash - under the pretense they are distributing it to the wronged people of Iraq.Nothing goes as planned.And nothing is as it seems in this hell hole waste land: they attack the location on the butt map - no gold; they notice civilian Iraqis clustering around a well - soldiers in disguise guarding a subterranean vault; the gold bars are not in sturdy roadcases - they're in cheap tourist suitcases; a gun battle is a few strategic shots, not sexy slomo spraying of bullets; they shoot up an oil tanker - it is full of milk!; sinister Iraqis garbed like STAR WARS Sand People rescue Archieand his crew and lug the clinking gold bars to a safe haven underground; like Viet Nam, the hostiles look like the friendlies, so no one knows who and when to shoot; and the press and military alike have no idea why they are there, exemplified in the miscast Nora Dunn (SNL) as a self-serving reporter and doofus Jamie Kennedy as her military liaison.And so the movie goes, every scene filled with strange actions and reactions. The four soldiers stumble on a group of hostage Iraqis, led by Cliff Curtis - over their avarice, they find their souls; realize they must help these people... then steal the gold.Director David O. Russell tells us via opening text: "The makers of THREE KINGS use visual distortion and unusual colors in some scenes in this film. They intentionally use these unconventional techniques to enhance the emotional intensity of the story line." Shouldn't that be something us cucumber reviewers tell you? Spike Jonze warbles the tenuous thematic link: "We three kings be stealin' the gold..."; Ice Cube loves playing soldier in his 'flage - at least all his guns are legal now; Clooney is decisive as a pouncing lion, and Marky Mark somehow finds an excuse to get his shirt off (even if it's Iraqis ripping it off to torture him).The torture scene is also a confusing revelation to all those inculcated to believe Middle Easterners are one-dimensional sadists, as the torturers cover their eyes while electrocuting Barlow (Wahlberg). The interrogator asks, "What is the problem with Michael Jackson?" At first, big laugh - then the biting indictment behind the question, "He is the King of Pop of sick country. A black man make the skin white and the hair straight - and you know why? Your sick country make the black man hate himself. Just like you hate the Arab and the children you bomb over here." The interrogator describes his family's death, with the roof falling in on his son, "Can you think how it must feel?" We almost ally with the Iraqis during that scene. Until we see Marky's abs.In the most amusing cultural flashpoint, Archie invokes, "George Bush wants you to unite against Saddam!" This was back in the day when the Bush name could incite fevered excitement in Iraqis. Last time that'll ever happen...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie. It's gritty and violent and serious, but the story is offbeat and told with style, meaning there's much fun to be had. Some absurdity in the midst of serious danger makes this a great black comedy. And the movie makes you think.Right after the end of the first Gulf War, four American soldiers steal away from camp in search of Saddam's secret stash of gold. The soldiers are outsiders in a strange land and find themselves caught in the utter chaos of post-Desert Storm Iraq. Saddam's forces are fighting a rebel uprising, with Iraqi civilians in harm's way. The American soldiers only want the gold, and are not authorized to interfere with the civil unrest in any case. But priorities can change. The movie shows several sides to the conflict and ponders what war is all about. (Freedom? Politics? Publicity? Oil?)There are moments of serious reflection, but also some really fun bits, an inspired soundtrack, and a terrific cast of characters. Director David O. Russell really impresses with some very creative flourishes and his offbeat script speaks for itself.AWOL treasure seekers? Nerf football skeet shooting? Classic pop tunes in the desert? Secret bunkers of confiscated valuables? Dangerous minefields? Competing TV war correspondents? And a compelling wartime setting? Count me in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Three Kings" is the movie that introduced me to David O. Russell's freshly original style of film-making, and now I place him in a category of next-generation directors, that includes others like Wes Anderson, Alexander Payne and Paul Thomas Anderson, who are reinvigorating American cinema."Three Kings" takes place during the first Gulf War and criticizes the U.S. for its habit of coming in to save repressed people without having plans in place to sustain the new orders they put in place. Once the Americans leave, the same problems plaguing these regions before they arrived just return to start the cycle over. Sound familiar? Russell's film is brisk and funny while still managing to be serious and poignant, a delicate balance he's able to achieve in almost every movie he's made.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern war action with a timeless moral</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personal and human interests butt heads in "Three Kings," a Gulf War action flick from David O. Russell. Following the Gulf War cease-fire four soldiers (Clooney, Wahlberg, Ice Cube and Jonze) plan to take gold stolen by Saddam Hussein during the invasion of Kuwait so they can live well for the rest of their lives. What seems like a simple operation turns life-threatening when the soldiers run into a group of Iraqi refugees in desperate need of their help.If "Three Kings" hadn't been released years before George W. Bush and the Iraq War, it would've made a heck of a propaganda film. Much of the movie's inner-conflict is created because of the discord between the greedy self-interests of the soldiers and their difficulty simply turning their backs on Iraqi refugees who would surely be killed by Saddam's soldiers without them. The film calls on the humanitarian responsibility of countries such as the United States. In 1999 that's just a thematic message, but in the context of 2003 or later, it would definitely come across as political.But politics aside, Russell's film is a very real one. "Three Kings" is more than just good suspense and a decent amount of thrilling explosions for this reason; it offers important moral questions and portrays soldiers as more than just men trained to "kill (insert any number of derogatory nicknames for Muslims here)." The characters are flawed men governed by self-interest, but they are challenged and tested throughout the film as we all are at times, just not within the context of danger and war.Clooney, Wahlberg and Ice Cube all convey the inner tension fairly well, although the film still thrives mostly upon action and suspense rather than dramatic performances. Russell does make some excessive or bizarre choices, such as a C.S.I-like graphic of one of the character's insides -- guts and all -- after he sustains a bullet wound, but Russell mostly exercises good taste."Three Kings" is an effective morality tale set in a modern war context and fitted with gunshots and explosions. It's solid film with something good to say.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all let me just say that I don't normally watch Gulf War or War movies in general especially giving the current status in Iraq I feel that no one is to blame for that apart from America it-self. However having said that my fears were totally quashed whilst watching Three Kings as most of it was actually built on factual information of the horrors caused by Saddam and his regime during the first Gulf War. Three Kings follows the tail of oddly enough 4 U.S. soldiers who go about to steal a gold Kuwaiti bullion from right underneath Saddam's nose. The film start's of as a roller coaster of jokes and wise cracks but then changes gears very quickly as the adventure unfolds and I guess thats what keeps the audience hooked on it. The acting from everyone was very good and the scenery costume etc was all well done giving it that stylish look to it as you would see on the news. To sum it up, keep your political opinions to ones side giving the current state of Iraq and check this movie as entertainment value and nothing else although it seems a little dated by now and it does drag in places but it is still good time pass/fantasy.THREE KINGS 8.8 OUT OF 10IN A WAR WITHOUT HEORES , THERE ARE KINGS!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The premise for the film is kind of unlikely, but rather amusing.Most of the film is kind of unlikely, in fact, but it doesn't matter because it entertains.Another good thing is that the characters all seem somehow vivid and recognizable. This is not a film where the heroes wear white, and the bad guys wear black. The film tries to portray everybody, even villains and minor characters, as having real, and sympathetic motivations.It doesn't patronize us by trying to feed us a simple, tedious morality tale.The film also tries to strip away cultural and religious differences, and really focuses in on the plight of the Iraqis. It challenges us to try and be perceptive, and understand the mindset of people who live under a completely different paradigm to ourselves. If only the modern media would credit us with that much intelligence.If I have any complaints about the film, it's that the overall story didn't really grab me. But even so, I can't deny that I had fun watching it.</fullReview>

I had a similar impression in watching Coppola's 'Apocalipse Now' back in 1978. The editing and the soundtrack are also very well done. The movie uses a wonderful and successful way to translate emotions and atmosphere by shooting many scenes in a particular light, sequence and frame speed to reinforce the dramatic element. Never too much nor too soon or too late. The use of subjective camera serves its purpose in the tradition of classic filmaking and allows the audience the chance to participate intensively in the action, feeling the wide range of emotions at the right level.

		<fullReview>Sure it may not be the biggest blockbuster war movie, but Three Kings has a lot of things others don't have. It has got a sense of humor that we have never seen, it shows all sides of a war instead of just one side, and it is the first real war movie set in the Gulf War. The movie is set right after the war ends and follows four soldiers who go in search of millions of dollars in gold bricks that Saddam stole from Kuwait. The grainy looking film it uses gives the movie a unique and vivid look that works great with the film's theme. The acting is also one of the film's high points. George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, and Ice Cube give some of their best performances. Spike Jonze and Jamie Kennedy provide some of the movie's most hilarious moments, and Nora Dunn is great as the journalist trying to find a story that hasn't been done. The writing is really great, especially in the scenes in which Troy (Wahlberg) is captured and interrogated. As we learn about him and his interrogator, we learn that they are pretty much the same person who grew up on different sides of the world. I think this is a very important movie everyone should see, especially now. 9/10</fullReview>

Some excellently filmed action scenes ensue in which everyone fights everyone. Spoiler Alert!The letdown of an ending finds that the nobility of human nature overcomes its greed. Yeah, right! Where are the Three Kings? Who knows. We can count four, or maybe five. Possibly six, or maybe 150. But not Three! This movie asks us to accept some incredible stretches. And then when we do, it gives us pap and pablum. None of the characters capture our interest, as none are even slightly developed. We therefore must take everyone at face value, so they all come off as cardboard cut-outs in well-filmed and well-choreographed debacle.

The camera techniques in relation to the lighting and the colour are a little weird but the story and the characters make up for that drawback. Everything looks so realistic in the movie as well, the battle scenes, the rescuing of the refugees, etc. After the movie was over I was waiting and waiting and waiting for it to come video to buy and once it did I bought it right away. It is definetely one of my top five movies of all time, right up there with Payback and Under Siege.

		<fullReview>Certainly the best Gulf War Film, an honor shared with Friedkin's `Rules of Engagement'. Politically incorrect and unpredictable, this film couldn't be made after 2001, as the world affairs and mainstream conservatism took over Hollywood's most edgy expressions. It's like a `Treasure of the Sierra Madre' transferred to the Iraqi desert. Never mind the weak ending, a film where a Chicago song could work in a symbolic system, deserves every possible acclaim.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is your only spoiler warning...'Three Kings' has so much energy that it's a shame when it degenerates into notions of "nobility" and "humanity". 'Kings' tries convincing that right can result from war when, in reality, war ends with "a whimper". Yes, 'Apocalypse Now' is better, but 'Kings' dares you to call it pedestrian.'Kings' knows the reference to 'Apocalypse' will result, so it makes fun of it with the Beach Boys in place of Wagner and throws in its own tricks including internal bodily views.The creation of a different environment begins with the photographic process and how the desert itself is shot. In that sense, it is the most surreal visual experience of war since Coppola. That vision is augmented by video game sound effects, the idea that war is a game or that nothing feels real.The characters themselves are mixes of what we've seen and haven't seen before. We've seen Wahlberg, Jonze, and Clooney before ('Saving Private Ryan', 'Platoon', and 'MASH' respectively), but it's Ice Cube that plays against stereotype...he prefers "easy listening".Overall, this is one of the best war movies in the last several years after loads of garbage.Final Analysis = = Learn from this...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different take on War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the worst difficulties in film is getting the 'right' light. On the plus side, shoot a movie in the desert, and this will not be an issue.PLOT: Guns of Navarone Gulf Soldiers of the first Bush era find opportunity to seize a piece of Arabian Gold. We are immersed in a feeble nation gone mad, surrendering to CNN crews. It plays just like a country song: Then the true meaning of liberation happens.Well done movie. A war movie where the war is a sub plot. A heist movie where the war is the backdrop. Great acting by the cast, great directing and cinematography. Good action and plot twists. Ultimately you understand that the movie is not about the war, nor the gold, rather, culture conflicts in the desert. We get a cheesy Hollywood ending, but it is justified after what you go through during the rest of the flik. Bottom Line: I would recommend it to anyone who likes war movies, heist movies, social commentary movies, or just people who like good films with a good all around cast &amp; crew</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A SATIRE WITH INNOVATIVE CINEMATOGRAPHY</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the first instance, what are striking about this movie, is its cinematography, its camera-work, and the computer graphics used, to create certain scenes. Considering these elements, the movie almost certainly ?appears' superficially like a Chemical Brothers video. From the beginning to the end, the movie is chaotic. Now, the movie is most certainly a two-hour Chemical Brothers video. As a matter of fact the movie is full of contemporary music-artists: Ice Cube, Marky Mark, and a prominent music-video director, Spike Jonze. Moreover, Spike has infact directed a couple of Chemical Brothers videos. So, there is a definite connection between Chemical Brothers and Three Kings. Actually, the slick and sleek look of the movie makes it very interesting to watch and to be studied. But, there is a lot more to this flick, than merely its skin-deep look. There is much beyond to this flick than its masterfully created outward façade. Three kings is a brilliant satire. Mainly during its first half, the movie shows American soldiers act like Hollywood heroes, frivolously doing things as they please, at the expense of the hapless people, who they actually are supposed to protect. In point of fact, this very first half is funny as well as grossly heartless. One can either laugh one's heart out during the first half, or at the same time one can feel really sick in the gut, for some of the really gruesome scenes, treated humorously and with aberrant detachment. But, herein lies the sarcasm of the flick.The second half of the movie is more hearted and thought-provoking than its first half. If ?satire' is the word for the first half, then ?irony' is the word for the second half. In the second half, the four protagonists set out to selfishly search for gold, actually end up doing just the opposite of what they intended to do, leading to the very warm-hearted end.This movie is definitely not the quintessential war movie. It stresses on frivolity of the human nature, with war just as a backdrop. A humorous, satirical, thought-provoking movie like Three Kings, shot brilliantly using fresh, new cinematographic techniques is very much a movie worth watching, more than once. RATING: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film opens as a great satire on war: Americans at war, journalism, the craziness of war, naked greed, and people doing anything they need to in order to survive. Nora Dunn gives a ferocious performance as a veteran reporter embedded with the troops during the first US-Iraq conflict. Director Russell also elicits great performances from Ice Cube and Mark Wahlberg.Unfortunately, Nora Dunn's character goes missing during much of the middle section of the movie, and a Hollywood resolution mars an ending that seemed to be headed toward the grim and bitter. (Perhaps military commanders have softened since the days of "Dr. Strangelove.")But along the way, Dunn, Ice Cube, and Wahlberg demonstrate that they are worthy of any serious and demanding films that may come their way.

		<shortDescription>A critical view of Gulf War I</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is hard to watch, especially when we are intrenched in another war with Saddam Hussein, but it is an excellent study of the conditions of the Iraqi people after the war. The movie starts just after the cease-fire agreement between Iraq and the U.S. was signed under Bush Sr.Filmed with shots of bleak desert landscape, and clever editing to give what seems a surreal accent to parts of the movie, it is the story of four three U.S. army men and one Special Forces major who set out, having found a map in the butt of an Iraqi troop, to uncover the stolen Kuwaiti bullion and put all their troubles behind. George Clooney is appropriately cynical as Major Archie Gates, who is set to retire soon from Special Forces, and seems content screwing one of the female reporters. Mark Wahlberg has probably one of the harrder parts of playing Troy Barlow, a new father who has too much to lose to get involved when they decide to help the refugees against the Republican Guard, but is still submitted to torture in a scene that is truly unnerving. Spike Jonze, for the time that he is on screen, adds some humorous moments as an ignorant, uneducated redneck soldier who sees Barlow as his role model and wants to see some action while he's there. The movie's only relief comes in unexpected bits of comedy, in what could be described as a black comedy/war film. The movie never lets the viewer forget the antiwar message, and the beaurocracy which allowed so many innocent people die who could have been saved if we intervened.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unique War Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen the trailer in TV, I expected an entertaining and funny war/adventure movie. But my expectations were disappointed - in a very positive way. In fact, Three Kings is one of the most authentic and serious War Movies I have ever seen, and I´ve seen many. There are few films that capture the essence of a war so well (f.e. Platoon, Apokalypse Now). The movie is everything: funny and entertaining, but also bruthal, shocking and provoking what strongly confused me the first time I watched it. Three Kings is very unsusual in a way that it shows no huge battle sequences like "Saving Private Ryan", but it shows all the different aspects of the (post-)Gulf War phase: the burning oil sources, the hundrets of POW´s in the desert, the euphory after the war, the suffering of the civilians, and reporters everywhere. The cast is brilliant, especially Whalberg, Ice Cube and Jonze as reservists not knowing (and not really being interested) in what it´s all about. The movie starts off very funny - as long as the soldiers are in the Army camp, knowing war only from CNN themselves, the whole situation seems more like a playground for grown-up boys. But once they leave the camp and enter the iraqi village, they are confronted with the violent and cruel reality of war, and that´s where the movie takes a significant turn. This turn is not easy to follow by the viewer, but you need to see this one more than one time. A must see. 9/10</fullReview>

Arizona stands in believably for Kuwait and Iraq, and authentic Iraqis play versions of themselves, often giving the movie a weird and welcome versimilitude.

		<fullReview>It's a solid war-movie where the story is taking place in Iraq - very on order now. Clooney plays the character he plays best - yeah, you gessed it right. A though, smart military-man who handles the job perfect. Mark Wahlberg plays the best character of all, he plays the bit scared, but determent and pro one. So we got Ice Cube, who is a religious man who's just doing his job. It's a excellent movie, yes it is.(Wahlberg's trapped in a cell) "When are you coming home baby?" "You see I'm working with it now baby"I had to admit that I had a great fun when I saw it, it's story, it's a look into the Iraq rules, it's action, it's funny - yeah it really has got that military - movie mood that this kind of movie needs to reach it's target."Are we shooting?!" "What?!!" "Are we shooting people or what?!!" "Are we shooting?!" "That's what I'm asking you!" "What's the answer?!" "I don't know the answer! But that's what I'm trying to find out!"It has the dogma, and it all has this sort of documentary-style. It's bad quality on the camera, some times we zoom or edit on to things that hasn't anything with the movie to do. In the opening of the movie there comes up a message that director Russell has used peculiar filming-techniques, but I got to admit - it's kind of funny to see."I didn't join the army to pull paper out of people's asses!""...will be taking in prisoners tomorrow! TOMORROW!!!"Entertaining, action-packed, funny, dark...yeah, it's a very good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Basic war movie (e.g. Rambo): fearless soldier overcomes incredible opposition to save the free world.Balanced war movie (e.g. Saving Private Ryan and Platoon): brave soldiers first overcome their own ambivalence, then overcome incredible opposition to save the free world, and ultimately embrace the costs of war.Advanced war movie (e.g. Seven Samurai): brave soldiers first overcome their own ambivalence, then overcome incredible opposition to save the free world, but ultimately fail to overcome the costs of war.Not-sure-what-to-make-of-it war movie (e.g. Three Kings): soldiers first overcome their boredom, then overcome non-opposition, then overcome the free world, and then turn the costs of war into a joke.I enjoyed Three Kings. I thought it was clever and gave an insightful perspective on the Gulf War. However, many people (including my more mature friends) found Three Kings annoying. I believe this is due to the movie constantly switching genres: slapstick, indie, satire, action, comic book comedy, drama, political commentary -- which can be distracting.So, be cautious about watching Three Kings. You might not enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best war movie since SAVING PRIVATE RYAN</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three Kings is about four U.S soldiers who discover a document from an Iraq prisoner,which shows a few bunkers which contain Kuiwait gold. But what follows after is they become responsible for the survival of Iraq rebals and citizens. All four leads are great, George Clooney is a real presence as the tired and supposedly gruff Archie Gates who has an emotional turn around.Ice Cube is superb as Cheif Elgin the more emotional soldier who has a respect for all the Iraq civillians,another is Mark Whalberg who plays the more reluctant member of the group Troy Barlow and Spike Jonze stands out as the uneducated and slightly racist Conrad Vig. The director,who also penned the script does a great job of this and an incredible emotional message gets across to the audience about the war and what happened to the Iraq people. It makes you think about it so much and the director shows what it was like by showing two men together, one U.S the other Iraq and showing the simularities between each other. The cinematography is brilliant too,they used different colours and changed the tone to give us a real feel for the film. The combat scenes are violent and touching and show an incredible amount of realism. Many complain that it is just a Kelly`s Hero`s rip off,but like I said this has an emotional message and is more about the war and not so much the gold that they all want. Overall one of the best pieces of filmmaking of the year.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me, this is a startling film, not so much in the action and camerawork (although both are good and help the entertainment factor of the film), but in it's view of the experience of being a soldier during the Gulf War.It's not what you usually see, where soldiers are either thoughtful introspective types aware of the horror that surrounds them (e.g. Saving Private Ryan) or gung-ho indestructible types encompassing the ideal of whatever country they are supposed to be from (anything with John Wayne in it, for example.)Here they are portrayed as complete airheads out on a huge party, trying to have as much fun as they can like kids on a school outing, completely out of touch with the environment they are in, and not really caring either.It is also hilarious and reminds me a lot of the book (not the film) Catch-22 in it's viewpoint. Like the book the hilarity underlines the reality of the horror, pointlessness and insanity of war . It makes good points someof the events in the Gulf War in particular.****SPOILER***** So good, and it could have been great if it were not for the action adventure Hollywood ending. Here the fairly self-serving, cowardly characters (normal human beings in other words) suddenly turn into selfless goodies ready to give up everything for the poor refugees who are about to be murdered - making the sort of moral choice we are taught to aspire to, not what actually happens when we are confronted with greater good vs. our own gain. HOLLYWOOD, WE ARE NOT STUPID, WE DO NOT NEED SIMPLE FEELGOOD ENDINGS. The last fifteen minutes clashed completely with the rest of the story and left me feeling frustrated that the punch had been so effectively pulled. Yet another film ruined. Still worth seeing though, for a viewpoint which comes across as highly accurate but sadly not seen in movies for a very long time.You can imagine a more likely ending for yourself.</fullReview>

It succeeds because it presents the true complexity of the situation, rather then taking a single minded approach to the situation. The story revolves around four U.S. soldiers (George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and Spike Jonze) who try to capture a load of Iraqi gold after the end of the Gulf War. It shows ever angle, from the U.S. soldiers point of view to the suffering of the Iraqi citizens who were abandoned by the U.S. Some of the dialogue is extremely funny, while some scenes are very moving. Good performances and superbly directed. One of the truly great war films of the 90s - even superior to "Saving Private Ryan".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David O. Russell's bag of tricks....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Experimentation with cinematography in a movie can be a very tricky thing; sleight of hand effects to tell a story can often result in calling attention to a director's technical prowess at the expense of a rattling good yarn. Directors of the 1960s were often guilty of this , and even esteemed films such as MIDNIGHT COWBOY and MASH, wonderful as they are, suffer to some degree from too much "directorial" commentary. The remarkable thing about David O. Russell's Gulf War film THREE KINGS is the use of those very ostentatious sixties effects to empower a very cold, cynical yarn about three AWOL American soldiers at war's end who go off on a quest for gold bouillion . Deceptively a blow 'em up type of extravaganza on the order of the Simpson/ Bruckheimer films, Russell's fiercely intelligent creation is anything but. This is ultimately a serious take on modern warfare, seen through a distrustful eye but with a sense of wit and humanity that just barely keeps the whole enterprise from curdling. The Iraqi landscape is initially photographed in a nearly bleached out color [ Russell's intent was to simulate the look of newspaper color photography]; the film's middle section favors a darker, green-like palette, particularly effective in a chilling interrogation/ torture sequence;and warmer hues color the final third of the film. Startling images and editing abound, including a graphic demonstration of what happens when a bullet tears through a man's organs: this is definitely not the stuff of mainstream movie making,although THREE KINGS looks like it cost a fortune. Russell is a wizard combining unlikely music accompaniment to alien settings [ The Beach Boys' " I GET AROUND " while army jeeps wildly traverse an Iraqui village is one example ]. Some scenes seem to evoke the ghost of a hip, cooler version of David Lean, especially an eerie moment when gas bombs explode overhead reducing the desert to a darkened, fog drenched terrain. David O.Russell is a director to watch. I can't say that I was totally taken with this picture; perhaps it has to do with the subject matter itself and unresolved feelings, both politically and environmentally , that this particular war engendered. The ending , as with so many recent American films, leaves a kind of antiseptic taste in your mouth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, "Three Kings" is not a war movie. Certainly, the main characters are soldiers, both American and Iraqi, and the locale is the Iraqi desert battlefield immediately after the cessation of hostilities during Desert Storm. But war only provides the backdrop to an old-fashioned adventure yarn that has more in common with "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" than with "Saving Private Ryan". In "Three Kings", the loot is a fortune in stolen Kuwaiti gold whose existence is discovered by a foursome of American soldiers while processing Iraqi POWs. The gold's behind Iraqi lines, but they risk life and limb nonetheless to go fetch it. It's a rip-roaring buddy movie complemented by the good chemistry between Clooney and Wahlberg. It's not a very deep movie, but certainly measures up to others in the genre and is well worth the rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice little essay I did for this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-contains spoilers-In the film Three Kings, the film uses several stylistic mediums to help illustrate the whole representation of good versus evil. The film has been labeled a "stylistic" film, but there are several aspects to the film that turn it into a classic Hollywood film.The direct cause of such assumptions is through the camera movement and lighting within the scope of the film. Lighting looked awkward from scene to scene, the grittiness of the film stock varied from shot to shot, and the use of hand-held cameras helped create an unconventional aura. While these differences may not have been the basic elements of classic Hollywood cinema, the plot of the film has a very conventional feel to it.At first, the audience sees the soldiers as nothing more than venture capitalists, weekend warriors out to make a killing. However, the idea of "America is Good and Pure" keeps cropping up throughout the film.Color timing is expertly used to promote this during the two raids the soldiers embark upon. In the first raid, the four soldiers are wearing their green jungle fatigues. With the addition of a dead cow's blood, the suits come off as much darker and foreboding. While they are wearing these particular fatigues, they are extremely aggressive, going after nothing but the gold and only being concerned with their personal gratification. During this time, the film stock is grainier in quality, and the red blood comes off as very black in nature. Since all of the bad guys (or the Iraqi Republican Guard) wear nothing but black outfits, this gives the impression these men are no better than the Iraqis since they look and act like them. It's a confusing moment in the film because the viewers understand the true intentions of these soldiers, but are wondering why they continue to progress with those intentions. Even though the soldiers try to redeem themselves by giving food away to the hungry Iraqi villagers, this concern for the well being of the villagers only occurs after an ingenious "cleansing" of the soldiers.The milk that knocked the soldiers off their feet did more than just injure them, but was implemented to bring the soldiers back to their "good guy" mentality. The pureness of the milk essentially helped reestablish who they were, even if the plot didn't elude to such a purpose. The absurdity of the moment appears rather confabulated, but in the long run, the shot becomes an effective narrative device. The whiteness of the milk is meant to remind the soldiers they are supposed to be the good guys, and the darkness of their blood stained clothes seems to disappear as they leave the village. This all leads to the second raid the soldiers embark upon. The only difference this time around is the fact the soldiers are wearing their lighter desert fatigues. This is a direct contrast to the Iraqi soldiers, who appear even more aggressive than the first time around.Classical Hollywood style has now been established, with a clear protagonist and antagonist through the use of color coordination. To make this assessment even more clear, the Iraqis are the ones who "cross the line" by killing the protesting woman. Even though the soldiers still have their desires for the gold, they now have a moral mission most people could relate to: helping others in their most desperate hour. The color coordination is much more subtle as the story progresses, but it remains consistent through the remainder of the film.While the "good guys" continue to wear their lighter colors throughout the film, the narration takes a much different turn with Mark Wahlberg's character Capt. Barlow. In the interrogation scene, he is no longer wearing his light fatigue tops, yet is wearing a black suit coat. Once again, the similarity in color content between Barlow and the Iraqis has stunted the narration, creating a moment where the audience is unsure which side is the bad guy. The audience understands that the Iraqi captain Said is evil because he is wearing his black garments, but now the dark side of the "good guy" is revealed. The audience learns the Americans aren't the good guys, as was earlier implied. However, the shot of the oil being poured down Barlow's throat distorts the line between classic Hollywood film and a stylized independent.In earlier scenes, the blood of all the Iraqis was not red. While Archie Gates and the Chief spill red blood throughout the film, only the Iraqis blood is black in color. The shot of the dead Iraqi woman's blood signifies the real reason why everyone is fighting during this time: oil.Unfortunately, the film's stylized narrative somewhat breaks down after that moment, turning into a straight forward film as opposed to a stylized narration. There's explosions, there is a death to the least deserving of all the characters, the protagonists dupe their superiors with relative ease, the protagonists create a plan that gets them out of a tight jam, the Iraqi villagers make it safely out of harm's way and the main characters lead happy and well adjusted lives at the end. In essence, this film is a pro-American epitaph.With the help of color representation, the audience can fully understand this objective. Soft focus shots also confirmed this ideal, making the American soldiers appear more angelic, like their moral principles were confirmed by God. While Three Kings will most likely be considered a stylized film for the rest of its days, the underlying fact is that it follows a lot of the same elements of classical Hollywood film. It would be more fitting to say that Three Kings was one of the most "stylish classic Hollywood narrative created up this point in history."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The camera and special effects of The Matrix meets the sensibilities and ideas of Fight Club. This could only be a winner. By showing us (quite graphically) what bullets do to human tissue and minamising the use of bullets in the action sequences, director David O Russell keeps the images in our head e.g when having a shoot out with Iraqi soldiers, the sound is kept to the bullets hitting the soldiers and their moans of pain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I waited too long, but it finally paid off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to see "Three Kings" when it hit the theaters way back in '99. Unfortunately, "Fight Club" and "American Beauty" came out at the same time, and since my free time is very limited, I had to pick and choose my movie-watching very carefully. Being a David Fincher fan, I saw "Fight Club" first, then because "American Beauty" was getting loads of Oscar buzz, I saw it. Once I finally had time to see "Three Kings", it was gone.So I waited and waited and waited, then eventually forgot about it until my friend loaned me the DVD. And now I wish I'd ditched "American Beauty" and seen "Three Kings" instead. What a marvelous piece of filmmaking.I notice a lot of people are saying that it can't decide what it wants to be -- that it plays with too many genres. Since when is that a bad thing? Many of the best films are the ones that interweave good aspects from many genres to create something unique -- like "Three Kings". It pretty much defies description, and its unpredictability is especially welcome.And whenever David O. Russell comes out with another movie, I'm definitely putting it at the top of my "see it in the theater" list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a different kind of war movie; done with skill and ingenuity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sharp, funny, violent and insightful action film focuses on four U.S. soldiers who make a daring plan to steal a secret stash of Kuwaiti gold from Saddam Hussein at the conclusion of the Persian Gulf War. The plan goes awry in more ways than one as they find themselves plunged into the midst of a brutal and emotional Iraqi uprising. A creative, clever spin on the war genre; director Russell's unique and stylish direction is a real treat to watch, and the performances of his well-chosen cast are right on target. The script is smart, innovative, and so shockingly political that it may be unsettling, but it's done with bold authenticity and goes a long way on it's startling sense of humor. ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie !Other reviewers here have complained that this movie is a dull remake, a tired cliche etc. How on earth can they say that ? This has got to be one of the most original movies of recent years. It tells the story of a group of American soldiers going after some of Saddam Hussein's gold. Of course, things get out of hand and before they know it, the soldiers are tied up in a web of Iraqi rebels, scared enemy soldiers, exploding cows (no kidding) and bunkers full of cell-phones. The good thing is that the Iraqi soldiers are not just shown as mindless bad guys. In stead, they are either educated and mad at Saddam, or just plain afraid of him. Very original and a lot more realistic then you usually see in action movies.The action scenes in this movie are also great. They are full of stylish slow-motion moments and "wow" moments. The music is also great because it's so absurdly chosen: the Beach Boys during a chase, and "Please Don't Go" by Chicago in the middle of an intense fight.On top of this originality, the movie is often very funny, and strangely enough, very realistic. The acting is also great. The only real problem is that the movie tends to get a little melodramatic towards the end, but other then that THREE KINGS is a funny, original and very stylish movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clooney's line, "What did we do here?" is the key to understanding this movie. "Three Kings" is a satire on the motives for war, on the effects of war, and on America's jaundiced view of what we stand for when we go to war. (And please remember, although this film has comedic elements, satire does not necessarily mean comedy.) This film is a marvelously tough-minded shot at the ugly underpinnings of war.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid entertainment... and more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David(and the rest of the crew of the Three Kings set) did an awesome job with this film. The cinematography-the only way I can describe it is to look at something right now and I swear this is how you see it. In other words, the cinematography is sharp enough to be confused with the naked eye. The direction never lets up...It's great you go from point A to point B without wasting time; no unnecessary explanations, bulls**t, etc.Some people are always gonna have something to complain about, and for this film, I guess people are complaining that it is anti-American, or anti-Iraqi, or whatever. Listen to me; let's put Three Kings into perspective. This film was made during a time when us Generation Xer's don't necessarily see the motivation or purpose of war; we've heard of and seen the misery it brings to both sides. What annoys me is people my age spouting sh*t without *knowing* anything , even about a war that happened 10 years ago. So I think that ANY film that has you look at a war without glorifying either side is a positive. It's not trying to be partial to either side; it shows there is almost never a 'black or white' where politics are concerned.I also enjoyed the great acting and the *hilarious* dialogue! "I'm talkin' about Iraqi bouillon. "You mean them little cubes you put in hot water to make soup?"..and the whole "Are we shooting people?" scene from the very beginning.."I don't know..that's what I'm trying to find out!" What about the part where they're listening to that really peaceful 80's song in the jeep while the hostages are running past them? The irony is just so funny.Look, all I'm saying is that this film has all the attributes that make a quality, entertaining movie. Maybe older viewers are looking for something more in a movie dealing with war. And look, I've seen a lot of movies that made me wanna puke from all the American patriotic bullsh*t, and this didn't do that once for me. It didn't glorify Iraqis, either..it just dealt itself as a documentary.On a side note..I loved that lady who played the older reporter..and Spike Jonze..they were both great! Not to mention George Clooney, of course.David O. Russell, keep making films as good as this one!Peace, Sep</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent action/comedy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's one thing I've learnt from IMDB, it's that no matter how much you liked a movie, someone else on this planet hated it just as much. So the negative reviews for Three Kings don't surprise me at all, because I thought this movie was absolutely magnificent.Probably the best thing Three Kings has going for it is the low expectations one has prior to seeing it. It was promoted as an "action/comedy", and while it won't disappoint fans of that genre, it has a much deeper message that very few action or comedy films manage to get across. In fact I thought it was perhaps surprising that Hollywood produced a film which tackles a rather touchy topic (for Americans) in such a head on fashion.The movie starts with plenty of naivety and lighthearted humour. The American soldiers complain of being bored and are have no idea about the politics of the Gulf War. The battle is over, the war is won, and all that's left to do is to take a few POWs, be interviewed on CNN and go home. Which is fine as long as they stay in base camp, but when a few sneak out of camp to pinch some of Saddam's gold, they are confronted by the realities of the war for the Iraqi people and start to suspect that the US might not be the good samaritans they had hitherto believed. The characterisations and the transition which takes place in all the characters over the course of the film is remarkably well done.Contrary to a couple of the reviews below, the movie is not anti-American and does not "take Saddam's side" but instead encourages the viewer to consider other perspectives of the Gulf War and points out that the US's approach to the war may have done more harm than good. It's a point that has been made by plenty of commentators, but not many inside the US, and never in such an audience-friendly format. Three Kings is not only a jolly good film, but you may just learn something about US foreign policy. And if not, you can at least enjoy the exploding cow scene.</fullReview>

I really like how this movie flowed, from introducing the characters, to them on their plot, to them getting involved even more deep with the conflict. This is probably Clooney's best performance in a movie yet. I like also that this movie humanizes the Iraqi people. Hey we all hate Sadam, but so does most of his people as well.

I guess that people didn't like this movie because it either wasn't the big blockbuster action flick that the previews made it out to be, or it wasn't a gritty, realistic war film that others thought it might be, but it was kind of both.That's why this was a good movie, because the action scenes were in a realistic war like fashion, making it believable as well as entertaining. The dark humor was also a very big part of this movie, and some parts you didn't know if they were supposed to be funny or not (like the cow/land-mine scene).

This is a film which is entirely without merit.It is dull, ridiculous, unfunny and unenjoyable. In short it is crap, utter crap. I cannot believe that anyone could sit through this movie without becoming either very bored or very aggravated at having paid for the privilege. Mr Clooney is as wooden as ever and the supporting cast meander their way through each buttock clenchingly poor scene.In every single one, the director tries to impress with some flashy effect or camera trick. He doesn't.He constructs a confusing, unwatchable mess each and every time. The "what happens when you get shot" bit is just plain risible. The work of a man who has clearing studied film at the Rotherham School for the Artistically Inept.There is nothing worse than when a director tries to impress with tricks and angles and doesn't even consider the basics of the film such as the script and the plot. This is most definitely the case here. A classic case of "style" over content.As anyone will tell you, this is a Kelly's Heroes rip off but that is awarding it far too much praise. This film is not worthy to lick the boots of said movie. In fact it is the sickly runt of the film world - a film to be universally abhorred and left to gather dust on the film store shelves.Avoid it, believe me - this film is BAD.

		<fullReview>A good film with plenty of atmosphere and something to say about modern warfare. The "are we shooting?" opening by Mark Whalberg demonstrates the chaos and confusion that I suspected was the untold story of the Gulf War (Forget the glossy CNN style coverage that we were spoonfed at the time). This approach managed to convey a message and also bring a little dark comedy to the opening scenes, a subtle technique which is attempted on more than one occasion with varying success. Considering the conflict has influenced international relations heavily throughout the last ten years it is surprising that this is the first movie about the conflict of any note- Hollywood prefers to keep it simple and conservative and this film in the early stages must have been a bit of a risk. In the event it does not carry an anti-American agenda but does try to position itself as pro-human, and makes decent stab at portraying the Iraqis as humans, unfortunately the west does not know of any Iraqi superstars so their screentime is limited due to the financial necessity to show Clooney and Whalberg as much as possible. On another level this is no bad thing, Clooney may not have demonstrated a great range thus far but he is fast turning out some performances of great coolness which give him the kind of screen presence as Steve McQueen or James Dean. This means you will either love him or hate him but for me what he does he does very well and is very entertaining and charismatic- no flash in the pan either, his best performance so far being his role in "Out Of Sight". Rent this one, its entertaining and at times thought provoking- those people "confused" by its plot and style stick to "Final Destination".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Three Kings" is the story of 4 men who, after the Gulf War is over, sent out into the desert to steal a stash of gold. The gold was stolen from Kuwait by Saddam, so the 4 guys figure, "Hey, he stole it from them, so let's steal it from him." That is basically the premise for this film. I was pleasantly surprised by the way this story was told. It was told with style, thought, and a perfect mix of action, comedy, and drama. Camera angles were well done, and the soundtrack is terrific. It was also very touching. The rebels in Iraq were going through a terrible ordeal, which was depicted very realistically and thoroughly. But it wasn't over done.  The acting was very good, too. Clooney, Wahlberg, Jonze, and "Cube" all give stellar performances. All in all, a very well done movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent post-war film, Three Kings has great performances from everyone involved, a great story, unique photography, and a solid message about humanity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's almost impossible to go wrong with George Clooney, and he proves himself yet again with his spectacular performance in Three Kings. Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, and Ice Cube are three soldiers in the Middle East just after the end of the 1991 Gulf War. Clooney leads them as they make an attempt to steal a huge amount of Kuwaiti gold bullion that has been taken away from Kuwait by Saddam Hussein. The job that the United States was trying to do was to confiscate everything that Hussein had taken and give it back to Kuwait, and Clooney saw a get rich quick opportunity and decided to go for it. However, Three Kings is not just a film about a bunch of greedy military personnel. During the course of their efforts to obtain the gold, the three guys, with an increasing number of sidekicks, come across several disturbing events, and they eventually set aside their financial goals for the immediate chance to help a lot of people who are being brutalized by Saddam's army. This is a very humane thing to do, and it is very uplifting to watch, but it also has numerous potentially damaging side effects. For example, eight years after the war has ended, it once again makes many of the people in the Middle East look barbaric. Besides that, it seems to be saying something about the role that the United States plays in the global society. In Three Kings, it almost seems that the rest of the world is in turmoil, and it is up to the U.S. to get out there are straighten everyone else out. However, regardless of this, Three Kings is still a very entertaining and thought provoking film that nonetheless gets a good message across. But I still think that it's way past time for Ice Cube to start using his real name, and the same goes for other rap-stars-turned-actors, such as Ice T and countless others. Do you think Mark Wahlberg would command any respect whatsoever if he still called himself Marky Mark? Both of these guys, by the way, delivered some of the best acting of their careers in Three Kings, and this combined with the good story and unique photography made for a very good war film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Underated Black comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three Kings is a little gem of a movie about the stupidity of the Gulf war. Gearge Clooney and Mark Whalberg star in a superb comedy that also shows how war effects all side and all people and really only is fought for finantial reasons ie: The oil in Kuwait. There are some real memorable scenes inthis film and the one that gets me is when the American soldior is being tortured by the iraqi soldior and what they say to each other. Another striking aspect of this film is the way it is shot, the cinamatography is amazing , even up to the point where they show what a bullet can do to a body when in enters and this scene is shown from inside the body! There are too many good things to tell you about this film so i sugest you just go ahead and watch it. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever, funny and different.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David O. Russel's 'Three Kings' is a hard film to lock down into a particular genre. It combines elements of a war movie, a comedy and a drama, and manages to do it very well. People wanting to see lots of big guns and bombs should stay well clear, there are video games to keep you amused. Anyone who appreciates witty, clever and slightly off beat films is well advised to see it.Telling the untold story of the Gulf War, with Saddam's army more worried about shooting rebel Iraqis then allied soldiers, was a brave move in Hollywood, because many people don't want to know that a democratic uprising in Iraq was being crushed while the Allies sat by in the desert. Rather than being an action movie, the film develops into an exploration of three soldiers and the human development caused by their experience of the war, and the extraordinary circumstances they place themselves in.Many innovative and experimental cinematic styles are used nicely, and solid performances are recorded by Clooney, Wahlberg, Jonze and Cube. The characters are portrayed as normal human beings, both noble and flawed at the same time, and even the Iraqi soldiers are seen as people rather than typical war movie bad guy cannon fodder. This film genuinely showed me the desperation felt by many Iraqis for the Allies to help them as they starved and fought desperately against Saddam.One of my favourite films, and probably one of the most underrated films of its time, 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved to watch this movie - for the first 1/2 hour! It is shot in the style of a video clip and has a brilliant dry humour. If the film had hold out this way, it would be a definite cult movie like "M.A.S.H." or "Kelly´s Heros". Unfortunately it becomes a conventional war drama after a while. The fun and the comedy aspect get lost in favour of the political message. This is not a bad movie at all, but there´s a lot of potential lost. (6.5/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another excellent war film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a lot of stuff in modern wars (The Malvines War, The Gulf War, The Kosovo War, etc.) not yet exploited in 35 mm. It's clear that today's wars are different from the ones from the past. Life has changed, people has changed, technology has changed, and the scale of values has changed, too. This film shows with exquisite detail many of those changes, and by watching them we soon find an insight. We recognize ourselves in those people, and we share their feelings and their aims. We see common people fighting other common people, and we understand both sides of the war. Far away were left those pro-American films where German soldiers or Japanese soldiers were shown as fight robots with no face and no name.There's humor, drama, suspense, action... There's good cinematography, good music, good actors...Three Kings is a great film. 8-9 out of 10.</fullReview>

And Three Kings does it better, with a plot and humor on top of a bizarrely stark realism. Who would have thought it possible? Yet it is amazing how many people, especially women, have watched the first few minutes and stopped? It is not your typical shot em up violent movie. It is not peckinpah. Don't worry about the violence. Just watch it. One of the best movies i've seen in years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On seeing the trailer for this film at the cinema I immediately put it on my list of MUST NOT SEE'S. Another film of the good old US of A kicking ass and saving the world is not what the world needs.However when forced to watch the movie by a George Clooney fan I was amazed to see that it was not "Independence Day in the Desert" but a funny, thaught provoking and at times moving film about modern warfare and the invasion of a foreign land not by Iraq but by the allied forces.A hollywood executive no doubt embarrased by such an unpatriotic view of his country obviously sought to disguise the true nature of the film to try to tempt US audiences to see the movie. However the rest of the world needed an alternative version to make it more popular i.e. one exposing the Gulf War as a deeply flawed operation with the US once again getting it wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will not outline the movie since so many users have done so already. All I have to say about this movie is that it is the best movie I have seen in the last year. For 90% of the movie, I had no idea where it was going and I liked that. It was not cliche movie where the good guys defeat the bad guys. The good guys in this movie were not that morally good and the bad guys were not that evil. You felt sorry for the bad guys, knowing that their fate was probably death.We need more movies like this. Hollywood makes such predictable movies and when something as orginal like Three Kings comes along, it gives me some degree of hope. Because of this movie, I grew to respect George Clooney, Ice Cube, Mark Whalberg and Spike Jonze as actors. This is a wonderful screenplay and it was shot beautifully. After seeing this movie three times, I finally bought it and the soundtrack. All I have to say for the director is please,please make more movies like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Gulf War is over and four soldiers are determined to come home with more than just sand in their bergens. Three Kings is the story of four men (George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube and Spike Jonze) who set out to find millions of stolen Kuwaiti gold in the Iraqi desert after finding a hand drawn map stuck up a guys ass. While searching for the promised gold the soldiers come across a group of Iraqis in need of there help to get them over the border and have to cope with more than they bargained for.Directed by David O. Russell, Three Kings is at times highly emotional while still delivering a superb story of three men caught in the middle of a democratic uprising. Action packed and hilariously funny Three Kings is a story that shows you more about emotions than most other war films, an overlooked little gem this is a must get for anyone, if you are not keen a war films fan this could make you one.My fav film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"american propaganda"? eh?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSThere are plenty of good reasons for people to dislike this movie, and if a movie just doesn't grab you, there's not much that can be said to change your mind. How anyone can accuse this film of being American propaganda, though, is beyond me. Three Kings is unrelenting in its criticism for American policy in the Gulf: that the war was motivated by nothing more than money; that it was conducted with utter disregard for civilian casualties; that the Iraqis were not, as they were portrayed during the war, a bunch of barely human evil towelheads; and above all, that having incited the Iraqis to rebellion, the West promptly left them to be butchered by their own leader. The final scene at the barricade presents the whole war in microcosm: the American army sits by as the Iraqi rebels are rounded up for certain death, watching passively as a humanitarian evil is committed, just as the West did throughout the '80s as Saddam massacred the Kurds and consolidated his police state, supported by the West in the war on Islamic fundamentalism. It's only once there's money at stake that the army changes its position, bribed into a seemingly humanitarian gesture. Some people have accused the film of having a typical sentimental Hollywood ending. I just can't see that... maybe in the little section explaining the respective fates of the three soldiers. Nonetheless, the bleak aftertaste remains that for the vast majority of the Iraqi people, the war (never mind the sanctions) left them infinitely worse off than they had started, and that any claims by the West to the moral high ground are utter hypocrisy.Three Kings goes a long way towards giving the lie to the sanitised Western view of the computer game war. Every bullet counts, and every death is a real person. Whether you enjoy it or not is more subjective. I thought it was funny, exciting and powerful in equal measure. Basically, a great film, in its own way as unusual and original as either Being John Malkovich or American Beauty, and a damn sight less of an exercise in propaganda than the likes of Saving Private Ryan.</fullReview>

When I first heard about this movie I thought "that sounds like a load of rubbish". Then it got a few good reviews and on a rainy Saturday I picked it up at the video store.Well I want my money back. These actors can act in other movies but there's no evidence here. It is a ridiculous piece of American propaganda disguised as a sensitive piece on the nature of war and heroism. It made me want to throw up. My boyfriend didn't even watch the last 20 minutes he was so disgusted.If you want entertainment, don't watch this movie.

		<fullReview>Three Kings is the second movie that I have seen to deal with the Gulf War, the first being Courage Under Fire. While Courage dealt with tribulations during the actual war, Three Kings takes place after the cease-fire takes effect. Amid the parting and confusion, four American soldiers (Clooney, Wahlberg, Cube, and Jonze) find a map where Iraqi president Saddam Hussein is hiding Kuwaiti gold bullion that he has stolen, and decide to find and take it for themselves. While searching for the bullion, they are plunged into the heart of a democratic uprising, which wreaks havoc on their plans. During the search of one of the suspected bunkers, all hell breaks loose when they confront some Iraqi soldiers who begin to mistreat some of the Iraqi people who are tired of the way Saddam Hussein has been treating them. Shots ring out, and while our fearless soldiers are leaving with the gold, their truck is bombed and in turn they are thrust into an Iraqi civil war. After their truck is obliterated, they are rescued by some Iraqi citizens part of the uprising. The friendly Iraqis nurse them back to health, and beg for the Americans help with getting them to the Iranian border, and to freedom from the tyranny of Saddam Hussein. Great performances by George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, and Ice Cube propel this movie into the instant Academy Award status even before it hit theaters. While the acting was exciting, the directing was the eventual success story. David O. Russell's unique tapestry of humor, violence and history makes Three Kings one of the best war movies that I have seen in quite some time. While it may not have been Saving Private Ryan quality, Three Kings definitely hits hard with great acting and directing. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not 'Apocalypse Now', not 'Kelly's Heroes' - that's fine!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie expecting something like "Apocalypse Now" for the Gulf War, which perhaps isn't fair to those who made this movie. And instead of a boat heading upriver in the jungle, Three Kings delivered a humvee speeding through the desert. It also delivered some of the outrageous, horror of war feel that 'Apocalypse' had (e.g. skeet shooting footballs laced with explosives, versus waterskiing while "Satisfaction" plays), but it's a different movie with a different feel."Three Kings" delivers commentary on a lot of subjects, but with a certain sense of humor, and provokes some thought on a war most Americans are content to think about as a clean and just war. It delivers some interesting photography and effects, as well as some just bizarre visuals, which I won't name to avoid any spoilers.Another movie people want to compare "Three Kings" with is "Kelly's Heroes". Again there are some similarities, but there are plenty of differences. "Three Kings" is far more realistic (imho) dealing with the consequences of running off on their own quest, whereas in KH there's no problem scaring up a few tanks and hippie tankers (!?!) to help out. "Three Kings" certainly isn't as obviously funny, either, but I don't think that's a flaw in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What struck me most about this movie was the way it looked. The different techniques that are used give this movie a distinct feel all its own. The choppiness of the shots when Spike Jonze is washing his hands is quite cool. There are also many instances where the background of a shot will be nothing but white color. These effects gave the movie a surreal feeling to it.I liked a lot of the acting. Spike Jonze was amazing in one of his first roles ever. You could tell that he was meant as comic relief but the character had more depth to him than simply as a fool. Ice Cube was also terrific. I really didn't think that musicians and sports players were good actors, but seeing this performance has given me a new respect for those who try their hand at many different fields.Another quality of the movie that I really enjoyed was the fact that it didn't get too preachy. It touched on the "horrors of war", but it didn't dwell on them. The movie never lost its focus from the four guys trying to get some gold. Yet, we still get a feeling that these atrocities shouldn't have been occurring. I think this is effective in this film because it treats its audience as smart individuals and doesn't try to point things out directly. The audience is allowed to make their own connections.So this is a movie that should definitely be seen by all. Especially in this election year where George Bush Jr. is running. This movie reminds us of George Bush Sr.'s role in the War both good and bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here's a shocker: a political action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What promised to be a 90's version of "Kelly's Heroes" (based on its rather raffish trailer) is actually a pointed and complex satire that speaks volumes about the contradictions of American foreign policy while beguiling us with its bold energy. Comparisons to "M*A*S*H" are not unwarranted, but the methods are vastly different. Robert Altman's approach is downright facile next to director David O. Russell's no-holds-barred assault on the senses. On the heels of the Gulf War cease-fire in 1991, four opportunistic soldiers scheme to cross over the border into Iraq and raid a remote desert bunker full of Kuwaiti gold. With arrogance set on '10', the last thing they expect is a gauntlet of conscience-overhauling obstacles at every turn. Credit Russell's daring script in making our "heroes" less than likable from the outset and displaying not simply a flavorless, balanced point of view but bravely deciding to show the honorable and obscene facets of both sides of the conflict. Kudos as well to leads Clooney, Wahlberg, Ice Cube and scene-stealing Jonze, all of whom deserve reputation-boosts for their deft performances. Admirable technical contributions insure a more than credible look to the production (shot in Arizona and Mexico), though I'm not entirely sure what's going on with the funky color scheme. Alternating somewhat arbitrarily throughout from nearly colorless, high-contrast photography to traditional full-spectrum lensing, Russell seems to be leading us into observing our heroes' transformation via the saturation of color within the frame. Uh...whatever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>compelling mix of humor, drama, and action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe Three Kings to be one of the better movies I have seen about modern warfare to date, and works on many levels. It is a compelling mix of absurdity of war humor, drama, and action that is handled well.Characters are not evil or heroic... as in real life, their actions vary depending on the circumstance at the time and the perception of others. This film goes farther than any other Hollywood film I can think of into how other cultures are perplexed by America, and how world culture, which is dominated by American culture, has in many ways melded together with sometimes absurd and unpredictable results.In my mind, the title "Three Kings" is not a reference to the Christmas song... it is a reference to the interrogation referencing Michael Jackson in the film. Jackson is known as the "King" of pop, and is used as a metaphor for America's seeming confusion and contradictions with itself. Another king...Rodney King... is shown briefly, and is used to illustrate the racism present in America always resting in the background, ready to be brought to a violent head with little provocation. This theme colors the interrelationship between the American soldiers themselves, as well as between them and the Iraqis. The interrogator earnestly asks one of the bewildered kings, "What the f*** is wrong with Michael Jackson?" This film may make you think about what is wrong, indeed.The film is a journey of the American soldier "kings" to a better understanding of themselves and others, with some interestingly shot action sequences and humorous situations thrown in to boot. The characters start out as cliche's, and become 3 dimensional in their journey (ok..about 2 1/2 dimensional, anyway..the film doesn't get that deep, because it is at it's heart an action film).I will admit the film is somewhat uneven in some parts, and some scenes are not as effective as others. It is well cast and acted, but some characters go nowhere or were not even needed. I, for one, could have done without the cheesy inside the body scenes, which I felt added nothing to the film and were laughably done--I can't believe some reporter actually believed they used an actual cadaver for the filming (shows you the gullibility of some entertainment reporters). Overall, though, I think the director skillfully juggles humor, action, and political commentary without overdoing it on any front. Maybe that's what some people dislike about it...it doesn't go full bore in any one direction and they're not used to that. I think it was original and highly entertaining, and worth the DVD rental (TWO commentary tracks and other bonus features--wow!). 8/10 for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Upon first glance this movie seems like nothing more than another war story, nothing but blood and glory. But if you take a second look, you will find that it is a great story about American soldiers that decide to do the right thing towards helping Iraqi refugees, no matter what the consequences. In addition to great special effects and hilarious one-liners, it shows what war,torture, and interrogation can do to someone. It shows that in the heat of battle, no matter how scared you are, you never forget your family. All in all, George Clooney,Mark Whalberg,and Ice Cube can really make a story about stolen Kuwaity gold an awesome movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For Once The Arabs Look Good!! and so does the film!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the trailer for this film and I couldn't resist rolling my eyes and expecting another ignorant expose of how the Americans are heroes, and the Arabs are monsters. I admit I was wrong to jump to such presumptions.Movies like Navy Seals, True Lies, and Delta Force aim to disregard the facts and instead opt to use 100 minutes of screen time to make Arabs as ugly as possible, and make Americans as patriotic and righteous as can be. This is disgusting and neglects to tell tales the way they are meant to be told. 3 Kings, on the other hand, promotes the credibility of the Arab vs. America film genre.The story is simple; 3 soldiers discover a map that leads to a trail of stolen Kuwaiti gold. The soldiers pursue the gold, predictably stolen from Saadam, but find themselves embroiled in a refugee war and must make a decision to sacrifice the gold for the people. The reason this film is so good, is that the 3 American soldiers (Clooney, Wahlberg, Cube) are not made to look neither intelligent, noroic, nor pro-American, nor any other typical association you make with movies like this. They are depicted as barbarians, who don't even know why they are fighting. They soon discover that President Bush' campaign is dodgy and begin to feel betrayed by their own nation. I loved the way this was captured because the men realize just how corrupt and seedy their politicians are and how the comparisons with Iraq's Saadam are not too dissimilar.I really appreciated the consideration given to the Arab issue. It is a sensitive issue and should be respected. To mock it, reflects poorly on the filmmakers and the film. Incidentally, most anti-Arab films are disasters and flop at the box-office. This is re-assuring because it suggests that audiences are not taken in by the ridiculous stereotyping.3 Kings succeeds because there grows a bond between the soldiers and the refugees. The refugees in fact ultimately humanize the soldiers and their characters. It is, as if to say, that the Americans can learn just as much from the Arabs, as the Arabs can learn from them. Even more!!The Pro-Saadam soldiers are also given real character. There is a real point to made here. The soldiers emphasize that they are at the mercy of their President. They have a job to do and they must do it. If not, everything they hold dear will be taken from them. So their merciless campaigns are carried out, out of fear, not joy or satisfaction. Similarly the Americans are under orders. They are told to fight, so they fight. No questions asked!!! The only difference is that the Americans look nicer and are fortunate enough not to live under tyranny. Otherwise the comparisons are exact.The action here is expertly handled; it's like a rock video with superb set pieces complemented by powerful musical montages. It's a unique action film; the shots and techniques will no doubt awaken the interests of thousand of people. Whether they like action films or not. Then you add the comedy angle and you have a really exquisite movie.This film is one of the best and most underrated action feasts of the decade, and it earns bonus points with it's deep respect for the Arabs. Granted, there are moments that border on the precipice of banality, but no film is perfect</fullReview>

This isn't a typical war movie, there are no big battle scenes or shootouts, but it does, however, take war movies to new hights.(How many war movies show a bullet pinballing inside a man's innards ?) The performances from a first rate cast are outstanding, especially from Mark Wahlberg and George Clooney.

		<shortDescription>Very wise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wise is the best word I can come up with to explain this movie. I don't believe there have been any movies made about the Persian Gulf war. It was a pretty dull war, not many casualties (at least not Americans) or a lot of combat that would make good footage.So instead of making this movie about the war, it takes place shortly afterwards. The plot is very simple, a few soldiers find a "treasure map" stuck in the anal cavity of an Iraqi prisoner and decide to go on an unauthorized mission to find the booty, so to speak. But, wisely, the movie is not about an Arabian gold rush, it's about characters and events that happen to these characters along their journey.I like how the reporters are scrambling at the last minute trying to get a story, trying to cover as much as possible in order to portray a "real war". Clooney is assigned as a personal escort for one reporter, but ditches her to find the gold, taking whatever soldiers are at hand to join him. At first, I was a little disappointed to see him play a higher-ranking officer, since I think he's at his best playing a crook or a worker at the bottom of a totem pole. But here he's very convincing, his way of speaking demands attention without having to bark orders.I like the quirky editing and special effects. A fiasco breaks out during a ceasefire when an Iraqi soldier shoots a mother. Of course this starts a domino effect and everyone starts shooting. You hear the gun pop and the zoom of the bullet as it takes literally seconds to hit its fleshly target. And there's a scene where an American soldier is shot and we see the wound as if we were on the inside of his body. His lungs are collapsing and bile is leaking into his chest cavity via the bullet hole, and then some sort of valve or cathedar is inserted through his ribcage to alleviate the air pressure.The humor that appears during this warfare is almost M*A*S*H-like. The war is not funny, but when funny things happen you just have to laugh. And it's the talent of the writing and direction that makes this work. If a bad job was done, this film could've easily been in bad taste.If I had any complaints about the film it'd be that I wish it was longer. There weren't any plot holes or loose ends that need to be tied, but I got the feeling that I was cut short and didn't experience the fullness of what it should have been. Many war movies are 3 hours long or longer, if this movie could've filled up 45 additional minutes of entertainment it could've been close to a masterpiece.</fullReview>

The plot could also be a true story. The feeling of danger, confusion, and euphoria are captured and we too, feel these as we are taken on a wild ride into hell.I served in the Gulf as a Reservist, I had so many weird and strange feelings within me as I watched this movie the second time, I had to turn it off, I couldn't watch anymore. For me this says more about the quality of the story, filming, editing and special effects than I can even try to put into words.I give this movie a 10+, I have no words to explain it, simply put: THIS MOVIE TOOK ME BACK TO THE GULF, AND IT SCARED ME!Watch this movie, you WILL enjoy it!J.D.F.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't quite know what to expect from "Three Kings" beforehand, but I was pleasantly surprised. Very few filmmakers could mix screwball comedy, serious drama, and political criticism without resulting in an incoherent, schizophrenic mess. David O. Russell is one of them. He tries a few too many camera tricks, some of which are distracting, but on the whole he does some outstanding work.The acting was also surprisingly good. Ice Cube has always been solid in action roles, but here he shows some new found emotion and depth. Spike Jonze is hilarious as an earnest but intellectually-challenged redneck. George Clooney, as always, is stellar. The standout performance comes from Mark Wahlberg, who has become one of Hollywood's real talents.It took far too long for the film industry to challenge the media whitewash of the dubious Gulf War, but "Three Kings" is a good first step.</fullReview>

In three kings you get an insight on war like no other i have ever seen. Its not just black and white like other war movies, it actually shows that even the "bad guys" have feelings, and that they are actual beings. the movie also contains a certain surrealism, like when they plant C4 on a football and shoots after in a moving vehicle, or when they practice their assault on a cow, and it blows up. i have almost nothing but praise for this movie, it is so real, and the amazing directing by David O.

		<fullReview>* * * * ? (4? out of 5)Three KingsDirected by: David O. Russell, 1999Andrea: I pity the country that has no heroesGalilei: No, pity the country that needs heroes- from Galilei, Bertolt Brecht, 1938I was reminded of Bertolt Brecht after I saw David Russell's Three Kings.Where I may disagree with Brecht's philosophy ? and hence this is not a political debate ? I find those specific words above very appropriate. And haunting.See, Three Kings is not about heroes or enemies, but about something as pure and honest as doing the right thing. This media labelled `war movie' is about overcoming adversity, finding a purpose and belief in life and making the right decision.Today the distance from actual reality to any given human being is larger than ever. One would think that with all the abundant technology and knowledge available, that it would lead to a more rational, united and focused contribution by those who have ? to those who have not. Cultures clash and financial interests clearly determine which way the wind blows. So it's sometimes hard to keep a straight face and just chew the popcorn. The world of consumerism ? from cellular phones to online grocery shopping ? seems awkwardly pitiful and tragicomic when there are countries plagued by hunger, famine, natural disasters and war. Russell's Three Kings manages to address all these issues indirectly as the first real Gulf War movie of substance. At the same time; it's probably the best that'll ever surface. The amazing workmanship lays the groundwork. Russell has a firm grip on evocative story-telling and throughout the movie presides a grungy, alternative and hip feel to the proceedings with his use of hazy and grainy cinematography (by Tom Sigel). There's also an acute awareness of motion picture coloration. Scenery is shot in watery beiges and greys giving the sun-scorched desert a feel all of its own. The time period is also perfectly depicted. There's a genuine sense of being back in the chaos and confusion of an Allied army camp during the 1991 Gulf War. `Are we shooting or what,' a US soldier asks his comrades as he stands in the desolate desert, confused, bewildered and boyishly intoxicated by the whole hype of being in actual war for the first time. Iraqi forces are surrendering left and right, so who knows when to shoot or not? He doesn't know and he doesn't get an answer. So he shoots. The victim is killed, huffing and puffing to a slow and cruel death. He was waving a flag and surrendering. But who could tell?The shooter is young Sergeant Troy Barlow as played by Mark Wahlberg. The former singer and rap artist, today a fine actor of grounded realism. It seems to come natural to him. I always considered Wahlberg to be a grittier long lost brother to the more rigid Matt Damon. Another key scene shows us Barlow in agonising pain as he is being tortured in captivity by Iraqi soldiers. One of many scenes that define the triumph of Russell's coyly manipulative movie-making. We now see a man who is starting to understand a little more about the politics of war. It's a tough scene, and one where the audience is sure to have turbo-charged ambivalent emotions racing inside. The sergeant is just one of many richly-textured characters. George Clooney is charismatic and totally embodies the role of Major Archie Gates ? a man of high intelligence and questionable moral but also of a charming blue-collar loyalty. Spike Jonze as redneck hick Conrad Vig and Ice Cube as the philosophical African-American Chief Elgin exchange punches and hugs and are both compelling, while Nora Dunn bears a striking resemblance in etiquette to an actual CNN broadcaster of the time. Säid Taghmaoui brings life, reason and compassion to the most difficult role: the Iraqi interrogator. Taghmaoui is scintillating. Russell's characters are first and foremost human beings and not Hollywood stereotypes. That's the essence of Three Kings; his story-telling is gutsy and reflective throughout.From the craziness and moody lunacy of the whole Iraqi invasion of Kuwait to the subsequent CNN-covered liberation by US, Canadian and European forces, Three Kings is brimming with razor-sharp wit and a genuine respect for all parties involved in the conflict. Former false modesties and nervous ironies of this horrible war are completely blown to smithereens in a clever and crude manner. History teaches us that in times of war all logic and reason heads for the nearest exit. When Barlow phones his pregnant wife from deep inside an Iraqi base on a stolen cell-phone amidst heaps of stolen electronic goods it's a logical move. The situation, however, is beyond sanity. Russell shrewdly shows us both. The story of stealing gold bullion out of an Iraqi stronghold by taking advantage of the cease-fire agreement sounds like an old John Wayne movie. But Three Kings is formula the way that Kelly's Heroes was. And it goes a step further and becomes a very confident hybrid of movies like M*A*S*H and Dr. Strangelove. Fickle wartime policies are made out to ridicule but not necessarily overly judged. The breathtaking visual ingenuity is staggering (there's even a `bullet-cam') and works to effect. It helps intensify the complete insanity of it all. Three Kings plays with our conscience and is both funny and absurd enough to keep us guessing until the very end. The message being that bad intentions are sometimes a necessary vice to clarify what good intentions look like. Three Kings is original entertainment. It's enlightening and engaging as it reopens closed history books. </fullReview>

Just as the Gulf War is ending, several soldiers attempt to find gold bullion stashed by Saddam Hussein from the Kuwaitis. George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and especially first-time actor Spike Jonze are all terrific as soldiers who are acting just our troops have won the war, yet face a dilemma of whether to aid the Iraqi rebels fighting Saddam.Three Kings perfectly captures the madness of the situation, and manages to be funny as well. Director David O. Russell, who has made edgy comedies such as Flirting with Disaster and Spanking the Monkey, switches to a totally different type of film, and directs with the same manic energy and style.

		<fullReview>Three Kings...where do i start? This is such a brilliant film for a number of reasons. First off, the acting in Three Kings is amazing, George Clooney, Mark Whalberg, Ice Cube, Spike Jonez, and the rest of the cast are so perfect for this film. They bring an edge of realism and utter brilliance to the picture which makes it that much more enjoyable to watch. Their characters are fully developed, and are incredibly believable at the parts they portray. Second, the cinematography of Three Kings is magnificent for the story of untold heroes of the Persian Gulf Crisis. The use of blurred visions and off colorization of scenes adds to the incredible intensity that surrounds the entire film. The script is also uncompromised, and 100% brilliance! It portrays the horrors of war, and of the situation of every day people not always considered in large pictures such as this one. The depth of every character and scene makes everything about Three Kings believable, even when Mark Whalberg's character finds a box of cell phones, locates one that works, and telephones his wife in the United States! I loved this film, for all of its wonderfully done parts!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very original war movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three Kings is about these three guys who, after Gulf War, decide to find and retrieve gold from Saddam Hussein. They don't actually take it from Saddam himself but from one of his many hiding places. This movie stars George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and Spike Jonze. The first three stars are the Three Kings, Spike Jonze plays a redneck who helps them with the mission and provides comic relief. When the movie starts the Gulf War has just ended. Everybody is celebrating because soon they are going to go home to their families and friends. A few minutes later in the movie they kill an enemy Iraqi soldier, and when searching him find a map in his ass. This map shows where some of Saddam's gold is located. So Ice Cube, Wahlberg, Clooney and Jonze go on a mission to find it. The premise of the movie is very straight forward but as the story goes on a lot of crazy events hinder them from getting to the gold and getting it back to the base and eventually home where they will be very rich men. Wahlberg gets captured, the truck with the gold in it crashes, and a whole bunch of other crazy stuff(I don't want to ruin some of the movie's surprises for you). One thing that bothers me is the abuse of power by the American Soldiers in this movie. They kill a lot of the Iraqi soldiers just because they are pissed off about the war and having to fight and be stuck in the desert, which you're not supposed to do considering it could restart the war. They also order everyone around even though they don't have the authority. All in all this movie is very enjoyable though. It's funny, full of action and is very different from most of the movies that are released now. I wouldn't recommend it to people who are offended by violence or profanity. Anyone who likes really original movies or likes action, or comedy, I would definitely recommend this to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice New Style War Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether or not you will enjoy this film depends greatly on perspective. That is, not in the sense of which character (if it is the "good guy" or the "bad guy") you choose to support, plot, comedy, irony, etc., but rather the style of filmmaking that is used.If you choose the former sense, then this movie does have all of the elements that a movie would need. George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, as well as Spike Jonze (it was a pleasant surprise to see him acting) all give nice performances and there is a nice suspenseful element in the plot. There is even the odd "tear jerker" moment. Like when an Iraqi soldier is torturing an American with electric shocks and makes him reflect on his own family in the U.S. in a war situation by saying to him (in a strong accent): "What if they dropped a bomb on your daughter, my main man? I no longer have a son". While these elements do exist in this film, if that is what you are looking for in a film then you've probably seen better (anti)war flicks.If you choose the latter sense then there is much to be appreciated in this film. Everything from the Matrix-esque gunfights to the clever cinematography to the unique way of showing the effects of a bullet wound inside of the recipient's body.Such a manner of filmmaking is manifesting itself through more and more directors these days and to them, I say Bravo! for blazing new trails.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great "war" movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three Kings is one of several movies to really break the trend of "war" movies that Hollywood creates, and its funny, intelligent and moving script will put this film with classics such as M*A*S*H and Catch-22.Unlike such gritty (and, yes, amazing) films as Saving Private Ryan, this war story makes an impact because it doesn't blurrily run through it's shooting scenes, but rather pays close attention to the effect of every shot fired. At no point does it lend itself to a shoot-em-up movie.I'm not big on George Clooney, but he, Ice Cube and Mark Walhberg actually step into some real acting here. The directing is great, and I had a lot of laughs. It was ignored at Oscar time, but don't miss this one. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this film for capturing one of those moments when creatures usually driven by greed suddenly turn into heroes/saints. The plight of the Iraqis was depicted with enough intensity to make the conversion of the American soldiers plausible. The special effects, for which apologies are made at the very beginning, were adequate and lent humor to some of the situations which would otherwise have been deeply depressing. Overall, I very much enjoyed the sense of humor of the creators, and would recommend this movie as one with a good heart and a good mind for like-hearted and -minded audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With movies such as American Beauty and Being John Malkovich getting most of the hype and praise by critics, there was one movie overlooked. Three Kings and American Beauty were both the best pictures of the year, but Three Kings needs the credit it deserves. This is something we have not seen before, how many action movies, show the effects of war or the effects of a gun shot wound. Not only is it original, but the acting is superb. George Clooney makes us forget about Batman and Robin, Ice Cube is showing the Boyz N the Hood was no fluke, and Mark Wahlberg has a standout erformance. Even Spike Jonze, the director of Being John Malkovich, has a good and very funny performance. If you have already seen this movie, see it again, b/c it is just as good or maybe even better the second time. If you haven't seen it yet, then I don't know what your waiting for. Go see IT! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's 1991, and in the first chaotic hours after the Persian Gulf cease-fire, a band of opportunistic American soldiers led by George Clooney realize they can pull off one of the biggest gold heists in history by raiding one of Saddam Hussein's bunkers of stolen Kuwaiti loot in the nearby desert. "We'll be back in time for lunch," Clooney assures his men, which nicely sums up America's post-Vietnam military doctrine in this brilliant satire of the Persian Gulf War, the media, and modern life in general. You don't have to be "anti-war" to appreciate this film; I, for one, think Saddam Hussein was a dangerous player who needed to be put in check, and George Bush did about as good a job of it as could be done. But this film serves to remind us that war by its very nature cannot be "surgical" and "clean," that bullets do great damage to the human body (presented as an artsy conceit that some people might find irritating, but I think it's a good point), that the powerless are just as likely to be trampled upon by their "liberators" as by their oppressors, and that even sadistic Iraqi Republican Guardsmen have families. Besides that, it's extremely funny (the cell phone scene was fantastic, and the "day job" scene also comes to mind, among many others), tense and action-packed. It doesn't get any better than this. See it!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that the film's story is the best thing to describe the whole Gulf War, America came hare not because of human rights or to free the poor Iraqi people but because of gold (The Black Gold).Ironically, the sands of Karbala in Iraq are famous for the tragic death of Alhusain bin Ali the grand son of prophet Mohammad and his family before 1400 years ago. Which is some how reflected in the suffering of the Iraqi people in the Gulf War.The film managed to give the audience a taste of that war. After all the film is quite good and it's unique in its kind.I think that most of Americans remains ignorant of what's happening around them in this world and I think they are imprisoned there self in there own unrealistic world although they are equipped with the most powerful technology of communications. And one can see the dangerous role of films because it's like a the two edges of a sword espicialy for those who don't know.Search in IMDB for: The Message (1976) &amp; Lion of the Desert</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's very hard to explain Three Kings to someone and really make them understand what the film is like. There are so many different elements thrown together that categorisation is nie on impossible, but with the films schizophrenic attitude to genre, what results is refreshing for a Hollywood picture. As a viewer you find yourself laughing out loud, squirming in your seat or jumping for joy ( which must've been quite annoying for the bloke sat behind me). With warfare portrayed in film many different ways, Three Kings says more about war today than any other and in a way that is totally compelling. The actors are all excellent, and the direction changes pace and handles awkward mood swings with consummate ease. When you see this film, it won't be what you expected, but it will be good.

		<shortDescription>Fascinating, provocative, compelling ... yet overhyped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERS,I would give "Three Kings" maybe 7 stars out of 10. It's a powerful and well-made film, but certainly not the masterpiece some critics have made it out to be. It's an engaging story alright, with good dialogue that generally avoids cliches, and often mordant humor, particularly when it contrasts the evidence of global consumerism with the devastation of war. (George Clooney telling the Iraqi dissidents "George Bush wants you!" was one of the funniest scenes.) I also enjoyed David O. Russell's cinematography. Some of the visual imagery -- robed figures in gas masks emerging out of the fog of mustard gas like ghosts, the brightly colored Nerf footballs amidst the washed-out desert, the long line of refugees marching along the dunes -- was simply unforgettable.There was good acting, too. George Clooney was better here than in "The Peacemaker," even if he was doing a bit too much of a movie star turn. Mark Wahlberg turns in a moving and convincing performance (not quite up to the level of "Boogie Nights," but then he had a much more richly developed character to play in that film). And Spike Jonze's character, Private Vig, eventually transcended the annoying hillbilly cliche.And now the bad news.The movie is constantly ramming its political message down the viewer's throat (much the way Walhberg's character, Troy Barlow, has oil poured down his throat by an Iraqi torturer to "educate" him about the true goals of the Gulf War). How many times did we need to hear yet another character repeat that he/she has no idea what this war was about, or that Bush let down the Iraqi people after encouraging them to rise up against Saddam? Also, the attempt to draw some sort of moral equivalency between the American soldier and his Iraqi torturer was rather crude and simplistic.Emotional manipulation. Of course the scene where the mother is shot in front of her child and the weeping child is dragged off by soldiers is harrowing -- how could it not be? -- but here we can transparently see the director pulling at our heartstrings. (Same thing when the Iraqi torturer tells Barlow about his child dying in the bombing and asks him to imagine how he would feel if his daughter died.)The visual inventiveness sometimes becomes gimmickry. For instance: the first time we see the inside of a human body penetrated by a bullet, it's truly shocking. The second time, it was, pardon the expression, overkill. (In fact, the sound of the wounded Barlow gasping for breath as the air fills his chest was far scarier than the view of his lungs.)Fairly one-dimensional characters. (I couldn't believe that some reviews praised the characterization!) Archie Gates (Clooney), the cynic with a compassionate heart. Chief Elgin (Ice Cube), the dignified, devout Christian (they never explained how his religious principles gibed with the gold-stealing caper). Sgt. Barlow, the loving husband and father who just wants to get back to his family. Private Vig, the comic relief who ultimately turns out to be pretty caring as well. Some of the character development made little sense. At first Barlow doesn't want to help the Iraqi villagers, then we're supposed to believe that he undergoes a moral conversion after being tortured ... except that even before that, he has already risked his life -- and dropped his bag of gold -- to save the two kids who were running toward the mines. (By the way, since family appears to be the key dimension to his character, why isn't he even more outraged than his comrades when the Iraqi soldier shoots the mother?) Maybe all this is meant to suggest moral complexity, but instead it ends up being muddled.A certain amount of hypocrisy. We're told how horrible war and violence are, yet in the action sequences we're also supposed to cheer when our heroes blow up the bad guys (how much thought is given to the Iraqis who are burned to a crisp inside that helicopter?).HUGE logical holes and factual gaffes. Here are a couple of the more obvious ones:How were they going to get all that gold home to the U.S.? Stash it in their backpacks? It would have actually made more sense if each of them just took a few bars, which certainly would have greatly improved their lives at home.A person who had been forced to swallow oil would have been violently sick; yet we see Barlow walking around not much worse for the wear.Re Spike Jonze's character: I believe you need a high school diploma to be accepted into the Army. And they've had diversity training program for years so that Vig would have known better than to use racist language in front of Chief.In the torture scene, Barlow tells his interrogator that he only joined the Army reserves for extra cash because he found out he was having a baby. (This underscores the parallels between him and the torturer, who also joined Saddam's army to provide a nice life for his family.) That means he would have joined less than a year ago (his daughter being 1 month old), and he's already a sergeant???Come to think of it, the mother's shooting doesn't make much sense, either. The Iraqi soldiers wanted the Americans to get out of the village; they could see that the Americans were troubled by the mistreatment of the villagers. So what do they do? Commit a cold-blooded and totally unnecessary atrocity right in front of the Americans.For all these flaws, this movie is far superior in both intelligence and filmmaking to most Hollywood fare. (It's certainly head and shoulders above "Titanic.") So, it's worth seeing, but I think reviews that build up the expectations too high actually detract from the viewing experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War Is Greed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the Gulf War "raged" in 1991 and more than 90% of the American people claimed they were behind this cynical effort, I kept my dissenting mouth shut for perhaps the first time in my life. It was clear to me that we were saving some rich (and absent) Kuwaiti ass and our oil supply; the persecution of the Iraqi people by Saddam Hussein was not our concern."The Three Kings" brings this message home with flair and style; I gave it a 9. Good, solid acting; solid editing and occasionally brilliant editing work hold up throughout the movie, which must have been hard to shoot in the desert. Several scenes in which good guys and bad guys are confused truly illustrate the idiocy of the situation.The plot is simple enough: A few soldiers to collude to steal war booty and find the heroic within themselves, if only briefly.What kept this movie from greatness? Perhaps the pervasive cynicism, relieved only at the end, and then it's not lasting. Nevertheless, it's well worth watching as an action flick or as a study in modern "warfare."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is quite possibly the worst war film I have ever seen, and it is definately one of THE worst films in cinematic history. Everything about this films is awful: the acting, the "story," the action, the music, the direction, the cinematography, etc. etc. I've seen better examples of the above-mentioned in 20-second TV commercials. (And you know you're in for a treat when the main character is introduced in a scene that has him getting a furious lap-job from a television reporter.)What could have been an exciting adventure picture about a search for stolen gold instead turns out to be another artsy-fartsy film that tries to stand out from the rest with so-called "artistic style."And don't even get me started on what is quite possibly the lamest gun fight ever committed to celluoid. A character fires a gun. The camera pans left-to-right in semi-slow motion (as if tracking the bullet), and comes to rest on the intended victim. We hear a dull thud as the bullet hits, and the man falls over. Each exchange of gun fire in this scene is played out that way.None of the characters are even remotely interesting, but what do you expect from a film with Ice Cube and Mark Whalberg in the cast?George Clooney appears to be one of those actors who will just tank and tank in feature films for years, making only one really great film ("The Peacemaker") and too many bad ones to even count. A shame, too, because I kind of like him.If you want a see a good film that takes place in the Middle East around the time of the Gulf War (and the first film to be set at that time), rent 1991's "The Human Shield" with Michael Dudikoff. It has everything "Three Kings" doesn't, and it's a much MUCH better film.THREE KINGS: 0/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, what a movie. The first couple of minutes before they find the bunker, you feel so much tension as if you were really there.It was as if I switched places with the characters and was experiencing the moment myself. Saving Private Ryan perhaps tried too hard to make you feel as if you were there but all it did was make you think, ouch that had to hurt. This movie makes you think more like the soldiers probably felt, like, I hope I don't get hit by a bullet but I won't let anyone know just how scared I am I'll just take my mind off the subject. Then when they see a fellow comrad in danger you want to help them but not forgetting you can still get your butt blown off. And I must say I was impressed with the technology we have during war times, maybe thats why I liked it so much because I love technology and all that James Bond art. But George Clooney, to my surprise, was an ace as a member of the Special Ops division in the movie. It's a very good movie, the fact that George Bush makes a peace treaty with Iraq causes much of the tension felt by the viewer, how far will the other side go without breaking it, I guess you'll just have to see.</fullReview>

He always seems to play the smart tough-guy, with a heart buried beneath the smarmy veneer.Contrary to other reviewers, I did NOT find that this film glorified the USA. It made a point of showing us to be bullies, who only entered into the Gulf War for $$$. When presented the opportunity to aid in a fight for freedom, we passed.Finally, why do Texans always have to be played like idiots? This film did an excellent job of portraying Arabs as the people they are, not just stereotypes; but, like so many others, it presented a Texan as a cartoon character.In any case, I highly recommend this film.

		<shortDescription>inventive war movie satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Three Kings" is that rarest of commodities in commercial American moviemaking - a freewheeling satire that resembles nothing less than a dizzying cinematic kaleidoscope of taut action sequences, clever sight gags, frenetic editing and dazzlingly inventive camerawork, all somehow coalescing into a satisfying organic whole. It definitely isn't a film for all tastes; many will find its constantly shifting tones and courageous irreverence jarring and bewildering to say the least. Certainly, for those who prefer their war movies "straight," with the heroes and villains clearly delineated and the tone one of respectful seriousness, "Three Kings" will more likely irritate than exhilarate. However, for those with an appreciation for the off beat and the unconventional, this film provides much to admire and applaud.Set in the confusing days immediately after the end of the Gulf War, the film features a quartet of American servicemen (George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube and Spike Jonze) discovering a map leading to Sadaam Hussein's cache of gold bullion stolen from the Kuwaities. As the four men head out on their own to find it and steal it, they encounter a bizarre desert world inhabited by men caught in a savage ritual of slaughter as the Iraqi army attempts to systematically wipe out the rebel forces among their own people, spurred on by George Bush's admonition to overthrow their leader and the American military's subsequent abandonment of those same people. Writer/director David O. Russell casts a scathing eye on both Sadaam Hussein and his murderous ways as well as the American military leaders who, essentially, set up the anti-Hussein forces for self-annihalation. In this setting, the four "heroes" learn what is truly of value in this world and end up doing the "right thing."This synopsis does not, however, begin to do justice to the remarkable innovation and creativity of the film, for its true quality does not lie in its "message" but in its execution, in the myriad miniscule details and tiny moments of unexpected humor - often shattered by the stunning eruption of shocking violence - that comprise the dense fabric of the film. "Three Kings," unlike so many current films, pulses with life, even at those rare moments when the plotting tends to become a bit obscure or the point of it all seems momentarily to elude the author. One always feels one is in the presence of a master filmmaker, an artist with a firm grasp of all the best elements of cinema at his disposal. The "weakest" element of "Three Kings" (and that is truly a relative term in this case) lies in its character development. Intriguing and likeable as these four men are at times, Russell does not flesh them out with enough depth to make them entirely comprehensible in either their motivations or their innate personality makeups. Perhaps with all the absurdist humor and visual kinetics spinning around them, the main characters have simply too much to compete with and they too become just part of the swirling, eye-filling chaos. This inability to always focus on the psychological nuances of character may account for the fact that the film goes a bit soft at the end, losing some of its cutting edge sharpness as a sop, perhaps, to the mass audience without whose support more films like "Three Kings" could never even see the light of day. Still, despite its rare imperfections, "Three Kings" is a film whose creativity, energy and style will hopefully serve as a model for other American filmmakers in the near future. Jaded by countless films that take the easy path of derivativeness and unoriginality, some of us in the audience hunger and beg for more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great, well balanced film sadly overlooked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>3 Kings was in my opinion a very good film, combining comedy, action, violence and sentimentality in an interesting plot line with unusual characters added to improve it further.The Scene is in Iraq at the end of the Gulf War, where the party attitude is rampant due to the fact that the war is over and the peace treaty signed with most of the soldiers having not seen any action and having not made any kills what so ever. It proceeds to give a introduction to the characters who involve an aging CNN reporter, a special forces captain looking for an adventure and a group of privates with bogus jobs who joined the army as an escape from their day to day life.The story follows the men as they decide to take a risk by following a map to wealth and riches. All I can say is that this trip takes a wild twist involving a lot more Iraq's and a lot more action and lots of sentimentality and is combined here with some very ridiculous events which provide the humor.3 Kings starts off as a story about a bunch of americans out to have a good time in Iraq and turns into a sentimental story showing how every person involved in the war is a human being for his or her different reasons. It delves deep into the personalities of the characters and shows you many interesting things, for example the view of Iraq's, soldiers and refugees towards americans and shows the refugees as real people, not to be looked down upon, at one point there are several refugees making jokes about one of the americans hairstyles and everyone has a good laugh.I think this movie turned out to be much more than I expected and I think that it will surprise you.It is definitely worth a watch and I think that this was more like what I expected of The Siege which i found disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three Kings was by far the most enjoyable movie of 1999 and one of the most entertaining movies ever. By not giving it a single nomination the Academy takes its credibility down to rock bottom. Three Kings is a near flawless movie and is recommended for EVERYONE. The visual style is amazing, the directing is superb and the acting is top-notch. David O. Russell puts himself into the league of Martin Scorsese and Oliver Stone with this and he deserved at least ten Oscars. American Beauty was a fabulous movie, but Three Kings was ten times better.

		<fullReview>This film is immense fun, both in terms of its irreverent style (the rigorous jokeyness is actually very Richard Lester, showing how dismayingly unadventurous our modern cinema is) and in its action, with its four dislikeable, very funny heroes, and the heist plot. But it is, if I may say so under IMDb guidelines, compromised; the inability to go all the way with the satire not only dilutes it but negates it; and the structural allegiance to THE WILD BUNCH, a pitilessly, fearlessly bleak film, only demonstrates its pusillanimity. Some scenes are very powerful though (yes, the torture scene), and the link between the black blood of the Iraqi victims' blood and the murderous oil slick is shaming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of '99?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nevermind the Oscars, please, but I have been on a quest to watch the critics best of 99 movies. And Three Kings is up there on a local list. And now on mine.This movie should belong on any awards list simply because of what it achieves in Directing and Photography. Being John Malkovich, oh please. I watched it at the end of a run of movies that included this title, American Beauty, Boys Don't Cry and The Insider. What Spike Jonze can really credit himself with is an apperance as a part of this movie. The amount of praise that came on after Saving Private Ryan should have been reserved for this title. Yes, it falls prey to the same need of American Movies to see Americans as world saviours, but it subverts it with a message that greed is what drives the whole mission anyway.The whole look of the movie is another stunner. I have heard of it referred to as a 'left out in the sun' look. And that just about says it. There is a sparkling quality to it, which should really blind you, but makes it all clearer somehow.Brilliant work overall. From scripting, to the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! What an experience! When I first saw the preview for this film, I thought it was going to be just another piece of Hollywood trash. Boy was I wrong. Three Kings is one of the freshest, most exhilarating rides I've ever had at the movie theater. The action is highly unpredictable, yet it flows so well together that you start to wonder why Hollywood can't ever seem to do something this good. It's more than just action, though. It contains a strong political message where American foreign policy is actually criticized. It also questions moral values such as greed and the worth of human life.Three Kings was not honored with any oscar nominations because the majority of academy members had their heads in their rear ends. Not all, but most. It will take many years before Three Kings is finally recognized, but it will be the film, I think, that will be remembered for the year 1999. Not necessarily American Beauty and The Green Mile, and certainly not The Sixth Sense or The Cider House Rules. It will be Three Kings. Mark my words.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grotesque war movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a film and a half that makes John Wayne's 'Green Berets' look subtle. It's a vulgar and tendentious re-working of 'Kelly's Heroes' set in the gulf, headed by George Clooney, a dull actor every bit as smug and self-regarding on screen as he is in interviews. This film's much vaunted originality consists of unnecessary and distracting film stock changes and Peckinpah-like slow-mo with someone invariably flying through the air with something exploding in the background. The self congratulatory scenes with the soldiers in the tent at the beginning set the smug tone for the rest of the film. This is a film that wants Americans to feel good about themselves. And they couldn't during the gulf war because they were made to stand by while Iraqi's suppressed their own people sometimes a few feet away from them. This film wants to re-write that history by suggesting hey, we did go out on a limb to help them after all. In fact, this is a film that wants to eat it's cake and have it. It criticises America's involvement while at the same time moaning that they didn't finish the job. At the same time it indulges in some tasteless and unfunny would-be black humour and slapstick to encourage us to like these aw-shucks, non-too-bright good old boys. While civilians and other 'towel heads' (in the parlance of the film) die around our heroes, let us not forget that the most significant death is always the American's. He is afforded a long wake with a bunch of Muslims praying over his body. I remember when a wheel chair bound American was killed by terrorists on board a ship in real life, an entire film was made around his death starring Burt Lancaster. American film's invariably revolve around the violent acquisition of money, with the usual un-engaging and tedious results. Likewise, This one's plot is wildly implausible and at times, plain daft. These soldiers actually have the gall to invoke soldiers honour at the end of the film after selfishly tarnishing it for a boring and witless two hours. The only soldiers with any real integrity are the two Iraqi's who bravely went back to face their enemy after the rest of their men cowardly deserted, an enemy that had broken a ceasefire for the theft of gold that did not belong to them. And why? Because we are led to believe that these men are hard done by in one of the richest countries in the world. Their living conditions are so desperate that they are even equated with an Iraqi's in one particularly nauseating scene in the film. 'Three Kings' attempts to be even handed about this war are disingenuous if not down right dishonest. Give it a dishonourable discharge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It has action in it but its in no way an 'action film'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Three Kings last night (I'm not slow, just English), so its still pretty fresh in my mind. I actually went to the cinema to see The Green Mile but it was Saturday evening and it was unsurprisingly sold out. So, myself and my two friends deliberated over what film to see, should it be Toy Story 2 for a fourth time, or American Beauty for a second but I'd just read a very positive review in the newspaper of Three Kings and it sounded good. So, we got our tickets for the nearly full showing of TK and went out for food to kill time until the later showing started. When it began, the opening scene showed us pretty much all of the main characters and began with some very nasty yet funny jokes about whether or not the troops were'shooting people' anymore. This opening scene was indeed very funny, but it was also very effective in showing us the less than eager yet utterly desensitised troops in the Gulf War of 1991. The war, it transpired had just ended and US President Bush had told the peoples of the affected countries to rise up against Saddam but hadn't actually offered anything in the way of support. This is the basic structure of the plot throughout the rest of the film but it is most certainly a lot more complex than that. The trailer (oh dear, how incorrectly was this film marketed) showed TK to be a brash, action movie filled with loveable rogues and guns. Sure, it is an action movie in part, it does have a lot of guns and yes, the characters (Clooney in particular) are loveable rogues but this is one of those films that makes you laugh, a lot, but also makes you sit there, open mouthed unable to fully take in the horror in front of your eyes. Anyway, this is a film about four American troops who find a secret map (in a man's a**e, no less) that leads them to stolen Kuwaiti Bullion. And so, the men go AWOL in the hope that this little endeavour will be a quick afternoon job, go in, flash the weapons, get the gold and go. However, although it does sort of work out this way, before the men leave they realise the predicament the townsfolk of these war stricken villages are in. These are ordinary people, told to 'rise up' but they have no weapons, no water and Saddam's soldiers are on their tails from word go. So, in true Magnificent Seven style, the outnumbered good guys take on the bad guys. Simple, unoriginal.? Hell no! The goodies don't take to the idea well, the whole thing is just a big mistake after one of Saddam's Republic army kills an innocent woman in front of her husband and daughter. What follows is a superbly stylish and deeply effective gun fight where the camera never breaks from slow motion and follows each bullet as it leaves its respective bullet and embeds itself in the body of a soldier. Main characters get shot, the cease fire is broken and the law breaking escalates. The rest of the film is spent pondering the plights of the Americans and their understandably less-than-grateful protectees. The film has its fair share of nicely played action set pieces, but where it really excels is in its powerful messages and beautifully acted 'quiet bits'. It gives us characters we can enjoy and like and then makes us watch them suffer. George Clooney is excellent as the worldly, knowledgeable Archie Gates on the edge of retirement. Mark Wahlberg gives us a nice, pretty boy patriot, Troy Barlow, who doesn't really like what he's doing, but does it for the benefits it could bring. Ice Cube, Chief Elgin is suitably stylish to look at, and plays his born again Christian role with quiet power. My favourite character was Spike Jonze as Conrad Vig. You know him? The funny little man from the Fat Boy Slim 'Praise You' video? Well, he can't dance but he can direct (Being John Malkovich) and he can act too! He plays a weedy little yokel with 'no real day job' (watch the film and realise why people who have will chuckle when they read that) who wants to be Wahlberg's character more than anything. The main players are supported nicely by Jamie (Randy from Scream) Kenedy and a foolish yet not entirely heartless reporter, who's name shamefully escapes me. Overall, this is a film that made me think, a lot, that night about how vile war is. But its not entirely an anti-war movie. The message I think it said was that the only way out of war is more war, until its over. A sort of Just War type thing.As a piece of entertainment, it'll make you laugh (never before has an exploding cow been so great to watch!), make you think about things in a new way (the bullet sequence is a real 'stick in the mind' piece of cinema) and it'll make you think you spent the money on the ticket wisely. And isn't that the real point of the movies? Well if not, getting messages across as well as this movie does must be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this film. The effects created were outstanding, ie:- the slow motion shots of the bullets flying towards their intended target; was reminiscent of the 'matrix' and its use of the so-called bullet time. The realities of war are very graphically thrown at you. It easily rivals Spielberg's first 15 minutes of 'Saving Private Ryan' for sheer intensity and realism. Clooney gives his stock performance and is very impressive in his role as the 'leader' of the troop. Mark Whalberg continues to amaze me with his performances he definitely can hold his own against other top actors (if only he got rid of that whiny voice he puts on for most if not all his previous films), as for the others - ice cube should start using his real name as he is talented and could make a name for himself in this business. All in all this is a good film that doesn't take itself too seriously, its only failing is its formulaic "try too hard to be a tearjerker" ending</fullReview>

But for all its qualities (and there are plenty) it seems that in making a big budget Russell has also been tainted with Hollywood conventions such as the contrived ending and a few formulaic scenes.

		<shortDescription>I was positively surprised in this movie. It showed many aspects about the gulf war that are not usually shown. It was in many ways fair.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to watch this movie because very few movies were made about this war. Very little was known about it and many things were masked by the media. It was one of the few movies that shows that not only the US army is right and the 'enemies' or the opponents are simply a bunch bad and clumsy soldiers. This is the usual trend regardless of whether the enemies are Germans , Russians, Arabs or Vietnamese. In this movie there was an encounter between four American soldiers and Iraqis that belong to several groups. It was clearly shown in which bad conditions the people are living under suppression and in a destroyed country. It was also the first encounter of these American soldiers with war at all since they were sitting in their camps waiting that the air raids and the other allied forces finish the job. Many mistakes of this war were shortly mentioned in smart short commentaries like mentioning burying the Iraqi soldiers alive in their barricades with bulldozers. In fact many dialogs and statements met some sensible issues of this war like bombarding civilians. It demonstrated as well what a bullet can do to the human body and that it is not only a game! It showed the Americans, the Iraqi soldiers and the population of south Iraq as human beings with their strengths and weaknesses. Nevertheless one can not expect a Hollywood movie to be completely non-hollywoodic. For instance the end of the movie was rather "traditional". Also the American soldiers can shoot better than the Iraqis although the latter ones are members of the elite troops. The movie had even humor in some scenes although sometimes one doesn't know whether one should laugh or cry! The photography was very good and it served its purpose efficiently. Special photographic effects were used like altering the contrasts , the brightness and the graininess of the pictures scenes to enhance their beauty. The music was also generally well chosen and fitted good. In my opinion there was nothing special about the acting performance of the main characters. In general the roles of the Arabs were more convincing or let us say more natural. I am still asking myself why does this movie have this name? Although they were four soldiers only three are mentioned. Is this a similar case like the 'Three musketeers'? Does it have anything to do with the three kings of the new testament? It is maybe like this since they gave a big gift to a group of poor refugees at the end of the movie. Some other comments suggested nominating this movie for the academy award. Well I think it is too good to win an academy award!</fullReview>

George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, and Ice Cube all put on some amazing performances. Clooney's history in films has been tarnished by the occasional film flub. I personally enjoy most of his movies. Cube and Wahlberg are both musicians-turned-actors who are proving that they are able to hold their own in a good movie.This movie dealt with the bonding of three men in the search for stolen gold that they wanted to claim for themselves. In the end however they realise it is more important to help the needy people of Iraq and that money is not everything. A well acted, directed and shot piece, this will go down in the history of war movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An antidote to the summer blockbuster; courageous and original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In one memorable scene from ?Three Kings', there is a brief gunfight between American and Iraqi troops. Rather than cramming the frame with flying debris, however, Russel slows down the action, following each individual bullet from gun to victim with low-framerate cameras that trace each round's path. A split-second battle extended into thirty seconds, it allows the audience time to take in the random and impersonal elements of the scene before us. It's an excellent example of the main appeal of this film to me; although we all know about the Gulf War from TV, and war films are as familiar a genre to us as any other, this film is entirely different in its tone and presentation to anything that has come before it.In addition to excellent performances from all involved (Ice T and Mark Wahlberg in the same movie... now there's courageous casting), the film is expertly crafted. The (fittingly quirky) direction, script, bleached cinematography, and editing are woven together seamlessly, lending even the bleak desert landscapes a distinct character. In spite of its bizarre blend of comedy against graphic violence, of empathy against tension, ?Three Kings' preserves a continuity of atmosphere; it is very much a complete film, each part fitting comfortably into the overall tone of the piece.There is also a genuine effort made to consider the characters and viewpoints from both sides of the battle; whilst the Iraqi torturer we meet is indeed sadistic, his hatred is born out of a loss brought upon him by Allied bombing, and the film does not shy from the more unpleasant truths behind the war. The honesty inherent in this goes some way towards apologising for films such as 'The Siege', which seem insultingly shallow in their treatment of similar themes next to this film. Perhaps most important of all is that the film treats its as intelligent; the assumption is made that we are responsible enough to deal with the shocks and criticisms the film places before us; for a Hollywood studio, this makes for a refreshing change, and a much superior film to the regular studio fare. The people who made this film knew that most people don't actually need dappled cinematography and a sweeping orchestral score to whoosh us into emotional responses on cue.I would emphasise that ?Three Kings' is another instance of a film not done justice by its publicity; I saw a trailer for it before 'The Beach' which made it look like a Gulf War action film, with Clooney and company shooting and driving their way through ranks of Iraqi soldiers. This does no justice whatsoever to a film which is richly diverse and genuinely thought-provoking in its content. It's like advertising American Beauty as a straightforward comedy (oh no, wait, they did...). It's a trend that increasingly continues to damage exciting new films by making them seem generic and unoriginal.On the verge of global release after its undeservedly lukewarm response in America, I fear many will perhaps have been put off this film by its inappropriately gung-ho trailer; to any such people who might now be looking to these pages for further feedback, I would say this; while the film does indeed have several highly original and genuinely tense action set-pieces, it is primarily a thoughtful and courageous reconsideration of a war which was maybe not quite as ?won' as we all thought it was, and deals with the ethical connotations of the hasty Allied withdrawal responsibly and effectively.This is a great film, refreshing in its style and important in its message. If you've seen the trailer, don't worry- it's the most innovative and complex ?action' film you'll ever watch. Go and see it before summer arrives, and be reminded exactly why films like this should be treasured, and encouraged. Top marks.</fullReview>

Best Picture, but how about Best Script, Best Direction, and most certainly Best Cinematogrphy: the look of this film was every bit as memorable as Saving Private Ryan, which it kind of reminded me of, the way the color was so bled out and everything made to look so parched. It made it gritty and hallucinatory at the same time. One of the best films ever dealing with war, and an absolutely original and intoxicating mix of drama, comedy, satire, action/adventure, and bitter political commentary. Another unqualified success for writer/director David O. Russell, making him now 3 for 3 (Spanking the Monkey and Flirting With Disaster being the other two).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Film Not Nominated for a Single Academy Award Out There</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard of Three Kings, I absolutely despised it. Why? Well, I thought the commercials made it look like some hip kind of movie that would make a mockery of war and attract the commonfolk. Let's admit it, the commercials didn't at all accurately show what this film was really about in fear of not attracting a big audience. So there I was on my computer, despising the film and at Roger Ebert's website, when I saw a review for Three Kings with 4 stars. I thought it was some kind of fluke, but then a friend who saw it told me he thought it was one of the best films of the year. So my interest in the film was then huge and I went to see it a few weeks later over Fight Club, which I had wanted to see but my friends didn't.This film was such a treat. I knew it was going to be unique after the first scene, but I wasn't sure if it was going to be the good kind of unique. The storyline has 4 soldiers fighting in Desert Storm right after the War has been declared over. The soldiers find a map in a surprising place(trust me, you wouldn't want me to give it away) and find that it leads to bulyan, the Kuwaiti form of gold. On their journey to get the gold and throughout, the soldiers find themselves changing gradually. I won't go any further into the summary.The acting was good, with strong performances by Mark Wahlberg, Spike Jonze, George Clooney, Ice Cube, and 2 Arab actors whose names I am unfamiliar with. This is the first war movie I've seen that is successfully funny yet very dramatic. The end of this film is touching, and the film satiates your need to know about what happens afterwards by telling you exactly that.I also thought there were no superfluous scenes in this film. Every scene feels important, and every scene will keep you interested. The film is shot in a really unique way, and it looks great. The only problem I had with this film is the title. Why couldn't it be titled Four Kings? Why in the world are they leaving Spike Jonze out? He definitely had as large a role as the other three leads....About the comedy in this film, a lot of it may fly over your head. I never understood the haircut joke until I read about it on a website after I saw the film. This film is probably hit and miss comedy at its best, and I can't recall any misses! I am writing this a few hours after the Oscar announcements and am quite angry this film wasn't at all acknowledged? What is the Academy afraid of?This review has been all over the place, but that's the way I feel about this movie. There's so much to say, and so little room to say it. I recommend this to any mature person over the age of 15. Trust me, don't let anyone younger watch this. I give this movie a 9/10, but on the IMDB, a 10/10 because it needs it to balance out the low number of votes. If any other movie I've seen this year has generated more positivity, I haven't seen it yet....(ok, ok, so I haven't seen American Beauty of Being John Malkovich yet, hehe)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie because I am a big fan of David O. Russell's earlier movie "Flirting With Disaster". I was pleasantly surprised at the directors third film. This movie has a huge budget compared to his earlier movies but it still focuses on character development and storyline before the action. George Clooney is on a roll after scoring in last years "Out of Sight". Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube are turning into good actors. The real star of this movie is the camera and the untraditional ways that it is used. Russell literally puts the camera inside the action in ways that have never been seen on film. This movie is a must see in my book. Can't wait for it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all....I liked it. Three Kings is definitely a unique movie. Lets go with the basic premise...the United States is just completing its role in the Gulf War and Iraq has withdrawn from Kuwait. Four soldiers, with the help of some "behind the scenes" manoeuvering, come across a map to the gold that Iraq has taken from Kuwait. These soldiers, George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and Spike Jonze, go into Iraq to get the stolen gold. Along the way they face various hurdles, including the unwanted involvement of a nosey reporter, Nora Dunn. This film breaks new ground and this new ground has raised some controversy. In one of the scenes, Clooney describes what a bullet does to a human body, and while he describes it the scene on the screen shows it in detail. Why the controversy? They use a real cadaver. I guess this is a new way to break into the movies for some. The scene while gross, does show what damage a bullet does in a very educational manner. The scenes in this film are as unique as the storyline. You are literally shocked a few times when a specific action scene takes place...so shocked you won't see the scene on a trailer. This is probably the first time all the best movie scenes will never make it into the trailer. Clooney is great as the leader of this group, Ice Cube is as cool as one can be, Mark Wahlberg continues to show the skills of a great actor, but the most surprising performance is put on by Spike Jonze, who you truly can hate as an individual but yet understand why he acts the way he does. One of the most heard comments about this film is that the audience has to make it through the first 20 minutes and after that you are hooked. Three Kings is a film like no other....it has a single small comparison to "Kelly's Heroes" with Clint Eastwood, in the fact that soldiers look for gold, but that's it. Bottom line...while some question how much of a war was the Gulf War...this film shows that even a little is still too much.</fullReview>

They came out a whole lot humbler (and smarter).As for the people who think this is a fantasy or slam on the US, I went to see Three Kings with a friend who had been a US Army Sargent in Lebanon.

		<shortDescription>Operation desert storm becomes operation fast buck - but fun though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a vaguely unsettling offbeat action caper movie with a war setting - a bit like "Raiders of the Lost Ark" meets "Catch-22" with a few ideas borrowed from "Saving Private Ryan" and "The Thin Red Line." It's not a work of genius but there are some neat explosions and interesting camerawork and a fresh approach to a well-tried plot line. It passed the watch test (you correspondent did not look at his watch throughout the film) but was diminished by an over-cute ending. Its political stance on the Gulf War is suitably critical of US policy and cynical about media wars while at the same time portraying Hussein's Iraqi army as a bunch of murderous kleptomaniacs and therefore very much in line with US policy. The "heros" themselves start out with felonious intent also (stealing Saddam's Kuwaiti gold), but circumstances alter their mission.Why the film is called "Three Kings" when there are four protagonists is not clear. George Clooney as leader of the band sweeps along like a demented house surgeon (must be the ER training) even doing a bit of emergency surgery on the way. Mark Wahlberg might look like a small side of beef (and probably reached his peak playing Dirk the pornstar in "Boogie Nights") but he emotes appropriately. The part does call for him to suffer a lot. Ice Cube's approach to acting is pretty minimalist - he tends to stand and glower a lot- but he didn't have much of a part. I thought the best of the lot was Spike Jonz (director of "Being John Malkovich") as Conrad the southern farm boy who never got to high school. Given Jonz's own distinctly affluent background and education it was a genuine piece of actin'. There was also some real acting from Said Taghmaoni as the Iraqi officer who interrogates a captured Marky Mark.The media are sent up as well as the military and we get to see at the start just how much in bed with the military the media can get. It seems that world culture is emerging in matters such as whether Lexus actually makes a convertible, a conversation topic between the Iraqis and Americans at one stage. But the best indication of the global village is in the comic scene where Marky, thrust into a storeroom with dozens of captured Kuwait cell phones, finds one that works, and after a tussle with an obtuse emergency operator, calls his wife in Arizona, direct. Not something you were able to do in 'Nam.The external desert visuals are rendered in a peculiar palate almost devoid of contrast producing something akin to a comic book, or animation. One of the firefights is filmed in slow motion from all angles as if it were a videogame replay. We are also shown the inside of Marky's chest for a quick lesson on the effects of gunshot and emergency treatment thereof, and get to see what happens when a cow steps on a landmine. It's a young, cheeky and slightly experimental movie done within the confines of mainstream American cinema.</fullReview>

Going into the theater, without having read any reviews of this movie, I thought I was in store for a run of the mill action film, climaxing with the much ballyhooed "We Three Kings be stealing the gold" song.What I got was a pithy, moving movie on modern war and American hypocrisy. One of the best movies of 1999, Three Kings is essentially a journey of American soldiers who begin the movie viewing war as comic opportunity to strike it rich, but by the end know the realizations of a war.Three Kings does for the Gulf War what Platoon did for the Vietnam war. Except everyone going into Platoon knew the horrors of Vietnam. Three Kings completely turns the war, and allows the view with at least some distance away from American propaganda.</fullReview>

He adapted the screenplay very well from an original screenplay written by John Ridley, who adapted his novel "Stray Dogs" for Oliver Stone's "U-Turn".Kings manages to have an equal amount of action, drama, and comedy and features an excellent, moving, and very satisfying ending.This film really showed me to never judge a film from it's advertising and to give all movies an equal shot.All in all a great drama and satisfying feel good war film.

For them to choose these role, I expected an excellent performance out of each actor. In "Three Kings" it seemed that Clooney's ego got the best of him and pertruded on the screen. Wahlberg and Ice Cube just didn't act to their ability. The plot was enjoyable, however, it was executed poorly by the three actors. A few things to point about this film that I did find worthwhile were the unity between the three soldiers, which I found to be heart-warming especially while they are fighting a war, and the fact that there was more than one plot that seemed to be going on at one time. "Three Kings" is a the type of film that could have worked if there was better action sequences and more humor added.</fullReview>

I remember praying for the soldiers, gulf war trading cards at the grocery store checkouts and most of all, bombs on the news, but it never really reached me. Being eight I cared more about my matchbox cars and Seseme Street. I experienced the Gulf War through school and my own curiosity in the years after. The Gulf War was a unique war, and it was perfect for the screen, and Three Kings captures it perfectly. I wasn't expecting such a funny, exciting and affecting movie. I actually made a mistake going to it. I was in the mood for an excapist action flick. Boy did I make a mistake! A good one mind you, I got something much better. David O. Russel's film is everything a good film should be, funny, exciting, unpredictable, affecting, and memorable. Even though I know it won't be, Three Kings should at least be nominated for Best Picture.

With his outrageous variety of film stocks and techniques russell gets (usual suspects) cinematographer tom sigel to invent a new look of violence, one that overwhelming conveys the real horrors of real war and the intensity of emotion. mark wahlberg amply reassures that his boogie nites performance was no fluke, in a role which takes him to the extremes of nearly every human emotion. the metaphysics of the heist caper plot sometimes feel too pat amongst the sensorial and emotional panorama russell creates but they are the only aspect which reminds you you're watching a movie and not experiencing first hand the scariest adventure ever brought to you courtesy of uncle sam. again, an absolute 10.</fullReview>

Of course, it is common when POW gets a torture, somehow the torturer and the torturee understood what a war can bring such unhappiness, and that made me wet my eyes. But I must say that this movie contains so much humor. It made me a laughter by showing me so much unpredictable scenes.The movie makes us to think that we are family after all. Whether you are Iran or American, we know and worry about what's going in neighbors countries.Please Watch this movie!!Review by Kevin: Not having seen a good war/soldier movie for some time, this movie really hit the spot for me. The leading cast of George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, and Ice Cube is impressive. The cinematography is effective and well suited to the story. That the audience can sympathize with the lead characters is no surprise. What is surprising is that some of the Iraqi characters are also fairly well developed. After watching this movie, I feel very fortunate to be living in peace and prosperity in the United States</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three Kings, a movie i went into the theatre expecting to see another battle movie about a war. SUrprisingly I was very impressed. As the movie portrays a recent war in the middle east, the three kings clooney, Ice cube, and mark walburg go through trials of judgement of morals. This movie has a unique plot where the people of a smaller country view of a superpower army of the U.S. As for the cinematography, I thought that it was very unique. The shooting scenes were biologically educating, I thought that the bullet entering the body scene was very interesting. But all in all I thought that the movie was a great movie with a theme with morals. This movie is not worth missing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This socially conscience satire of the Gulf War works in many ways similar to Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. Many of you may not see these film parallels but let me assure you they are present. As in FMJ, the film can be divided into two halves.The first half; a comedic venture through life in the time of a war no one was sure they should be fighting. And the second half; a gripping drama that spares little detail on the horrors of this terribly underrated war. Easily not quite as graphic as Saving Private Ryan, but the mood of the war was very clearly stated. A vast barren backdrop, and innovative camera work make this film a modern classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three Kings was a very good "worth going to see" movie. The makers were very responsible to illustrate the reality of human beings losing loved ones without being hyped up, and one sided on the war game of propaganda. Very refreshing to view this attitude-which is what was attempted to be taught to us in school or college. Anytime any film attempts to teach us about the feelings of war participation is an automatic reward or award for the writer and producer. The cinematography was excellent. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three Kings is a rather deceptive movie. My first impression was that this was an action/comedy movie about three soldiers who were attempting to steal Saddam Hussein's gold cache from the Gulf War. What it turns out to be is a powerful movie on morals and beliefs. The story begins at the end of the Gulf War. The US army is engaged in peace keeping duties while a peace treaty is in place. During this time, a couple of the American soldiers (Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube) come across a map that may point to where Saddam Hussein has been hiding the gold that he took from the Iraqis. George Clooney's character (special forces soldier - Archie Gates) bursts in on Wahlberg and Ice Cube while they are looking over the map and assumes control of the situation. What results is these three soldiers, along with a rather dimwitted fourth member, set out to find one of the bunkers where the gold is held to steal for themselves.The movie starts off with the impression that these soldiers are slightly incompetent. They bumble around the desert not really knowing if they're supposed to shoot people or not and in the end they shoot first then ask questions. The interesting thing about this movie is that the moral aspect of it literally sneaks up on you. The story starts off with quite a bit of humor but as the main characters pursue their treasure, the situation begins to change slowly. They, along with the audience, begin to see the atrocities that are taking place and somewhere along the way they take a slight detour in their plans. By the end of the movie you're no longer laughing but pulling for the freeing of the Iraqi refugees.Once again, Mark Wahlberg is proving to critics that he is a legitimate actor. I found his performance very good as was George Clooney's. Ice Cube also gave a fine performance but his character was not as central as Clooney's or Wahlberg's but it was nonetheless good. But of all the performances there was one actor that I thought stole scenes. The character that Cliff Curtis portrayed (Amir Abdullah - the restaurant owner who losses his wife) was very well played. I was captivated by his performance every time he was on screen and he probably delivers some of the most powerful lines of the movie. Some of the other peripheral characters were also well played and they bring out the personal conflicts they must endure in some short but very pointed dialogue.There are quite a few pro USA lines in the movie but not all of them were meant to be serious. In fact some of them were slightly "tough-in-cheek". The director paints a powerful picture of the hypocrisy that exists in war time as people become confused as to what the purpose of war is. Morals and beliefs become confused but by the end of the movie the main characters seem to discover what their purpose is in this very complicated situation.The cinematography is also very effective. Quite a large part of the movie is shot in very bright light and quite often you see halos around the characters that enhance the effect of the intense heat of the desert. There are some logic "bumps" in the story that make you wonder as some situations you knew was just not possible but these "bumps" were few and far between.Overall, this is an excellent movie with a powerful message. As to what that message is...I'll leave that for you to figure out. Each person is going to walk away from this movie with a different interpretation but you will get something out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the year's best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Three Kings' is one of the best films of the year. It is entertaining, fresh, original, has great photography, great direction and great performances. The film is set back in 1991 when the Gulf War ended. Four guys set out to reclaim relics that Sadam Hussein has stolen from Kuwait. The talented cast includes George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube and Spike Jonze. The speed bump I run into is that, while all the actors are good, they were hired because they are who they are. For instance, Ice Cube was? well, Ice Cube. In the various movies he has starred in, he can not seem to shake his urban `thuggish' quality. In every movie he has been in, he is, what I like to call, ABG (Angry Black Guy). George Clooney does his usual acting schtick, but he's improving more and more. He started to blossom in last year's `Out of Sight,' and he's even more commanding here. I forgive him for `Batman &amp; Robin.' Interestingly enough, his character here is quite similar to his in 1997's `The Peacemaker.' Hmm. Mark Wahlberg, so effective with a difficult role in `Boogie Nights,' shines as well. Of course, to bring in the ladies, he must have the obligatory shirtless scene that shows how much he worked out in the gym. (I'll admit that if I had half the six-pack he had, I'd show up to work shirtless everyday.) Well, anyway, this film was very ambitious for independent director David O. Russell. His last film, `Flirting With Disaster,' is one of the funniest films of the decade. Reportedly, he spent 18 months researching the Gulf War for this project. It was a very ambitious step and, apparently, Warner Brothers had mutual feelings. The screenplay by Russell was very well written? I guess. I was never fully educated on the Gulf War or the events that have proceeded it. Oh well. Nonetheless, `Three Kings' is a very well-made film. It is energetic, the performances are sparkling, the cinematography was wonderful and the pacing was consistent. Strangely, it's one of the best war films I have ever seen and one of the best of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Surprise! 9 out of 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing `Three Kings' last night, my wife and I came home to check the newspaper ads. It must have been a different movie that was billed as a comedy. No. Just another case of bait-and-switch. On reflection, though, that pre-viewing misdirection probably made the whole experience more intense. Because we were so unprepared for what we saw, it shocked us even more.The movie is not a comedy (although there is some humor in it). It is not about the Gulf War (any more than `The Good, The Bad and The Ugly' is about the Civil War). It is just one of the best movies I have ever seen. The fact that the story in `Three Kings' did not really happen does not make it any less true. The movie showed what happens when people who are from different cultures who have weapons and the belief that they have something akin to 007's `license to kill' meet on the frontier.Yes, the movie had a point of view: America went to war over oil, not to save Kuwaitis from Iraqui domination or the Iraqui in the street from Saddam Hussein. Unlike the politicians who send them to war, ordinary Americans would give up untold millions in gold to save people they had met just a few hours before. You can't really understand the sadistic torturer until you walk a mile in his shoes. Are those things THE TRUTH? Maybe; maybe not.People make movies to sell tickets and to convince people that the author's version of the truth is THE TRUTH. Few things have the power to do that as well as good movies. Costa-Gavras' `Z' and `Missing' come to mind. But you don't have to buy Russell's version of `the truth' to want to see `Three Kings' more than once. Watch it once just for Nora Dunn. Her constant swearing like a drunken sailor to prove how tough she is is worth the price of admission. Watch it again for George Clooney. He is the natural heir to Sean Connery. Mark Wahlberg shows with every gesture how easy it is to focus when it hits the fan (although I have to say that it bothered me near the end of the movie when he kept standing up, in spite of the fact that he had a bullet wound in his side). But most of all, take your R-rated children to it so that they can see how un-pretty, un-funny and gut-wrenching war can be, even when it's just happening to actors up on a screen. What `Three Kings' captured best was how quickly that gung-ho attitude of those who have not faced live fire changes to real fear when the guy on the other side has a gun too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film appeared as a dark satire on the lines of the movies from Coen brothers. By dark satire I mean humor at gruesome deaths and violence. While this might be so with many other movies, this movie is different in its pace and originality in presenting this stuff. But at the same time I should rush to add that there is more in the movie.The movie has a political undertone. It depicts the trivialization of the lives of the Iraqis. Its ironical that it happens in the movie in the backdrop of American solidiers trying to steal the property from Kuwait while Iraqis kill their fellow country men encourated by the Americans to revolt against Saddam. Yet the movie shows the concern of these American soldiers for the helpless Iraqis by helping them cross the border into Iran in the end. I felt that the movie was trying to balance the points of view of both the parties.All the time the movie moves on with a lot of energy and humor, positive one sometimes like the one where there are lots of American cars in the bunker and Clooney tries to get them to transport the Iraqis to the border or how the Republican Guards are scared off by the fake Saddam entourage or the way the document detailing the locations of treasure was found and retrieved.Visually the movie is very good. The camera work is quite off-beat.In all I would rate this movie 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Too few Hollywood films give the audience credit for having the patience, intelligence, or whatever it is they think we are lacking, to create films which demand second viewings. Three Kings demands not just a second viewing, but many more. There is so much here that needs to be absorbed and thought about that one viewing will only scratch the surface.Like all of David O. Russel's films, Three Kings provides humor that is wickedly funny, until you pause for a second and realize how horrible what your laughing at is. The ambivalence runs deep. There are few "good" guys in this film, and the film often implicates the (American, at least) audience. How innocent are we? This film suggests we are naive, but not innocent when it comes to the way the U.S. interacts with the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The War Movie for the 90's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In order that a war film become classic, it must carefully blend grandiose action with a haunting message. Good war films don't glorify war, but rather find the lesson that still needs to be taught. All Quiet on the Western Front (1931) showed us that even the Germans are human. The Best Years of Our Lives (1946) showed us the tragic side of coming home from battle. Patton (1970) showed us that even our greatest heroes weren't perfect. And Platoon (1986) finally showed us that war kills innocence. Three Kings is the first major Hollywood film to deal with the Gulf War. For those of us old enough to remember (and at the time of this writing, that would be most of us) this was the War that CNN won. Over a three day period, just long enough for the average viewer to stay tuned, we witnessed (or at least we thought we witnessed) American righteousness at its best. Three Kings tells a different story.At the start of the film the war is officially over and a cease fire has been called. Mark Wahlberg plays Troy Barlow, an army captain whose team is sorting through a group of prisoners. His men find a map that could lead to some Kuwait treasure stolen by Sadaam Hussein. George Clooney is a member of the Special Services, charged with escorting news reporter Adriana Cruz (played nicely by Nora Dunn) around. When he gets wind of the map he dumps her and takes Barlow and his men on a search for the treasure. The film wastes no time getting to the point. When the film opens, we see soldiers who are confused and disappointed. They came looking for action but before they even hit the desert, the 'fun' was over. They take their frustration out on the prisoners that they must process, terrified Iraqis who they call 'camel-jockeys' and 'sand niggers'. Suddenly we aren't so sure who the bad guys are. As the film goes on, Clooney and Wahlberg, accompanied by Ice Cube, playing Chief Elgin, and Spike Jonze, playing Conrad Vig, encounter a group of Iraqian rebels. Of course these rebels are not of the CNN variety. They are simple people, the Shi'a Iraqis, men, women and children, who opposed Sadaam Hussein with the hope that the glorious USA would help them. Now that the war is over, they have become victims. Three Kings does not fall into the trap of being cliche. Unlike Saving Private Ryan, which simplified the morals and went right for the sentiment, this film offers complex issues, and forces the characters (and the audience, for that matter) to realize that things aren't so black and white. Wahlberg is tortured by an Iraqi soldier. The scene is chilling because this character is introduced in the classic American stereotype, cold and bloodthirsty, but we soon learn that he has good reason for hating the American soldier who he holds captive. The film is darkly funny, filled with ironic messages. Nora Dunn's reporter may cry at the sight of dying pelicans affected by the burning oil fields, but she's also bored with it. Spike Jonze's character could easily have been the Oklahoma bomber. A gun-happy dolt, he's desperate for some action, but even his blind eye can't protect him from what he sees. Soon, that which was the 'bad guy' becomes his savior. Whoever came up with the marketing campaign for this movie should be exiled to the Iraqi desert. All summer long I saw trailers for this film, wincing at what I thought would be the 'feel-good' action flick of the fall season. If it weren't for the mass critical acclaim that this film received later, I would never have gone to see it. Three Kings is a slick film, but more than that, it also makes a powerful statement. Where another recently released flick, American Beauty, ripped at the heart of American values, Three Kings launches a scud missile. This film is preachy, but I don't mind that, because it valiantly dares to say what some of us may not want to hear!</fullReview>

Ice Cube further convinces us he's not "just" a hip-hop star. Spike Jonze does a great turn as a hick reservist who never seems to quite know what's what . . . but we do, because due to the quirky camera techniques, we are never mere spectators, but participants in all the action. This probably won't get the Best Movie Oscar due to its cutting edge quality, but the Academy really should seriously consider electing Russell Best Director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert!!!! Oh this is a good one, just got home from seeing it. Terrific stuff; MTV style editing, a gut shot 'from the inside', fine Clooney/Wahlberg/Ice Cube performances--plus a shot of Moses taking the refugees to the 'promised land'(or Iran, whatever).I admired the Shia rebels plight being shown on screen for a change, and its true-besides Big Oil, what DID we fight in the Sands for again? As the film shows, it was unfinished business, and a damned shame-Bush told Iraq to revolt, parts did just that and we let'em twist in the sand and die. Had the chance to yank Saddam outta his bunker, beret and all-and we did not. This helps portray the consequences.Some parts-the guts shot, for example, the exploding cow-really weren't necessary, but over all it was done well, without Too much gratuitous violence;a unique filmaking vision and look here.So-Gazzo2's rating?***1/2 outta ****; go see it! You will be entertained, slightly sickened and moved all in one movie. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie of the year, so far.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This would be the funniest war drama I have seen since the TV series Mash. One of the first movies to deal with the events of the Gulf War. It twists history by creating a story about four army officers who decide to find gold that Sadam Hussein had stolen from the Kuwaitis. The movie becomes humanitarian story when the four soldiers realize that Sadam is trying to slaughter the people in the town they are stealing the gold from. A excellent mix of humor and drama throughout the movie. David O'Russell's clever story telling and wonderful use of cinematography could make this movie be nominated for best picture. It's the best movie of the year so far in my books. The scene where a bullet goes through Troy then comes right back out is an instant classic. The beginning of the movie has documentary look to it, "Are we shooting people?" Troy. The must see movie of the year. 10/10 The best movie of the year, so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, but not "GREAT"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I had gone into this film only having seen the lame TV ads without the critical hype, I probably would have been stunned by how good it is. But after reading all the Oscar talk, I was mildly disappointed. This is a great film, but in no way a classic. (Which is really the case with most Oscar winners, so I shouldn't be surprised.) This is a funny, sad, shocking, and important movie. It has a message that needs to be told. But it could have been told better. It was slightly clumsy and very heavy handed.Bottom line...Three Kings has a lot in common with MASH, and it will most likely become the definitive Gulf War movie just like MASH is the definitive Korean War movie. But just because it shares the same rank as MASH doesn't mean it's as good as MASH.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`The Price Of Honor' Three Kings: rated R, 1 hour and 50 minutes Three Kings is an excellent, uniquely modern, stylish war movie. Though it starts off slowly, it picks up and clearly makes its point. What makes it stand out is its ability to entertain the viewer as an upbeat film rather than being utterly depressing akin to the average war movie is. That's not to say that Three Kings doesn't have its moments of shocking realism. In some ways it truly was touching. Its moral outcome was quite moving. Comical lines scattered throughout the movie, along with trendy actors who display a natural talent for contemporary filmmaking keep the movie in its place. In the end, Three Kings is exceptionally satisfying. Four young military officers set off on their own personal expedition at the conclusion of the Gulf War to retrieve a bundle of stolen riches. The plan appears to be straightforward and feasible, until the men put it into action. Things then seem to become increasingly complicated. The four run into a slew of obstacles that threaten to hinder their goals. Major Archie Gates, played by George Clooney, decrees the ultimate ambition for a human being to be necessity. Later, he admits that necessity often changes its form. The operation begins as a greedy mission to acquire individual wealth, but metamorphoses into a test of valor and heroism. The men are challenged by their integrity. They must inevitably contend with what is the right thing to do. The quest develops into one of virtue and greater reward than the success of a single man, it instills the power to make a difference. Sacrifices are made and lives are lost, but righteousness prevails. That is the main message of the movie. Humans have the capacity to do good as well as evil. George Clooney is suitable in the role as the leader of the group and the initiator of the mission. Spike Jonze is pleasant as the ignorant, unschooled member of the team. Ice Cube is all around excellent, exhibiting a strong sense of maturity in acting that was indefinite prior to this movie. Somewhat surprisingly, the finest actor of all in this film was former singer, Mark Wahlberg. Troy Barlow (Mark's character) was a compassionate and highly admirable character. He learns from his experiences. Not only does Barlow grow as a person, but also Wahlberg grows as an actor. It was the scenes focusing on Barlow that were most poignant. On the whole, the acting in the movie was very respectable, as was the movie. Three Kings delivers by nearly every means possible. Smart, funny, moving, and captivating, it thoroughly fulfills its audience's expectations.Three Kings, directed by David O. Russell, also starring Said Taghmaoui, is generously awarded an A-.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"There's nothing so kingly as kindness, and nothing so noble as truth."--Alice Cary.Three Kings, in my opinion, succeeds immensely. Though no Saving Private Ryan, it portrays the nastiness of the Gulf War in a way you never saw on CNN. Loyalties (and lack thereof) and personal motivations are examined in plenty of instances of man's inhumanity to man. There is no flag-waving sentimentality and no sappy idealism. David Russell confronts the fact that there is no such thing as 'a good war.'The movie also throws a lifeline to the much-maligned, so-called Generation X. In an environment of no clear guidance, these GenX characters make surprising moral choices. Gates, Elgin and Barlow are indeed three kings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David O. Russell is clearly one of the most original and creative directors around. He's taken the War Movie far off its well-trodden path and moved it in a new direction. This movie is about war, greed, morality, culture, politics, friendship, and last but not least, humor.Brilliantly written, with Russell's usual ear for dour yet hilariously witty dialogue, the movie is also beautifully shot, crackingly edited, and tolerably acted by its trio of leads.Make no mistake-- this is a Hollywood movie. The Good Guys are Good Guys, and things work out in the end far better than they ever would in real life.But the path there is what is unconventional, and it keeps us glued to our seat, eyes peeled, ears wide open, waiting to see what new shiny frightening things Russell will storm our minds and senses with.If all Hollywood movies were like this, life would be bliss and there would be never a dull moment at the cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film that isn't afraid to take risks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's comforting to see that some filmmakers are still taking chances these days. A week after seeing American Beauty I have been very pleasantly surprised again. 3 kings is a movie that isn't afraid to experiment and take chances and this pays off. There are times when the experimentation backfires but the pros definitely outnumber the cons in this wonderfully bizzare film.The opening scene is both incredibly funny and dramatic. it quickly turns to horror as war so often does and eventually ends in bloodshed. The film really conveys the insanity of war, especially the Gulf war. It shows the confusion and cynicism of the soldiers and civilians on both sides.It is also the first film in a long time not to completely stereotype people of the middle east. After insulting trash like the Siege and others it is a relief to see a film that doesn't resort to jingoism to cover for a lack of imagination. It seems that U.S. films need a stereotypical badguy for every generation. It must have been a serious blow to morons in the film industry when the Soviet bloc collapsed. Never mind, I've become distracted. The film uses captivating cinematography to accurately show the desolation of the desert. Unlike some films that use strange cinematography to cover for shaky characters and stories, 3 kings uses cinematography to it's utmost advantage.3 Kings is inventive and original, except for an ending that feels somewhat like a copout but it's not too bad. The film tries new things and gives an interesting view of the Gulf War. I recommend this film to anyone who likes to see something different in films and anyone who loves a good satire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>*** (Out of four)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wish I could recommend "Three Kings" more highly than I finally am, for that three-star rating does not give the film enough justice in recommending its propulsive drive and unique visual scheme. However, it seemed to me that director David O. Russell, who has previously directed a movie on incestuous relationships ("Spanking the Monkey") and a wild romp about a New York Jew romping across the country with his incompetently sultry psychologist, his nursing wife and a couple of gay police officers in the search for his parents ("Flirting with Disaster") would at least be able to milk the standard war-movie dry of all cliches with this incantation. And while a lot of it exudes the mind-blowing cinematic fascination which any movie-lover is sure to appreciate, it has some trouble reconciling the more serious elements of its plot with its own fast-paced recklessness.George Clooney (a man who I always thought had movie-star potential, regardless of what the critics say) stars here as Archie Gates, the macho group leader of a 1991 Desert Storm platoon with multitudes of testosterone and few Iraqis to use it on. Utilizing the old saying "Necessity is the mother of invention" to the point of action, Gates takes three of his troops (Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, Spike Jonze) to a destination where stolen Kuwaiti bullion awaits them. The Clooney character claims that a handful of such riches would be able to buy them happiness, and the story cuts to Wahlberg's wife and child back home and Cube's airport luggage job as a clue to how desperate these characters are. Of course as many other war movies have told us before (albeit not in nearly as interesting a style as "Three Kings"), such a venture will prove disastrous to our protagonists. Already subjected to pulling a map out of a prisoner's posterior, the soldiers encounter a group of Iraqis whose culture proves not as barbarian as the many CNN reports inclined one to believe, as these people seem to be in the midst of a vast Western influence with boxes of stolen cellular phones and stereo systems blaring out mindless Eddie Murphy tunes of yesteryear (at one point Wahlberg's character proclaims this as "bad music" and indeed I was expecting his very own "Good Vibration" to be played for an additional ironic effect).Inevitably the film leads to Clooney leading a group of Iraqi refugees through the desert in the Iranian borde; these scenes seem like a jarring shift of tone from the anarchic style of the film's first hour, as Clooney and the main Iraqi engage in pseudo-philosophical conversations while the rest of the cast statically stands around in circles feigning interest at the faux-wisdom of the main character's words.And yet Russell's caustic wit comes rushing back for an utterly enjoyable, if predictable, finale which culminates in the use of a long gone Peter Cetera ballad for one of the finer uses of irony exhibited this year on celluloid. (The movie revels in portraying the distinction of the more urbane early-90s mood with its schmaltzier-in-comparison 80s counterpart.) While the film's final five minutes exhibit a "seen-that-before" kind of nobility which nary a war film has failed to employ, one can find a plethora of things to appreciate in "Three Kings".Although David O. Russell's script finally succumbs to the very pretensions its own theme is trying to send up, at its best it is an acidic piece of writing. It is backed up by Newton Thomas Sigel's innovative cinematography, which features glorious strips of celluloid illustrating the glamorous cinematic dessert deserts have always provided, from the super-wide lensing of "Lawrence of Arabia" to the creamy mounds of sand in "The English Patient". Add a career-best performance by Wahlberg, surprisingly effective as the character with the most heart, and one could proclaim "Three Kings" as a highly effective movie.Yet its very intentions of eliciting emotion from its audience cannot succeed with the style the film is presented in. Indeed the two halves of the film do not mesh well, and perhaps that is why so many people are labeling this movie as "weird". Many critics are comparing this film to Coppola's "Apocalypse Now": of course these claims are unfounded. "Apocalypse" operated as an entirely cerebral movie apart from the conventions of any particular genre; at times "Three Kings" shows the strain of its action-movie roots. Indeed I wish that the movie would have had the ambition of its journalist character (Nora Dunn). She shows integrity and gumption even at the most inopportune of times. One could only realize what a pioneering work "Three Kings" could have been if it would have stuck to this mentality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best action movie since "Face/Off," and one of the year's best period</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Three Kings" is a film whose wit, ingenuity, and hyperactive momentum catch you of guard. This is a movie that, like so many great movies, flippantly refuses to conform to the rules we feel exist for particular genres, and that's a great deal of what makes watching it such a thrilling experience. It's hard enough to just make a great action movie when Hollywood views a good screenplay as subordinate to computer graphics and explosions, but "Three Kings" extends its ambitions beyond the simple label of "action movie." With an off-beat irreverence and surprisingly thoughtful and cynical political undercurrent, writer/director David O. Russell immediately grabs your attention and never lets go, but it's the level of humansim that elevates this wholly original and uniformly thrilling film to greatness.The Persian Gulf War has just come to an end, but four soldiers think they've found a way to benefit from the U.S.-Iraqi peace treaty. While rounding up Iraqi prisoners, Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg) and his best friend Conrad Vig (Spike Jonze) find a map hidden that is, shall we say, well hidden on one of the men they are searching. They bring it to Chief Elgin (Ice Cube), who determines that they've found a map pinpointing bunkers filled with loot Saddam stole from the Kuwaites. When story-hungry reporter Adriana Cruz (Nora Dunn) hears rumors that the bunkers on the map are storehouses for gold bullion, she imparts the information to her military escort, Archie Gates (George Clooney). Gates, disgruntled with his assignment and distraught over the pointlessness he sees in the army's involvement in the Persian Gulf, immediately ditches the reporter, finds the map and the soldiers holding it, steals a Humvee, and sets off into the desert with his new comrades.Gates thinks the gold should be theirs for the taking - the Iraqi soldiers are currently preoccupied with restoring order among rebellious citizens. But once the soldiers locate a hidden bunker, they're pulled into the political situation that is tearing apart life for the locals. "Bush told the people to rise up against Saddam," notes Gates, but now that the U.S. has protected its own interests the rebels are left with nothing to protect them from Saddam's retribution. Gates' troop watches Iraqi soldiers hit a milk truck with a rocket launcher, and moved by the starving people scooping milk out of puddles in the sand, they pass out their rations and water bottles. After witnessing a graphic execution, Gates intervenes to save a prisoner, and the shootout that accidently ensues (a brilliant scene that somehow manages to use slow-motion in a way that didn't make me think of John Woo) ties the fate of the soliders to the Iraqis. Troy is taken hostage, but resistance movement will help the Americans with the gold and in locating Troy if the soldiers will, in turn, escort the refugees to a camp just inside the Iranian border.Like many great movies, "Three Kings" finds a fundamental strength in the quality of its characters. There isn't a bad performance in the bunch, but George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg are the clear standouts. Finally we find Clooney with a character that fits well with his acting sensibilties; in Gates he finds a man who, much like the "ER" role that brought him stardom, has a considerable undercurrent of compassion and sensitivity coursing beneath his initially commanding, cynical surface. And Wahlberg only continues to show a deeper and deeper screen presence with each movie. Like Clooney, he's naturally commanding during action sequences, but we also see a lot of the touching naivity and boyishness that made him so effective in "Boogie Nights" as well. What Russell's screenplay does very effectively then is take its sharply defined characters and give them, and us, a bit of a culture shock - the shock being that Desert Storm might have made very little difference to some of the very people the U.S. claimed to be helping. In its own, more offhand way, "Three Kings" is just as insightful and articulate about the grey areas in American military action as "Saving Private Ryan" is. Where "Ryan" argued that war could be a necessary, but lamentable atrocity, "Three Kings" sees atrocity in the way that what America viewed as a necessity lead to a greater slaughter that America then did nothing to stop. There's a darkly funny scene late in the movie in which Clooney tries to con an enterprising Iraqi into giving him a fleet of new cars with the promise that the soldiers and the Iraqi rebels will unite and expel Saddam together. "George Bush wants you!" yells Clooney, and as he rallies the rebels into an uproar Russell is showing us the kind of unfulfilled promises the U.S. made in the name of protecting some oil interests.The compassion and understanding that Russell's screenplay holds for the Arab situation does not produce any kind of melodrama or simplistic portrayals of the Iraqis on either side of the conflict however. There's a scene in the middle of the film, in which Wahlberg's character talks to his Iraqi captor about his daughter and American reasons for being in the Persian Gulf that ranks among the great movie moments of the '90s. The Iraqi has lost both his wife and young son due to American bombing, and Wahlberg starts talking about his little girl back home "because we're both fathers." Both men also joined the army for no other reason than to make a little extra money by helping out their country. Each man understands the other's reasons for being in the situation they are both in. Each man recognizes similarities with the other, and that's part of what makes Russell's approach so thought-provoking. "Three Kings" isn't pro-American, and it isn't really pro-Iraqi either. Instead, the film equates the problems soldiers on both sides of the war are dealing with in terms of importance. Afterall, it wasn't Wahlberg's decision to bomb that man's home - everyone is at the whim of higher powers who are acting with questionable rational.Nothing I've written so far, however, properly conveys just what a viscerally exciting film "Three Kings" is; this movie has a rambunctious comedic spirit and a visual ingenuity all its own. But when all the bullets have been fired and when all the C-4-laced Nerf footballs have been blown up, it's the film's thoughtfulness on such a complex issue that gives "Three Kings" real staying power. It's the best action movie this country has produced since "Face/Off," and one of the year's best films period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Highly original directing, awesome camera-work and use of tricks of the trade, and high-octane acting from all involved combine to form this modern-day masterpiece. Three Kings follows the quest of four American soldiers during the days following 1991's Gulf War. Sergeant Major Archie Gates [George Clooney], who's about to retire, and Chief Elgin [Ice Cube], a devout Catholic. Then there's Sergeant Troy Barlow [Mark Whalberg], your average All-American, and Private Conrad Vig [Spike Jonze], Barlow's admiring pal. The four, after "unearthing" a map pointing out the way to bunkers where Saddam Hussien is storing gold bullion stolen from Kuwait, set off to make themselves a lifetime fortune, with the Beach Boys blasting on the radio. But they get more then they bargained for...excellent directing, dialouge, high-quality and solid acting. A modern-day masterpiece filled with blistering action and satire...a must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A beautifully structured film of enormous confidence, as assured in tragedy as in comedy, that rigorously pursues the apparent inanity of US policy - fighting under a banner of liberating Kuwait, yet unwilling to support the less economically loaded cause of the Iraqi rebels against Saddam: in the best irreverent MASH-like style, the film's citations of George Bush generally seem barely straight-faced. To further skewer the geopolitical confusion, the film is festooned with evocations of consumerism, media and popular culture - underlining the increasingly amorphous nature of global affairs (a theme summed up in the exchange between Wahlberg and his torturer - where it's always so clear how easily the roles of captor and prisoner could have been reversed). With the generally well-judged deadpan performances, the audacious mix of styles and moods and the superb physical handling, and the strange desaturated look which makes the movie (aptly) seem like strange science-fiction at times, it's a great achievement - a mainstream movie (the ultimate theme of moral awareness is not of course that uncommon) with a fresh, bull-headed sensibility. Minor reservations: the film seems a bit overlong, and some of the pop culture oriented dialogue (like the talk about Michael Jackson at the start of Wahlberg's interrogation) is getting stale now.</fullReview>

Thankfully the films morals aren't shoved down the viewers throat. The moments of levity left me speechless, then just as quickly I'm laughing at a scene of political satire. I was amazed that a mainstream film like Three Kings has the guts not to offer a clear villain. Just as in real life each side has its own motives for fighting things are a lot more complicated than they seem. This movie is in the vein of Natural Borne Killers and Pulp Fiction as a risqué masterpiece. One of the best of the 90's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>People are people ( exposing the truth about policy and politics )</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when the Gulf War broke out. I remember being naive back then about war and politics. This was before the movie JFK came out and before one of my best friends at the time told me to wake up and open my eyes. It was then that I started to investigate official versions of wars and political fiascos. And it was then that I realized that there are always three sides to everything; the winners, the losers and then the truth. The truth is hardly ever revealed and it is left up to us to fill in the pieces and develop our own theories. We'll probably never really know what happened to JFK. It's probably somewhere in between the Warren report and what Jim Garrison believes. World War II? There are so many stories out there about official this and official that that no one really knows where to look anymore. Take any conflict from Tianemen Square to Watergate or in my country things like the Meech Lake Accord to the fishing dispute that we'll always have with the U.S. There will always be a shroud of mystery to any conflict. Because we aren't supposed to know. But why? That is a question that I don't have an answer to. All I know is that the government thinks that it's better if the public is given limited information on everything so that we stay safe, comfortable and free. But what does all that mean? Because if the truth is out there, I'd like to know it, just like I'm sure the rest of you would too. Three Kings feels the same way and tries earnestly to shed some light on a few issues that certain people think that we would be better off not knowing about. This is one of the best movies of the year and it should be remembered at Oscar time. More on that in a minute.Three Kings is the story of four soldiers that discover there is gold to be hijacked from Saddam who hijacked it from the Kuwaiti's. In the group are four very different personalities. George Clooney is the take charge guy that takes no crap from anyone. Ice Cube is a devout religious guy but he too is determined to live by his own rules. Spike Jones plays a guy that is somewhat of a redneck. He doesn't really understand what his role in the war is. He really thinks that it is cool to kill with extreme prejudice. He doesn't know that his job is liberation, he thinks that they are there to kill every Arab that they can, not even taking into consideration that they are being helped by many Arabs. Mark Wahlberg plays a family man that tries not to have a conscience about what he is doing but he can't help it. When they embark on their journey they are met with ample resistance from not only the Iraqi army but from their own military that doesn't want to stop them from getting the gold ( they have no idea that they are going for the gold ) but they want to prevent them from disobeying conduct that could jeopardize their reputation back home with the American people. Everything is kept hush hush and the media is only allowed to report what they are told they can report. They can't tell the public about the real dangers or what is really happening, if they did, then Bush may look bad in front of his own people, so they are given fallacies and fairy tales to report. That is one of the interesting sub plots to the film.What really stands out is the theme of unity. Is an American life worth more than an Iraqi, Kuwaiti or Iranian life? Are we really that sad of a people that we put our material needs above the welfare of a human being? And as easy as those questions may seem to answer, they really aren't. Not to the person that is honest with themself. If you could get away with about 50 million in gold but knew that people were going to be slaughtered, would you stay and help them or would you go and live with your conscience? Really, what you do? Three Kings asks tough questions and doesn't always give the "right" answer. Three Kings is unflinching when it asks these questions and it doesn't duck anything. It comes right out and tells us that perhaps we are not as noble and benevolent as we think we are.Three Kings is one picture that deserves to receive a slew of Oscar nominations. I think that so far this is best picture material along with best director, supporting actor in Jones and especially in the cinematography department. The shady and hazy look to the film works to perfection as you sense the confusion and feel the ambiance and the heat around you. Having the camera look as though it has sand in the lense was a stroke of perfection. Filming this in perfect wide screen 35mm film would take away from what it wanted us to feel. After all, this isn't a feel good fantasy like Star Wars.Three Kings has so much to say and it is a film that should be seen by everyone. American Beauty is still the best film of the year, but this should be mentioned in the same sentence and it should be remembered in March.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surreal war story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an odd but interesting film. One moment we are being given intense drama; the next moment, we get comedy -- and strangely, it works. But it isn't a film for everyone since it is satiric, and lots of folks don't get or don't like satire. What is satirized? War, the media, politics, the military, human nature, and just about everything else that gets in the way.Working on the premise that the Gulf war was really a media event, the film shows us a media war. Along the way, we get a surreal conglomeration of some classic movie elements, including THE MAGNIFICENT 7, M.A.S.H., PLATOON, and TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE.Mark Wahlberg gets to play an interesting character with some depth, and he does an excellent job with it. The others in the cast give powerful performances also.I wouldn't recommend this one to everyone, but for people who like satire and irony, this is a great dose of both.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Already-A Great Film of the Gulf War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a classic. It is an almost perfect exercise in great moviemaking. It is a daring political comment that is incredibly entertaining. When the film isn't hilarious, it's shows a level of importance and focus that never lets up. From the concept and symbolic storyline comes action and comedy that are not directionless. The wild carefree air of the film comes from the Americans and it makes as a provokative contradiction to the graphic horror and serious nature of the Iraqi and Kwuati people who must fight with the reality the US ignores. This film is an Apocalypse Now for a new generation, yet with an optimism that shows hope instead of despair because a difference can still be made. It is yet another great American film that calls into question the ideals of the United States. This film basically shows how the political aspect of war in the twilight of the 20th century is greed, but compassion and the need to do good has not diminished. It's an excellent film that will emotionally and intellectually involve its audience. One must also not forget that it's also a hilarious movie that is incredibly artful and daring, not only in concept but in execution. Definitely one of the best films of the last year of the 20th century. Entertaining and involving, satirical and emotional, perfect cast, it hits every note perfectly while making up some of its own. See it, you won't be sorry.</fullReview>

Well first the Gold Bullions stolen from Kuwait, That was NOT true, it was in a safe under the ground. And then again...Sergeant Barlow, Marky Mark, Calling his wife from a makeshift prison from a "CELL" phone...I mean come on, what Kuwaiti Company was operating it at that time!?!?! Its a mixture movie which is GOOD and I liked it despite the fact that it contained wrong information (i.e Kuwait was Liberated in Feb 26th 1991) well at least I got the main point out: Kuwait got help because its an "Oil" rich country, a friend..hmmm maybe, and the good part is it didnt make the Arabs look like a bunch of crazy jabbering savages!!!! I liked that =) well overall that was Good, hmm Okay actually and I hope it showed more than a desert because there are more to it than that...Iraq looks better than that!

		<shortDescription>Politically Correct War Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not many films about the Persian Gulf War have come out. "Courage Under Fire" is the best one. "The Three Kings" is not worth your time. A politically correct film about Iraqis and the Persian Gulf War neatly bundled with enough exploding violence and sidetracked stories to make it seem interesting. "Three Kings" doesn't work as anything but a ?kindlier and gentler' war story. The film tries to present a moral tale about rag-tag men who can somehow, even in the face of war, change and be better. "The Three Godfathers" is a classic moral tale told in a much more direct and realistic way. "Three Kings" gives us superficial characters, stereotypic Arab behavior, and just enough overhanging guilt to paper over a contrived ending. Yes, the coalition forces won the Gulf War but betrayed the embattled rebels in their own futile war with Saddam. George Bush became an overnight savior but his name soon personified the fickle American Army whose presence was felt more in damage and destruction than in liberation. And so in "Three Kings", we have a reversal of form in which four men, whose initial goal is to steal back Kuwaiti gold for themselves, end up doing good instead. The film also highlights insipid soldiers, to the point of making us wonder if they are the only kind of foot soldiers we have. The character, Conrad Vig, is stupid, racist, loud-mouth, and out of control. Equally dumb are the chaperoned soldiers who take an arrogant and aggressive newswoman named Cruz, all over the desert. When the movie finally tries to make a statement about war, it does so badly. Take the interrogation between Troy Barlow and his Iraqi captor. In between electric shocks and physical torture (which don't seem to have any purpose), Barlow empathizes about how he would not want a foreign country to bomb his home and kill his children. "Three Kings" could have been a fair action picture if you take out any messages. Instead, by trying to portray sides equally, it badly diluted any messages at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three Kings is a very original movie that took me by surprise. It's a mix of action, comedy, and political satire, all behind the guise of a caper movie. The trailers for the movie highlight the action sequences (which are excellent), but the ideas behind the action are what makes it a great movie.It doesn't exploit the Arab people the way that most action movies do by making them the villains, rather it shows us that they are just people trying to live their lives like anyone else. And although the movie carries a moral message, it is never heavy-handed, but handled thoughtfully and intelligently.I find it real hard to call a movie that stars both Marky Mark and Ice Cube the best of the year, but this may end up being just that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say about a film that features a cow being blown to bits and played up as a joke? Nothing much positive, unfortunately. Barlow, Gates, Elgin and Vig are Gulf War soldiers who take advantage of the jubilation and confusion at the end of that conflict to steal gold bullion originally stolen by Saddam Hussein's men. The story includes thoughtful commentary on the politics of war (even criticizing the USA's involvement), racism and the human cost of conflict. It mixed satire, political drama, and action, but it felt as if the movie didn't know what it wanted to be. The camera never stops moving, and I found the constant zipping and zagging to be headache-inducing. Very little information is given about the character's backgrounds, other than Barlow (Mark Wahlberg), who's the only family man among the soldiers. He was the only character who changed the most at the end. Vig (Spike Jones), is a Southerner who's not much more than a stereotype. I could tell that George Clooney is constantly improving as an actor, proving he's not just another handsome face. Hopefully, this movie will also finally prove that Ice Cube is more than just a rapper. Even though I understand that a war movie would have bloodshed, much of it is senseless and it is non-stop. There are also incidents of torture, and several scenes have people being riddled with bullets. At one point, the audience is shown what really happens when a bullet enters the body. Fortunately, I have a strong stomach; others might find themselves looking for the exits. A female reporter (good job by Nora Dunn, formerly of tv's Saturday Night Live) is one of the best characters in the film. She's set up as an outsider looking in on the mayhem. She has several funny moments. Three Kings is definitely not for kids or teens (who may be drawn because of the presence of rapper Ice Cube).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kings Deserves to Be a Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three Kings is clearly one of the most original, fresh, and provocative films of this year. First, there was Rushmore, The Matrix, Southpark, The Sixth Sense, The Iron Giant, and now Three Kings. Although not nearly as great, Three Kings is thoroughly set in the vein of Great, absurdist warfare movies like M.A.S.H. and Apocalypse Now. Had I been someone who solely relied on movie trailers to encourage or discourage me from seeing a picture, I would have regrettably missed out on this exciting film. For me, George Clooney has yet to be a successful leading man at the box office, and Ice Cube . well, Ice Cube is Ice Cube. So, a movie having those two in it wouldn't exactly make me salivate at the chance to part with my time and money to go see it. In fact, before seeing Three Kings, I had more respect for the talents of Mark Wahlberg than either of those two. Nonetheless, my doubts about the film were for naught!Three Kings is so multi-faceted that it cannot be pigeonholed into a 60-second vision byte. Yes, there is action as the movie trailer overemphasizes, but if that is all you're interested in, then this film is not for you. The action in Kings is not for its own sake, but is merely another element in the story, just like dialogue and visuals. Too many times, persons who make movie trailers cater to the lowest common denominator - as though no one the audience has ever seen a truck blow up before. How misleading! Instead, Three Kings is hilarious; action-packed; thought-provoking; cynical; balletically violent; at times, beautifully sorrowful; bitingly sharp in its commentary on American consumerism and materialism, and mercilessly critical of the Bush administration's Gulf War policies. It's the best film I've seen since The Sixth Sense. Only, Three Kings is wholly more apt, and deservedly so, at becoming a classic.Rating: 7.5 to 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hello, everyone.Last night I saw Three Kings. I heard that it was going to be great somehow from a couple of friends who are studying film together. So, I decided to see it in terms of cheering up the director as well. And then, this is what happened to me.Oh, my God... It was amazingly well written and directed. Honestly, I don't know much about David O. Russell and did some research about his last two films before I saw Three Kings. Probably, I didn't expect as that much good as it was, so I enjoyed it as purely as it was supposed to be. Oh, man, it was good.The movie starts when the Gulf War ended, and that's what makes this film different. The unique subject matter comes with our three heroes (it's kind of sad that it couldn't be four heroes although it was about four heroes). I was very intrigued by the visualization. It is a mixture of a little bit of music video like and a live broadcasting news like. Although sometimes the discolored pictures were extremely unnatural, it was successful in order to make its content more intense. I don't know much about the American patriotism and its power over the War, but it was very interestingly described in a way how well everything can get manipulated over our very basic nature, 'greed.' However, it is the motivation that sparks off wars in ourselves not outside of ourselves..., although they were dealing with the life and death situation at the moment. Anyway, the idea of being ourselves makes much more sense when the trouble that the four U.S. Army soldiers causes in Iraq to live better(?) in this material world. It is a very powerful and well spoken story in terms of the conflicts between the characters and their ideas to cope with the same issue, which make us think about ourselves one more time before moving onto the next century. What would you do when you were in thatsituation (you know what I'm talking about, right? or you will see what I'm talking about...) :)After the film ended, my walk out of the theater was very delightful. Or I would say it was very inspired. I am glad that I saw it at least during the first weekend although it was pretty late. (It was a 10:15 p.m. show, but started at around 10:30 p.m. or 35 or something... It was worth waiting for the guys who sweeping up the theater floor and the previews of other coming</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A welcome big-studio remedy to our post-Gulf War sugar high, THREE KINGS seems in its first two reels to be Whit Stillman's LAST DAYS OF BAGHDAD. The writer-director David O. Russell (of SPANKING THE MONKEY and FLIRTING WITH DISASTER) has a Stillman-like bemused-preppie sensibility that just can't work itself up to the gallows humor of MASH or APOCALYPSE NOW. But once the action-movie plot gets in gear, the movie is a fount of invention and of startling truth-telling--a sequence in which an Iraqi torturer recounts the smart-bomb destruction of his family may be the most seditious scene in a studio movie since JFK. The movie is plenty uneven, but it's brave and alive in a way studio movies aren't these days--you get one or two of these a year if you're lucky, so the quibbles don't really matter. And as the gradually wised-up, cornfed reservist hero, Mark Wahlberg has arrived at bona-fide movie-star status--he's the current reigning champ at portraying the confused and agitated decency of Joe Everyman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Three Kings" ranks as one of the best war movies of this decade and certainly one of the better films of this year (1999). Its story starts out sort of satirical though it quickly becomes something more meaningful. While it seems to be only about four soldiers trying to get rich off of stolen gold it definitely has a more poignant and deeper purpose. The portrayal of enemy soldiers as actual people rather than stereotypical "bad guys" particularly struck a chord with me, and since its message was one of anti-war (as most war movies are) this aspect was very well done. While it may lack the sheer intensity of something like "Saving Private Ryan" or the thoughtful introspective nature of "The Thin Red Line," "Three Kings" stands on its own by using humor to contrast against the realism seen in the characters. Also of note are the great performances, especially by George Clooney who finally proves that he is a very talented and capable actor. Highly recommended, 4/4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of the time, Hollywood gets it wrong about war. Rambo seems to be the best known "individual" that came out of the Vietnam War, but as someone who experienced that conflict first hand, I don't recall anyone who reminded me of such a person, not even the Green Berets in the fire base I was at. But once in a while Hollywood seems to get it right. "Apocalypse Now" was the "opera" about the Vietnam War. "Grand Illusion" and "Paths of Glory" might be the "operas" about World War I. "Seven Samurai" might be the "opera" about mercenaries. "Three Kings," unless a better one comes along, is the "opera," however offbeat, about the Gulf War. All the elements were there. Frustration about the missed "glory of war," as if there were such a thing. The media, represented in all its self-promoted importance (along with a tiny bit of usefulness). The politics of the war was there as well, showing the audience exactly what it was all about-oil (and to a lesser extent, compact discs). Touching the bases of what has gone before (Catch-22, MASH, even "The Boys in Company C," a Vietnam movie that was far closer to the truth about Vietnam than it has been credited), "Three Kings" was a joy (of sorts) to watch. I saw it on opening day, and went back the next day to see it again. I don't think any comments about the director, actors, script, or the style of cinematography are necessary, because to me this was a film so well made that all that is really unnecessary. To me, I was totally involved in watching the screen and I never really took notice of any of it. Which is how it should be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To quote my friend who I dragged along with me to see this: "That was f*%&amp;ed up."And really, it was. Reason #1: they made a war movie out of the Gulf War. Reason #2: they tried to take that and make it super-dramatic and lighthearted at the same time. Reason #3: it worked.It is funny. The jokes are funny, and there are some things that are so dang wacky, you have to laugh (e.g. nerf footballs filled with C4). And thank God, George Clooney doesn't take himself too seriously this time.And it is dramatic, too. I'm not going to elaborate, because doing so would probably reveal more than I'd like to.There were some things that kinda bothered me... sometimes the way they filmed made things out of focus, and that got to me. I guess it was all part of the plan, but I still didn't like it. And certain parts got pretty over-the top: I felt like Russell was hitting me with a two-by-four saying "THINK THIS WAY!!" (It felt quite a bit like English class...)I can't see how people can compare this to Schindler's List or Saving Private Ryan or Platoon. It may contain elements that could be considered similar to those, but the approach is too different to be able to classify it anywhere close to the same league as those other ones.But it's still a good movie, and worth sinking $8 into.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thomas Pynchon's novel 1972 "Gravity's Rainbow" will never be made into a movie, certainly if Pynchon has anything to say about it. But its spirit is evident throughout "Three Kings". Both take place in the messy anarchy that characterizes an immediate post-war period. Both revel in the technical details of what other books and movies take for granted. But most importantly, both look at every character dispassionately AND compassionately, whether they are torturers, pedophiliacs or Americans (just kidding - I couldn't resist).Three Kings is a movie of perfect details. The brief sex scene at the beginning cunningly symbolizes the relationship between the military and the media during the Gulf War. I'm fairly confident that the writer/director intended the scene to be symbolic and not merely gratuitous, based on the level of intelligence displayed in the script throughout.The salaam-hair salon verbal riffing scene is hilarious. For those who didn't get it the first time, "salaam" is Arabic for "peace". It's an example of how many of the verbal jokes in Three Kings are not in your face (unlike the sight gags - shredded beef anyone?). You have to go in to get them - which is why Altman's MASH has been used as a reference point by reviewers. The dialogue isn't overlapping in the usual Altman way, but it's not very high in the mix.IMHO, Three Kings goes as far as any American movie could ever go in portraying how the rest of the world sees Americans - both as individuals and as cogs of the government/military industrial complex. The heartbreaking scene [mild spoiler alert] where our heros are loading up the truck with gold, with help from Saddam's troops, while the Shi'a Iraqis beg them not to go not only illustrates a truth about the Gulf War, but about how the US usually comes across as being hypocritical in any of it supposedly do-gooding ventures.Unfortunately, no one movie can erase the damage of decades of Arab demonizing in Hollywood movies. But full marks to Three Kings for trying. The (apparently not that obvious) point is that everyone in the world, including East Timor, is a human being worthy of respect.No movie is beyond criticism. Yes, Three Kings is slow in places (perhaps a result of the attention to detail mentioned above), yes the ending is too Hollywood. Although all the actors - especially those playing the Iraquis - were at least adequate and didn't get in the way of the story, just think of all the memorable character actors in Kelly's Heroes to realize how different Three Kings could have been. But not necessarily that much better. We don't need another (Kelly's) Heroes anyways.Overall, Three Kings is so strong and original in so many areas that it towers above every other film I've seen this year. I have this knawing sense that the script is too pointed yet ambiguous for the movie to be successful, which would be a shame. Not to knock Blair Witch, which was an interesting approach to filmmaking, but this a far more important statement. I hope it makes more money, because this sort of thing has to be encouraged. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We went to see the new Kevin Spacey film and wandered into this one instead. What we found was a movie so full of implausible story, gratuitous violence and hatred, and tiresome filters that people were walking out midway through. Unfortunately, we stayed until the end. I'm glad to see that some others also didn't like this movie, I was beginning to think I had missed something. I thought it was miserable, not able to decide what it wanted to be. I had seen it advertised as a Comedy/Adventure, which wasn't at all what we got.Four big thumbs down from our group.Peggy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A welcome big-studio remedy to our post-Gulf War sugar high, THREE KINGS seems in its first two reels to be Whit Stillman's LAST DAYS OF BAGHDAD. The writer-director David O. Russell (of SPANKING THE MONKEY and FLIRTING WITH DISASTER) has a Stillman-like bemused-preppie sensibility that just can't work itself up to the gallows humor of MASH or APOCALYPSE NOW. But once the action-movie plot gets in gear, the movie is a fount of invention and of startling truth-telling--a sequence in which an Iraqi torturer recounts the smart-bomb destruction of his family may be the most seditious scene in a studio movie since JFK. The movie is plenty uneven, but it's brave and alive in a way studio movies aren't these days--you get one or two of these a year if you're lucky, so the quibbles don't really matter. And as the gradually wised-up, cornfed reservist hero, Mark Wahlberg has arrived at bona-fide movie-star status--he's the current reigning champ at portraying the confused and agitated decency of Joe Everyman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Three Kings" ranks as one of the best war movies of this decade and certainly one of the better films of this year (1999). Its story starts out sort of satirical though it quickly becomes something more meaningful. While it seems to be only about four soldiers trying to get rich off of stolen gold it definitely has a more poignant and deeper purpose. The portrayal of enemy soldiers as actual people rather than stereotypical "bad guys" particularly struck a chord with me, and since its message was one of anti-war (as most war movies are) this aspect was very well done. While it may lack the sheer intensity of something like "Saving Private Ryan" or the thoughtful introspective nature of "The Thin Red Line," "Three Kings" stands on its own by using humor to contrast against the realism seen in the characters. Also of note are the great performances, especially by George Clooney who finally proves that he is a very talented and capable actor. Highly recommended, 4/4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roger Ebert sums it up, "some kind of weird masterpiece". Certainly it's the strangest "war picture" since MASH. It reveals, in several ways, just how much of what we think of as "the nineties" derives from the national orgasm that Operation Desert Storm provided this country. From national uncertainty, even a little humility as we watched the Soviet Union topple before our economic might in the late eighties, to gloating vanity as "the American Way" seemed to drive all before it. The idea of America as the world's policeman gained new popularity and the puissance of the American military became, once again, the conventional wisdom. It's all there peeking around the edges of this film and, occasionally, taking center stage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic film which blends action, comedy, and drama perfectly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three Kings is one of those rare films that combines action, comedy, and drama without losing anything and making itself a great film. George Clooney (Out of Sight, The Peacemaker) stars as a man in the army who along with Mark Wahlberg (Boogie Nights, The Big Hit), Ice Cube (Anaconda, The Player's Club), and Spike Jonze (director of Being John Malkovich) have come upon a map which they believe leads them to a fortune in stolen gold. The Gulf War is over so the men decide to go after the gold. They find it, but are convinced to stay and help out some locals who are being terrorized by Sadaam's army. The film starts off with comedy, then adds action, then the drama without losing anything it had before and still showing the horrors of war (though there are no major battles or anything). Clooney gives a strong lead performance. Ice Cube and Jonze are both solid. The film's best performance belongs to Wahlberg. Jamie Kennedy (Scream) adds some very funny moments. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing the commercials/trailers for this film and hearing the buzz (rumors of Oscar talk) , this movie had become a must see. I wasn't sure where the Oscar talk fit in to a film that looked like a buddy action flick set during the Gulf War. However, the cast does a wonderful job. Spike Jones was wrong, he does deserve to be among this cast. He steals the show in most scenes and is extremely entertaining. The comedy factor in this movie is high but so is the creativity and drama. Anyone expecting nonstop action, well wait for Universal Soldier 3. This movie touches on an element that is left out of most pictures made today and that is the human element . Each character is, well, human. They don't think alike, they don't act alike, they don't act as one. The movie makes use of some interesting "perspective shots" which sometimes amaze and at the same time repulse the crowd (that is what it is used for, so it isn't a bad thing). David Russel and company did a wonderful job on not only making this movie believeable but kept it entertaining. That is what movies are all about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most striking aspect of how "Three Kings" presents its story, is its humanization of the Iraqis, the enemies of the Gulf War.One scene involving the torture of an American POW by an Iraqi Republican Guard, speaks volumes in its presentation of the motives of the young Iraqi. He was trained in torture by the Americans, against the Iranians, and speaks in American slang. He is overwhelmed by the crippling of his wife and death of his son in the American bombing of Iraq, and his passion is to make the American prisoner understand his pain and the basis of what he sees the War to be really about. You get that this is not a film about the glories of war, but rather about the pain and chaos. That it is presented in dark humor and comedy gives you the real sense of humanity of the participants. I would rate this movie as between very good and excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great stuff, good movie, reduced slightly by sophomoric ideology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a lot of moralizing in this movie. This is OK, but it can also be dangerous, because it is human nature to confuse our own opinions with fundamental human conditions. Not that we would ever do that, of course, but the movie makers here seem to have a blend of genuine "reality" as well as the fashionable story lines of the ideogogue (that's a fancy term for a "manure" filled person who doesn't recognize the manure-ness of their, and all, opinions).Much of the drama has to do with the horrible situation of a real individual human being getting caught up and included in a big, impersonal event. Here the reduction of a human life (including the families and friends not in the military) to a mere cog, a mere member of a group, a "side" in a conflict, is powerful and moving. Yet these stories were also told as they bridged two real cultures-- Saddam's Iraq on one side and the West on the other. Thus, the writers/director had to select some real features of the times and the politics to portray as backdrop for the movie's story. Precisely here is where they stumbled a bit-- all military authority and hierarchy was depicted as fumbling and inefficient-- with a hint of some hidden agenda, some unnamed evil. The explanation that they war was about "oil rights" was also trotted out as the prime cause of the actual Iraqi war. While I agree that the fabled "liberating" of Kuwait was also bogus as an explanation-- I would guess that most folks saw through that story by the time the real war was over-- the "blood for oil" explanation dished up by the knee-jerk marxists at the time, and since, was equally insulting.There is undoubtedly a grain of truth in these explanations, but they are too shaky and too distracting from other important issues to be worthy of a film maker's or audience's time. Some analysts, including some at the Kremlin, reported later that the primary reason most of the Russian generals refused to support the military coup that happened right after the Iraqi war, was because they had been profoundly demoralized by the swift defeat of their "client" military regime-- Saddam's army and air force. It has been said that the Iraqi war was the proxy for the long dreaded stand-off between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. Maybe it prevented World Ware III? It was shown that all the Russian military stuff was crap; and the best and bright Soviet advice failed to produce a useful strategy for the Iraqis.Whatever-- "Three Kings" is a great movie because of the harsh edge with which they depict battle. It is also a lame and mediocre movie (in parts), because of the superficial and "media friendly" arguments it sometimes used to criticize the war. It sounded, at times, like a group of 19 year old college students mouthing back the conventional, modern, politically correct versions of why government (read: mom and dad?) is wrong. Come on-- do your own thinking, folks. Learn to see beyond the cliches and slogans (the ideology) that you have been spoon fed. If you want to criticize something-- great! But do it intelligently, with at least some grasp of objectivity, and for the right reasons.Overall-- heavy themes, good job. George Clooney is SO great as an actor-- he really gets to shine here. But all that is tempered and reduced slightly by the corny and unconvincing whining about "The Man," and how he's out to get us all. I gave it an "8."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first impression I got of this movie was: it was weird! I mean, one minute you're laughing and the other everything becomes dead serious. At fist I was not sure I liked it but finally it got to me. The actors are great (especially Clooney) and the story is an excellent mix of comedy, drama and action. And it's a very interesting way to see the human side of both Sadam's soldiers and the american troops in a war that we really weren't told that much about when it happened.. A little less silly would have been better , though. But just the fact that a movie can make you laugh so much and at the same time reflect seriously on a war.. that's pretty impressing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>absurd war = dark humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like your humor on the cynical and darkened side then this film will appeal to your sarcastic nature. I saw the film in a city that practically had a wargasm back in '91 with flags, ribbons, and Lee Greenwood saturating every pore of the populace. Laughably, a few in the theatre were visibly upset when the movie began deftly picking apart the ridiculousness of the whole desert storm situation. Yes, to some this film is a skewed patriotic representation of what they might imagine the whole war was about, but I favor the opinions of the film. I'm familiar with reservist who took a couple of months sabbatical to the desert, and the thought of a few of the guys I know with semi-automatic weapons IS an absurd notion. Glorify the "war" if you wanna, but there's enough absurdity to that event to justify and warrant more than a little dark humor. If your sensibilities can't handle that notion and you'd rather sing "Proud to be an American" every Thursday night at the kareokee bar, then stay home and rent Saving Private Ryan...and leave the better movie of 3 Kings to those of us who know how to laugh at irony, tragedy, manipulation, illogicality, and more than a handful of the baser human conditions.This movies highlights those sensibilities in glaring relief to the popular notion of the war. And it does it a fashion that's both subtle AND (yes) heavy-handed. It's not a perfect film, but the moments (and there are more hits than misses) that capture the true essence of war are sublime. Violence is brutal. This film shows it to us in hyper realism; not as a gag either (as some here would have you believe) but as an exercise in authenticity. If you've seen Catch-22, then you know what angle the lens is pointing. If you're favorite movie is The Green Berets or something with Audie Murphy, then stay away from this film (and buy a clue while you're at it).Four outta Five stars</fullReview>

His character seemed to think that everything that was said by the other white soldier in their group (not G. Clooney or Mark Walhburg) was somehow "anti black", the writer could have left that out. Many of the shots/scenes in it were just plain neat, like the bullet wounds, and just how some of the camera work was done, like when I think it was G. Clooney was standing motionless, and the clouds were behind him moving at a fast rate, to show a sense of time. I'm glad I liked it, because I jeoporadized my employment with my theater company, by watching a screening of it when I wasn't supposed to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clooney finally found his breakthrough film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three Kings: at the end of the Gulf war, four grunts set out to "liberate" the gold Saddam stole from Kuwait but damned if real life doesn't get in the way. This is not your typical war movie i.e. it is not a rah rah recruitment film. The violence is sparse, but when it is onscreen it feels real - no "Oh, don't worry it's just a flesh wound" drivel. The slow motion scenes of bullets meeting bodies, although not as visceral as the opening scenes in Saving Private Ryan, are very effective. In addition, The grainy whiteout quality of the film helps to emphasize the harsh brutality of the landscape, and provides an appropriate backdrop for the ever-present black humor (where else other than an Ozzy Osbourne concert will you get to see exploding quadrupeds?). What really makes this movie work is the camaraderie among the actors.Spike Jonez is hilarious as a moronic hick whose idea of fun is wiring footballs with C-4 and using stuffed animals for target practice. Once again Mark Wahlberg demonstrates that he is a much better actor than a singer (and he just keeps getting better), while Ice Cube does an admirable job in his first time out. George Clooney however has the most to gain: he has finally found a role that capitalizes on his monotone, expressionless style (is he smiling, gritting his teeth in anger, or totally disinterested?). Don't get me wrong, I've liked Clooney since I saw him in "Return of the Killer Tomatoes", and I think this is going to be the movie that makes him bankable, but he doesn't really have a huge acting range. I'll be going back for seconds...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful, funny, original film meant to rattle the public's perceptions of the Gulf War.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the dawn of this decade, as the U.S. was trouncing Iraq, few would have guessed that Operation Desert Storm would inspire any great war movies. After all, the battle was easily won -- and audiences wouldn't pay to see what they'd already seen on CNN, right? But as the decade comes to a close, along comes "Three Kings", a powerful, funny, original -- and, indeed great -- war film meant to rattle the public's perceptions of the Gulf War. The movie is a framework for director David O. Russell's scathing indictment of the Bush administration's hypocritical, self-serving foreign policy. It lobbies heavy criticism at a nation that acts as global policeman -- only when it suits our needs.Some of the imagery comes off as cartoonish, and as Russell tries to drive home his point, the film is at times heavy handed. Shots of an American soldier having crude oil poured down his throat, and a baby's crib being crushed by an American bomb are a bit over-the-top. But Russell is simply trying to combat Gulf War propaganda with some brilliant propaganda of his own.Even bolder is how Russell seemlessly blends his serious complex political statement with moments dark humor, searing drama, and some rollicking Rambo-style action sequences. It's an outstanding piece of work.</fullReview>

Happiness, Boogie Nights, and American Beauty are some of the very few quality films that did both so well and effectively. Three Kings is just as great as those movies.Unfortunately, I haven't seen anything else by David O. Russell, but I'll be sure to soon. He has written and made a nearly flawless movie. He has recruited three extremely capable actors and juiced an awesome performance from Spike Jonze. One of the other reviews complained that the Iraqi accents were inaccurate, and unfortunately, I am another stupid american who couldn't detect it. (Nevertheless, I didn't complain about The Bitter Tea of General Yen (and I'm chinese).) Perhaps the accents are inaccurate, but that doesn't mean that the Iraqi characters weren't treated sensitively. Even the "bad guys" weren't all that bad. They're just pawns of Saddam. Saddam is the only "real villain" but that is a proven fact.Russell successfully includes some campy material like what happens when someone gets shot by a bullet, or what would happen if someone bombed your own home, or my very favorite, visually describing why and how Spike Jonze's character "doesn't really have a job."I'm afraid many people are going to be disappointed with this movie because of the lack of violence. This movie is more like Schindler's List than Rambo III or even saving private ryan. It presents some morality issues that many Americans probably never thought too hard about. It is more hard hitting than Saving Private Ryan (which I thought was visually stunning, but lacked the heart of Thin Red Line) but not quite as harsh as Platoon. I want to say it is light-hearted but that makes it seem like a comedy which it isn't. It's just a funny movie.It raises some important concerns that Americans should know. Truth behind war can be clouded. The ugliness of money is one of the themes of this film. The war is about money, the soldiers get themsleves into trouble over gaining money, what happens to people when they don't have money, and what is money really worth. All these are addressed in the film.I saw this at a preview on the berkeley campus and I'll be sure to see it a few more times.This is a great movie. It isn't a war movie. No one should see it expecting Saving Private Ryan or Rambo 9: The Search for Trought. This movie has a great script that always borders on hilarity and desperation. You don't know when why you're one the verge of crying even though you can't breathe cause you just coughed a lung up from laughing so hard. The film has four great actors and a great director. The only sad this about this movie is that it will never win any big awards because of it's unconventionality.See this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I received free passes to see an advanced screening of this movie and was unsure what to expect. I'll admit my tastes usually run more to the romantic comedies and dramas, but this movie was a completely wonderful experience.Violence was used sparingly, a plus in my book, and each bullet really did count. The comedy was used intellegently to offset the horrific treatment of the Iraqis and the true nature of war and oppression. In addition, the eyecatching, albeit graphic, method of showing what exactly a bullet does to one's insides hammered home the costs of violence and coupled with the portrayal of the emotional aftermath of death, provided an incredibly powerful message.Clooney, Ice T, Wahlberg, and -- unexpectedly -- Jonze had incredible comedic and dramatic chemistry together. Truly, a joy to watch them interact. The rest of the cast -- from the extras to the actors who played the Iraqi military were impeccable. The pain and agony of this experience was conveyed in the tiniest of ways -- furthering the story.I don't want to spoil the ending, but in all honesty, Russell is a genius. He provided the necessary closure to a complex, challenging and, ultimately, heartwarming story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're looking for a no-brainer, shoot-em-up, blow everything up type of movie that leaves you pumped up and wanting to fire a Bazooka, this is NOT the movie for you.Thoughtfully done and wonderfully filmed, Three Kings is the story of 3 American soldiers who go on the hunt for Saddam Hussein's gold reserves, only to discover that they have the ability to make a difference in some Kuwati's lives, and that some things are more important than money.The cinematography alone is worth seeing this movie for, but the acting of George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, and Ice Cube are fantastic - Mark Wahlberg has proved, beyond a shadow of a doubt that he's matured into a fine actor, and you can expect great things from him in the future.Run fast to the theatres... You don't want to miss this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Positive review emphasizing the film's surrealism and originality.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director and screen writer David O. Russell ("Spanking the Monkey" &amp; "Flirting with Disaster") has fashioned an original, surrealistic and cultural-bender film about the last days of the Gulf war in 1991. Cast is excellent with even the secondary characters having substance and impact.Story revolves around George Clooney leading three soldiers (Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube and Spike Jonze) in stealing a fortune in gold bars, that Saddam's army has looted from Kuwait. But the mission takes bizarre twists with the Americans having to decide to help civilians or leave with the gold.Although there are hints of "Apocalypse Now" in this film, "Kings" has a decidedly humanistic slant in the midst of battle horrors. Film is realistic in its combat sequences, but the film makers take the easy way out for an ending.Film is anti George Bush with the US military leadership often portrayed as stupid. While the individual soldiers are shown as courageous, doing their job and sympathetic toward civilians.Movie has some memorable vignettes and scenes. One scene, where Clooney is invoking the name of George Bush to get something done, is worth the price of admission. Writing is hip and funny with two hilarious lines about the Dallas metroplex for those of you living there.Besides the four major actors, two others deserve notice. Nore Dunn, as an aggressive cable news reporter, and Jamie Kennedy, as her military escort, steal scenes throughout the movie. In a year of mediocre Hollywood film making about teenagers and supernatural mumbo jumbo, "Three Kings" is a crown jewel to be relished for being different. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three Kings is a great movie! This movie is sort of difficult to explain in the sense that it could be considered a comedy, a drama, and an action flick. Clooney, Wahlberg, and Ice Cube have a good chemistry together. The story itself is good as well. I particularly like the directing of this film. The director uses several types of styles of filming to give an almost independent film -like flavor! I highly recommend Three Kings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A memorable film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People think that a picture with George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, and Ice Cube can not be memorable, or a classic. Well, I have to beg to differ. First if you look at the three actor's and their film career's, you would understand. Ice Cube was in BOYZ N' THE HOOD, Mark Wahlberg was in BOOGIE NIGHTS, and George Clooney was in OUT OF SIGHT. Now all three of these underrated and talented actors star in the new David (FLIRTING WITH DISASTER) O. Russell film titled THREE KINGS. THREE KINGS is set in 1991, as the U.S. troops are celebrating the cease fire from Iraq in Operation Desert Storm. Sgt. Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg) and his friend/protege, Pvt. Conrad Vig (Spike Jonze) find a map that leds to a Iraqi bunker with items seized by Sadam Hussein's troops. One of the items is tons of seized Kuwait gold bullion. Meanwhile, Special Forces Captain Archie Gates, get wind of these Iraqi bunkers with gold, and finds out that Sgt. Barlow found a map leading to the bunkers. Gates orders Barlow, Vig, and the religious and serious Sgt. Chief Elgin (Ice Cube) to go with him to steal back the Kuwait gold, and to split it among each other. Gates figures that it's only fair to get this gold since all he did during the operation is baby-sit pouty network journalist Adriana Cruz (Nora Dunn). The soldiers expect this "mission" to be quick in and out job, and that they'll be back before the end of the morning. What the troops didn't expect is the treatment of the Iraq civilians given by Hussein's troops. The civilians are beaten and even killed by Hussein's soldiers, and they ban any shipments of food or water to the people. When the U.S. soldiers see this, they're not suppose to react, since they are to follow President Bush orders on not to interfer with Iraq's politics. But these men begin to have a change of heart, and decide to alter their plans. I was very surprised on how excellent THREE KINGS was. I figured that it would have been another clever action film like FACE/OFF and MATRIX. I was wrong, this film is more than a action film, it has comedy, wit, and even emotional scenes. This film has quite a few disturbing inages of the violence of war, and the terror that many Iraq civilians, including children, were facing. Russell does a unique job of showing images of the character's thoughts and flashbacks. I haven't seen such rapid, yet memorable editing of images since the late Stanley Kubrick's work in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. Also, Russell does a great homage to Sam Peckinpah with slow-motion gun shots and deaths, similar to the WILD BUNCH. I was pleased with the acting also, Clooney stood out as the tough and intelligent leader, while Wahlberg was also good as the sensitive soldier. And Cube is good as the very serious soldier who has faith in his mission. The plot, also written by Russell, is very witty and great. It mixws a terrific blend of action, comedy, suspense, and drama, to where it's taken seriously and not sarcastic. Before seeing this film, I heard that this film, along with AMERICAN BEAUTY, was a strong Oscar consideration for this year. I didn't believe it, and couldn't believe it, until I saw the movie. Now I'll be very upset if it doesn't get nominated for Best Picture. It does to Operation Desert Storm, what SAVING PRIVATE RYAN did for World War II. This is another war classic, and so far, my favorite film of the year!!! ***** (out of five)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best damn movie of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got back from seeing an advanced screening of the movie "Three Kings." I cannot even come close to saying how godDAMN good this movie is. The music throughout the entire movie is absolutely HORRENDOUS and SUCKS @$$ (except for the U2 song at the very end), but that is the one and ONLY complaint I could even come close to making about this film.It is a fairly graphic war story, so if you are easily grossed out or don't want to have to see innocent people get shot and killed, then avoid it, but if you can stand some realism, then this film is an absolute must-see! The story is EXTREMELY powerful -- I can't think of another war movie even remotely like this one (no, I have NOT seen the Thin Red Line OR Saving Private Ryan, so I can't compare this to them), but my previous favorite war film was Full Metal Jacket (Long Live Kubrick!), and in my humble opinion, 3 Kings surpasses even this film monument.I can already hear people say: "But the three leads don't even know how to act, they're all hacks!" Believe me, I though so too. I was wrong -- dead wrong. All three of them (George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, and Ice Cube) may have done some absolutely terrible and revolting work in the past, but this film is a milestone for their careers. There is simply no way to say anything more about this movie than "Wow." It is an astounding piece of work, and it has earned my highest praise for cinema. Go see it. Today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a great drama, with great action sequences, and some good humor. It was informative, in the sense that it gives American audiences some information they might not have previously known regarding activity during Operation Desert Storm... but it does not take a political stance on it, one way or the other. What could have been an anti-Bush, anti-Saddam movie, just kinda lays it out there, and lets you feel about it however you're going to, in the interest of keeping you entertained.And I was certainly entertained. They show what a bullet will actually DO to a human being, and really makes you think about good vs. bad, and how it is not always as black and white as all that.I thought the ending was somewhat of a cop-out, since these characters are fictional, but I guess the director wanted to try and have it end on a happy note. Was he forced by the studio to do this, or is he just too young to be bitter about things? You make the call.Really fun to watch, tho. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Because I really enjoyed a couple of David O. Russell's movies, I thought I'd try this one. Big mistake. Maybe it was more enjoyable when it was made -- before the US spent a decade fighting more wars in the Middle East. Maybe I'm just tired of seeing George Clooney in his usual smug tough guy with a heart of gold role. I know I'm tired of seeing white Southerners portrayed as stupid hicks who talk like Gomer Pyle. Mr. Russell obviously wanted to send a message with this movie, trying to wrap it in enough violence and low-brow humor and stereotypes to hold the attention of what he must think is a very stupid audience. Because I have to submit at least 10 lines of text, please excuse the repetition.

		<shortDescription>Clooney's heroes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1970 movie 'Kelly's Heroes', staring Clint Eastwood and Donald Sutherland, told the story of a bunch of American soldiers attempting to help themselves to some Nazi gold. The film was fun, amoral (no discussions of the ethics of Nazism or war here) and carried a distinct whiff of the counterculture. Thirty years later, David O. Russell's 'Three Kings' begins in a very similar vein, albeit updated to a setting in the aftermath of the first Gulf war. And the start is similarly fun, although some scenes (for example, those showing the interior of the human body) smack of a young director trying a little too hard to show off. It's the second part of the film that is more problematic: the film tries to develop a heart and a conscience, but the Americans are unlikeable (until they undergo the standard Hollywood transformation into conventional good guys) and the Iraqi characters rather unconvincing. War is ugly, and "we" are not always in the right, but these are rather tame messages from a supposedly scabrous satire; without any guiding political message, the movie can't really say anything of interest when it confronts larger themes. Overall, it left me a little disappointed; you need a viewpoint of your own from which to deconstruct those of others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gripping Retelling of the Persian Gulf War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had feared this film would upset me. Many war films get me upset because of their pro-war messages and pro-American bias. And when the film is taking place in Iraq, which is currently a hotbed of military activity, the possibility to upset me is even greater. But I guess I should have realized that this was a George Clooney movie... I was not upset at all, but took heart.Four soldiers (not sure why it's "three kings") find Kuwaiti gold and must return it to Kuwait, despite having to go against orders from above. Can they help the Iraqi people in the process? That's what I liked about this film. There were Iraqi men torturing a soldier and some racial slurs I will not reprint here. But the film went out of the way to explain that Iraqis are people too and they have families and do whatever they must to defend themselves and their family. This is too often overlooked in our us versus them mentality.Good gunfights, good explosions (the one with the cow was nice). The whitewashed colors were very good and added something to the film, though I could have done without the slow-motion scenes. The close-ups of what a bullet does inside a body was a great idea -- whoever wrote that is great and whoever pulled it off is also very good.I could have used less Judy Greer, maybe none at all. Her role was pointless and I'm not clear why she was in the film at all.If you like war, politics or current events or history... this is a great film. Probably Ice Cube's best, incidentally. Mark Wahlberg was alright, though he still looks like Matt Damon to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most unconventional American movies for a long, long time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the original Gulf War, the American forces and their Allies declared the fighting over without closing in for the kill on Saddam Hussein. Instead, the Iraqi citizens were encouraged to rise up against Hussein's regime and topple him themselves, with the promise of American assistance.... but in reality, the Americans failed to provide the assistance they'd promised, and many Iraqis who took up arms against their tyrannical leader were left to face the music. Three Kings is a very unorthodox war film which is set during the truce following the end of the official combat. The story deals with four soldiers who learn that the after-effects of war, and the costs of broken promises, are far greater than they could imagine.Whilst rounding up surrendered enemy fighters, some American soldiers find a map which gives details of the whereabouts of Saddam Hussein's stash of gold bullion. Four soldiers - Major Archie Gates (George Clooney), Sgt Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg), Chief Elgin (Ice Cube) and Private Conrad Vig (Spike Jonze) - decide to follow the map with the objective of stealing the gold for themselves. It seems a sound enough plan.... they've just fought a war, a truce has been declared, and they figure they deserve to return home a good deal wealthier for their efforts. However, once into the Iraqi wilderness, they are drawn into the plight of a group of Iraqi freedom fighters who have been encouraged to rise against their dictator. Left to their fate by the unfulfilled promise of American support, these freedom fighters and their families now need desperately to escape to the Iranian border to avoid the terrifying repercussions of their insolence.... and Gates and his men realise that their personal wealth must be put on the back-burner while they help these brave but betrayed Iraqis escape from their hostile homeland.Three Kings is an energetic and sometimes surreal film, with a morally complex heart and a brave enough script to question and even criticise American attitudes towards post-war Iraqi problems. Everything about the film defies conventions; just when you think the film is heading down the Italian Job/Kelly's Heroes route, it turns into something far more challenging and sophisticated. The adventures that befall the quartet of Americans are anything but standard fare (for a great case-in-point, check out the wonderfully outlandish scene wherein Wahlberg makes a phone-call to his wife with an emergency request in the heat of battle!) And the ending manages to strike a note of bitter irony that few Hollywood films of the modern era are courageous enough to provide. The film is disturbing and hilarious; caperish yet totally unorthodox; violent and comical.... a film of substantial intelligence and depth which tackles difficult themes without looking for easy answers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Groovy, modern thriller as political polemic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read that director David O Russell used to be a political activist, and it shows. Sure, the film is about the (conspiracy-style) obsession that the US drove an Iraqi invasion force out of Kuwait in order to secure a political relationship with a major oil producer; Russell doesn't shirk this core message.However, he does it so that we won't glaze over. The film is fast, funny and full of action. It's also surreal, although this has as much to do with the confusing post-conflict terms of ceasefire documented in the film as it has to do with Russell's quirky cinematic eye. I particularly like the Gene Krupa-esque drum torrents that drive the 'three kings' of the title into bunkers in search of the spoils of war.Clooney, Wahlberg and Ice Cube are all very good, particularly Clooney, struggling to not give in to his humanity - like a gifted student battling to look too cool for school. Ice Cube can lapse into gooey sentiment a little too easily sometimes but is tough and convincing in the main. I also enjoyed Nora Dunn's tough and slightly unhinged NBC reporter. Tight, funny, only controversial because it all seems so self-evident when put this way. 7/10</fullReview>

As the story goes on Clooney, Wahlberg, and Cube get a change of heart, and decided to help out Iraq civilians get across the border instead.The movie never really tails off, or become boring.

		<shortDescription>A film that gives everything in the book its best shot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, makes you tremble that you won't be able to do it justice. I was trembling during and after the film. This is a film, far and beyond more awake than any American director's films like Steven Soderbergh, probably the most exciting film of present day. But the truth is, seeing Clooney, Wahlberg, and Ice Cube on the poster will not give you the impression that you will be in good hands if you see it. For people who haven't see it, you'd probably think it's another "Armageddon",or another movie that cares more about its money than its art, well you can take my word on my dead body for it, you'd be more than just surprised. I'm sure you're able to read the plot line on the IMDb page, but I don't know why this plot outline can seem so clichéd, melodramatic and uninteresting, let alone original. Guess what? The movie is the exact opposite. Right from the beginning, the flash, high contrast image editing informs you that this story is going to stay in flash and constant motion, that it will believe and never forget it's audience. This movie convicts what all the others isn't doing right with the subject matter, I mean people like Speilberg in his heavy handed war films, I mean James Cameron in "True Lies" or something like that that isn't fair to non-Americans, or if forget about being "fair", in terms of the story, it's just being really, painfully cheap. The movie starts off as entertainment, but it goes places you didn't prepare for it to go. The guys are out to get gold very early in the story, they didn't go through 45 minutes of myths and discoveries, they found a map and plan to get the gold the next morning and return before lunch the same day. The joy of it is you cannot put your finger on what will possibly hold them back to make the whole 115 minute movie, after all, the war is over. Yes, they get to use their guns and there's a lot of fuss getting the gold, but I think one of the reasons why it seems so fresh is because you can never picture what the next location will look like. Well, what happens is they get involved in Iraq's political position, they get involved with "necessities" they didn't think they needed, they get involved with their own conscience, yet at the same time, their own greed or dreams. The obstacles weren't so hard to see at all, because you realize the ability of the emotional range. It can take you from the deepest hell of sufferance to the deepest hysterical laugh, all done with exuberantly reinventive and literally penetrating technique. The style was always done with it's own sub-American sort of way, casting people like it does. But what's genuinely memorable is the dialogue, because the script gives every character it's best shot to be true, to be unapologetically seen from all kinds of perspectives that challenges how an audience could feel and think, which at one point or another will win over our trust for the world going on in the screen. From then on, it's no more about explosions or grand finales than it is about the decisions the characters go with, and we won't doubt them. This movie does it all so assuringly and emotionally profound that it transcends the integrity of an audience's anticipations. What more can be said of that? Unforgettable? Magical? What may feel more substantial is some hysterically pleasing moments in the movie. There's too many, for example, the convertible argument, the "day jobs" flashbacks(the flashbacks or out-takes are thrillingly satisfying and lingering), Clooney and the civilians walking while "Stop ou Encore" by Plastic Bertrand is playing cut with an Iraqi head wrapped woman wearing sunglasses, Wahlberg's phone call with his wife, certain music which Carter Burwell also contributed to, the lady news reporter ironically crying or being intimidated by Saddam's army, Spike Jonze playing the love songs in the car on the way to save a kidnapped soldier---touches like that that are reminiscent of "Mash"'s sensibility but more modern and somewhat more at the tip of the edge for today. To tell you the truth, you really don't get so exhilarated like this so easily in movies. It's like what Pauline Kael says: when you realize it doesn't get better than this, it becomes blah blah, I forgot what she said, something depicting nostalgia or personal memory. Of course, you wish George Clooney's character can loosen up a little, since he always seems so wise and confident, though very much convincingly, but you know, the other guys got more of a share for humoring themselves or making themselves vulnerable, which is essentially what acting is about.In the end you almost forget that this movie isn't based on true people or events. David O. Russel, which made his superb comedy "Flirting with disaster" is probably one of last remaining people in Hollywood that still fully believes in its audience and being one of the audience members himself. For such numb and insulting products Hollywood can make these days, given more and more, this is a film that flies above anything of its class and importance, especially for today when we are certainly engaged with Irag in ugliness and the feeling of disbelief for our time. Don't dare to underestimate this movie. Thanks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three Kings deserved a 7 rating, because the story, acting and plot were well done.But if anyone views this movie and thinks it contains some kind of "truth" about the Gulf War, then you just weren't paying attention during the actual war (or never read the media coverage). True, some people swallowed the "We're liberating Kuwait" rationale for the Gulf War. But all along the reason was oil first, then anything else.And the U.S. surely did abandon the Iraqi Kurds and others in that country who had been urged to rise up by President Bush. I don't know if the U.S. promised any tangible help at the time, but nothing came and thousands of people were slaughtered by Saddam and his military while they awaited (in vain) assistance.But this has been fairly common knowledge for years. Three Kings just puts a (fictional) face on it. Also, I do think the movie stretched when it sought the viewer's understanding for the Iragi motives ("You bombed my home") and tried to make Iraq/US morality equal. As much as the Gulf War was about oil, Iraq did indeed invade Kuwait and did indeed need to be kicked out. No invasion, no bombing of Iraqi homes. So I don't see the two sides as having equally good reasons for their actions.The DVD is fabulous. Many extras, terrific sound. Overall a good movie with some interesting innovations (i.e. the bullet from *inside* the body). But no insights.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not bad, but decidedly overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three Kings is a movie that has gotten a lot of praise, and, judging from the average vote on imdb, has been popular with movie buffs as well. ultimately, though, it's just an uneasy blend of comedy and heavy-handed, preachy drama (see mark wahlberg's hostage scenes) and, with the exception of the from-the-bullet's-point-of-view shots, it offers little that can't be seen in "full metal jacket," or any other war drama for that matter.it is a movie in desperate need of an identity, an emotional throughline. i did find myself laughing occasionally (toward the beginning) and cringing (toward the end), but only the last scene, at the border, had any real power for me, and by that point it was too late to save the rest of the movie.i'll probably give the movie a rent when it comes out just to make sure i didn't miss something big, but i would imagine Three Kings won't be joining the ranks of my video library till it hits $5 at blockbuster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By watching the trailer and the commercials, one gets the impression that Three Kings is a hybrid of action, comedy, and drama. Well it is - sort of. In reality it is a drama above all with some truly funny lines and scenes thrown in. The action sequences are incredible. Not the kind of incredible that we saw in the D-Day sequence of Saving Private Ryan but more of type that we loved in the Matrix. Don't be fooled by what you see and hear - this movie is a drama.Some excellent points are raised in this film. It is a socially conscious war movie, the likes of which I don't think I have seen. It takes a completely different spin on the Gulf War. It blames the U.S. government for telling the Iraqis to rebel against Saddam and then not helping them as they are slaughtered. Immense sympathy is created for the Iraqi people whether they are civilians or members of Saddam's army. Were we wrong for what we did in 1991? What did we win? Money? Oil? Gold (as the heroes of the film are searching for)? Self respect?Aesthetically, the film is great. The film stock is faded to not only give the film an aged quality but it also shows the washed out view of the war itself. As the heroes become more aware of what is occurring around them and decide to do something, the stock becomes more standard. The color becomes more "normal." Furthermore, the use of hand held cameras and panning gives the viewer a sense of being in the action or cavern or crowd (depending upon the scene). For example, we are cinematically placed inside of a truck as it flips over; on the big screen it looks awesome!For all of the film's great aspects - message, aesthetics, acting (which was great). The writing lacked. Although the characters were well witten, the plot was filled with cliches and became too preachy at times. It is as if sympathy for the Iraqis was being shoved down our throat. The film didn't think that we the viewers would follow what they wanted to say. In addition, there was a great deal of moving around as if the plot wasn't really sure what it wanted to do. What this film lacked, other war films like M*A*S*H excelled in. In all, the script really brought down what could have been a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Russell has created an interesting hybrid of a movie bringing together the adventure stories of H Rider Haggard, the westerns of Ford / Wayne, and the anti war comedy style of M.A.S.H. Gritty and funny in equal measure, Russell has attempted a biting satire of the war / adventure movie and generally succeeds. However, the need to appeal to a wider audience means the introduction of a few clunky plot devices, and the inevitable happy ending. The acting swings from the professionalism of Clooney, to the increasingly erratic style of Mr Cube. Spike Jones' turn as Conrad Vig is impressive and Wahlberg manages to be inoffensive as the soldier who eventually sees the a reflection of his own life and family in the traumatised Iraqis. The movie maybe tries too hard to spell out the obvious - war is bad, everybody suffers, America can be good as well as bad, not all foreigners are terrorists. But Russell I suppose manages to tread a fine line between US imperialist action / adventure movie and satire of US military incompetence.All-in-all, Worth giving up a couple of hours for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Clooney leads a group of ordinary GIs into Iraq in pursuit of Saddam Hussein's gold bullion in the aftermath of the Gulf War. (Kids, that was 1991. We won.) At first the film looks like "Kelly's Heroes." But that's only because the targeted gold allows for an exploration of some of the internal political dynamics of Iraq, and for some outstanding if commercially handled action scenes as well. The gold is a MacGuffin, just a plot point to keep our guys on the move, in and out of danger.The Iraqi soldiers are mostly presented as stereotypical villains. While the Americans look on, the Iraqi army captures a handful of anti-Saddam rebels. Then they shoot a woman at point blank range through the head while her young husband and little girl look on. The scene isn't handled discreetly. The woman falls to the sand and a pool of blood forms under her while the daughter tears herself loose and runs to the corpse, shrieking, "Mamma, mama!" In a way it's the opposite of how Spielberg handled atrocity in "Schindler's List," where such scenes are presented matter of factly, under the assumption that the mature audience knows how horrible these acts are without being kicked in the pants by a screaming child. But then there's an adolescent quality in much of the direction. Sometimes the action is thrilling and slightly comic, an upended truck sliding to a stop only inches from the land mine the driver is goggling at. There's the expectable slow motion as some of the artifacts explode. And the ambient sound shuts off while we follow the trajectories of a couple of particularly important bullets whizzing through the air in slow motion.I'm not sure whether such obvious tricks belong in this kind of movie or not. The script itself, willy nilly, provides plenty of comic moments without the director's having force fed additional laughs to the viewer. If anything, comedic intent at the wrong time drains incidents of some of their dramatic value.The movie paints the Americans as greedy and unethical, maybe, but fundamentally good, pausing in their quest for pelf long enough to rescue damsels in distress, and some guys as well. And it criticizes American policy in the war's wake. George H. W. Bush encouraged Iraqi rebels and then he didn't help them. In light of current events, one is compelled to wonder whether it was such a bad idea to stay out of it. The movie criticizes American policy by seeming to argue only that we should have gone ahead, taken Bagdhad, booted Saddam out, and installed a democracy. In that order. At this point it's beginning to look less like "Kelly's Heroes" and a little like "Rambo." The story has one of our guys captured by Saddam's forces and tortured in an unspeakable way in an underground bunker. But then the plot deals us the joker we could never have expected was still in the deck. One of the Iraqi interrogators, in a polished performance combining malevolence with an impassive but genuine curiosity, quizzes the American prisoner concerning the morality of the war -- and the answers aren't easy to come up with. We can't respond with easily available schema about "you and your kind." The scene is presented without much subtlety. It's obviously posed. And yet it may be the most important and memorable in the film, lifting it out of the action/comedy genre that laid claim to American screens through much of the 1980s and 1990s. It may be obvious but it may be necessary too. Its very starkness may be required to penetrate the firewall we've constructed around our conception of the world as one of Biblical good and evil.Clooney's a good actor, along the lines of Clark Gable. Masculine enough not to be off-putting to men, while (I guess) handsome enough to appeal to women. Interesting enough to have a beer and an argument with.Recommended? Yes. It ought to satisfy anyone whose movie values encompass more than video games.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie infuriated me. There's nothing wrong with examining the ambiguities of war, but this movie is so slanted in favor of the Iraqis that I was expecting to see an executive producer credit for Saddam Hussein. The dialogue with Marky Mark(a good actor) and his interrogator is nauseating: 'We Americans made Michael Jackson the freak he is'-what crap--(by the way, I don't believe he started calling himself the `King of Pop' as he is referred to in this movie until he was promoting his album in late 1991). Typical anti-military Hollywood tripe-and I expected so much more. This movie is proof that some movies are lauded for their political agenda alone. Creative photography does not a great film make.

		<shortDescription>One of the best (anti) war films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three Kings is probably one of the most remarkable films of the year. Almost everything in this film is perfect and the way writer/director David O. Russell puts it all together it makes some of the other films of the past decade look bad, but thats good. It goes for a distinctive visual style that sets itself apart from films dealing with the subject (not the Persian Gulf War of course as so few films have been made about it), while still keeping a thrilling spirit to the process. It's funny, but also cutting deep into the sides of what makes people on the edge watching a film like this. The story is the first I've seen that involves the Persian Gulf war, but it actually doesn't surround itself around the war though. The main story comes around with four soldiers (George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube and Spike Jonze) who have a plan to find a whole lot of Gold Bullion in an Iraqui place of storage. The plan works out, but then their conscience comes in to play and they decide to help out a group of Iraqui refugees from Sadaam. This story, plus terrific acting from the cast, excellent photography (their is one point where the camera shows a bullet being pulled out of Mark Wahlberg's chest) and great scene work makes this a great film and one of the better made films of 1999.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...because the good parts of "Three Kings" are so good they keep you sitting through the, well, not the bad parts because there are no really bad parts, but the not-so-good parts. The best part is that from time to time we get to see the impact of the Gulf War on the people of Iraq, both the soldiers who were in it for revenge or just for the extra money (as is the case with so many American soldiers) and the people who were sadly led to believe that the US would support them if they rose up against Saddam. We also get a different, more intense (gut-level, if you will) feeling for the effects of gunshot wounds than we usually do in war movies. There are some bravura camera effects, and some wonderful absurd moments (mild spoiler ahead), topped by the scene where one American soldier captured by Saddam's troops is locked in a storeroom with a box of working cell phones, and starts using one to call his wife back in the USA. (Well, I laughed at that one, anyway.)Unfortunately, though the premise is fascinating, it's not worked out in an especially interesting way, apart from the touches mentioned above. The principal characters are hardly developed at all, and their dialogue is mainly functional. It's a credit to the professionalism and screen presence of George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and Nora Dunn, plus the comic timing (but not the Gomer Pyle accent) of Spike Jonze, that they're as watchable and appealing as they are.Similarly, the action sequences seemed pro forma to me, functioning primarily as raw material to excerpt for the previews. Not having seen his previous movies, I don't know how much experience director-writer David O. Russell has with action sequences, but I don't think his heart (or his gut, whatever) was in them as much as the graphically goopy bit illustrating the internal effects of a bullet wound.The really interesting characters are the Iraqis on both sides, especially their connections to the USA (one went to school in Bowling Green, another was trained by American officers during the Iran-Iraq war). I can imagine a much better movie centering on the Iraqi characters, cutting from time to time to the Americans with their plans for heisting Saddam's gold, and having these plot strands come together about midway through the picture. Such a movie might have topped most of the year-end critics' lists, instead of just placing in their top 10's.Of course, it might have also made less money than "Eyes Wide Shut", "Being John Malkovich", or even "Magnolia". As it is, few movies at this level of commerciality possess any convincing viewpoints outside of mainstream Middle American, and fewer dare to get under the skin of American viewers by criticizing American government policy. So give it its due: "Three Kings" isn't a great movie, but it is worth watching. If you don't care for any of the features I've outlined as positive, you probably won't enjoy it. If those features intrigue you, give "Three Kings" a shot. Who knows, you might actually like it better than I do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I were an American, I would doubtless have found this film a heart warming rendition of Gulf War drama/comedy. Outside of the States and it's own trumpet blowing, I can only look on in shocked amazement at the high score the film has achieved.The director seems to have no idea what film he is trying to make - a comedy, a drama, a political commentary or simply a farce. The director's attempts at humour seem brief and sugar coated. Certainly George Clooney handles his one dimensional character in a suitably plank like fashion. He should take notes from Mark Warhlberg and one day attempt to portray an emotion, rather than simply continuing his slick ER role on the big screen.The plot seemed filled with triviality when a moment of some gravitas was taking place. The story is simply not very plausible and the ending is so week I think only Sphere can match it for shere let down factor.If you can think for yourself, you'll fall asleep.

War movies typically exhibit the worst character in humans, generally it is the worst character in the "enemy" whereas the good guys--even if slightly flawed like this movie--are still saints compared to the bad guys. And the ones caught in between, the civilians, are just canon fodder. Either they are waiting to be slaughtered by their own or waiting to be saved by the magnanimous forces of good.Three Kings is not fully a war movie but it's darn close. I stopped the movie a third of the way through because I couldn't stomach it anymore and it's not like Ice Cube and Mark Wahlberg are worth watching.

		<shortDescription>A Beautiful story about Iraq (There People, War &amp; Us Military</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An astonishing movie that keeps you off-balance from the first scene. It starts out a wisecracking, cynical action lark about four Gulf War GIs who see a way to steal a fortune. It ends up a sadly resigned indictment of market-driven American foreign policy, wrapped in a sneakily moving story of personal sacrifice and small, compromised victories snatched from cruel anarchy. That actually counts for a happy ending without feeling like a commercial cop out, and the whole thing is often mordantly funny to boot ? what a balancing act! Sgt. Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg) and enlisted men Chief (Ice Cube) and Vig (Spike Jonze) come into possession of a map that shows the location of a bunker full of gold. With the help of thoroughly disaffected special-forces operative Major Archie Gates (George Clooney), they decide to make it their going-away present. "Saddam stole it from the sheiks. I have no problem stealing it from him," says Gates by way of clearing up the heist's ethical dimension, pointing out that amid the post-cease-fire pandemonium, no-one will notice or care what they're doing. Naturally, it doesn't go as easily as they anticipate. Surprisingly, they get sucked into helping a group of anti-Hussein Iraqi refugees who know their only hope of post-war survival lies in fleeing the country before the American military pulls out. The GIs are fairly decent guys, in a lazy kind of way, capable of pretending that wrong is right until somehow utter bloody chaos marches them, one baby step at a time, into doing the right thing at the moment when it stands to cost them the most. This is an amazing leap for writer-director David O. Russell, who graduates from sharply observed, small-scale stories about screwed-up families to a thought-provoking dispatch from a profoundly screwed-up world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching Three Kings, it soon becomes apparent that you aren't watching any normal war film. The main group of George Clooney, Ice Cube, Mark Walberg, and Spike Jonze work well together. That is not what makes the film interesting however. The camera work takes you into people's bodies and through flashbacks, slow motion and following the path of bullets. The film keeps a good pace, and does a good job of showing the plight of the average Iraqi citizen. This film also shows the change in men who are at first just out for themselves and then realizing that helping others is more important. Bottom Line: A fine film, the DVD has plenty of extras and if you haven't seen it yet then you must rent it and check it out.</fullReview>

Another reason I liked it was because it kept to a minimum the "Americans are the greatest" kind of message which usually goes with those kind of movies, even made the enemy (Iraqi torturer) somewhat sympathetic.This is the best movie so far about the Persian Gulf War. It is a blend of humor, drama, violence, with some awesome camera work and good music. The acting was also very good - Mark Wahlberg and Spike Jonze were the perfect American mercenaries. Ice Cube was also good and even the not stop nodding Clooney was convincing.I would recommend to all who want to see a serous and solidly build movie which while conveying its political message doesn't fail to provide a typical Hollywood entertainment. I will go as far as giving it 8.5 stars out of 10. It's a good movie.</fullReview>

I, like many before me who have critiqued this move on IMDB, would agree that this movie was extremely underrarted and overlooked. Now I'll grant that this movie came out the same year as movies like American Beauty, Fight Club, The Matrix, The Sixth Sense, Magnolia and an endless list of other excellent movies (at least, I can definitely vouch for the first three movies) but still, this movie was comparable to those flicks and deserved at least a few Oscar nominations. It also didn't help that it came out not to far after the like of the more overrated (though still very excellent) war-dramas, ie-Saving Private Ryan and Thin Red Line, but still this movie deserved much better marketing and better acclaim. *SPOILERS MAY OCCUR. JUST DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU!* To give a brief plot synopsis, the movie is set during March,1991. Of course the Gulf War has just officially ended. The United States has achieved it objective of liberating Kuwait from the control of Iraq, but has signed a cease-fire agreement with the latter, leaving the now liberated Kuwaitis to fend for themselves against Sadaam and his Republican Guard. The main characters of the movie are Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg in an excellent and sometimes heartfelt performance) who just recently became a father, Vig. Conrad, Troy's boisterous and somewhat gun-happy best friend (Spike Jonze, whose performance provides some of the more comical moments of the movie), the cautious and more reserved Chief Elgin (the surprisingly good Ice Cube) who initially can't stand Conrad, and the soon-to-retire Major Archie Gates (the very under-rated George Clooney). Our four heroes have stumbled upon a map that could lead to some bunkers full of Kuwaiti bullion (gold, essentially) stolen by Sadaam's soldiers. They subsequently decide to set off on this journey completely driven by their own self-serving interests and grandiose dreams of wealth and material indulgence. They finally get to the village where the gold is stored. They notice that the villagers are being tortured and starved by Sadaam's troops in a bid to force their allegiance. At first the four soldiers ignore the chaos and proceed with "necessity" as usual. "Necessity" suddenly changes when the four Americans witness a brutal murder by one of Sadaam's troops. The four decide to stay behind and help the villagers. What follows is a tale of transformation and sacrifice. Besides the excellent plot, one thing that I really liked about this movie was its skillful and unique (albeit, sometimes uneven) combination of all the action, drama, emotion and intense violence of an excellent war movie with the razor-sharp wit of a wickedly-funny dark comedy. This trait by itself catapults this movies far apart from most of the war movies that have come out recently. This, by itself, should have turned some heads at the Oscars. To add this, the visual techniques used in the movie were perfect (I especially loved visuals used to show what happens with a gunshot wound) and should have been nominated as well. The dialogue and the chemistry between the main charatcers was also played to perfection. Jaime Kennedy is perfect in a supporting role as the goofy and somewhat inept private Walter Wogaman who has to stall an over-ambitious reporter Adriana Cruz (Nora Dunn) from following the four soldiers Beside being an excellent action-comedy/war-drama, this movie was also a very brilliant satire. It had much to say about the selfishness of man, the pushiness of American media and the way we're seen by other countries. In one scene, we hear an Iraqi soldier use Michael Jackson as an example of how Americans make black people feel inferior and to wish that they were white. Even the main plot of the movie could suggest satire. We see these four American soldiers on this selfish quest for gold suddenly turned into a group of people fighting for a cause that is greater and more valuable than the riches that they seek. We also see the example of the reporter who is so driven by her desire to capture that great story that she would willingly risk her life for it. Now as to why the title of the movie is called Three Kings as opposed to Four, well, without giving much away, one of them does die at the end. Despite this tragic part of the movie and some other equal tragic moments, this movie is definitely worth your time and money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Three Kings" just didn't do it for me. Although I appreciate its intention of finding humour even in something as inherently gruesome as Gulf War, it was simply too unfocused. It's not like I wanted it to be an 'inspiring tale of the triumph of human spirit' or similar Hollywood schmaltz that wins the best picture Oscar almost every year, either, but something is definitely missing. Maybe I'm simply not into movies that call on you to watch the adventures of 4 shallow jackass-American Joe Sixpacks out on the desert and then suddenly slap you with a heartbreaking 'plight of the refugees' plot line. I'm sure any modern war contains equal parts of the former and the latter but I'm not convinced you can properly and satisfyingly deal with them both in the same movie. "Three Kings" sure couldn't.Many scenes were cute! I use this term rather than 'insightful'; who at this day and age doesn't know war reporters are shameless get-a-story-at-any-cost scavengers and many other 'insights' already seen in prior war movies. On a general level, "Three Kings" left me cold with constant switching between slapstick, political commentary, tear jerk moments... etc, etc. Kinda like they wanted to roll elements of "Schindler's List", "Platoon", "Apocalypse Now", "M*A*S*H".... all into one picture.</fullReview>

He wanted to get rid of Saddam Hussein but didn't want to use American troops to do it or help others to get rid of him. So we left in power until recently. This movie shows what a joke the Gulf War was and why we had to go back 12 years later to finish the job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting look at Gulf War, not much else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three Kings is one of the few war films out there that looks at both sides of the conflict. Possibly the only war film that's popular. However, this film sometimes gets too over- the- top. The acting is solid by George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg, but I felt that Ice Cube was just okay, he was a bit too focused on trying to make the audience see that rappers can act. Spike Jonze offers the comic moments in the film, but his stupid character doesn't really bring much to the story. The script by David O. Russell suffers badly from using about every cliche in the book of a war film. Examples are slow motion shots of gunfire, one of the character's deaths (I won't say anything), and also the villians appear too crazy. The direction by David O. Russell treats this film seriously, then not seriously so it really lacks focus. The photography isn't that good because even though there's the desert, it isn't used well visually enough. The main push of this film is showing both sides, but it still doesn't do it well enough to consider it a major plus. Solid film, a bit too cliche, but mostly solid. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Basically a contemporary derivative war flick, this high- and ham-handed film-student movie is barely worth the price of a rental. Anyone introduced to the film without knowing who created it would be completely underwhelmed by its bargain-basement production value, ludicrous plot, and heavy-handed imagery.What's most interesting about this movie are the type of critics it attracts. This is summed by brilliantly by film critic Chuck Rudolph:"I'd wager that these critics, who are often forced to endure hour after hour of mindless garbage film-making, are so desperate for something even a little different from the norm that they immediately flock to whatever looks good at the moment. This is how smart, scrupulous criticism gets lost: insight and taste are sacrificed in favor of desperate snap judgments failing to see through the haze of desperate filmmaking."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>more infantile plot twists than a movie needs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of the strangest plots I've ever seen. There were more infantile plot twists than any good movie needs. So many, in fact, I couldn't help but laugh at the scene transitions. The oddest thing about this movie was that half of the acting was pretty good, but the other half was absolute horrible. Take a wild guess at what part of the country the two dumbest soldiers are from? Their Southern accents might give that away. Yet another "bash the only non-pc group left". The overwhelming theme of the movie seemed to be `Killing, war, electrocution, breaking rules, losing your career, and violating peace-time treaties are all justified by the anticipation of lots of GOLD.' Huh??That aside, Clooney was pretty good and Ice Cube was an excellent match for his role. Mark Wahlberg is the most underrated actor today, mostly because the roles he ends up with (other than "The Sixth Sense") are so astonishingly stupid, you question whether he actually has an agent. His character in this has about as much brain power as my left foot, yet try to present him as being one of the more intelligent?DO NOT READ PAST HERE! PLOT GIVEAWAYS.For instance, he is taken prisoner by the Iraqis and thrown into a bunker that's filled with a ton of stolen merchandise. Surprise, surprise, there's a bag full of cell phones. What does he do? He presses "0" and asks for "Operation Desert Storm" and "The big army in the desert". Is this a cartoon? Of course, he throws it to the ground in frustration destroying it. Surprise, surprise, the very next phone he picks up works. "So he's about to call some number to get in touch with military officials and tell them where he is so they can rush in and rescue him, right?" is what you're thinking. No, he calls his WIFE somewhere in the U.S. and asks how the BABY is doing!! Holy cow.It gets better. Under shock-treatment torturous interrogation, the Iraqi goes into a long story about how he's so frustrated and angry at the Americans and the war because they destroyed his business, put his wife in a wheelchair, and killed his son. Ok, that's fair. I'd be angry too. What does Marky Mark do? He tells his interrogator his WIFE's name, his NEWBORN BABY's name, and all about how he FEELS not being able to see his family. Uh, what? I was expecting them to break into a verse of "Kum-bah-yah" next.The worst thing about the movie was the relationship between the American and Iraqi soldiers. They acted like they were opposing sides in the middle of a televised football game and they didn't want to appear too "mean" in front of the camera. Rarely did you get the feeling that these two groups were just on opposing sides in a deadly war.I cringe when I see movies like this that are so lacking in character, plot, and scenery that they have to fill every empty scene with ANYTHING politically correct. They touch it all here too: racism towards blacks and Arabs, sexism, equal opportunities for women, gun control, violence, freedom of speech, ethnic cleansing, the "War is bad" theme stolen from "The Thin Red Line", etc. They even throw in the Rodney King video for good measure. The only things you'll get from this movie: WHITE Americans are evil, Arabs are wonderful, and Southerners are stupid. Other than that, I question my own Southern stupidity for wasting $3 for this garbage on pay-per-view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They three kings of orient aren't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someone said that there are too many clever camera tricks. I couldn't agree less. When we get a CLEVER use of the camera - like the way it zips around to follow the chain of causation as one soldier after another breaks the cease fire - it comes as a relief after all the confused, arty rubbish that makes up nineteen twentieths of the film. The camerawork is TERRIBLE. I must say it was a good idea to give us that grainy, washed-out look, but that's like saying that it was a good idea to shoot in colour. Cinematography and editing are still surpassingly bad.There's a lot to be said for the script, and there's nothing wrong, as such, with mixing comedy, drama and political comment in this way. The trouble is that one third of the triad is missing. None of the comedy is funny. The opening half hour in particular is just one big hole: a hip, humourless nothing. Things pick up considerably during the genuinely interesting story that follows, and the film could actually have been good if it hadn't been so badly directed. A lot of the "emotional involvement", we feel, though, is no such thing. We see crude oil poured down a man's throat, and we see LOTS of disgusting shots of people's insides - the kind of cheap stuff that works directly on our stomachs, but bypasses our emotion altogether.I can see what some critics were thinking when they mistook this for a great film. A great film may even be buried here somewhere, underneath the rubble, or perhaps it's just the foundation of a great film: it's hard to tell. It's certainly not great as it stands.By the way, does anyone understand the title? Clearly it's a reference to the Christmas carol - only really popular in America - "We Three Kings of Orient Are". One of the main characters is even kind enough to sing the song for us. But this doesn't help much, since neither the lyrics nor (and I'm stretching here) the mood imparted by the tune, have anything to do with the events in the film.</fullReview>

The best thing about this film is it's intriguing camera work, but even that becomes annoying before long. There is so much possibility for an interesting commentary of the Gulf War, but the producers just do not take advantage of it. The one attempt at this is a tortured soul of an iraqi commander making some intelligent comments about the reason for the war, yet this is used for comic effect and passed off as the ramblings of a lunatic.

Maybe I'll forget to shave for a couple of days and see what happens. Anyway, if you can get past Clooney, there are some nice desert scenes in the movie, and... well, some graphic violence for the Doom set.

The scenes about all of the Nerf footballs, goofy conduct, and boredom are very true. The scenes of soldiers capturing the Iraqi prisoners were also true.That being said, this movie really suffered from a lack of a good plot. The end seemed as if the film makers were running out of film and had to do something. It was totally unrealistic! NEVER would soldiers give the body of one of their own to foreign nationals to bury in another country! They would have kept it for his family to bury honorably. The film makers also made the Army out to be the "bad guys" which happens far too often in modern films. What a shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With little REAL emotion or even very interesting lines, Three Kings basically hinges on it's graphic war scenes to pull the movie through. Originally touted as a comedy, after about half an hour, your smile fades and the jokes stop. It then focuses on the "story" for the rest of the time, abandoning whatever mood and atmosphere they had previously established. The thing about Three Kings is, there really is no story. Often contradicting and overly tripe, it treats the audience as children, not letting them have any opinions whatsoever. All we're left with is a visual style that we hope brings justice to the Gulf War. It has it's interesting parts, like a new cross-cutting way to show quick, rushed, battle scenes, and an interesting explanation of the bile buildup after one is shot. Three Kings is a stylish film, if not substance driven, and certainly not the best Gulf War movie. Too many are forgetting the four star masterpiece Courage Under Fire with Denzel Washington and Meg Ryan that was released in 1995. That does more justice to the Gulf War than Three Kings does. If you want to see a new breed of modern film making, check Three Kings out. But don't expect to see anything deep, and really don't expect a decent soundtrack.</fullReview>

I was not a fan of the films extremely high contrast look. Film should open well, but long term outlook is questionable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable, but a terrible movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no doubt you'll be put at ease and enjoy this film. However, you'll be put through every war and comedy cliche the filmmakers could think of. ER fans missing Doug Ross will get to see George Goony deal with some internal medicine, and Marky Mark haters get to see him stabbed, shot, and electrocuted (although none of these really have anything to do with the plot, so don't think I'm spoiling anything for you.)Essentially, this film relies on expletives and Ice Cube's rugged attitude to carry interest through the introduction and a shrouded climax. Truly, the only good thing about this film is Nora Dunn's portrayal of the whiny news reporter trying to get her elusive Emmy for Desert Storm coverage.If the next best comedy is sold out, fall back on THREE KINGS. But don't say I didn't warn you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three Kings is visually stunning. There is some truly great cinematography in it. Visuals are important, but filmmakers should remember why movies are made- to tell stories. Unfortunately this story flounders. Important plot elements are introduced then dropped without resolution, and trivial elements are given great rise just to get an artistic shot. Somewhere in the middle, they remember that they wanted to make a point about the Gulf War, and all wars in general, but by then it's too late.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just finished reading the script (first draft) for this on Drew's script-o-rama and - quite frankly - am amazed as to why this wasn't used. The script I just read earned the poor writer a humble "Story By" credit when it should have been earning him a brilliant career. Hell, the film I saw was pretty crap - no two ways about it: Clooney's as unconvincing as ever, Wahlberg's a whiney little hippy and the rapper's just another clichéd Ice T! Don't get me started on the actual script... Go to Drew's script-o-rama now and check out the original script: what you'll discover is a masterpiece well deserving of acclaim.I read the original as research for writing, what I learned was that producers are capable of screwing up things something chronic! I honestly can't fathom John Ridley's decision to not use his own work when he got a credit as "co-producer" for this film.I gave this film "5" before as it wasn't very good but didn't overly suck either; upon reading what I just have, I've lowered that score to a "3". Read the original and you'll likely agree with me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all the movie has some pretty good scenes, lots of wide angles and camera has a lot of movement all the time. The colors are a bit washed out and it suits well to the desert scenery. Acting is OK as well, although George Clooney is a bit too obnoxious in the beginning of the movie as obscure, strange character. I couldn't really get why he is stealing the gold. I thought this movie was really confusing from the beginning, since I didn't really know what to expect. It has lots of black humor which I personally couldn't really swallow. Especially, when someone get shot it was being made humorous in a way. Which is strange because the movie has a clear anti-war message. The tanker scene was great and surprising. Also from my point of view the marketing of the movie was quite failure since it was bit misleading.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsThis was one film which got better as it progressed,rather than one which starts with an intriguing premise,and then gradually deteriates into a boring mess,as is the case with so many films these days.To begin with,the charecters wer'nt very likeable,and the film was shot in an unfamiliar focus,which takes time to gradually build on you.Plus, I've never been a big fan of George Clooney,not as a person,as I caught a glimpse of him when he landed in by helicopter at the premiere of The Perfect Storm at my local UGC cinema,and he seemed very nice,but as a performer.But,gradually,all the charecters,even the most irritable one in the shape of a crazy Southern sharp shooter,become more involving and more intriguing as people.This film shows Ice Cube as so much more than some rap loving homeboy,which he usually seems to be cast as.The action heats up engrossingly towards the end as well,as we see a super sonic modern helicopter crash and explode,and a slow motion gunfight.This film depicts Hussein in what seems to be his sad but true modern light:a power crazed warlord who's even prepared to oppress his own people,let alone American troops,in order to enforce his diabolical ideas.His not far from being a modern day Hitler,unfortunately.***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't actually claim to have seen this movie as I was unable to force myself to finish watching. The movie was bad, the acting was worse, and the intelligence content the worst. Three Kings' story is a ripoff from Kelly Heroes, it's premises from Full Metal Jacket and it's characters from Disneys Donald Duck.What can one say about troops who watch a cow get blown by a mine three yards in front of them and calmly proceed to walk around the crater? How about a soldier shooting a surrendering enemy, in full view of his commanding officers, comrades and journalists? Can anyone say 'Court Martial'? Apparently Mr. Russell can't.Not only is the behavior of the characters that's a flaw. The totally lack of knowledge of military matters exhibited by the cast and crew is disturbing to say the least. The only thing more disturbing is the fact that a lot of people not only accept this glorified BS but also consider it to be one of the greatest war movies of all times. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David "O NO!" Russell: Director...Writer...Hack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who is this guy David O. Russell? Who is he to write and direct such a god-awful piece of trash?Well, looking back a ways, he seems to be a master of trash! It seems David O. Russell also wrote &amp; directed "Flirting with Disaster" (1996). This has got to be one of the most whiny and annoying films to date...on par, of course, with "Three Kings" (1999). He also wrote &amp; directed AND produced that delightful whimsical romp "Spanking the Monkey" (1994), which is about everyone's favourite subject: the Oedipus complex! That's right, he hates his father, and has unadulterated sex with his mommy. No, thank you Mr. Russell.Granted, i went into "Three Kings" not realising the baggage that this Writer/Director brought with him. Aside from the wretched plotline, and blathering dialogue, there are the pitied actors who had to be in this film. Mark "Marky-Mark" Wahlburg is a fine actor (see: "Boogie Nights"), and tries his best to wade through the drudgery and only remove his shirt a few brief times. Ice Cube (or is it Ice T? or is that Ice Cream?) is also a swell actor. But it's hard to strut your stuff, when you're cast as the "token-black-guy." And George Clooney is still scrambling for his "star-vehicle." Georgey doesn't realise, though, that his destiny as an actor lies as the doofy romantic leads, wooing opposite the likes of Michelle Pfeifer. His aching to be an action-star is painfully obvious, and always ceases to thrill. Hopefully, he'll realise that he's not meant for action films--sooner than Harrison Ford has (see: "Seven Days and Seven Nights").I could go on about the contrivances, and the dreaded comic-relief of the profanity-ridden reporter, or the supposed timeliness of this movie about a war-for-our-times. But it would all essentially be about the same theme: bad film.What's his name? David O. Russell? Stay away from this name; it does not bode well for whatever project he is involved with. I mean, come on...Mary Tyler Moore exposing herself?! (see: "Flirting With Disaster"). What's wrong with you Russell?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is all the fuss about? I heard this movie was "patriotic" and "innovative", etc. I went to see this movie against my will. I saw a preview and thought it looked stupid. I saw a trailer and thought it looked ludicrous and gratuitous. But my husband wanted to see it because he heard all kinds of raving reviews. Now I'm raving--mad. He wanted to leave halfway through the movie but I made him watch through to the end so we'd remember not to spend $17 without trusting our instincts again. And we squirmed in our seats. I had to laugh incredulously (when I wasn't groaning) at nearly every scene. The portrayal of the U.S. military was anything BUT patriotic. It made us look foolish. The opening scene was a huge frat party. Several of the soldiers we meet are dumber than dirt and trigger happy. Sad to see our military men portrayed as so incompetent. Scary! Characters were cardboard cut-out cliches, very flat and superficial. Writing was very amateurish, as if done by a teenage boy for a creative writing class where logic in the plot doesn't matter but machismo does. We meet Archie (Clooney) when he's banging a cute war correspondent in a raunchy, gratuitous sex scene. Of course, they're caught in the act and he gets reprimanded, while the nymphette gets into a catfight with an aging, self-conscious and perpetual Emmy losing reporter, Adriana. I hoped her cranky, one-dimensional character would get abducted by the Iraqis and tortured with Palmolive soap in the mouth, considering every other word out of her mouth was a variation of f***. So the flimsy plot progresses thus: several soldiers find a map tucked just so in the butt of an Iraqi prisoner (insert gratuitous butt humor here). Where were Beavis and Butthead during all this? Or actually, Cornholio? Anyway, Archie finds out about it and convinces the three incompetents that they can use the map to find a secret bunker where Saddam stashed gold bullion stolen from Kuwait. They could bring some back (and "quit their day jobs"). How is this supposed to work? How do four guys go AWOL armed with a few guns and a ceasefire agreement in hand into foreign- speaking enemy territory, breaking into guarded bunkers at gunpoint? Once they find the gold, if they can, how do they bring it back and cash it in without anyone knowing? What bank would give cash value for stolen foreign gold bullion? DOES THIS MAKE SENSE? So the treasure hunters manage to find the gold after schoolmaster Archie lets the boys shoot a few rounds for fun before they encounter a cow in the middle of the desert which is (gratuitously) blown up by a cluster bomb. How did that happen? They steal a truck to load ALL of the gold into. Then they argue about whether to take some refugees with them (since that wasn't the original mission) in a reluctant humanitarian effort to save the Iraqi citizens from the soldiers who try to quell their rebellion. Our golddigger/heroes encounter all kinds of dangerous mishaps with these refugees in tow. Everyone carries some heavy gold through the scorching desert as they try to escape without the vehicles (which got blown up/crashed, of course). One "hero" gets captured and tortured while forced to wear a fancy suit. He also managed to call his wife from a cell phone he found in a box of stolen goods. Clever. More mishaps occur and more refugees join the entourage as this expedition goes haywire and beyond ridiculous. A portrait of Saddam is seen wearing the cap and gown of a college graduate, further confusing the tone of the film. Are we supposed to feel empathy for the slaughtered Iraqis as we see them gunned down by their own army or are we supposed to laugh at the silly tongue- in-cheek portrait of Saddam? And how come Archie thinks he can spend the gold when it belongs to Kuwait? Was the purchase of a fleet of luxury vehicles to fight Saddam's army just an opportunity for product placement by Infiniti, Mercedes-Benz, Lexus, etc.? Or was this an opportunity for a clever ruse just barely pulled off in the script? Several okay ideas were (predictably) used such as nerf football bombs, and some scenes were creatively shot with well-composed stills and grainy "documentary" style camera footage, though this was more effectively used in Saving Private Ryan, especially considering the camera technologies relative to the Gulf War and WWII decades. Other scenes, while meant to be creative and clever, were just plain cartoonish and gross, like the body "x-rays" showing what happens when someone is hit by a bullet. (Minor spoiler:) And how does one survive a gunshot wound to the lung if a clavicle wound can be fatal? Nothing makes sense. I know I'm supposed to appreciate the change of heart and self-realization the pseudoheroes experience but it doesn't work. If the film was intended to show the consequences of a country at war with itself and to show the dire situation of an oppressed and tyrannized people, there's a better way to do it which would elicit more compassion than to undermine their tragic situation with slapstick nonsense and gratuitous camera tricks. War movie humor may work in Life is Beautiful in its heartbreaking attempt to save a little boy from the horrors of a concentration camp,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie wondering if it could live up to the critics' hype as the best of the year. Nope. Sorry, American Beauty already has that distinction, and Three Kings is not even a close runner-up.I found it entertaining at least, but several of my friends were bored. The attempts at comedy were pathetic, and there were a lot of attempts. I think I chuckled a few times maybe. The acting performances by Clooney, Wahlberg and Ice Cube were solid, but the supporting cast left a lot to be desired.The film was basically an action movie that tried to be preachy. It tried to make a poignant statement about the U.S. abandonment of the Iraqi citizens. Tell me something I didn't know. I wasn't shocked at all by the "scathing political indictment." After all, the U.S. shafted the Kurds even worse.The main problem with the movie was the lack of focus, both in plot and direction. Russel does some cool things with the camera (especially the inside shots of bullet wounds) but it seems as if he tries to put every cool idea he has ever had into one movie. Sometimes there are flashbacks. Sometimes we see a person's thoughts. Sometimes there a lot of slow-motion close-ups. Other times we get grainy, choppy, Pvt. Ryan-esque action shots. The result is a jumble of techniques. The plot suffered because it couldn't decide to be funny or serious. In one scene, we see a soldier attempting to be funny while sitting in his underwear. Less than thirty seconds later, we see another soldier being tortured in what is supposed to be an emotional scene. The whole movie was up and down like that.It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't good either. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Ten Worst of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie got 3 &amp; a half stars &amp; a good review in the paper today so I stopped by to see it after work. Also, I had thought Mark Wahlberg was good in The Corruptor &amp; I looked forward to seeing him in this. But I have to say that this film was a terrible disappointment. The early part of the film is weak but at least it moves along fairly nicely. But once the "subplot" about saving Iraqi refugees begins, the movie crashes &amp; burns badly. I think this film was supposed to have combined action with satire, but what we get instead is a tendentious political screed from the director, who apparently opposed the Gulf War and who is willing to use whatever propaganda weapon at his disposal to get us to agree with him (at the expense of entertaining us). Unfortunately for his purpose, he is so incapable at this task that the movie is almost laughably bad. The film tries to wring your emotions but it is so inept that it never even manages to rise to the level of being called "manipulative". It is incapable of manipulating anything. One of the worst scenes involves an attempt to equate Mark Wahlberg's character with an Iraqi who is torturing him and is both painfully obvious in its intent &amp; painfully stupid in its execution. In fact the entire film is painful. And stupid. And obvious. Spare yourself the money &amp; go see something else. This one has already made my "Ten Worst" list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four soldiers go AWOL to steal gold after the first Gulf War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>May contain spoilers!!! Sorry to break up the chorus of rave reviews.Three Kings has terrific production values (photography, cinematography, effects), and I am a Clooney fan. The Arab characters also made sense (reasonably fair portrayal rather than stick figures), although more generous subtitles would probably be nice for non-Arabic speaking audiences. And the self-promoting TV journalists, although caricatures, were not far off the mark.But it flunks too many believability tests (kind of like the TV show Alias). Majors do not even socialize with non-coms, and are unlikely to go off on a criminal venture together before discharge, because of issues of trust. Four (non-Arabic speaking) guys are just going to wander through post-war southern Iraq? They would be quickly killed by the first combatants they met on either side, and the bodies would not even be recovered. End of story.The three lead characters, hardened soldiers turned mercenaries at the beginning, are going to develop hearts along the way? I don't think so. Anyone willing to risk their life or a trip to military prison for just money is not likely to know what compassion is. Spike Jonze as Troy's puppy dog, Conrad was the most believable.The "action scene" in the minefield while tear gas explodes overhead was ridiculous. Chasing a fast moving vehicle with a mortar is almost impossible. Airbursting teargas that high would just dissipate it. Mines are rarely that obvious unless deployed by artillery or air (only done in the face of a mechanized advance); folks on foot do not have to worry about AT mines, since people are neither magnetic nor do they weigh a ton. And Iraq's Army would be unlikely to mine its own road. Nor is anyone going to jump out of a moving Humvee just before it hits. The front of the Humvee would be incinerated, but not flip through the air. And the flying machine gun just happens to hit the van -- get real. Very Hollywood. I was waiting for Rambo in MOPP 4 gear to swing in on a vine with an M60 trailing a loose belt of ammo.I switched off halfway through. The melodrama of Troy imagining his wife and child being blown up when facing the interrogator (portrayed realistically, but Troy by training should *assume* he is lying about his loss of family, especially after electrocuting him) was just too much. Incidentally, Troy (not exactly Delta Force) would have wet or soiled his pants after a jolt like that.I give it 5 out of 10. Has some excellent points, but is irredeemably flawed as a package.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Film During One of the Worst Years for the Cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Three Kings" was the best film of 1999, one of the weakest years for movies ever. The film follows four Desert Storm troops (George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube and Spike Jonze) as they set out immediately following the end of the war to find millions of dollars worth of gold bars in Kuwait. However, the journey takes a strange turn when they learn that the U.S. government will not assist poor Iraqi civilians from Sadaam Husein's wrath. What follows is an unconventional movie about life, love, sacrifice and the pains associated with war. Co-writer, director David O. Russell creates a film about war that caters to so many audiences. "Three Kings" is a war film that is for the Generation X and Y groups. The film engrosses with clever dialogue, lots of action and a unique brand of comedy and sucks its viewers in and will not let them go. The messages are passed on in a subtle way that will make you think and reflect on a part of contemporary history that many do not give a second thought to. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From people I've heard from, this is the sort of movie that a person either really loves or really doesn't. Count me among the latter group!I never really got a strong sense of where this movie wanted to go. Set during the Gulf war against Iraq, it's the story of a plot by three US soldiers to steal Kuwaiti gold bullion that had first been stolen by the Iraqis after the invasion. Frankly, I found this to be a rather silly story line. But the movie then takes twists and turns and these three (George Clooney, Ice Cube and Mark Wahlberg) then somehow get transformed into heroes trying to help out a group of refugees trying to escape the country.I personally thought the three leads struggled mightily with their roles and never quite got a true hold on any of the characters. I also never really understood the need to show graphic details of the inner workings of the human body at various times of trauma (found these shots, in fact, to be unnecessary diversions that added nothing to the story). Generally speaking, I just didn't enjoy watching this movie. Obviously many do (its rating is 7.6 right now) but count me out.I rated it as a 2/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacking moral &amp; political depth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*spoilers* Although the advertising campaign made it seem like just another action movie, I trusted the positive reviews that it was something much deeper. I was disappointed to learn that it really was the superficial flick that was advertised.At the end of the Gulf War, four hyped-up Ugly Americans pursue a get-rich-quick scheme to plunder Saddam Hussein's own plunder. Along the way they realize the plight of a village of persecuted Iraqis and help them to seek refuge from the Hussein regime, giving up much of the gold in the process. This plotline has caused some to celebrate it as a moral, humanitarian message, but this message unfortunately is superficial. Even though the soldiers change their actions, one doesn't seen a significant, moral transformation within them. There aren't deep connections developed between the GIs and the refugees. The "camel jockey" stereotypes persist among the protagonists even after the tone of the film changes.A note about the film's politics: it is more mainstream than folks on either side of the political spectrum seems to portray it. It is not rabidly unpatriotic as some on the Right suggest. Although it does not portray the GIs as John Wayne or Dudley Do-Right types, all the film's Americans are heroes. Nor does it seem to me to be the anti-war flick, that some on the Left say it is. The film is driven by a sense that the Hussein regime is brutal, immoral, and should be driven out of power. Rather than repudiating the war, it implies that the US should have broadened its intervention in the region.I give the film kudos for treading new ground in its subject matter. Unfortunately, it deals with its subject matter on a superficial matter. It's flawed as an action film as well because of its uncharismatic heroes and what seemed like a major continuity gaffe at one point (I may have just been confused, it seemed that the film got some location mixed up).I gave this film a 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another war movie for yet another war.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a painful film to watch, both for its flaws and virtues. George Clooney gives a lackluster performance, and fails to help us see why his character perseveres as the plot complicates. Ice Cube shows great promise but his potential is wasted in this film. Likewise for Nora Dunn and most other supporting players. I winced several times, and not at the bloodshed, but how this story was told.The sound track is incredible. I'll give it that much. A veritable cornucopia of fun music from the latter half of the twentieth century. Quite a contrast to the remarkable UNfun of the movie itself.The tale is based at least loosely on eyewitness accounts of events that took place at the end of the Persian Gulf "war." It sheds crocodile tears to the end of noble chivalry, revealing the truth of why man fights man in these dulled and amoral times. However, it tells us nothing we didn't already know. The reasons to take arms are not for justice, but for material wealth. This is repeatedly slapped in our faces as if to convert us. The priest is preaching to the choir. Repeatedly the characters question why they were even fighting this war. They were in the thick of it and yet never understand why. We know why. We know the Persian Gulf incident was fought over crude oil and gold bullion.The tale also attempts to offer hope that despite mankind's unquenchable thirst for wealth and control of others, deep down we all want to be kinder and gentler to one another. However, the same preacher voice doesn't sell this convincingly, and the end result is a hollow shell of a film that does not captivate. Instead it just leaves one sick in the stomach at the very thought of one's own humanity.Are we all like this? Are we all this shortsighted, vain and greedy? Surely each one who reads these words thinks "not I" but to judge the characters in this film for their actions, both noble and savage, we judge ourselves. Would we do the same if the score of twenty three million American dollars worth of Kuwaiti gold were within our grasp? What price tag do we each place upon the loss of life? The loss of innocence? The loss of sanity?The dialogue is melodramatic when it should have been simple, and at other times simply hollow. The poetry is sporadic and not believable, and when more poetic words would have been preferred, we get rot gut. The plot is based on real events, but it is still a hard hook to swallow, and pulls at the insides. The suspension of disbelief should not be necessary for a story that is this true to life.The first actual gunfight is edited in such a way as to give each bullet a pertinence equal to a presidential address. The camera becomes the bullet for practically every blow to the head. The eye candy is tart and sour. It becomes less like a war movie and more like a Punch and Judy puppet show. The message of needless bloodshed is wrapped around us like a head lock and is suffocating. Again, we KNOW. It's pointless. Why drive the point home like a stake in a vampire's heart? The bloodshed is simultaneously necessary for realism's sake, and more irrelevant than the video game Quake Arena Three. The discoloration and affectation of some scenes is a noble attempt to stylize for visual interest, but it falls short and is superfluous. The characterizations are weak and diluted. Needless to say I was sadly disappointed in Three Kings.The film does attempt to answer the questions: Why must man kill his fellow man? Why do we keep having pointless wars? The answer is a simple and pathetic one. Why, for sand of course! For baubles like cell phones and expensive cars, just to toss them aside or blow them away at the next opportunity. We fight for fear of powerful leaders who command us to hate one another and hoard the wealth so that we must remain subservient. We kill one another not only because we can, and because it is easier to kill disagreement with small metallic pebbles blasted at great speeds with modern technology, than it is to realize that every man woman and child on this planet has the inalienable right to necessities, and dare I say even comforts, despite their disagreements of politics, religion and sociality.The question this production should have asked instead was this: Why do we keep making pointless war movies about pointless wars? I think the answer to that question is equally unsatisfying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So called war film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading some of the raving reviews here at IMDB I expected much of this movie, but I stopped watching after an hour or so. This movie was even worse than I thought when saw the first preview shots of it and learned that George Clooney will be starring it. I was ready to forgive that to the director of this Pulp Fiction-meets-Apocalypse Now! fruit cocktail, but because there's Clooney the film HAD to be stupid "scroundel-war-comedy". Wahlberg and Ice Cube are OK but cant save the film, since the concept is so badly messed up. The movie tries to please MTV generation, offering cool camera views, cool violence and cool, washed out film color. It also tries to please more "thinking" crowd with semi-critical scenes of the "most televised war in history" with television crew running around. This films tries to be comedy (when an iraqi POW has a map hidden in his a**) and serious war film (when iraqi soldier shoots a kurd mother in the head in cold blood and her daughter runs crying to her bleeding corpse). Needless to say, the "battle" scenes are also totally unrealistic so there's no catch for war movie fans either.In all, this film should have been never made. It's stupid, revolting and waste of money &amp; time. Additionally, it's a waste of good subject (The Gulf War).</fullReview>

I almost fell asleep through this movie. There was really nothing great about this movie. The acting was average at best. The plot and dialogue were weak. The characters in this movie had no identities and were pretty much dull. It was almost like watching a 2 hour episode of "The A Team". Wasn't Mr. T available for this movie? He might have actually made this movie more exciting. This definitely wasn't one of George Clooney's best movies. If you want to see a good George Clooney movie, go rent "Out Of Sight". It combines a good premise with superb acting, snappy dialogue, and well developed characters. How in the world it failed to crack the top 250 while "Three Kings" was #166 is beyond me.</fullReview>

If you aren't three steps ahead of these three clowns, you should join the circus.

Well, it wasn't horrible but I don't think we want to call it good. The movie was full of weak acting and two dimensional characters that were squished in and around a series of scenes that tried hard to be fresh and unique, but failed miserably. The slow-motion sequences were especially hard to sit through. Overall, Three Kings was an annoying film that was barely watchable.

		<fullReview>THREE KINGS (1999) **Starring: George Clooney, Ice Cube, Mark Wahlberg, Spike Jonze, Cliff Curtis, Nora Dunn and Judy Greer Written and directed by David O. Russell. Running time: 115 minutes. Rated R (for strong graphic violence, a scene of sexuality, and for strong language)By Blake French:"Three Kings" is a good example of a bad war flick. It is getting so common to see great war movies these days, simply because their subject is based on important eventsl. Therefore good directors and experienced filmmakers are most frequently involved with these productions. War movies, such as "Saving Private Ryan" and "The Thin Red Line," are always events for appreciative audiences. As "Three Kings" explains to us, however, it is possible to create a poorly crafted film of its genre.It's never a good signal when a movie's opening sequence features a bunch of young army men partying like wild animals. "Three Kings" contains character descriptions that consist of captions being typed up on the screen. The story takes place directly after the Gulf War. Four military figures, including soon to retire Archie Gates (George Clooney), young newlywed Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlburg), a Troy Barlow wannabe, and an African American religious man named Chief Elgin. All these folks work up a secret plan to travel on a private, illegal mission to a doomed Iraqian town to rob thief Sadaam Hussein of millions in pure gold.While the film opens as a tale about the consequences of heartless greed, it soon turns into a story about the four money hungry Americans desperately attempting to cross dozens of endangered Iraqi pedestrians over the border for safety from the murdering solders.Unfortunately, by the time the film develops values for the characters, it is already too late. Due to the humorously poor development in the opening, and the foul-mouthed, ignorant attitude of our four kings, we never really care about anyone in this movie. The audience certainly doesn't think highly of the George Clooney character. We first view him on screen as he is having premarital sex in an army post with a young blonde television reporter.Another problem with the characters is the script's lack of interesting intent and energy propelling their actions. We first arrive at the conclusion that the characterswant money--but that goes no where. These are characters who we mostly despise and are unconvincing. We receive profane rapper Ice Cube as a religious man--yeah right? That is as bad as having LL Cool J as someone named Preacher in "Deep Blue Sea" and Eddie Murphy as a Holy Man in the movie of the same name.There is a torture sequence featuring Mark Wahlburg in an electrical chair. That doesn't have any impact either, however, because we know such little about his character. We receive strained chinches about his newborn baby and lovely wife at home in peaceful Michigan. But that is so contrived it's almost funny.This is not to state the actors do not fit their roles, because everyone does a good job at the portrayal of their characters. George Clooney is good in his role, performing with dramatic intensity and some emotion. Ice Cube is also quite believable, but seems a bit underplayed by the other actors. Mark Wahlberg is his usual, ignorant self here, once again proving to us that he can't star in a movie without having a scene of two where he takes his shirt off. This type of role is becoming so conventional for him, its almost a shame that he is most likely confusing acting for modeling."Three Kings" focuses on being hip and having a unique style instead of nurturing subplots, writing good dialogue, and forming descriptive characters. The style is gritty, fast paced and chopped up. Even the soundtrack is ridiculously immature. A particular gun battle scene shows my theory perfectly. It is presented in extreme slow motion as we hear the bullets leave their gun with a loud whoosh then hit the characters in dead science. This sequence tries so hard to be different from other "better" war scenes, it actually wreaks of desperation.Another problem with the style in "Three Kings" is the fact that it tries to be so hip and action packed, it ends up lacking an educational stand on its subject. This film does a poor job of explaining to us the informational nuggets detailing the Gulf War. At the end of this movie, based on what the film said, I still had no idea of what the war was about. It is so fast and fragmented, only at mid point does the film slow down and actually allow the audience to feel the emotional depth present. Its not that I have anything against war movies in general, but "Three Kings" just doesn't work.Brought to you by Warner Bros.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why is this called the THREE kings? FOUR insensitive and greedy soldiers,led by a disgruntled Special Forces officer, break the peace agreement and ceasefire after Desert Storm to steal Saddam's plundered gold for themselves. They blunder about, causing many innocent people to be killed, including one mother....right in front of her young child and husband. After causing a lot of unnecessary death and mayhem, their testosterone poisoned leader, George Clooney, changes the plan to returning part of the gold to Kuwait and escorts some refugees to safety. Are we supposed to think they are heroes? If it weren't for all the blood and brutality, they were more like The 3 Stooges Meet Gomer Pyle than 3 Kings...except Gomer Pyle had integrity. Pretty bad...I gave it a rating of 3. The only reason I didn't rate lower is that there was some interesting and creative cinematography.</fullReview>

Those films were sides-splittingly funny, while showing us something meaningful about ourselves. This film, while promising to do the same, fails quite miserably. It is almost as if this movie was the worst possible combination of two films the director had in mind. One a touching war drama, the other a darkly comic view of war. Together, it is a jumbled mess that left me and others wishing it would end quickly.</fullReview>

Yes, somebody could tell me that this is black comedy, but only in some parts, the rest is just a drama, and this combination of drama and black comedy is not even interesting.It's a shame because the movie theme is interesting and very critic, but the fact that their makers were trying to cheat on the audience by selling us a comedy giving a tragedy is what really ruins this movie, I' m disappointed because when I saw it i was expecting a funny movie, so if the director or George Clooney or whoever is responsible I would like to take me my money back and see a new trailer, only then I will forget about the disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just came back home from the movie theater where I watched Three Kings and I cannot believe that I had to pay money to see such a bad movie. I want my money back. That was the worst movie I have ever seen. If you have not seen it yet don't go!!!!!! PLEASE!!!!! It is not worth the money. And I can't believe that such a great actor like George Clooney took part in such a piece of ... . (Please excuse my language but in this case I have to use such language because there is no other way to describe this horrible movie) I think this movie should be banned from the screen to protect innocent people who think they are going to see a good movie. They should not have to listen to those horrible lines that they used in this ... movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was horrible! Saving Private Ryan and Three Stooges simply don't mix. This movie includes drastic shifts in mood, violence that is not called for, and blatant brutality that totally removes the viewer from the story line.Example: An Iraqi guy has a US army guy tied down in a dark basement of a bunker and is torturing him with electricity and pouring motor oil down his throat, then the Iraqi asks "How would you like it if your daughter was taken like my son was." Then it changes to a shot of his daughter in a crib as a huge explosion hits the nursery, blowing her to bits. This is totally unexpected and shatters the whole dank dungeon feel that they had going. Not to mention being really gruesome.Don't even get me started on the whole bullet through the organ scene with the "bacteria filled bile filling the hole". How necessary was that?!Bottom line...too much brutality that took away from the overall feel of the movie. Take it out (or just place it more appropriately) and you have yourself an excellent war flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>According to this movie, here's what I learned: 1) The U.S. is inherently evil and Saddam Hussein and his raping, pillaging, and torturing Iraqi soldiers are just misunderstood; 2) It's all about the oil, and has nothing to do with the fact that Saddam wanted Kuwait; 3) American soldiers are cowardly back-shooters who shoots unarmed people because they wanna get a picture to show the folks back home; 4) American soldiers will throw away their career and life at the drop of a hat if it means they can make a few easy bucks; 5) No one despises America more than Hollywood.'Nuff said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film made me nausious. It is the tale of American ignorance and greed at its most disgusting. Against a backdrop of stereotyped Arabia and Arabs, pathetic attempts are made at humour (in the style of Kelly's Heroes) and action. Both fail and the ignorance powering this failiure is enough to make you weep. What a sick nation it is that produces this garbage as entertainment. The 'message' is morally disfigured, the 'action' is voyourism at its worst, the 'acting' gives cardboard a bad name and the script was written by one of those infamous monkeys and their typewriters. The makers of the non-sense should be ashamed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like gratuitous violence (heads flying, blood spurting); think Arabs are either cute or violent; think Americans are always stronger, cleverer, and braver than Arabs; and appreciate unbelievable sentimental tripe, then Three Kings is for you. The movie is a throwback to the 1940s or earlier when Hollywood routinely portrayed people from other cultures in patronizing ways. Plus, the movie is really ugly--the lighting is flat and the imagery is more colorless than necessary. All the characters are cartoonish--the fearless leader, the hick with a heart of gold, and so on. If you used to watch the TV show Combat, you'll like Three Kings. Otherwise, avoid it.</fullReview>

Have we become so desentized that killing can be funny and chemical agents just tickle us to death? Or, when a cow is blown up for pleasure do we giggle with mirth with no respect for our fellow creatures, since they didn't shoot first? (And probably should.)

		<shortDescription>Dumb Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a good enough movie until the awful ending. Writer/director Russell wants to give us a movie about the Gulf War from the perspective of the Iraqis. True to many beliefs of the Hollywood elite, Russell doesn't think we should be there, and believes Americans are actually the problem, not the answer, to the troubles of the Middle East. Okay, I can dig it. I'm always up for a "This is how they see it" movies. But then after making us try to symphatize with the Iraqi civilians caught in the middle and even giving his Iraqi soldiers (one of which is about to torture and poor oil down Mark Wahlber's throat) a nice little 5 minutes speech about the evils of the American campaign, Russell blows it all by giving us a standard cliche ending that Hollywood is so good at. Nice enough premise, funky execution, but fails when it tries to be "meaningful." I have to admit, seeing Spike Jonze run around playing a crazy redneck was hilarious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but heavens, not THAT good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Certainly not a boring movie, and the movie is to be praised for dealing with issues not usually found in war movies, and examining the Gulf War closely.I did have some problems, though. While the acting was good, I just didn't feel anything for the characters, except mild annoyance. I liked that the characters weren't totally likable, but I just didn't feel anything strong about them, except for that mild annoyance.The cinematography is annoying as well. I don't know what they call that technique that makes everything look pale (seen in many music videos), but it doesn't work on the big screen. It's distracting, especially when the movie suddenly changes to a more conventional cinematography.And though I liked that the movie examined the war closely, it came at the cost of characters and several situation that seemed to SCREAM "Message!" or "History lesson here!"Certainly entertaining enough as a rental or on TV/cable, certainly. But one of the best of the year? No way!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like most movies that I see but this was one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. I had a chance to preview the movie at the college down here and my only advice is DON'T waste your money on this film. I like Mark Wahlberg as an actor and in this movie his acting was about as good as he was in the movie "The Big Hit." As for the rest of the actors, well, try again. The movies plot was kind of shaky and the accents the the "iraqi's" had was very hard to understand. The movie lags a lot in most parts and at points make no to little sense at all. Overall. I would give it 1 1/2 stars and I give it that much for the story about the freedom of the refugees.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another 'anti-war' war movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched Three kings again and decided that I'd give my 2 cents despite the film being a decade old and despite America having had another illegal and brutal war with Iraq. So we have three reservists sent on tour of duty to Iraq, they find the place not exactly the walkover they were told it would be but soon get wind of a stash of Kuwaiti gold bullion and decide to steal it. Along the way the trio have a change of heart and set about helping a bunch of Iraqi refugees and slay lots of 'bad guys' while doing it. The film is set on the backdrop of Operation Desert Storm. It manages to entertain as well as evoke empathy for its many characters, which range from a gun toting major played by Clooney and a young officer of the Iraqi republican Guard who has lost his family to Uncle Sam's bombs. While the film does try and raise several important issues, it ends up trivializing Iraqi and Arab suffering by showing them either as victims who need to be helped and guided or self-loathing barbarians who would pimp out or kill their own to stay in their masters good books. The central question, as to what US and co. was (and is) doing in Iraq in the first place is never really answered. The excuse given is the invasion of Kuwait; But, the fact that Kuwait was created out of Iraq by the British and is America's cut price oil barrel today, is mostly forgotten. The message of this film should not have been "lets help out the world, coz we are no 1. but learn from our mistakes" the message should have been "the world does not need Americas help, lets not pretend to be the saviours when we are nothing but a bunch of greedy mass murderers who have destroyed more countries, civilizations and murdered more innocent children than any other empire before us period!" Cinema is a powerful medium and the time has come for filmmakers to stop make ambiguous, tit-for-tat war films, and start taking sides clearly sending out the right signals. Lets stop glorifying and justifying war. A war fought against an opponent who has never ever threatened us and possesses not 1% of our military capability is not a war at all, it is Neo-Con Darwinian extermination at its finest. Lets just stop this hypocrisy...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Enjoyable for Supporters of the U.S. Military</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are more courts martial in the first 15 minutes of this film than the whole Desert Storm war. It is unfortunate that this depiction of military behavior will be believed by the ignorant. George Clooney plays a Special Forces major who, in apparent disregard of losing his hard-won rank and spending the rest of his days in Leavenworth, decides to pursue a little war profiteering. He is too old to play his character and the George Michael look is inappropriate for the role. Mark Wahlberg and Ice T become embroiled in his quest before they can lawfully turn over a map found secreted on an Iraqi who surrendered to the U.S. The whole plot depicts serious and repeated illegal behavior that is not even close to being entertainingly cute. In fact, the filmmakers seem to have gone out of their way to make the violence cavalier and the stupidity acute. There's not much conflict or plot twist: 3 soldiers could go AWOL, create havoc in towns where people need rescue and gallivant off to enrich themselves. Then, suddenly and with no explanation, the same characters become worried about some abstruse concept in the peace accord that you are not allowed to return fire after the enemy has shot one of your team members. They try to work in a noble angle at the end. It just doesn't make amends for the rest of the film. The Iraqis aren't portrayed in any kind of believable or favorable way either. Despite the pure stupidity of the plot, Ice T is excellent and Marky Whalberg starts to show promise. Avoid seeing this violent, pointless film. It's not cute, or funny, or cool.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would have been excellent had they left out the left-wing nonsense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No doubt this was a good film in many ways. It was a dark comedy, a drama, and had loads of action. But the horribly overt attempt to make Bush Sr. out as a bad guy was just stupid and so obvious that you would have to be dense to miss it. George Clooney (noted left-wing looney) kept raving on and on about how George Bush told the Iraqi's to rise up and fight Saddam. While that was true to a degree, the Iraqi's did not rise up in a great enough number to overthrow Saddam. As we came to learn in the second gulf war, the Sunni hold the power and even with our enormous forces in Iraq, we are still struggling to set the Iraqi's free on top of their own destiny without Saddam. So how could Clooney's character think that whatever minor support the U.S. suggested to the Iraqi's could have done any good? It couldn't have but the producers of this film wanted to attack Bush and this was the way they did it. In retrospect, Bush looks good and the producers look bad.Anyway, I know I got off track but it was a good film, minus the political lies.</fullReview>

Although I do like George Cloney, but I guess he had a miss hit here (kind of like ocean's twelve!).The movie Stereotypes Arab's, and showing American soldiers as if they are more caring about Iraqi's than Iraqi's themselves. And we all know how true that is....not. When compared with the reality of what's going on in Iraq right now, you just laugh at it. Not that its funny, as its tragically ironic. Very few redeeming points in some of the conversations between Iraqi civilians and the American soldiers. However, not enough to pull the movie out of the hole it should be buried in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's funny because in all of this kinds of bad war films, Americans soldiers look very brave. Educated people know that Americans soldiers are really cowards, and Arabs soldiers, or Asian, are amazingly braves,they barely care about their lives. Even when they try to make it OK, they don't get it. They are unaware people. But I guess to make something better is impossible taking for granted their big lack of information. Real freedom only lives in Europe, where we think that the most important requirement for a good society starts for the good education and the free access to the contrasted information.

		<fullReview>This movie is ridiculous. The authors can't find enough bad things to blame on America without having to create them. There are way too many errors in this film to point them all out; following are just a few on the most egregious.The Iraqi whose child has been "slaughtered" by American bombs was supposed to have been trained by Americans during the Iran-Iraq war. He's a "little" too young for that to be the case, not to mention Americans NEVER trainined Iraqi's during the Iran-Iraq war.The Iraqi's had American weapons. Does the author think that people are that stupid? The weapons in the Iraqi arsenal came from the usual suspects - Russia, China, France, etc. They have AK's, Soviet era tanks, etc.The war was for oil. Riiiight. Why do all left-leaning Hollywood types want us to believe that? America did not take the oil fields.But it's not just the politics of this movie that are bad, there are many other simply ridiculous aspects of this movie that make it unwatchable. The characters are VERY stereotypical and predictable. You know what's going to happen well before it does - what a waste of time and effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In their primary pursuit of Saddam's gold bunker, Clooney and his 3 stooges enter an Iraqi Shiite town boldly pointing their guns in the faces of its inhabitants... Now I don't mean to be disrespectful, or to undermine the might &amp; bravery of the reserve American soldier, but it would've been much more convincing if those 4 soldiers were high that morning.my Iraqi friends who fled Baghdad recently tell me that American troops wouldn't dare break into a suspect's home unless they were in a pack of 100 GI's armed to the teeth...So unless that scene was intended to be part of the comedy, I say give us a fudging break!The rest of the movie doesn't go far from that impressive action scene.By the way... Just for the record, another hilarious aspect of this movie: It's how it portrayed Iraqi soldiers as mushy pussies who are waiting to get bitch-slapped! When the truth is, any average Iraqi soldier would beat the living crap out of any average American soldier any given day, unless of course the American hero is hiding inside a metal castle! Or you think those American soldiers falling everyday in Iraq are victims of sunstrokes?!Oh, and another scene I just remembered: When they find the gold, they just pick it up and leave while the guarding Iraqi soldiers remain watching TV and listening to western music?!!! Now putting aside politics, nationalism, gallantry and all that macho-stuff, if I personally had that much gold in my possession, I would annihilate America itself to keep that fortune for myself, out of pure human greed! Not just stand there helplessly as I watch 4 homo clowns taking it all away!Yet about the over-dramatic mistreatment of the Shiites fabricated here, this sad excuse of a movie was an early attempt to indirectly brainwash the American public when it comes to picturing Saddam &amp; his regime as ruthless killers who deserve to be invaded!While now it turns out that a whole year of biased trials + endless piles of false documents and testimonies are not enough to convict the man of war crimes against his people!Three Kings (criticizes) American hypocrisy alright, but in the most condescending way imaginable! Kinda like saying: "we as Americans are your gods, but sometimes we mock you, and that makes us bad gods"!!!In a nutshell: This film can be considered spoilers-free by dogs, blind cats and the below-average American Joe! If you're none of the above, don't waste a minute on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three Kings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't remember much about the actually story or events, so being put in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die was a good reason to see it again, from director David O. Russell (I Heart Huckabees). Basically it is 1991, and the end of the Gulf War, where four American soldiers have come across a secret map hidden in a man's arse, showing the whereabouts of a bunker in an Iraqi village. Major Archie Gates (George Clooney) is convinced that the hidden directions found are pointing to a huge stash of stolen gold bullion and treasure from Kuwait is being hidden, so they start the journey to find it. Archie, with companions Sergeant First Class Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg), Staff Sergeant Chief Elgin (Ice Cube) and Private First Class Conrad Vig (Being John Malkovich director Spike Jonze) hope to find the gold and keep it for themselves. To make sure that they will not have their plan spoilt, Archie gets Specialist Walter Wogaman (Scream's Jamie Kennedy) to get Emmy nominated journalist Adriana Cruz (Drop Dead Gorgeous's Nora Dunn) out the way with misdirection. They reach the village, and after being lied to that its in the next village, they go back and do eventually find the gold, and the Iraqi army do initially help them take it. But they soon have the hearts tested when the Iraqi army starts shooting and killing the innocent villagers and also taking prisoners, including Troy. Now Archie, Chief and Vig are working out a way to rescue Troy, and also help the many people facing certain death by Saddam Hussein and his military power. They do eventually manage to rescue Troy, and they strike a deal with Iraqi villager and ally Amir Abdulah (Die Hard 4.0's Cliff Curtis) to get all the villagers across the border to make sure they cannot be harmed any more. Also starring Forrest Gump's Mykelti Williamson as Colonel Horn and Judy Greer as Cathy Daitch. This is meant to be a comedy satire, it certainly does mock the period and the American army, it has a really good cast, some great action, good moments of gun play, and great small moments with special effects, a very worthwhile and most watchable wartime action adventure. George Clooney was number 72 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and the film was number 50 on The 100 Greatest War Films. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As usual, a typical Hollywood movie casting anti-military "leading" actors to play soldiers. The only redeeming qualities of this steaming pile are the uniforms and equipment, and the opening scene with the Major boffing the reporter. I total ripoff on Kelly's Heroes with none of the humor, talent or pace of action. Too bad, considering how much money was wasted on this turkey.The expense and detail going into the set up of the basecamp scene and the correct equipment were wasted. The uniforms, weapons and vehicles were correct (except for the French painted M-35 trucks). I was amazed just how much this movie was loved by the anti-soldier crowd here in The People's Republic of Norman. I guess, a movie that is that anti-military and that anti-American has to be a hit here.Anyway, for what was paid to make this, they could have gotten some actors who could act. Other than Ice Cube the rest could have stayed home.Has to be one of the worst of the modern genre.</fullReview>
