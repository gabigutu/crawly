		<fullReview>I was worried about this film being worth a darn. My father is depicted by Aaron Eckhart. Well, it turned out much better than I ever could have asked for. I've seen people try to make a movie out of this story for decades, so I was surprised that it got finished... and released!Well, you may not cry out loud, guys. But I guarantee you will get chills and a lump in your throat. Sure, it's got a lot of football, but GIRLS, you will love this character played by Finn Wittrock. Then you will cry.You are at the cinema-plex. You aren't sure what to see.... PICK THIS ONE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. I'm a University of Texas alumnus and have vivid childhood memories of Freddie Steinmark the player, followed by Freddie Steinmark the tragedy, and finally Freddie Steinmark the inspiration. His legacy remains an active part of the Longhorns football program today via the stadium scoreboard dedication and the locker room tribute that is part of every game day in Austin. This is the directorial debut of Angelo Pizzo, who is known for writing two other inspirational sports movies: Hoosiers and Rudy.It's difficult not to cringe when the film opens in 2010 with a reporter interviewing legendary and elderly former coach Darrell Royal, who is dementia-stricken and forgetful ? until he starts speaking of Freddie. The cringe-inducing part isn't Coach Royal's dementia (of which we fans were all aware), but rather the amateurish make-up applied to Aaron Eckhart in an attempt to age him into the 85 year old icon. Fortunately this segment is brief, and we are soon enough picking up a high school aged Freddie as he practices and works out ferociously with his dad in hopes of fulfilling his dream of playing football at Notre Dame.Finn Wittrock ("American Horror Story") plays Freddie, and captures the intensity, ambition and goodness of the young man who would galvanize the Longhorns program and end up making quite an impression on those Notre Dame coaches, but for much more than his play on the field. Burned into my memory (and that of anyone who witnessed it) is the shot of Freddie on crutches at the 1970 Cotton Bowl.Director Pizzo offers some breath-taking aerial shots of Austin and Memorial Stadium (digitally altered to reflect the late 1960's), and some impressive sequences of football practices and games. Football fans will have fun spotting former players making appearances including Case McCoy (as Razorback Bill Montgomery), Hays McEachern, Danny Lester, and Luke Poehlmann. You will also note Juston Street plays his father James (mimicking the game face), and Jordan Shipley plays my all-time favorite Longhorn receiver, Cotton Speyrer. Nostalgia flows as the game announcers call some of the greatest college players of the era: Ted Koy, Steve Worster, Jim Bertelsen, Steve Owens, and Chuck Dicus."The Game of the Century" is the centerpiece game of the movie, and we actually get a clip of President Richard Nixon arriving to the Texas-Arkansas game of 1969. It turned out to be Freddie's final football game, but more aptly, a continuation of his influence. However, this is just as much the story of Freddie the individual as it is Freddie the football player. His determination, zest for life and incredible courage are the message here ? not tackles and interceptions. Even his relationship with his high school and college sweetheart Linda (Sarah Bolger) seems the stuff of which dreams are made.In addition to this film, there have been three books written about Steinmark: in 1971 Freddie worked with Blackie Sherrod on an autobiography called "I Play to Win"; in 2011, Jim Dent wrote "Courage Beyond the Game"; and just this year, the University of Texas published a new biography entitled "Freddie Steinmark: Faith, Family, Football" by Bower Yousse (a former friend and teammate). It should also be noted that Steinmark's battle against cancer inspired Congress to pass the National Cancer Act of 1971, beginning the war on cancer and spurring a jump in cancer research that continues to this day.It's a football movie, but also a tearjerker. It's a profile of an over-achiever, but also the story of a young man who inspired a team, a university and a nation. Every time you think the story is a bit corny, or that Freddie is too good to be true, just remind yourself that despite the cynicism permeating society today, Freddie Steinmark was flesh and blood, with a heart and soul and mentality that refused to surrender.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was fortunate enough to be at the Austin premier to listen to those who played with Freddie Steinmark, all saying the movie was spot on. Acting was phenomenal. The true story of a beloved, yet small, football player who gave everything he did 150%, even til the end. Not only did he inspire everyone around him, but continues to do so 40 years after his death. You don't have to be a football fan to appreciate this story of where determination and hard work can take you. As a UT grad who has gone to countless UT football games and seen Freddie be honored at every single one of them, I am so glad I got to finally hear his story. Now I understand why his legacy is still so profound. GO SEE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It hit you hard as emotionally as it does with the football. Great football movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Freddie Steinmark Story adapted into a movie. Freddie seems like a underdog as his body does not measure up to his heart, but Freddie proves that sometimes heart is all you need, and when the world tossed him a bad pass, he still stood up tall. It is the type of movie that makes you wish you had someone like Freddie Steinmark on your team. It was beautifully done.Aaron Eckhart was great as the head coach leading his team to victory, but the actor they got to play Freddie was perfect in capturing what an amazing guy he was. The whole movie just inspires you like a good sports movie should. It's like Rudy for a new generation.And the football was great too. I seen the gridiron thing done in many movies. Nothing out of the ordinary is going on here, but the sound effects accompanying the visuals definitely makes you feel the hit from every play.A fair warning, this is the type of movie that makes grown men get all misty eyed. My All American is about the type of heroes America loves, who against all odds, raised to the occasion to produced victory, and made so much of himself in so little time that people are still talking about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Story of a admirable, young football player who faces one of life's greatest challenges with courage, grace and resolve.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In terms of finding someone to look up to, heroes are scarce in American cinema. Superheroes, antiheroes, comic book heroes abound, but an uncompromising, generous-spirited Everyman is notably absent, despite there being a huge draw for him and a vacuum for good family entertainment.Enter My All-American, financed primarily by Bud Brigham, (a Texas oilman and prominent UT Alum) and written/ directed by Angelo Pizzo. (screenwriter, Rudy and Hoosiers) My All-American is a football story, and Freddie Steinmark is Everyman. He's a kind, generous, hard-working fellow who becomes the starting safety for the 1969 National Championship Football Team, the Texas Longhorns. Writer/director Angelo Pizzo introduces us to Freddie as a child, with sandlot dreams of playing football at Notre Dame, but Notre Dame thinks he's too small. (There are early echoes to Pizzo's prior film Rudy here.) Rather than force his way onto the Notre Dame Football team (like Pizzo's Rudy Ruettiger,) Freddie Steinmark finds a home with Darrell Royal, the iconic head football coach at the University of Texas. Despite his Steinmark's small stature, Royal recognizes his unflappable persistence and effervescent personality and offers Steinmark a football scholarship. What begins as a familiar climb to up the ladder of college football success changes at midpoint, as Steinmark discovers a nagging injury that turns out to be much more serious than first anticipated. Despite some sports personalities deeming the film this generation's Brian's Song, Pizzo does what he does best. He makes us feel like we have never seen this story before.Finn Wittrock plays Freddie Steinmark with exacting intelligence. He makes thoughts visible; he could tell the story without saying a word. In scene after scene he displays an unswerving loyalty to principle and a strong grasp on the diploma of manhood. Aaron Eckhart, as Darrell Royal, has a hard job here. (Royal referred to himself as the Barry Goldwater of college football). Eckhart's portrayal of Royal is measured, as he alternates between an extroverted warmness and a self-controlled, calculating, fear-inducing dominance which helped Royal lead the Horns to three National Championships. Juston Street, portrays his own father and UT quarterback James Street with swashbuckling candor and verve. In terms of supporting roles, he is the standout here. But Rett Terrell deserves mention, portraying Steinmark's roommate, Bobby Mitchell, with a steady stoicism and unexplored depth.My All-American is above all, a relationship movie. For those who seek love stories, there is a beautiful one here. Freddie Steinmark and Linda Wheeler are high school sweethearts who go to college together, and then are asked to endure the strain of facing a serious illness. Sarah Bolger (as Linda Wheeler) displays her own form of heroism; she is bright, playful, and child-like, yet stern and has the fortitude to confront Freddie's illness with an inflexible determinism, resolve and wisdom beyond her years. And Gloria Steinmark, Freddie's mother, is adeptly played by Robin Tunney. As the matriarch of the family, Tunney, presents Gloria with a steely strength and sympathetic tension, as she is caught between her love for her son and her ambition for him.In addition to an outstanding cast, My All-American's score, by composer John Paesano, is exquisite. His score highlights the scenes with just the right mix of melodic emotionality.While we are wholly unprepared for Steimark's untimely prognosis, Pizzo, leaves us with a form of Steinmark unbent by the weight of his sorrowful circumstances, and a heart adorned hope and love and fearlessness. The film infuses a new life and a new courage in the hearts of every movie goer: May we all face life's obstacles with Freddie Steinmark's courage and enthusiasm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful, Funny, Faith-based, Honest and Very Sad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The is based upon a true storyUniversity of Texas Coach Darrell Royal (Aaron Eckhart) tells the story of one of the best football players he ever had: Freddie Steinmark (Finn Wittrock). A reporter asks Coach Royal of all the All Americans he coached which one had the greatest impact on him. Coach Royal replies, " Freddie. Freddie Steinmark." The reporter states that Freddie Steinmark was never an All American. To which Coach Royal replies, "No, but he was MY ALL American."The first 3-quarters of this movie will remind you when you were in High School or early years of college as we follow Freddie Steinmark in his football days. It is delightful, funny, faith-based and honest. When Freddie meets Linda (Sarah Bolger) - the love of his life - in HS, we are off to the races.We see that Freddie Steinmark is truly an exceptional football player, who played Safety later on for Coach Royal. This movie shows us more football practices than we see from other football movies, and those action scenes are somewhat brutal too. (it's only a movie, Bob) When we see the actual games the hitting doesn't let up and we think about checking into the ER just to be safe. (still a movie)Aaron Eckhart probably plays the best role of his life as Coach Royal. Kudos. Newcomer Finn Wittrock as Freddie is a breath of fresh air and you wished you knew Freddie and further you wished everyone else was like him. He is the perfect friend as well as a better than exceptional football player. The last quarter of this movie is sad - extremely so - and you may need that Kleenex box. Everything caught me by surprise as I had never heard of Freddie Steinmark. Football movies come and go and we rarely or barely remember what they were about (except maybe for WE ARE MARSHALL) but this movie is much different as I don't think I will ever forget Freddie Steinmark or Coach Royal, who saw things in Freddie no one else saw. I am glad this movie was made so we know what an exceptional Human Being Freddie Steinmark was. Go to Wikipedia to learn more about Freddie Steinmark and Coach Darrell Royal. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is quite simply an amazing film.For starters, the acting performance by Aaron Eckhart as legendary head coach Darrell Royal is spot on. He got his mannerisms, speech patterns and facial expressions down-pat, and in doing all of that he got the spirit of Coach Royal almost perfectly portrayed.Secondly, Finn Wittrock makes the character of Freddie Steinmark very believable. He portrayed him as a flawed, fallible human being with a desire to prove himself and willing to do whatever it took to overcome any challenge...even when that challenge was his life.Finally, the incredible attention to detail to even the finest points. I have a copy of the 1969 Texas game vs. Arkansas in my home video library: let me assure you when they replicated the football action in that game, they did so with EXTREME accuracy....even down to a shot of a Longhorn Band member cheering on the team just before a big play in the game! Add in the charming performance of Juston Street as his father James Street, and the beautiful Sarah Bolger, and you've got a wonderful film. Freddie himself would be humbled and touched.This film explores themes of courage and overcoming adversity that should inspire anyone even if you're not a football fan.10/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this inspirational and uplifting film. Altho I don't quite understand the game of football and abhor the violence of some of the plays, I still enjoyed this film. The acting was superb in almost all of the actors. The cinematography was very good. I didn't realize it was a true story till the end but feel real good to have gotten to know the main characters. It is a wonderful example of the true team spirit that can be found if we try and the keep on trying attitude of those who succeed in life. I highly recommend this film for all young men and women, especially high-schoolers. Altho I consider it a faith-based film, it was not preachy or overbearing in its message.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . in the current Docudrama, MY ALL AMER!CAN. A runt-like Colorado boy is the only player on his public high school football team attending mass daily. His dream is to play college ball at Notre Dame, like "The Gipper," and continue on to the Chicago Bears. He's going to have tons of babies with his high school sweetie on the side. When his only scholarship offer comes from an apparently Lily White University of Texas grid-iron squad, his new goal is to lead the Longhorns to an unprecedented Cotton Bowl match-up against the integrated Fighting Irish &amp; Whatnots. Though MY ALL AMER!CAN does not overtly caution against making "pacts with the Devil," this 20-year-old runt DOES lead U-T to a national championship in his final game to set up the impossible long-shot of a few years back: U-T playing ND in the Cotton Bowl three weeks later. But as soon as that match-up is set, the under-sized over-achiever has a leg amputated at the hip, due to a baseball-sized cancerous tumor. This allows the U-T coach to pull a page from legendary Notre Dame master Knute Rockne, and plead for his team to "Win one for Freddie!" Most football fans and religious folks will be totally disillusioned by MY ALL AMER!CAN (unless they're up to the mental gymnastics being talked about in this week's sports sections, about how the "devout" families of Gridder Bart Starr and hockey great Gordie Howe see nothing wrong in filling these aging legends with stem cells from aborted babies to keep them going for a few more inches).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although he only lived for 22 years on planet earth Freddie Joe Steinmark touched a whole lot of lives and still does today in the great state of Texas. He's their version of the Gipper for those University of Texas Longhorns.The film is done in flashback with Freddie's Knute Rockne, UT's coach Darrell Royal played here by Aaron Eckhart. Freddie Joe Steinmark did not make All American, but in Royal's mind he's his once and forever My All American.Finn Wittrock plays Freddie with a minimum of sentimentality who led that Texas team to its first national championship in a generation and then it's discovered he has one bad almost always terminal version of bone cancer. Both Wittrock and Eckhart are supported by an impeccably cast group of supporting players.To this day in Texas the Longhorns win for Freddie the way Knute Rockne had them win one for George Gipp. The film is also a winner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"We would not have been national champions if you had not been on that field." Freddie Steinmark (Wittrock) is a tremendous football player, but was always told he was too small to play for a major college. When Texas coach Darrell Royal (Eckhart) recruits him, Freddie works harder than anyone on the team and finally earns a starting job. In the midst of a run at the National Championship season Freddie's knee begins to bother him. When he sees the doctor his life, and the legacy of Texas football is changed forever. I am a huge fan of sports movies, especially ones that are true. This one took awhile for me to get invested in, but when I did I really got into it. This is not one of the best sports movies I have ever seen, but it is very much worth seeing and I do highly recommend it. The movie has great sports scenes as well as a very emotional arc that can only be true, this isn't something you can make up. Sports movie fans will really like this, and this is actually a decent family movie. It is rated PG, but some of the subject matter may need to be explained. Overall, a very good movie that I recommend. Not one of the best sports movies ever made, but a very good addition to the genre. I give this a high B.</fullReview>

I recommend it if you love movies, drama and sports is great for you to watch with your teens and show them some values about endurance, love, family and team.

		<shortDescription>Coach Royal tells who his favorite All-American was.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I watched this movie at home on Netflix streaming movies. Judging by the paltry box office numbers and the very few IMDb votes far too few people have seen it. Mostly true, it would seem too melodramatic if it were fiction, and wonderful story of a football player that to this day, almost 50 years later, inspires University of Texas football players.Most of the movie involved the 1968 and 1969 college football seasons. Even though I now live in Texas (for 30 years now) back then I was a student at Purdue University and a Big 10 fan, so I don't specifically recall what UT was doing in those years.The movie starts in 2010 when a young lady is interviewing old coach Darrell Royal who would have been about 86 at that time. She asks about who his favorite All-American was and after a brief pause he says "Freddie Steinmark". The reporter is taken aback, Steinmark was NOT one of UT's All-Americans but Royal says "He was MY All-American." And that is what the movie is about.Aaron Eckhart is good as Coach Royal and Finn Wittrock (looking too much like Matt Damon) is Freddie Steinmark. We first see him in high school in Colorado, hoping to get a chance to play at Notre Dame. Or somewhere, because he wasn't very big at 5'9" and 165 pounds. He is surprised with a visit offer to University of Texas at Austin where Coach Royal offers him a full scholarship to play football.The story is about how Freddie always had a positive attitude and a work ethic, both on the field and in the classroom, that set the bar for everyone else. He became the star on defense and in punt and kickoff returns and as Coach tells him later, they would not have won the national championships without Freddie.Good story, good movie. The recreation of football action is very realistic.SPOILERS: During that 1969 season when UT went undefeated, was voted #1, and won the Cotton Bowl over Notre Dame, Freddie began to experience increasingly painful discomfort in his left leg. At the end of the season Coach made him see a doctor and he was ultimately sent to MD Anderson in Houston where he was diagnosed with bone cancer. They had to amputate his leg at the hip, the prognosis was not good. Freddie disregarded doctor's orders and learned to use a walking device so that he was able to attend the Cotton Bowl game and help inspire his teammates to victory over Notre Dame. He died less than 2 years after his surgery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Human Drama First and a Football Film Second</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the bonus segments on the DVD of "My All-American," it is clear that the filmmakers were primarily interested in presenting an inspiring human interest story, as opposed to a football biography. They were enormously successful in achieving their goal in retelling the life of University of Texas football player Freddie Steinmark.Freddie Joe Steinmark was only 5'10 tall and weighed only 155 pounds, yet he was such an overachiever that he won a full scholarship to play for the University of Texas in the late 1960s. Legendary football coach Darrell Royal is perfectly played by Aaron Eckhart, and an outstanding young actor, Finn Wittrock, performs the role of Steinmark.For football fans, there is an excellent set of hard-hitting action scenes on the gridiron. In the bonus clip to the DVD, we learn that Mike Fisher was faced with the daunting challenge of recreating a football playbook from forty-five years ago. The sequences were entirely believable both on the practice field and in game action. The son of the Texas quarterback in the championship season of 1969, effectively played the role of his dad.The film is not perfect, and some viewers may find the interpretation of Steinmark to be overly sentimental. A legitimate question to ask is whether Steinmark was really quite the saint, as portrayed in the film.Another shortcoming was the relationship of Steinmark with his father, as interpreted in the film. The father clearly overbearing in the way he pushed his little boy to excel in football. The drama of whether Steinmark would be awarded a scholarship seemed like a life-and-death matter to the father. Why? Student loans existed in the 1960s.Inexplicably, the domineering presence of the dad never seemed to phase young Freddie Steinmark. There is an excellent film called "Fear Strikes Out" that depicts a similar father-son relationship and the damaging effects on the baseball player Jimmy Piersall. Psychologically, "My All-American" was not sophisticated in its approach to family systems. At the least, there should have been some accountability for the conduct of the father. In the film, even Freddie's close friend, Bobby Mitchell, casually observes that the father is living out his failed athletic career through his son.Still, the film was a moving depiction of a life well-lived, yet cut short. It is clear that Freddie Steinmark truly touched those around him, both with his athletic abilities and his strength of character. This is a solid family drama and worthy of viewing and reflection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Story of Human Perseverance Beautifully Told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What an emotional great ride My All American is. It's a beautiful movie about humanity using football as the vehicle. In that I don't see this as a football, or even sport, movie as it explores how greatness uses our world around us to which, yes, football is a part. It's the exploration of the human spirit and how it rises around the life one lives within.Freddie Stenmark was a true force of nature. The kind of person who is uplifting to all those in his sphere. He was a positive force who unrelentingly worked to overcome the deficiencies of being small in a tough world of football where size is, perhaps, valued on par with skill. That never stopped Freddie and the story of a life lived positively with grace is one for the ages.If a story were to use football as a backdrop it couldn't be better than the 1969 meeting of The University of Texas and the Arkansas Razorbacks. Texas coach Daryl Royal had handed Arkansas their only loss the previous year, but was not content with his team's record of 6 and 4 that year. The rivalry between these two teams, always heady, reached a fevered pitch for their 1969 meeting which would decide the national championship. It was a battle for the ages living up to it's advanced billing as The Game Of The Century as college football was also celebrating it's 100th year. As large a role as this game plays in the movie it's fitting ending is only a wonderful fulfilling within a greater story. It's this great story revolving around Freddie Stenmark's abilities and heart combined with coach Daryl Royal's vision and guidance that trumps the big game.My All American is one of the finest tributes to a fallen hero I've ever witnessed on celluloid. Aaron Eckhart's portrayal of coach Daryl Royal is wonderful. Smartly, the movie opens with an aged Royal giving an interview in which a young reporter asks which All American to come out of his system stood above all others. The answer is a perfect way to begin the re-telling of an inspirational story which could end with tremendous sadness, but celebrates how one player defined both the coach and team, and continues to do so. Special mention goes to Finn Whittrock's Freddie Stenmark. Whittrock honors the legacy with a moving, very realistic, look at one of football's all-time greats who deserves being remembered This is a movie, IMHO, that has such appeal that it should be seen by all?even those with no interest in football. A tremendous testament to a life well lived tragically cut short. It's not an understatement that in terms of sports meeting humanity this one stands with the classic "Pride of the Yankees". It's that good.</fullReview>

Freddie was a true spirit of inspiration. No one can dispute that. After watching I too felt touched by his accomplishments and his ability and fortitude to remain resolute until his death. There is not much on his family but I feel they too were proud of him and deeply felt his loss. He and his finance made plans to marry. He entered into a coma preventing their marriage. What a tragedy. Freddie is an example of how to live daily and follow your dreams. I wish I could have met him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing More Than An Article</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'My All American (Courage)' brings nothing more to the table than an article you can read online. The screenplay constantly stays safe and the writing never takes a chance to create more depth to portray Freddie Steinmark in a realistic way. This is a glossed over family film, with the strong hint of bland Christian morals. There is no room for character building and change, as everyone remains flat and stale.Any attempt of trying to add a backstory away from his football career is quickly drowned out by, well, more football. Every conversation, whether its with his family, girlfriend, or friends, is quickly shifted to football, which portrays Freddie as a robot bowing down to the game; nothing more is on his mind. His early life struggles are quickly resolved and move on to the next football task; nothing more.Sure, we can understand that he loved football, but Angelo Pizzo does not show the effort in film-making as the real Freddie Steinmark showed for the game. Pizzo's script and direction can be equally fulfilled by reading only a single article, or skimming the SparkNotes from 'Courage Beyond the Game: The Freddie Steinmark Story' written by, Jim Dent. What we are watching in this film is the first adaptation of a screenplay, as Pizzo forgot that screen writing takes a few more drafts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soooo disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure about a spoiler warning for this one...it's akin to reviewing Titanic and letting it slip that the boat sinks.In the end Freddy dies, there's no sugar coating that. I was in high school at the time. I have a vivid memory of him on crutches at the '70 Cotton Bowl. A heartbreaking and inspiring story, which the movie fails to capture.When I heard they were filming in San Antonio, I took time off work to go be some small part of the story that touched me as a 15 year old HS football player. We sat in 100 degree heat in jackets and sweaters, crew went over our dress with a fine tooth comb, looking for authenticity. No watches, or shoes or hats that were not time period correct.Then I see the movie (along with 7 other people for a 7:45pm start) and the CGI of the stadiums is horrid. You'll see better in Saturday morning kids cartoons. Yes, I saw that picture in DKR's office with the west side upper deck in it, how'd ya miss that? Here's another news flash, DKR was not blonde...ya couldn't afford a bottle of black hair dye? The make-up for "old" Darrell was horrific, perhaps the worst effort at aging a character I've ever seen, and I'm OLD.The face-masks were all wrong...ALL wrong. How can you spend hours looking for Nikes and not 5 minutes on something as obvious as a face-mask? So much, so wrong, but rest assured, when that camera pans a stadium full of extras, not one of us was wearing a digital watch or a pair of Reeboks.The script was disappointingly cheesy. The dialogue was campy and stifled. I was afraid of this knowing the writer's previous work on Rudy and Hoosiers, 2 horrid and over-rated little films.On the other side...the cast was pretty good, Finn &amp; Sarah especially, even tho this pivotal relationship, despite extensive screen time together, seemed superficial and under developed.In the end, I cried, not because of Freddy's plight, but that such a poignant and inspiring story had been so poorly done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average at best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My All American is a quick paced movie with a story that doesn't quite connect. I want to like it, but it doesn't let me.Acting was nothing great. Very average across the cast. The story was decent, though it didn't feel genuine enough. The biggest problem for me was that I never could connect with the characters very well. Freddy was not relatable, he seemingly had no flaws most of the movie besides his stubbornness. He was not fleshed out in the slightest. He also seemed to be unstoppable the entire movie. Even when he deals with the conflict he seems hardly fazed... Maybe that was the point of his character, but I couldn't enjoy it. The music was overwhelming. It was constant across the film, and it basically all sounded the same too. Nothing memorable, it started to annoy me after a while. It felt like it was desperately trying to add emotion to the film that the film itself couldn't do.This may be nitpicky, but a lot of the character interactions were straight up weird. This one character goes crazy licking his lips. I was constantly laughing because I was feeling emotional, sexual tension between the male characters with so many of their interactions. I don't think the director was going for this, but that's how it was coming off to me. Overall the movie wasn't terrible, but it was pretty disappointing. I'd give it a 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My All American is one of the many sports stories we can just skip.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Next to the zombie genre, sports dramas are usually pretty unoriginal. They have nowhere to grow and they at times follows the same formula piece by piece. With it being America game, you see so many of these football films and really only a handful work. My All American is more of the same.Freddie Steinmark (Finn Wittrock) is a high school football star who eventually goes on to play college football at Texas University. This is a story of Freddie's efforts and setbacks while at Texas that changes his life forever. As someone who walked into the theater knowing nothing about this story, the plot is based off a real story of Freddie Steinmark's life. Frankly, I don't think this movie will have an audience outside of Texas. Freddie is sure a likable character even if he is single-minded about football but more times then not I asked the question "why". Why should we care so much about this guy? Why so much into his life story? He sure has a lovely girlfriend in character Linda Wheeler (Sarah Bolger) but there's no room for her to grow. Even a big name like Aaron Eckhart playing Texas coach Darrell Royal doesn't work because there is nothing is to the character and nowhere to go with it. Don't get wrong, it's a nice story but a 30 for 30 feature makes more sense for the story. My All American evens get more cliché really once you get into the depth of the football aspect. We see football scenes that have been done so many times before. So many of the game highlights just drag. The ending really wants to really grip you even though it doesn't come close and is so cheesy. If one of the purposes of the story was to get me interested in Texas Longhorns football, then it was very far off.This movie is easily watchable but it feels so much like a one-time watch. Really what's the point of it if you already know the story the most dramatic happening in the plot is in the third act; a third act that drags badly. My All American is one of the many sports stories we can just skip.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sappy is a poor substitute for inspirational</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Angelo Pizzo has written four movies: "Hoosiers," "Rudy," "The Game of Their Lives," and 2015's "My All-American," the true story of Texas Longhorns safety Freddie Steinmark. Notice a trend? Inspirational sports movies, yes. But also the downward trend, from arguably the best sports movies of all-time to, frankly, one of the worst. "My All-American" seems like a parody of the great sports movies of old. It preaches "try your hardest," but then, in practice, doesn't put in enough effort. Undersized running back Freddie Steinmark (Finn Wittrock) had expected to play college football for his hometown Colorado team. But when legendary coach Darrell Royal (Aaron Eckhart) offers the scrappy blue collar boy a full scholarship to be safety at the University of Texas, Steinmark's life changes. When his high school girlfriend Linda (Sarah Bolger) gets her acceptance letter to Texas, too, Steinmark is on top of the world. He has plans to play for the Chicago Bears. His family is behind him. But in the middle of a record season, with Texas on the road to a possible championship, Steinmark has an injury that could threaten his football career forever. Acting is at its most stilted in "My All-American." Wittrock is a heartthrob, but you can't hide bad acting in a nice tan and beaming smile. He's an amateur here. He was irritating, right down to the way he holds his mouth. He looks like a constipated Batman villain. And his character starts off as a selfish, unlikable guy. He's the cocky type that doesn't know when he's being made fun of. Aaron Eckhart, past the days of Two-Face, gives us a ridiculous Southern accent and a stereotyped football coach. Halftime pep talks are at their most clichéd. Blame the script, which is in every way a highly inferior "Rudy." Start with the insincere, love-at-first-sight romance. To write his girlfriend's name, I had to look it up. I didn't remember it. That's because Linda was hardly a character at all. Really, nobody was. There was no characterization. There's a spattering a religious references meant to boost the inspirational shtick. But they never get into it, maybe for fear of coming off as a "Christian" movie that's only seen by church congregations. The direction, too, is amateurish. To be fair, this is Pizzo's first directing effort. Lots of rubbing of brows to show concern. It's a first-film thing to suggest. Plus, the football choreography shows players missing tackles so unintentionally it's almost funny. The plot is barely there. You don't really know the plot until about two-thirds of the way too. And by that point, you don't care. It's too long. It's just bad. "My All-American" is a sad excuse for a sports movie. Sappy is a poor substitute for inspirational.For more reviews, visit Cinema or Cine-meh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not kidding. This film starts in like 1960. There is a friendship and invitation that evolves out of high school...in which to a big surprise is shown to the larger of the two football players. The natural effects that have captured these guys faces as well as those CREASE marks on the leading ladies upper lips under her nostrils are remarkable. I saw matt damon and james marsden in the smaller hard training qb playing Steinmart. when the movie started, I was like, aw man....and when the movie progressed into the Cotton Bowl I guess 10 years later.....the story was about a tumor that had developed in one of the Coaches players.at the 1/2 hour before this movie ends we learn that...giving the audience a 1/2 hour to wrap it up.....whereas, unlike Rudy and this famous coach I've never heard of....I cant express the facts that its inspired or is actually autobiographical plus narrated by the old coach who in turn is being interviewed by a WOMAN..nudging him with footnotes</fullReview>
