		<shortDescription>A Terrible, Unfunny, Man-Hating Mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heralded by the most disliked trailer in YouTube history, and an embargo on reviews until pretty much the day of release by a panicked Sony Studios, the "Heaven's Gate" of supernatural horror comedies is finally here, and what a terrible, unfunny, man-hating mess it is.Like Paul Feig's previous movie, 'The Heat', this appears to be nothing more than a 'comedy' with all the comedy taken out: No jokes. No discernible plot to speak of. No memorable or likable characters. Terrible CGI. Possibly the worst theme song ever penned. Then on top of that the only black woman in the thing is a 'HEELLLL NO" racial stereotype 40 years out of date, and ALL the men, without a single exception, are exclusively depicted as either stupid or evil.I honestly hope this abomination is such a flop it sinks the studio, and so ever after acts as a warning to future film-makers not to cynically exploit beloved movies from the past for short term gain or presently fashionable political brownie points, but maybe instead try to make memorable movies of lasting magic and worth themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspicious of the positive reviews...something is going on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ATTENTION: THIS IS NOT A REVIEW OF THE MOVIE. THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE REVIEWS.As I usually do before I watch new movies, I came to IMDb to read some reviews. First, I read the 5 top "Love it" and then the 5 top "hate it". The comments were so diametrically different that I decided to investigate who was posting these comments.Surprisingly, the top "love it" reviewers were all new IMDb members. What's more, none of them have any other review. Even more strange, all the reviews seemed manufactured with hype-type sentences. Here are some examples extracted from these reviews:- "it's damned entertaining, and visually appealing. I recommend it in 3D if you can watch it that way" - "Everything I could have wanted, and more." - "Oh my gosh, did my excitement grow" - "It blew me away." - "I decided to go see the movie, ready for it to suck. I was astonished to find myself laughing throughout the movie" - "This movie is AMAZING!"By contracts, the top 5 haters, all of them, have been long-standing members with at the very least a dozen reviewed titles. In fact, take a look at my own profile and you will find that I have been reviewing movies here for years.I am not saying that the positive reviews are fake. I am not accusing anyone. But if I were you I would do due diligence before trusting a suspicious review.I am NOT going to see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dead on arrival</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as the end result... ...the film completely fell flat across the board. I have nothing against the four leads. I more or less blame the writers, director and the studios choice of direction for the new Ghostbusters.The acting is some of the most stiff and cookie cutter I have ever seen. There were times when it really sounded like they were reading their lines. The actors did NOT mesh well at all and their interaction with all of the blue and green screen effects was lifeless and clueless.I was just lost with the approach on their attempted humor. I mean, it's bad. I don't know what panel sat around the table reading the script and laughed at it, but I hope they never do again.The effects were horrible. Every time, which was A LOT, they used a green screen, I found myself taken away from the movie.The film constantly contradicts it's own established continuity. One minute they can't kill the ghosts, only contain them, the next, they can. Just ridiculous.They even added a segment to the movie early on that shows the four girls poking fun at all of the hate for the film. I just don't think the studio gets it. More mocking of the very people they expect to pay top dollar for their product.Despite all of the sexist remarks towards the movie, the movie itself is EXTREMELY sexist against men and borderline racist. All men are portrayed as fools in the movie and in order to kill the final villain they have to shoot him in the crotch. It almost seems the team behind the film knew how stereotypical and sexist their movie was, so they capitalized on the sexism against the film in order to hide that.I honestly recommend wearing a padded glove when you watch this, IF you watch this. I have never face-palmed so many times during a movie in my life. I would not suggest this film to anyone except maybe children under ten years old and even then, it would simply be for a cartooned 3D experience.I wish I could find positives because I dislike being so negative about a film. I understand completely the amount of work that goes into something like this. Chris Hemsworth was probably the best part of this believe or not. I could see him leading a team of his own Ghostbusters in another version if written correctly.But I can't help but quote Jurassic Park concerning the very idea of this film.The filmmakers "were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should."I really did try to give this film a chance despite all of the negative hype. But, the film was not funny and does not stand on it's own. Honestly, the only thing that intrigued me was seeing the cameos from some of the original cast.I will add that if you were thinking you had seen the majority of the movie throughout all of the trailers, various clips, TV spots, etc., you would have been thinking correctly. Sony used all of what they considered to be the best material in all of the promotional releases. Let that be your red flag considering how poor the trailers were.If someone were to ask me if they should go see it, I would say, "No, but if you are curious, just wait for it to become available for Internet streaming."I don't think people will walk away from this movie afraid of ghosts. I imagine they walk away afraid of the movie and more so, the people who thought it was wise to make it in the first place.There is some irony here. Ghostbusters 2016 has literally become a ghost. It was dead on arrival.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie made me so sad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, keep in mind that I'm going to try to make this as least-hostile as possible. But when a movie is this hypocritical, bigoted, and ignorant, there is nothing good that can be said about it. Except for the people who were literally bribed into writing positive reviews.1: This movie was stolen. Everything in this movie was stolen from the first two. All they did was literally take the first movie, and remove the action parts and the horror parts.2: The sexism. This movie is probably the most sexist movie since Doomsday Machine. They replaced the entire main cast with only women to appeal to the radical Feminists. When your ideology discriminates against who you can cast in a role, that is called Fascism, and it's not a good thing.3: The bland lobotomized token male. Pretty much the only main character who was a man was turned into a stereotype. He was useless, annoying, fake, had an IQ below sea-level, and was clearly trying to pretend to be Brad Pitt, but with none of the acting talent. He also only got hired because of his looks.4: The racism. The only black character was turned into a loud, annoying, street-smart stereotype.5: The CGI. It was terrible, and very cartoon-like. "Daffy Duck: The Early Years"6: The acting. Not one single main character in the movie could act. Not one. It looked like a grade- school drama club.7: The "comedy". Every single joke fell flat. I didn't laugh once at anything they said. Many of the jokes were sexist, too. The trailer is a perfect summary of the movie. Every single joke was dumbed-down because Paul Feig has no respect for his audience.8: The entitlement. The cast and director have been throwing a hissy fit ever since people saw what garbage the first trailer was. They have been trying to claim that people who don't like the movie are sexists. No, no, no, no, and NO. People who think they are entitled to success because of their gender are sexist. The cast of this movie is sexist. The director of this movie is sexist. The people who hate this movie are NOT sexist.9: So boring. This movie didn't take any chances, and didn't expand the Ghostbusters universe in any way.10: The product placement. It was everywhere. There might not have been a single scene where they weren't advertising something in the background. It made me long for the days of Foodfight!In conclusion, nobody should every give their money to these lazy fatcats again. I for one am never buying another Sony product in my life. And if you pay to see this movie, you are a bad person.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Avoid Like The Plague</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie with an open mind hoping that it would not be as bad as the trailers and TV spots suggest. It is. I really wanted this movie to surprise me, to make me laugh to make me care for the characters and have some investment in the story, but it failed to achieve any of that. What I saw was a two hour mess of a movie. An unfunny, poorly written, poorly edited, contrived cash-in on a beloved classic which has some of the poorest dialogue and worst performances I've seen in a while. The computer generated effects were like something out of a live action Disney picture. The music, in particular the theme tune was uninspiring and added no impact or energy to the movie. I honestly can't think of any redeeming qualities that this film has. After waiting so long for a new Ghostbusters film this comes as a major disappointment. Some things are just best left alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is all they could do is rip-off the original classic??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite what you hear from a few Movie "Critics" that are notorious for selling (payolla) their reviews to the highest Studio bidder, the new Ghostbusters staring Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, and Saturday Night Live standouts Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones is HORRIBLE!! We had a media showing last night and I thought I was going to be sick. The pace of the film is like molasses, the editing is amateur choppy, the acting is slapstick and the comedy is extra soft-porn SNL (Saturday Night Live). Yes I went in with considerable apprehension, but came out with a severe case of stomach cramps. As I said, the acting is abysmal, except marginally for Kristen Wiig, but that doesn't save this yawner. Melissa McCarthy has clearly become the female Adam Sandler / Mike Myers / David Spade (at his most obnoxious) and we can only hope that McCarthy fade into obscurity like the 3 aforementioned SOON! For a "reboot" of a classic, this film is pathetic. Ghostbuster Tampons is not worth your hard earned money for the price of the theater ticket. If you must see it, wait till it is on you free HBO or Showtime package .... and there is nothing else on even on PBS reruns. And "THAT is the View from the Balcony" (tm)(R) and all that other legal BS 2016.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Franchise Reboot Ever Made *SPOILER ALERT*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was unfortunate enough to see an early screening with a friend and... man, this movie isn't bad; it's TERRIBLE. BEYOND TERRIBLE. It's getting mixed to positive reviews, but the people liking this movie are the same people who jumped on-board the feminist "everyone who hates this film is a misogynist" train and they don't even mention anything beyond the parts they cherry-picked to like in the movie. Throughout the hour and a half + movie, the movie made a desperate attempt to be good to the point where it just appeared like they were trying too hard. Much of the humor is forced and most of the jokes are basic and can be seen/guessed even before the scene rolls. At times, it felt cheap and lazy. I thought I was watching a failing SNL parody rather than a good movie.Leslie Jones is another problem; she portrays a stereotypical black woman with an attitude. Yelling? Check. Bitch slapping? Check. Every single stereotype about black woman? Check. Remember Winston Zeddemore from the original film? Was he a stereotypical black man at the time in the 1980s? Nope. Instead, he was an Average Joe who wanted a job and took it at Ghostbusters. Here, Leslie portrays her character in an almost-offensive manner when it comes to playing a stereotypical black woman. It's borderline inappropriate and, had she been a man, this film would've been TRASHED by critics for this portrayal of a character. Also, it's Reverse Sexism in a film. Instead of treating both genders equally, Paul Feig displays men as idiots or assholes. This is true with Hemsworth's character, Kevin, who is the team's secretary. He's completely stupid, clueless and innocent; but mostly stupid. Janine in the original film was a smart, capable woman who had a lot of memorable moments and wasn't portrayed in a sexist, if not really unattractive manner. I almost walked out of the early screening because of how poorly men were portrayed in the film. And, probably, by now, everyone has heard of the atrocious final resolution to the final battle. SPOILER ALERT: SKIP IF YOU WANNA ACTUALLY SEE THIS BURNING DUMPSTER FIRE.The final battle is resolved by shooting Rowan in the dick. That's right; four chicks shoot Rowan in the dick with their proton packs. -.- You probably already know this because of the GIF floating around the inter-webs, but, yeah. That's how the final battle ends; a really sexist approach to finishing the film. It sounds mild, but combine this with the portrayal of Kevin, Bill Murray's cameo and a few other male characters who interact with the main characters and you have a feminist film ready to go.Along with these criticisms come with the really bad script that just acts like imitation crab in the food world; it's just an imitation. In fact, half the plot imitates the original in a distasteful manner that just really turns off Ghostbusters fans. It's unoriginal and it pays little homage to the films. When it does, it does it in lackluster fashion. Like, for example, Stay Puft's official sighting in this film is in parade balloon form, not true marshmallow form. If you were expecting at least one showdown with the destructive Puft himself, think again. He has been replaced by the logo ghost. XD There's so much wrong with this movie, but these things are just a few of them. Thanks Paul Feig for messing Ghosbusters up. I guess Paul's been Busted and it felt good busting' this travesty of a film that will haunt GB fans for generations.PROS: -Chris Hemsworth (For the most part) -Complete relief when the film endedCONS: -Terrible acting -Abismal writing -Huge gaping plot holes (Like the inability to buy the firehouse but the ability to create advanced ghost busting technology and obtain parts and equipment.) -Poor CGI effects -Disrespectful cameos and treatment of original material -Reverse sexist message -A stereotypical caricature of a black woman (Leslie Jones as Patty) -Useless inclusion of Patty into the GB team -Non-existent character chemistry -Disappointing final battle which breaks all GB rules first established in the film -Unmemorable soundtrack -Poor editing -Inappropriate responses to constructive criticism hidden in film -Dull, ineffective, dry forced-humor -Identity crisis (Reboot or Sequel. Choose one, Feig.) -Laughable film effort in generalThis film is BUSTED and busting this travesty of a film makes me feel good; better than good... GREAT.1/10 10/100 1/5 F</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing dross that bored an entire cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never seen the original Ghostbusters films, so I went into watching this with quite an open mind. It ended up being incredibly disappointing though, the CGI was terrible and reminded me of the early 2000s live action Scooby Doo films, the girls, who I'd imagine are funny in their own right, seemed to have absolutely zero chemistry between them and oddly enough Chris Hemsworth's character Kevin ended up being the most funny aspect of the film. That's just my personal opinion however. My boyfriend who I went to see the film with whispered to me 'this is awful,' half way through and he revealed to me that he had felt ashamed while watching the film. I went because he guaranteed me it was going to be enjoyable and I think it didn't take long until he realised that the movie was a disappointment.</fullReview>

In fact Batman and Robin (George Clooney and whoever played Robin) had more humor in it than this movie does, and that movie was worse than this one--that is how not funny this movie is.

		<fullReview>Awful but not necessarily for the reason you would expect.Despite some early reviews I've read or watched I didn't find the movie to be anti-male. There was nothing offensively anti-man in it that wasn't something I've already seen before and laughed off a million times. Unfortunately that's part of the problem this movie has with humor creativity. There was nothing there to laugh about.Thankfully Patty Tolan isn't a walking/talking stereotype. They made her a New York City historian instead of a caricature with "street smarts". Sadly, they didn't do her any other favors. Nor were the other characters flushed out at all.Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy play a pair of old friends who re-unite but I never get much of a sense they were anything but aware they were in a movie. They try to riff and play off each other but it kind of falls flat.Kate McKinnon's character stands out the most in this movie. The character just seemed too weird in an unrealistic way. She seemed to try chewing up scenery any time she was on a call sheet, even if she didn't have much to say. She didn't feel like she fit into what was happening.One actress that stood out to me was Cecily Strong. Cecily Strong stood out to me the same way Kristen Wiig first stood out to me in Knocked Up. She only has a very small role in the movie but she's able to be convincing and funny without making it seem like she's in on the joke.The performances weren't bad per se, they were just very underwhelming all-around. As a result, the film itself does not succeed.I did like how the ghosts look in the movie. I also like the choice the filmmakers make at the end regarding the classic logo. However I have to be harsh on this movie because it's a reboot that ultimately did not need to be made.Not only did they attempt to reboot a comedy (tell the same joke twice in a row and see how well it works the second time - comedy is a very very delicate thing and you need to respect the audience) but they went for a movie that originally caught lightning in a bottle. I don't even think Ghostbusters II did enough to justify existing. Maybe the lessons we didn't learn back when the sequel was made are the same lessons we won't learn from the reboot.</fullReview>

But it wasn't. it was a terrible, unfunny waste of my time and every other poor soul who had the painful misfortune of having to sit and bear witness to this god awful, inane, inept and pathetic excuse for entertainment. Not a single moment did this wretched movie give me the tiniest iota of anything that would resemble pleasure. Not a single joke made me laugh, not for any second could this film make me muster up a single emotion other than pure anger and disgust, I didn't care about any of the main characters and was so detached from them that if all 4 characters died horribly in the film I would have less of an emotion than I do when I flush my excrement down the toilet. Further-more just to give you an idea of how comprehensively bored i was, I found myself looking at my watch at a point in the film hoping it would be nearing it's end only to find that the film was only 30 minutes into it's running time. I abhor, despise, loathe and resent this movie and plea to anyone reading this to avoid this movie like the plague that it is. In fact I retract that statement as frankly comparing this film to the plague would be an insult to the plague as it has far more reason to exist than this film does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie sucked for me on every level. I refused to pay to see it because I didn't want to contribute to what I knew was going to be bad. However I had no idea it was going to be THIS BAD. I forced myself to watch it. I nearly couldn't finish watching. Even the needing left me feeling even more depressed that they could waste so much money and come out with so much dross is beyond belief! This movie was rampantly sexist in not a nice way. All men are idiots in this movie. Whereas women seem to possess not only brains but an inability to flinch at ghosts at all, which seems out of place with not here they are not! All the horror was removed from this flick which makes it nothing like the first one. There was nothing scary, it was all woo hoo wee hee - like a fairground ride, which made it feel like it had no soul and it was just going through the motions.So what replaced the horror and soul.... you guessed it Comedy. Bad comedy! Comedy which was so overplayed that no joke in it hit any mark and you could see the set ups a mile away. The cameos by Bill Murray and Dan Ackroyd didn't play up to those characters importance to their original roles and were very forgettable moments which is a crime for this film to have done that to these actors. Cameos of this standing should be memorable.Really this movie should be erased from history and the negatives burned. It has caused so much upset and so much disappointment and everyone who said it looked bad was right. I cannot believe that there is anyone out there who actually gave this movie a vote above 3, so why it is even at 5.5 on IMDb right now astounds me. Sony must have fake accounts on IMDb like crazy to have even managed to drag it this high.Paul Feig, your a hack. May you never work in Hollywood again. What you did to this movie is unforgivable. I hope it makes you unemployable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gave it a 2 for Harold Ramis, the rest of the living get a 1. This was the most unfunny, disorganized attempt at Franchising a classic title I've seen sine Car 54 Where are You. I truly believed I was watching a recent Saturday Night Live sketch, the ones after weekend update, that are generally unfunny and go nowhere. Leslie Jones screaming and carrying on in a very stereo typed black woman, comedic style that's decades past its expiration date. Think Aunt Esther but without the funny material. Kate McKinnon was using the aloof lesbian character she is famous for as well, also tired and without dimension. McCarthy and Wiig were basically Bridesmaids goes to Ghostbusters Fantasy Camp. They had the costumes, a cheap version of the Ecto-mobile, a headquarters, wait for it, above a Chinese restaurant (ugh) and no chemistry, a-list material or the "chops" of the original Ghostbusters. My companion and I were the only ones in the theater on a Saturday night. The original living cast was regulated to: Ackroyd, a confused senior citizen, Murray, phoned in remotely and Hudson, not sure I napped during some of this it was so bad. I knew I was in for an unpleasant evening based on past reviews, I just didn't want to believe it could be so bad. The last Ghostbusters movie was fun, likable characters, nifty sets and effects. This one was none of that and I feel I've witnessed an end to the funny comedies we were spoiled with by the original players as well as others in that same era. This film may appeal to the rare comedic ally challenged individual who just needs a quiet place to text friends, or nap but no regards for the original by any respect is the awful taste in my mouth that won't go away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, lets be blunt: I feel sorry for Leslie Jones. Its not her fault the script wrote her character to be nothing but a collection of every negative stereotype about black women, and added on "knows NYC" as if that somehow made it OK.Chris Hemsworth had fun getting to step out of his usual action and drama roles. But his character could have been played just as convincingly by a stump.And of course we had to have the "designated fat ugly nerd", the "desperate and clueless", and a few other tropes.Basically, if it wasn't a stereotype, it was a trope. The "great CGI" was all stolen from the originals, as was the plot and what few jokes that weren't based on blatant sexism or racism. To see Bill Murray and Ernie Hudson wasted in their short (few seconds) cameos was actually the best part of the film. All so Dan Aykroyd could squeeze some more cash out of the franchise. This probably killed off any hope of further entries.</fullReview>

Several original cast members have cameos that reference their original roles in creative ways and there's a homage to Harold Ramis. The ghosts/effects are well done and include some recognizable characters. The main characters- Abby, Erin, Holtzman and Patty are hilarious. Holtzman has a fantastic scene that made my inner- 8 year old want to start planning my Halloween costume around her. It was an amazing experience watching a movie where the 4 main characters are women, no one is dressed/designed to appeal as eye candy, they just going through the movie being hilarious and bad ass as very normal looking women. I'd absolutely go see this movie again.</fullReview>

Something I remember fondly as dumb fun with what were at the time pretty impressive special effects.But why remake it? Was it that much of a great idea that it needed to be done? Why? Who sat down in a big Hollywood office with their checkbook and decided that this just HAD to be made again?And if you did decide that, why did you make it so very, very badly?Every actor in this looks embarrassed to be there, and is either incredibly annoying on screen, or, even worse for a comedy, completely lacking in any humour! It just is not funny. And the stereotypes are cringe worthy. I'm also at a loss as to why it is funny to hate on men, but the same kind of humour from males hating on women is something that just feels dated and sexist. Are they trying to right the wrongs of the past? Yes there have been a lot of sexist movies that make jokes at the expense of gender or sexuality - and we should have moved on from them.Why rehash the same gags and sexist ideas, but point them at men? It wasn't cool in the past when women were the punchline, and it isn't cool or funny now that they switch this and make men the butt of the joke.This is a massive fail, and I'd have to say the cast knew. You can just sense they are rushing through this turkey in their hurry to get to the bank and start work on something else.I lasted about 35 minutes, and I felt like it had been two hours. I highly recommend you go get the original, and watch that, and pretend that this whole thing never happened.And if you do watch it - try hard not to think about the millions and millions of dollars they spent to do this so poorly. Somebody call me when there is a new idea out there. In the mean time, if you see a movie that says 'remake', maybe just DON'T BOTHER and stick to watching the originals, or go see something new and not a remake.Hollywood has honestly run out of ideas if they think this is the way to make money and produce content people want to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ghostbusters: An exciting popcorn film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, I am being deadly serious for anyone who is reading this in disbelief. Paul Feig's latest project has been slated since the release of it's trailer. It was even slated before then when it was announced it would be lead by a female cast rather the four male formula the original ghostbuster films relied on. However I remained optimistic as the haters slated the newly regenerated franchise. And I am glad I did, the film is honours the original two films in a very different style of comedy and tone. The new Ghostbusters film is very fast paced and does not have any scenes which you can say are boring or should not of featured in the film. Everything feels right, the flow is excellent. It is a very different style from the old films, it has Feig's stamp all over it showing his style of comedy which is of course showcased by his two golden girls Mellisa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig. The structure of the film and the way that the plot has been pieced together makes this version of ghostbusters seem very fresh and original especially with the groups dynamic. Feig's two newbies, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones are the two diamonds that shine in th spotlight of this film. Leslie brings brilliant comedy to the movie with her brilliant delivery and her sassy attitude. Kate brings a very different aura to the film that is not seen really in any film franchise, she brings a weird quirky character that the audience loves, with great humour and also can really kick some ass. McKinnon is brilliant and hopefully we will see her in much more after this debut. Also Chris Hemsworth is hilliariously funny as receptionist Kevin, his stupidity in this film really works well and structures some of the funniest scenes in the film. Plus seeing him possessed is even funnier.Even though the reboot has so much new energy and originality that doesn't say that you can't tell that it's related to the old films. I mean all the original ghostbusters are featured within this film. And yes even the late Harold Ramis was represented through a golden statue that featured in one of the first scenes. Bill Murray was given a reasonably humorous role, Dan Aykroyd was given a role which had the line everyone was waiting for and even Ernie Hudson featured in the final scene as a character mentioned throughout the film. Not only that, here was a few familiar ghosts *cough* slimer *cough*. We even seen the ghostbusters receptionist Annie Potts drop by in a scene as (no surprise) a receptionist. But there was definitely a connection to the old films and you couldn't separate this film from them. Basically this film is not what anyone was expecting and it certainly isn't what all the haters are making it out to be. It is an upbeat film that I love, it has a brilliant cast, talented director, strong storyline and it is definitely just as good as or even better than the original.Also anyone who has an issue with the fact that it's an all female cast or it has an African female lead should go pick another franchise to watch because producers and actors from the original ghostbusters has welcomed this film and cast with open arms and is proud of it. So is the original director who's is a producer in this film. If the people who worked tirelessly to bring this work to you originally approve of the reboot then why shouldn't you? Especially if it's got anything to do with not appreciating diversity within the film industry. The all female cast works very well with the storyline and also the overall flow of the film and I would much rather see Wiig, Jones, McCarthy and McKinnon than Tatum, Efron, Johnson and Hart. Also if race has something to do with it then why did you watch this franchise in the first place seeing as we had Ernie Hudson in the first film, that should of stopped this franchise gathering racist scum poisoning their opinion onto our beloved franchise. Leslie Jones is one of the best talents within this film and at points shines brighter than the well experienced Mellisa McCarthy. The slating that has been seen recently towards her his disgusting. Her performance was great and so natural, why give the girl such a hard time? Y'all be jealous that's why.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why so many hate this movie. I thought it was amazing. I have been waiting for a 3rd Ghostbusters for over 20 years. I did wonder how the writers were going to pull off women as Ghostbusters, but I went in with an open mind and I must say, they definitely pulled it off. The 4 leading cast were a great combination and they countered each others personality well. It was extremely funny and I enjoyed every minute of the movie. The lead in was great and it just got better from there. Having Chris Hemsworth in it was a good combination. The effects were spectacular and I loved the story line. I will go back and see this again, probably in 3D this time. Recommendation- Stay until the very end of the credits and don't listen to what all these close minded people have said. These people made up their minds before they even saw the movie. Have an open mind and enjoy yourself and you will see the movie for how it really is. Great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A below average unnecessary remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So this film has been talked about allot recently but I have now seen the new Ghostbusters film and yeah this film isn't very good. The premise sees four women attempt to stop new York from being taken over by ghosts. Melissa McCarthy, Kristen wigg, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones are the Ghostbusters and there all alright in this film. I thought they had decent chemistry together and were sometimes funny. Its just I didn't really care about them as individual characters and I didn't think anyone stood out enough to truly care. Chris hemsworth plays Kevin there assistant and he does a good job as the funny bumbling idiot that works well with the girls. Unfortunately, though the villain is just very cliché and over the top making him completely useless and pointless to the plot of this film. The story in the film is incredibly simple and messy. It just has nothing to it, the characters don't develop at all and the main villain plot doesn't make entire sense. The script has some funny dialogue in it, it just never got me truly laughing too much. Also the dramatic moments all feel forced in the film. The style has some cool action scenes with some decent cgi ghosts involved. However, the film is overly long and the pacing of this film is a bit all over the place. Overall I don't think this film is as bad as everyone expected but it isn't worth seeing especially if you are a fan of the material.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never, ever, EVER had to pause a movie partway through SO many times out of frustration, dread, shock, disgust, cringing, eye rolling, and anger. I had to almost force myself to resume where I left off and continue watching this abomination of a movie to completion. I am a man, I've seen and loved the original Ghostbusters, and I have NO problem whatsoever with the all-female Ghostbusters team; NONE whatsoever! The characters, writing, direction, these are the trinity of horrific elements that make this pathetically feeble attempt at breathing new life into a beloved movie franchise a complete and utter failure.I feel sorry for the remaining members of the original Ghostbusters who were stuck having to participate in their brief little cameos. They seemed cardboard cutout "characters" and despite their best efforts they didn't seem pleased to be there; it's as if they wore their inner cringe on their sleeves in every scene.Condolences to the late, talented Harold Ramis, whose RPM spinning in his grave has ratcheted up several notches thanks to this disgrace.Shame on you, Sony Pictures, Katie Dippold, Paul Feig, Amy Pascal, and whomever else thought this would be a good idea. You were DEAD wrong, so much so that the "ghost" of a memory this abomination will hopefully very quickly become would be perfectly happy to remain on the 7th plane of Hell rather than on the same plane this GHOSTBUSTED piece of garbage is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not expect this movie to supersede the original 84 version in any way because the original Ghostbusters is just one of those movies that's impossible to improve upon. It is set in stone and not to be tampered with. I did however at least expect a decent reboot but I think this movie failed miserably. It could really have been done much better. None of the characters really intrigued me. The only redeeming snippets in the movie were the three cameos of Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Ernie Hudson. I'm really glad I did not pay to watch this movie as my friend kindly paid for us. I absolutely don't recommend wasting time with this one. It seriously is a stinker. Wait for it to come on TV or Netflix or something. I think I'm going to go and watch my blu-ray copy of the original Ghostbusters to help me forget this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ghostbusters Gets Girl Empowered (and not man-hating either)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Was this a man-hating cartoonish reboot? No. In the 80s, no one seemed to have a problem with Peter Venkmann creepily stalking of Dana. Let's consider how Dana was treated in the original film. She asks for help when she discovers a hell beast in her fridge. Venkmann comes over to examine everything in her apartment except the fridge but including her bedroom. He stands too close. He doesn't listen. He makes inappropriate comments. He just wants to get in her pants. Eventually, she shoves him out but later accepts his offer to go on a date. Huh? Later, a demon possesses Dana's body, makes her proposition her body and make out with one guy and subsequently causes her to have sex with a neighbor guy she dislikes - yet this is a "joke" for the movie. I didn't know sexual assault by any means (in this case, by the supernatural) was a joke. Don't get me wrong, I grew up on the Ghostbusters movie and cartoon. I remember quoting Bill Murray often ("...dogs and cats living together... mass hysteria!"), and I don't think that movie would have been as successful without Bill Murray's oft ad-libbed lines. But let's be fair when we compare these movies, shall we? If this is considered man-hating, the original should be considered woman-hating. The original had an all-male team with a female villain who was wearing a bubbly outfit and high heels. Interesting. Kind of like this film as an all-female team and a male villain? Not sure how that's man-hating. More like completely turning the tables. Also of note, have the 50 different Spiderman reboots ruined the franchise? No. Batman reboots? No. So this should not be considered a franchise killer either.I was thoroughly entertained by this movie. It was funny, it was well cast, it had special effects that worked with the technology used, and it had some kick butt moments. But one of my favorite aspects was the fact that a group of four women were the main characters in an action film.Growing up, I saw groupings/teams of men who saved the day with maybe a "girl" or two as a sidekick: the A-Team, the original Ghostbusters, Back to the Future, Star Trek (original and somewhat TNG), Battlestar Galactica, Indiana Jones, Knight Rider, He-Man, X-Men, Smurfs, GI Joe... *sigh* Very few movies, TV shows, or cartoons had more than one female (or any) helping to overcome the odds. Typically females were blonde bombshells who screamed and needed to be rescued (i.e., the super annoying Vicky Vale in Batman).These women are not always pretty, and they do not mind getting messy. They dress in jumpsuits and casual clothes. They're intelligent. They dive headlong into their work and are not waylaid by danger (or threats from the mayor). And check out the movie posters! Is anyone turned around showing off their butt or zipping down their suits? NO! Because women are more than just the display of their parts! Sorry, that got a little crude there? I'm just really excited about women as scientists. Talk about new ground being broken! I felt like I could relate to the different characters, more than just one, and I could see my friends as other characters. I mean, those thoughts alone were like revelations. Look at that: me and my girls could bust some ghosts instead of be a romantic interest in some other hero's action movie (though if it's Captain America doing the asking - call me!). There were many excellent scenes that built up the characters and their relationships. And the scene where the team interviews Kevin (Chris Hemsworth) is fantastic. Everything with Wiig trying to flirt with Hemsworth cracked me up (because that would so be me - all awkward and geeky). Yet there was no need for a romantic subplot in this movie. Those scenes were just fun. The story focused on the team working together to uncover who was bringing ghosts into the city and why.While the main villain is not terribly scary, this movie doesn't pretend he is either. The villain is unveiled very early on. Is his motivation earth-shattering or full of depth and backstory? No, but neither is the movie. It's a good balance of serious and funny moments.Plus, the women kick ass at the end. I loved the proton whips that came out, the musical score rising in awesomeness, and ghosts being sent back to their maker. I enjoyed how the proton packs were used a little differently not only to catch but also to throw ghosts out of the way. I liked the team using skills with their physical weapons along with their intelligence to defeat the main villain. There are great dynamics and humor between the four women, and the relationship building adds to the appeal of the film.This movie re-invents a franchise and has a good time doing so. I felt it was done well. I'm waving my nerd flag high! Rock on, Ghostbusters. I hope to see you again. It's not going to be hard to surpass Ghostbusters II! Because women can be comedy and action stars too.Full review posted at: http://teasippinnerdymom.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reboot of classic 80s' comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original was an iconic part of cinema from the 80s, a movie which actually managed to live up to its big hype, budget and comic star filled cast. So, I went into this reboot with a little trepidation.I was quite pleasantly surprised. Like the original, it had a little bit of set up to do, but similarly it soon delivered with plenty of laughs and fun. From the trailers I thought there might be great slabs of material cut and pasted with a new skin, but the reboot manages to give just enough nods to the original while standing firmly on its own feet.The story was a little tighter than the original; e.g. the supernatural macguffin being more accessible than in the original ("...entire roof cap is made out of a magnesium-tungsten alloy").The original cast's performance certainly left big shoes to fill, the current actors did a great job in filling them (despite the pre-emptive howls from the bloggertariate). The group dynamic, if not the individual performances, were an improvement on original.If I had one criticism (yes, I know that you Reddit users have about 420,000 more) it is the obviously deleted scene cut for(presumably valid) timing reasons did jar a little.</fullReview>

I was initially not going to see this in theaters until one of my friends invited me to go see it with a group of people. I think the cast worked really great together, it was really funny to see Chris Hemsworth in a supporting role. I loved him as Kevin. I'd like to see other major actors take on smaller ish roles, its really fun. Also major props to Paul Feig for letting another hilarious out of the box. I've loved his previous movies (bridesmaids, the heat) and I didn't know until recently that he actually worked on both the Office and Arrested Development which makes a lot of sense because this guy knows funny!!!I know there's a lot of negative reviews but honestly I think its a movie that is definitely worth to see in theaters, it does justice to the ghosbusters movie franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Just Fun As Hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure we all know why so many people insist that the film is trash. It's female driven. I guess some men are too sensitive to handle women as the stars, or maybe the few jokes about men in the film hurt their feelings. Who knows? I don't. All I know is that I'm not gonna wax political here, I'll just tell you that it's a solid comedy with a sense of humor pretty reminiscent of the original. The CGI was great and just cartoonish enough to walk the line between fun and convincing. The script was good, and made better by the delivery of the actresses (McKinnon in particular was a gem). Chris Hemsworth was a great addition and was funnier than I thought he'd be given his lack of comedic roles. I'm giving it a 10 for the sheer joy I had watching it. It's just fun as f*** and that's what a comedy in this vein should be. Kudos to everyone involved in making it.Overall, I laughed a hell of a lot and I hope other studios take note: female driven films need to be 100 times more common than they are right now because I think most people are tired of seeing the same five white guys play the same five characters in every comedy ten times a year. It's old, guys. Anything you do over and over again is old. Make more films like this, though maybe not another reboot or remake. I miss original screenplays. But I digress. Just give me more women on screen.TLDR; If you wanna have a good time and laugh for a good couple hours, go see this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie does not deserve all the hate it's been getting. It was genuinely funny and refreshing. I see a lot of people getting butt hurt about how the jokes aren't funny, but they are to the audience that this movie is pertaining to: women. Not only do we see all the main roles of the movie filled by women, but we get to see a refreshing flip of the blond, bimbo stereotype filled by Chris Hemsworth. I don't see this movie as sexist at all. Actually, there is a certain fondness for the blonde bimbo (Kevin) typically seen towards overly sexualized women in other movies. I don't see this movie doing anything more sexist in other comedies where women are just lusted after and don't have a real purpose. Actually, the main reason this movie is so refreshing is we get to see women whose purpose is greater than getting over a breakup, finding a man, finding love, etc. We see women as real people, not just as minor characters or objects of lust and that is what I really love about this reboot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the most refreshingly original, yet lovingly-referential-to-its-predecessor reboot of a cult classic that I've ever seen. It has enough verve and fresh humor to stand on its own merit, yet just enough original-cast cameos and satisfyingly clever nods to the 1984 version to ensure that it's on point.If the almost complete lack of male gaze in this film is what's gotten almost every previous reviewer's panties in a twist, then I'm laughing all the way to the end of this write-up. They've all proved just how successfully this film has achieved its aims. When your four female protagonists are, in no particular order, a queer neuroatypical scientist-slash-engineer, a confidently nerdy local-history buff of color, and a pair of academics who, in addition to having faced bullies together in their teenage years, also continue to face workplace bullying for both gender and research-interest reasons, the bottom line is that it's stellar representation. When you add to this the fact that their character development and interactions with each other are not only cleverly and sensitively written, but also downright hilarious, I absolutely fail to see how this film could be counted as a failure.There's been a real dearth of truly fun, worthwhile, and socially relevant summer blockbusters in recent years. This remake is a breath of fresh air and (as the majority of the user reviews on this page amply demonstrate) a rollicking, status-quo-challenging kick in the pants for those who indisputably need it.</fullReview>

Chris Hemsworth has probably been waiting in eager anticipation to play a role like this and he's made the most of it here. Stay tuned for more of his hilarious vamping through the credits. So fun to see cameos of the original cast - clearly giving their blessing to this clever reboot of a classic. Though I noticed what I thought were two editing errors (McKinnon's reaction shots in an alleyway and one other place, seem amiss for the action and were likely poor editing choices), I am still giving this film a 10. First because I love the new casting and second, because so many people have bashed the film BECAUSE women were cast in the leads. And bashing a film for that is just silly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie the day it came out, and I, my boyfriend, and all hundred or so people in the movie theater laughed our asses off for the whole movie, credit bonuses and all. Kate McKinnon is a treasure, and the entire cast was phenomenal. There wasn't a single dud joke in the entire film. This movie is a wickedly good time, and I fully intend to see it again in theaters. To the men (and it is almost entirely men) who have been complaining about this movie for one reason or another for months before its release, I'd just like to say: the franchise isn't ruined. Women can be comedy action stars, and be them insanely well. Don't believe me? WATCH THE DAMN MOVIE. And seriously, if you think one movie with an all-female primary cast is a death knell for the genre, you should know that for us women, this is the most refreshing change of scenery we've had in decades, with 85% of top-grossing movies featuring male protagonists. So go ahead: buy an absurdly large pickup truck. Carry boulders up a mountain. Drink 30 beers at once, whatever it takes to piece back together your fragile masculinity, because guess what? This is a thing now. Women make up 51% of the world's population and 52% of the movie-going audience. We contributed a full 50% of the total box office revenue in 2014. And we like stuff other than rom-coms (no disrespect to rom-coms).Deal with it.</fullReview>

The ladies play to their comedic strengths with characters that sort of reflect their personalities and there are several laugh out loud moments. The plot was okay, not worse but also not better when compared to the original. The exaggerated visual effects that are very characteristic to the franchise were well placed, just like the appearances of original cast members. It's not the best movie of the year, but then again neither were the originals when they were released. Even though some people say they don't see the point of this movie being remade, specially with women, I really hope the trend of remaking the classics with a female cast continues because little girls deserve to have characters they can look up to that is a reflection of themselves, just like little boys have been for so long. And for the love of god stop whining and trying to find reasons not to like it. Just embrace the awesomeness that are funny women.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a great surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard about this movie's production (about a year ago), I was excited to hear that ghostbusters was getting a remake and pumped that there would be female ghostbusters. What can I say? As a young woman growing up in a liberal environment, I am often disappointed at how the media often portrays women as two- dimensional and weak. "At least," I thought, "There will be some rad women kicking some ghost butt." However, when the trailer came out and I saw Chris Hemsworth, I became worried. I figured that the movie would take the safe approach that would guarantee support from the masses of men: they would have the ladies do much of the work, but in the end, it would be the man saving the day.When I saw the movie today, I was pleasantly surprised. Not only were all four women extremely three-dimensional, with wildly different personalities and lifestyles, but the movie used the stereotypical model of a "pretty and dumb female secretary" and turned it around on men (Chris Hemsworth's character).Now, of course, many men are not happy about that and many other parts of the film. There were several jokes about men and defeating the "boss ghost" involved shooting it in the crotch. But in a world of gratuitous strip scenes (Alice in "Star Trek Into Darkness"), only wanting women after they've been "beautified" (Laney in "She's All That"), woman constantly needing to be saved (I don't think I even need to give an example because so many come to mind but "Transformers"), and myriad jokes at the expense of women ("Jurassic World" comes to mind), I think it's okay for men to be the butt of the jokes this time.Having said that, I understand that many men do not hold the above stereotypes about women and I think that said men (or anyone tbh) would really enjoy the cleverness of this remake. My little brother totally loved the cameos of the original ghostbusters and the "realllly cool guns and stuff" (his words, not mine).This is just my opinion, but I found it inspiring and totally rad that the 4 women didn't need men to help them defeat the bad guys. Also I like how each of the women was totally different from the other 3, yet none of them mocked or ridiculed the others for their hair, clothes, body, sexuality etc etc etc. I can honestly say that I have not laughed as hard as I did in this movie for a very long time, and I will definitely be going to see it again in the future. This is a movie that will be having a whole new generation shouting WHO YOU GONNA CALL?!?!?!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film doesn't take itself too seriously or follow the original in any serious way, but is instead a beautifully funny homage to the original that is done SO well. I really can't see how anyone coming out of this movie could have anything bad to say about it.OK if I think about mainstream taste versus alternative taste perhaps this film was just too happy and tongue in cheek for the general populous. It's not even a remake, it's more of an addition to the series and it's so humorous. The effects are awesome and colourful like joy in a can and the changes are crazy. The only other reasons I can see for not liking this movie is an expectation of seeing the original redone in the exact same way with new effects.That or some people can't stand to see the jarring difference of women actually playing great roles for a change. Which while I'm on it, I do enjoy the recent bouts of chick comedies so maybe that explains why I got the humour. I love it. Balls to the wall crazy.I will admit there were a couple moments that missed the beat for me for a moment, basically when things had to get serious for a moment and I didn't want to stop laughing or when they had to stick to a moment from the original film and not play it for laughs. But those moments were rare and very soon put back on track.One other thought is that I don't like most remakes of late, so if you do like remakes maybe this is the wrong kind of remake for you. Rather than making everything darker and more serious as most become, it does the complete opposite. Don't see it as a remake or reboot, but a lot of fun. Also yes the villain is a bit scooby doo but I can let that go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't listen to the reviews on here. Seriously</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To keep things short and sweet: the movie was entertaining, funny, and a good way to spend a night out. It's not the worst thing to hit theaters in years, despite what the reviewers on here seem to think. And of course it's not the best thing, either. But was the first Ghostbusters some sort of cinematic masterpiece that no comedy film will ever live up to? No. It was an entertaining comedy film- nothing more, nothing less. Just like this one. If the sequel didn't ruin things for you, the remake won't either. I promise. I know people are upset that the movie has been recast and redone for 2016, and I feel a lot of that has to do with the fact that it's an all woman recast (because let's be real). But all the original (living) cast members showed up to make cameos, which I'm sure they wouldn't have bothered with if they didn't think the movie would be good. So please, go see the movie for yourself before making any snap decisions about how awful you think it is. I promise, it's nowhere near as awful as the online reviews make it look!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After hearing nothing but that the movie had bad reviews, I decided to look up these reviews I was hearing so much about. I surprised to note that almost every bad review included something about gender (which really shouldn't be a factor in movie-going experience). So, I decided to go see the movie, ready for it to suck. I was astonished to find myself laughing throughout the movie! Not only were each of the leads well thought out and well rounded, they were all genuinely delightful. This may not be the best comedy of all time, but it is certainly the best movie I've seen in recent years. I highly suggest going to see this movie. Not only to prove our society has moved past the 1940s, but also because it is truly hilarious and action packed.Admittedly, two or three jokes are woman specific, but it is much friendlier to both genders than the original Ghostbusters movies. The male characters in the movie are also well rounded and genuinely funny as well. Seriously, go see this movie. You'll be gasping in fright moments before you are rolling out of your seat in laughter. It was honestly excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not all the jokes land, but I laughed out loud and the end CGI is fantastic. There's some terrific call backs to the original including cameos. I saw it in a crowded theater and people were cheering and laughing, especially during the climax. So, open your mind and heart and go see it if you are so inclined, and take a kid who is interested in STEM, too. Kate McKinnon is the standout as the group's "M" who invents their equipment and handles the ridiculous science babble with ease. Leslie Jones takes a character that could have been a stereotype and makes her a funny type with layers. Liam Hemsworth has a lot to do as the dim-bulb receptionist, and he handles physical comedy really, really well along side four women who have made their careers doing so. Some of the humor is deeply, deeply weird - including an extended homage to Patrick Swayze's career - and I appreciate a movie this big willing to go that strange.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movies today and I absolutely LOVED it! I'm a fan of the originals and this one honestly had the same vibe. The characters were likable and smart. It was honestly so refreshing to see female leads that had some serious brain power. Holtzmann is an instant favorite! I've seen a lot of guys on here whining about how the movie "hates on men". No, it doesn't. The men making these statements are the same ones who came on here to rate it before the movie even came out. All this film did, was reverse the roles. The women were the leads and the powerful ones while 2 men (TWO, out of the whole film) were given roles that are 99.999% of the time given to women. If you want a movie with a good story that makes you feel nostalgic all over, YOU NEED TO SEE THIS! 3/4 of the Original Ghostbusters say it's amazing, and I completely agree. :)</fullReview>

It doesn't make sense, after all, they were the stars.Now, after months of marketing and showings, the movie is being renamed for its release on DVD. This is one of the worst remakes, a Razzie nominee for sure. A true piece of crap. How did this get greenlit? Purely for the checks, apparently!

		<shortDescription>Nothing Special, unfortunately</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read the novel first, on a five hour plane flight. The novel was awful... absolutely the worst book I've ever read through.I felt that the author was a good writer. And the first chapter, depicting the haunted tour encounter, that was genuinely good. But the rest of the book was dreck. By page 60 I needed to put it down for an hour. By halfway through I wanted to rip the book in half. But I forced myself through, hoping for a payoff ending that never came.Based on the novel, I was definitely not going to see the movie. But someone I follow and respect greatly on Twitter was all but begging people to see it. Ultimately, I went.The movie did one thing very well.The part that I hated the most was the theme of "ghost girl". Erin had a horrible run-in with a recurring ghost as a child, and when she told the kids at school, she got tagged 'ghost girl' and mocked endlessly, particularly by an "alpha nerd" stereotype who wouldn't let her live it down. I'm a nerd, and /I/ wanted to punch this kid's lights out. ;) So how did the movie do that right? It's gone. There's no alpha nerd subplot. There's only one scene where the 'ghost girl' backstory comes up, and it's clean and sensible. Three cheers for editing!The second most annoying part of the story is Erin's fear of losing her academic tenure over her ghost history. Not only is it difficult to believe, it is constantly pushed in the reader's face as her sole motivation.The movie did use this subplot, but again, it was downplayed. Kudos again for the cutting room floor.The climatic battle in the book began with a massive dance number involving the NYPD and military forces. This was cut and put over top of the end credits. CONGRATULATIONS EDITOR, that was a brilliant move! Over the end credits, it was actually pretty amusing.So with those things fixed, what's the problem? Unfortunately, the problem was both on the screen and off the screen.On the screen, the problem was that the movie just wasn't very good. I don't understand the complaints over the SFX, because I thought that was fine. But the story just dragged. It couldn't decide when to stand on its own and when to pay homage to the original. When it did pay homage, it wasn't terribly well done. The only parts that I found funny (and I found it so in the novel as well) was Kevin being dim. That should have been offensive (especially in a movie supposedly so sensitive to sexism), but it was funny.So far as the characters went, they were all 'okay'. Patty was definitely better in the novel with a little more understanding of what was going on in her head, but like many I question why she needed to come off a stereotypical 80's street-smart type.It was like a mediocre fan fiction put to film, and that's unfortunate. Like many, I'd have loved a new Ghostbusters that rocked. In the end, I walked out thinking it was okay. It wouldn't land on my shelf but I didn't mind that I'd seen it. It would have been fun with a group of friends and maybe a RiffTrax will do it justice someday. ;) The second and much more unfortunate part was the off-screen drama. Nobody deserved to get beat up over this movie and it's sad that the worst of the internet went after the actresses, but everything got blown way out of proportion. I went to the theater myself feeling like I'd been bullied into going. Nobody who wasn't a troll of some sort cared that the Ghostbusters were female. It sounded cool to me... we were going to have to have a new team anyway. Without Egon I didn't care who they were. ;) But the poor response to the trailers led to an amazing back and forth that only hurt the movie in the long run. I believe they could have done a lot better if they had just shut up before release and not fanned the internet flames into a fury. All the fans would have gone, bad trailer or not.I also have to recognize the review a few below mine that reviews the /reviews/, and notes the people behind them. I looked for myself and all I have to say is that it looks pretty obvious. Shame.Back to the movie, for characters... Kevin was good - well played and not quite overdone. Holtzman was enjoyable to watch, except for the very first crude joke. But once I got to know her more she was easy to forgive for her raw enthusiasm (in addition her weapons, which played poorly in the book, were much more enjoyable on screen). Patty was actually pretty decent beyond the stereotype-enforcement scenes because of the raw energy she put into the character. The others felt kind of flat... particularly the tension between Erin and Abby was only awkward at best. It flowed a lot better once they were past that phase. The much touted cameos -- well, I only recognized Bill Murray, and I thought it funny that they put him in the role of doubter. But his whole character felt called in too, and ultimately didn't have much impact on anything. Aykroyd's cameo actually made me laugh, it was well delivered, I just didn't recognize him at the time.I scored a 6 out of 10 because it was just that overall - just mediocre. Certainly in the judge-for-yourself category.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melissa McCarthy is the worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected a feminism driven movie, I got a heavily feminism driven movie. The "jokes" fall flat with few exceptions, some are racist and some are pure feminist men-hating jokes. Which is probably also the reason why they made Chris Hemsworth as dumb as a caveman in this one. They basically allowed him to be able to speak the same language, that's it. Surprisingly, not even IMDb lists him in the main-cast list without having to follow the "See full cast" link. The actual "story" is extremely short. The writers waste most of the time assembling the crew, which doesn't even make any sense at all. The character "Patty" for example just quits her job at the New York metro to join Ghostbusters after meeting them ONCE.This movie seems like it was written, produced and directed by Melissa McCarthy herself because she's desperately trying to be the center of attention every scene she's in. I don't even want to know how she got to play the role in the first place. Certainly not because of her talent as an actress. Probably because she's a feminist herself so the feminists behind this movie wanted someone to represent. And just like feminism this movie disappoints. All other actors were OK, the character Patty was actually funny at times, despite what I read about her in another review. All-in-all it felt like the actual ghost-busting was 5 minutes at the end and that's it. The rest was just preparing the stage for it. Bad writing..My advice: save your money, watch it on TV when you're bored and there's nothing else on and you won't regret it. If you pay for it you will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There really aren't many positives that I can think of for this movie. I chuckled a couple of times, but most of the time I was thinking 'what the hell is this?'. I can't believe this came from the same writer that wrote for Freaks and Geeks, and the same director from Bridesmaids. I don't even know who the target audience is, the humour is so juvenile that only a very young child could laugh at it, but it also contains a few swear words, so who is it for exactly? The ghosts are terrible, they look like The Haunted Mansion ghosts, or a Scooby Doo movie. I'm very disappointed in Wiig and McCarthy, I really liked Wiig in everything I've seen her in except this, and I've been a fan of Mike and Molly since the show's start. I'm honestly flabbergasted that this got made. Considering that most sequels are worse than their original counterpart I think that if they made a sequel to this drivel that it could possibly be the new worst movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Politically Feministic Gender Propaganda: Nail to all coffins edition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ghostbusters 2016 doesn't exist to entertain anyone as a movie. It was Sony's ticket to start off a gender war and get free advertisement from far left media, internet activist and all sort of people who were easy to be manipulated and used for Sony's own benefit. Some call it a movie. I call it a bait. They created content which is very hateful, triggering and all in all offensive towards anyone who even stands in the political middle ground. This caused a chain reaction where people who got mad and offended by the content made some other people mad and offended for getting mad and offended. This made even more people mad and offended because it totally isn't okay to get mad and offended just because some other people got mad and offended from these other guys getting mad and offended. The result being that feminists, sjw's and leftist media now hate on movie fans, and rest of the world hates feminists even more for thinking anyone who doesn't like bad movies is a misogynistic racist. All this because person A doesn't like person B's favorite movie. Pretty funny yo.Since this movie isn't a real movie, I will not rate it. Here are some other ratings, though:0/10 for bringing more political bs into the movie industry. Seriously, I am watching movies to be entertained. Not so I can hate the world as much as you Edgy ducks do. Cut your wrists in silence, leave me out of it, bro.11/10 for making the world hate far left feminists. You did that well. Be proud.0/10 for provoking leftist media into writing more propaganda. Why would you do that? The last thing we want is seeing hate-based clickbaits. 11/10 for Sony making the most hated movie trailer ever. Not just everyone can make people start lifelong boycott based to 2 minutes video. That's amazing. 0/10 for having 0 respect towards movie industry and old franchises.11/10 for doing it with a franchise I don't care about.Another perfect 11/10 to Paul Feig who has now officially gone lower than any other person before. Good job. End of ratings now. Time to watch some movies that are actually movies. Like Sharknado 3.</fullReview>

I mean, the original Ghostbusters movie wasn't the best movie ever, but it was better structured and, the most important thing, was a shocking new film that we had the lucky to enjoy in the 80s. This is a 2016 reboot of that movie, and believe me, they'd been done better... Awful script, bad acting, unfunny, very bad jokes and quite predictable story. Kids didn't love it at all and grown-ups had a divided opinion.

		<fullReview>I remember when major Ghostbusters fans were outraged when Columbia Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures released the new trailer for Paul Feig's reboot of Ghostbusters. I was one of the few people who was giving it a chance before it was released because Paul Feig has had some terrible trailers turned into great movies like Bridesmaids and Spy. When I saw this movie, it was great! The story may go through some of the plot points of the original Ghostbusters, but makes up for it with great effects, funny characters, plenty of laughs and jump scares. The acting was phenomenal with great performances by Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Leslie Jones, and especially Kate McKinnon as the 4 main ghostbusters. Chris Hemsworth really stood out as Kevin, the handsomest, yet the dumbest secretary. The cameos were also pretty good from Bill Murray, Dan Akyroyd, Ernie Hudson, and a few others. I highly recommend this movie! Ghostbusters (2016) is a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ghostbusters reboot. Oh boy. I heard a whole bunch of bad things about this movie before watching it so i had low expectations, and i was right. It's a below average movie with some cringe-worthy humor that doesn't work most of the time. It does in some parts of the movie though. Although the actors do a fine job i think it's the writers fault for the flop. Since the story and the awful villain are a big part of what makes this movie bad. A few cons among a lot of 'em: The characters. They are very boring and uninteresting characters that make you not care for what happens during the movie and that's not really a good thing. Secondly some parts of the comedy in this movie makes you cringe so hard since they are trying way to hard to be funny in some parts. (This movie has a fart joke) yeah... It's bad, and thirdly is the extremely lame ending. It does however have pretty good effects and visual quality when it comes to ghosts and rays. The movie isn't nowhere near the classic when it comes to fun and characters. Don't waste your money on this.</fullReview>

It really was a parody of the older version and the goofy ghosts were kid friendly while still being unpredictable. You will see some wonderful surprises as well.

		<fullReview>This movie was so hilarious. I laughed out loud the entire time. The comedy is classic and not at all the crude, ridiculous stuff you see in a lot of comedies these days. The script is chalk-full of great moments that the cast absolutely capitalizes on. The cast (particularly Kate McKinnon) milks every last DROP out of their performances. These ladies deliver excellent comedy alongside endearing moments of friendship. The special effects for the ghosts are strangely beautiful while also being creepy and goofy--basically, the ghosts are super cool. And the ghost-busting gadgets are bad-ass; they make the fight scenes really interesting and varied. All of this, of course, is made even better by the female empowerment that goes on the entire film! The women in this movie are intelligent, creative, brave, and POWERFUL, all while goofing around with a bunch of green slime. If you're looking for a fun summer movie that breaks from the misogynistic mold of most movies, this is the ONE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot of fun, it felt like the Ghostbusters to me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really like the Ghostbusters franchise. And I don't mean that like some people, who mean they loved it when they were little and still love the movie now as they look back on it through the rosy tint of nostalgia. I cannot be like that; I didn't see Ghostbusters until I was a teenager, and I did not love the film until I was a young adult. However, once I click with a story, I never let it go and tend to pursue it beyond its most famous and mainstream component. In this case that involved watching "Ghostbusters 2," playing "Ghostbusters: The Video Game," watching all of "The Real Ghostbusters" and "Extreme Ghostbusters," and reading every single one of the IDW comics from "The Other Side" all the way to the most recent issue of "Ghostbusters International." Oh, and I also have a pair of Ecto Goggles which I clip onto my pistol belt and wear with a Ghostbuster zip-up shirt I made with a name badge, no-ghost patch on the right sleeve, pocket on the left sleeve, and velcro fasteners on the cuffs. Those are my credentials, that's the kind of person I am. So the big question is, "What did I think of this reboot?" This remake of Ghostbusters made me laugh a lot, and I liked the characters. While one of the main characters is clearly drawn to Chris Hemsworth's character Kevin, she is not persistently/creepily perusing him in the same way that Venkman does to Dana in the 1984 film. In fact, she actually keeps enough possession of her sanity to not be mindlessly blown away by his muscles and good looks and instead suggests they not hire him because he would clearly be a horrible secretary. Setting her attraction aside, the movie did not have a romantic subplot, and I think that is fantastic. We got a bit of backstory for a few of the characters, which is more than we can say for the original Ghostbusters film. And despite the trailers' best efforts to convince everyone that Patty was a certain overused character type, I was able to enjoy the character as she actually is in the movie, where she is quite the history buff and actually seems pretty laid-back a lot of the time. The ghosts felt much more dangerous than they did in the original two Ghostbusters films. For the first time I really felt like this was a potentially lethal line of work *before* we got to the the main enemy at the end of the movie. Some of the ghostbusting sequences were very cool, maybe too cool if you want this movie to be just like the one from 1984, but I think the sillier moments help to balance that out. (There are some situations only Ghostbuster type action heroes find themselves in because all the uber-cool heroes like James Bond somehow manage to avoid being smushed by gigantic parade balloons and the like.) There were new weapons for the Ghostbusters to use against the ghosts in this film, but I was surprised to find I was okay with that. I suspect this is because I have become accustomed to similar versions of several of them in the fantastic IDW comics continuing the adventures of the original Ghostbusters. (In the comics, Egon invents similar grenades and modifies several of the proton packs to include pistol-style firing mechanisms.) If I have one complaint, it is that I do not think the technobabble was as good in this film as it was in the 80's movies.This movie may contain the most entertaining credits I've ever seen, and there was an easter egg waiting for fans of the original movie at the very end. When the lights came on, my first thought was, "I hope they make a sequel," which may make me a terrible person in the eyes of some, but I don't get my opinions secondhand from the "cool" people, I try to think for myself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot of the same charm of the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was funny start to finish with brilliant representation of strong female character. The jokes were on point and had me, and everyone around me laughing throughout the film. I urge you to see the movie for yourself and ignore the obvious bias from MRA's who claim that somehow having four women is sexist while maintaining that the original movie wasn't for having four men. The movie gives a great nod to the original while still standing on its own feet. Kristen Wiig, Melizza McCarthy, Leslie Jones, and Kate McKinnon had great chemistry and were believable in their parts. It was great to see smart women celebrated as hero's and I urge you to see it; if not only to annoy the dude bro nearest you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very outspokenly against this film at first, but i just saw it, and it was AWESOME! They did the original LOTS of justice, and even honored Ramis by dedicating the film to him. The cameos by the original cast were great, the effects were AMAZING, the comedy was excellent, the story was solid (even more so than the first 2 actually) and the prospect of sequels is wide open! Even the credits and musical score were really good! Give it a chance, and ignore the worthless trolls. I'll always love the originals (and the cartoon series) because I grew up with it, but they did an excellent job here. I'm very much looking forward to sequels and I know the studio has more planned with this cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. I loved the cast, I loved the SFX, I loved the dialogue and the jokes. I thought the plot was a bit thin but the chemistry between the main characters more than made up for it.I loved the action sequences. I love McCarthy, Wiig, and Jones. Kate McKinnon in particular steals the show. I sincerely think Holtzmann is hands down the most badass sci-fi chick since River Tam.I know and have known quite a few STEM geek-girls who are exactly- *exactly*- like Holtzmann in the real world. They're genius smart, they're dorky, they're oblivious to social cues and interactions, and they're totally into their work and the world as they see it.Holtzmann's entire reason for existence is to kick some ghost ass. That's her obsession and her life's work. And not even because she's out for revenge or for any dark reason. She's a true nerd: she just wants to see if it can be done. She's absolutely giddy with all the tech she's tweaking and completely in her element in the lab. And when she pulls out her twin handguns in the big melee fight and licks one before proceeding to bust a bunch of balls, I literally pumped my fist and shrieked "YES HAHAHAHA" right out loud in the theater.That and the scene where they walk into the rock concert lobby and she's carrying a huge duffel bag in addition to her proton pack like it's just nothing because she's all biznass, just made me swoon.Now, let's talk about why this movie is getting bashed on the internet and doing poorly.Here's the deal: For whatever reason, a bunch of pale, pasty, friendless internet nutjobs have decided that, because they are powerless in their own lives, they are going to mount an endless, absurd internet hate campaign on a film, simply because they don't like the gender demographic of the cast, so that they can feel like they have control over something. That's just stupid. At the end of the day, the entire cast of this film will still have careers, and your lives will still suck. So good luck with that.It breaks my heart to watch this movie getting shot down in flames by a bunch of worthless, useless internet trolls. Oh well. A lot of my favorite films have been box-office bombs ("Buckaroo Banzai", "Dune", "The Thing", "Serenity"). I'm used to my film heroes getting screwed at the box office. This one in particular just really hurts because this cast deserved so much better. They really poured their guts into their characters. I detest bullying and it infuriates me that a bunch of pale pasty internet scum can influence a deserving group of actors in any way, shape or form. Some people need to be shot, seriously.Honest rating, 7.5 or 8/10. But I gave it 10/10 because the trolls are spamming the rating with 1/10 votes out of sheer spite, so fair's fair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than I ever could have hoped for.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first read the announcement that there would be a Ghostbusters reboot, I was not particularly hopeful. Knowing how reboots go, I was certain that it would end where most reboots do;&nbsp;unliked&nbsp;and eventually forgotten, relegated to five dollar movie bins and late night TV showings. There was a catch, though, and the catch was what kept me interested; it was to be an all-female cast. This seemed too good to be true, and I was excited.&nbsp;From the first moment I realized just how furious many men were about this, I knew I was in this for the long haul, for better or worse. Many detractors would dress up their words, would find ways to make it seem like they weren't just angry because of the female cast, they were just mad that their beloved franchise was being rebooted, because how dare anyone touch a classic like Ghostbusters?&nbsp;But let's be honest here. No franchise is safe in Hollywood today, and far more loved films have already been touched by the remake/reboot/continue story machine. Were you aware, before this, that so many people adored Ghostbusters this much, that so many folks held this movie so dearly? I certainly wasn't. What's so different about this movie being remade that it could spark this level of vitriol? Who knows?&nbsp;I'm kidding. We know. We all know.So I've been waiting, ever since the first announcement was made, for this movie. Often nervous and vaguely worried that I was defending it for nothing, scared that I would see it and be let down, I kept up hope. When the first wave of reviews came out, largely positive, my hope grew. Was it possible the movie would actually live up to my own expectations? There were bad reviews, of course, and for some reason, every single one of these reviewers felt the need to FIRST specify that it WASN'T because they hate women, though this really shouldn't be something you have to specify first when you're reviewing a movie. Many of the good reviews weren't glowing, but there were still a TON of good reviews.So again, I held out hope.The movie was released, and due to circumstances, I couldn't go opening weekend. Friends did, however, and not a single one of them was disappointed. My hope grew. I went shopping for&nbsp;merch, just to see what was out. Target, who many have been pointing to because they discounted their Ghostbusters toys before the film ever came out, had REMOVED the discounts. You could see where they'd pulled the stickers off. That was it, for me. I had to see this movie.&nbsp;I got together a group of friends to see it with, and we went.I adored this film.I was struck almost immediately by how comfortable I felt, how familiar things were. Not in a bad way, but like visiting a loved one you haven't seen in ages. The characters felt like real people, the kind of folks I would know. I don't think I've ever seen female characters who felt so wholly human. There were so many unflattering shots, so many scenes where the women get to be real people, something usually reserved for male characters. The chemistry between all of the actresses was great, and again, they felt like real people with real relationships.Most importantly, I laughed almost constantly through the film, and so did the near full theater around me. I can think of one joke in the whole film that didn't work for me. The pacing worked, and in the moments where it wasn't quite what it needed to be, the humor made up for it. I can't say the special effects are, well, anything special, but even top notch CGI gets knocked for even existing, and I can't complain, because it worked. The cameos were fun, if unnecessary, though I was extremely happy with Sigourney Weaver's, and waiting to see where they'd pop up was great. The story isn't incredible, but they were playing it safe. The villain is, I think, a character that will make more sense to the women watching than he does to many of the men, and that's the thing about this whole movie, really.It's just not aimed at men.It's not made for men to like. It's not made with men in mind at all. None of the women were cast with the intent of bringing in straight male viewers, and the young, hot Ghostbuster isn't straight. The secretary position, something usually reserved as the slot in which to stick eye candy for straight male viewers, is, again, not used in their favor. This is a summer action flick that, beyond a shadow of a doubt, was not made with men in mind.It's incredible.I can't believe this movie was ever made, but it was, and I am thankful. There aren't any fat jokes. There aren't any jokes about the way the women look at all. Erin is never made to feel bad about her superficial interest in Kevin. Abby is never mocked for her (sometimes ruthless) ambition. Patty gets to be loud and funny AND super interested in weird history stuff, and no one ever gives this a second thought. Holtzmann, my personal favorite, is&nbsp;unapologetically&nbsp;strange. All of these characters get to be themselves, and no one is ever allowed to make them feel lesser for it.Is this a ten star film? No. But it's far from a one star film, and I hope the score I give it can weigh out some of the unnecessarily low ratings its being given.Go see this movie. Take your friends to see this movie. Take your mom and your sister and your cousin. It's fun. It's not a perfect film, certainly not, but neither was the original, and this is a damn solid entry in the franchise. Bring on the sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely a movie that needs to be watched before you rate it. Using the trailers as a guideline for your review is not how you should judge this movie. I've seen it twice, for basically free. This movie, despite negative reviews, is actually really appealing. The only major issue was the plot, as it was kind of choppy, but the comedy and the characters made up for it. I think it was more geared towards the teenagers rather than adults, judging by the comedy and the way the movie played out. As for somebody who grew up watching the original Ghostbusters (and whose parents are die-hard fans of the series), my whole family enjoyed it. I'd definitely suggest watching it in 3D if available, though. It felt like the 3D gave more effect and more immersion than the standard version. Most people have issues with the Ghostbusters team being female. Personally, I don't see what gender of character should have to do with any review writing at all. A review is meant to be posted or written after seeing the movie, and focused more on the movies aspects, plot line, and graphics, and the personality OF the characters, rather than what gender the characters are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was a great homage to the original, and was a funny, well-paced experience. In the theater, there was not one person who wasn't enjoying the movie. From the old Ghostbusters to the newer generation, this is a well written and very fitting cast for this film. The leading rolls did a fantastic job, and the special effects and animators did a phenomenal performance. This movie was written for and welcomes a new generation of "Ghostbusters". The supporting cast were also great, and their was not a single moment of 'down time'. Each scene flowed well from the next. The musical soundtrack is very fitting and adds to the movie instead of takes away like in most films.A lot of the hate and bad reviews come from older men who believe this film was geared specifically toward them, but it is not. The movie was geared for everyone, and is well liked as a whole. I cannot wait to see if they continue the new Ghostbuster franchise. I'm looking forward to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very funny, loved the homages to the original movie. Also Holtzmann. And Abby. And Patty. And Erin. And the interactions between them were pretty cool. Erin and Abby had the broken friendship between them, but they got through that and Erin even saved Abby's life. The special effects during that was really cool. Kind of a muffled, not quite on this plane sound and neat lighting. I was so relieved to see them pass from the green part of the vortex to the red. And Holtzmann! She is flirty, brilliant and funny! She's definitely one of the movie's highlights. All of her scenes were fantastic. All of them. Patty injects a sense of, well, sense into the group. Considering Erin jumped into a swirling portal of death the group is really, really going to need that. She's also kind of relatable, a grounding point in the science crazy that the others take for granted. Also, I like how the group is protective of Kevin, dumdum that he is. He tries! And he fails, epically, but he tries!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was 13 when the original Ghostbusters came out. I was astounded. it was exciting and hilarious. But a year ago, when I introduced it to my own 11 and 13 year olds, the cracks and flaws were more apparent. The 11 year old wandered off at some point. The 13 year old appreciated it but he never asked to watch it again. This new film held my boys' attention, The characters were well-drawn and likable. The action was intense and at times unexpected. My youngest asked if we could go see it again this week. I think for their generation, the 1984 film will be a footnote. This will be what people mean when they refer to Ghostbusters in the future.</fullReview>

We caught the 3D version and man I jumped and screamed a few times!Don't jump up and leave at the credits there are more scenes when it ends.We didn't think it was racist, stereotypical, or man-hating in any way. A couple of things were cheesy but it's a comedy... It's also PG-13 and there wasn't any horny sluts panting to get bred either. The female actors weren't slutty, didn't wear a ton of makeup or tight revealing clothing. Maybe people are used to seeing that? My kid loved it! I had a smile on my face the whole time, I remember this distinctly because I read the crap reviews and was ready to sit through a painful movie just to make my kid happy. The characters were well done, each had their own distinct traits and quirks to love. Also (unlike Star wars) it was a totally different movie with completely different aspects, scenes, locations, etc. I didn't see the "bad acting" to me it was a comedy and you need to go into that with a lighter attitude. They aren't trying to win an Oscar here folks. I loved that the former Ghost Busters (even those who were not alive) made an appearance and had acting parts. I give it a 10 out of 10 because it is exactly what I hope to see when I grab a PG-13 flick with my kid. There wasn't some ridiculously young female following some 50 year old actor around... (ahem at some of the previews tonight!)I should mention Ghost Busters two was on TV earlier tonight and my kid walked out on it completely bored and utterly not interested... soo there's that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Drs. Erin Gilbert and Abby Yates are co-authors of a book which posits the existence of paranormal phenomenon such as ghosts. When the book proves unpopular, Gilbert distances herself and eventually becomes a physics professor at Columbia University, while Yates continues to study the paranormal at a technical college with eccentric engineer Dr. Jillian Holtzmann. Years later, Gilbert learns Yates republished the book, threatening her bid for tenure at Columbia. Gilbert reunites with Yates and, in exchange for getting the book out of publication, agrees to assist Yates and Holtzmann on a paranormal investigation.The group witness and document a malevolent ghost, renewing Gilbert's belief in the paranormal. However, a video of their investigation is posted online, and Gilbert is denied tenure. She accepts an offer to join Yakes and Holtzmann's project, but when a new institute director learns its nature, he fires them. To continue their research, they open the "Department of the Metaphysical Examination" in an office above a Chinese restaurant, hire dim-witted but handsome Kevin Beckman as a receptionist, and start building equipment to study and capture ghosts.Meanwhile, MTA worker Patty Tolan witnesses a ghost in a subway line and contacts the Department. The group investigate, documenting the ghost and successfully testing Holtzmann's proton containment laser, but their proof is again dismissed.Despite the setbacks, the group continues to develop their ghost containment technology and advertise their services as what pundits are calling "Ghostbusters". Patty joins the team, providing a historic knowledge of New York City and a redesigned hearse dubbed "Ecto-1". Unbeknownst to them, the ghosts are being summoned by devices built by Rowan North, an occultist attempting to bring about the Apocalypse. Rowan plants another device at a live music venue. The Ghostbusters are called in, and capture the ghost in front of hundreds of people.When supernatural debunker Dr. Martin Heiss demands proof of the Ghostbusters' claims, Gilbert (who resents being labeled as insane or a liar) releases the ghost from containment, and it throws Heiss out a window before escaping. The Ghostbusters are brought to see Mayor Bradley. It turns out that the city and the Department of Homeland Security are well aware of New York's ghost problem. While privately supporting the team's work, the mayor's office and DHS publicly denounce them as fraudsters. The Ghostbusters realize Rowan is planting his devices along ley lines which intersect at the Mercado Hotel in Times Square, a site with a history of paranormal activity, and discover Rowan building a portal to the ghost dimension in the hotel basement.Rowan electrocutes himself rather than be captured, and Holtzmann deactivates the portal. Gilbert discovers a copy of her and Yates' book among Rowan's possessions. It turns out that he planned all along to become a ghost and turn the spirits he releases into an army under his command. Rowan returns as a powerful ghost, first possessing Yates and then Kevin. After possessing the latter, he opens the portal and releases hundreds of ghosts. The police and DHS attempt to stop Rowan and are quickly subdued, but the Ghostbusters fight through the army of ghosts to reach the portal.Rowan takes the form of the Ghostbusters' logo, grows to enormous height and starts destroying the city. The team devise a plan to use Ecto-1's nuclear reactor to cause a total protonic reversal, close the portal and return the ghosts to their own dimension. The plan succeeds, but Rowan drags Yates into the portal with him. Gilbert leaps into the portal and rescues Abby, and they both return to Manhattan with prematurely white hair. Afterward, the mayor's office agrees to secretly fund the Ghostbusters' research while publicly continuing to denounce them as frauds. With new funding, the Ghostbusters are able to move to a better facility--an old fire house. Despite the mayoral smear campaign, New York lights up with thanks and tributes to the Ghostbusters.In a post-credits scene, Tolan listens to a recording of a ghost encounter and asks the others if they have heard of Zuul.</fullReview>

Some say this movie is "man hating" but all it does is reverse gender roles. How many movies out there are full of men with one woman (who happens to be a secretary?) Girl power and a delight, and who couldn't love Chris's character!!!! Honestly any fan of the original who keeps an open mind (and open to the concept of a female cast) will love this movie. I say it's a total hit, and any girl could agree. Whatever, trump. The ladies from Satetday Night live are fantastic, and Mcarthy and Wiig do it again. The characters are well rounded and impossible not to love. The plot is fast and full of humor. As a girl who grew up watching Ghostbusters, I've fallen in love all over again!!!</fullReview>

Why do all the professional reviewers agree with me about how good the movie is but these reviews don't? I read through the reviews here and it's funny how all the low ratings are from men. Do you guys have that much of an issue with women playing a role that was originally male? The sad thing is I know for certain if this was a remake with all males, it wouldn't have been rated so low.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Belly Busting Nonstop Laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never found the original 1984 Ghostbusters all that funny -- especially Bill Murray's quirky shtick. I went to the sequel out of curiosity to see what happens when the roles are swapped. Would the whole thing just be a gimmick?I was delighted to find nonstop laughter from a far more energetic and fast-paced sequel from the original --propelled by a clever script and great comedy acting. It's hard to go wrong when you have the wacky antics of Melissa McCarthy in the mix. And, SNL's Kate McKinnon plays a wonderfully amusing geeky and slightly maniacal scientist that just keep you giggling. Also, nice to see the Thor hulk, Chris Emsworth, play a Monty Python-like silly character in his role as office secretary. The flirtatious play between him and the ladies is lots of fun.I was also glad to seen the film pay homage to the storyline and style of the first film. However, having the predictably gratuitous cameos by some of the original cast didn't add to the laugh momentum at all. Despite the negative reviews I certainly would not consider anything in the film tokenism or sexist. Are people so thin-skinned about what they perceive these days as "politically correct?" This film would not have been nearly as engaging with an all-male cast. It would have been just another boring sequel that would have invited endless comparisons to the original actors.About halfway through the film the tight-paced hilarity throttles back for the predictable huge battle with an army of ghosts. These inevitable climatic special effects orgasms get tiring. This is by far one of the most entertaining and funniest films I've seen in a very long time. I'm delighted that they seem to have left the door open for a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lovingly Crafted Reboot--This Is How It Is Done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Loved it! A great reboot of a franchise and most decidedly NOT a remake. The original spirit (ha, spirit) of the 80s films was there along with several tasteful nods/cameos. I laughed a LOT. The performances were nuanced and each character had their own meter and timing. The four leads are not rehashes of the four originals. For example, the engineer's similarities to Egon began and ended at her glasses. She is not "the Egon character." There are no direct substitutes for Venkmann, Ray, or Winston, either. Some folks have made some racist assumptions that because Patty is black, she is the "Winston." True, she started the film as the non-scientist, but she is also well-read, believes in the mission of the team, and has a near encyclopedic knowledge of New York--a far cry from the original Winston who would believe in anything if there was a paycheck in it for him.This isn't ruining anyone's childhood anymore than 15 different Batman re-starts have. Forget what you've heard--mostly from people who are giving it a bad review based on what they think it is and without having seen it, i.e. a giant chunk of the IMDb negative reviews--and give it a chance on its own merits. This is a movie that stands on its own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>GB84 and GB89 were my first favorite movies, and I could quote them extensively before I turned 10 years old. I am in the prime demographic to feel "betrayed" by a reboot, but I adored this movie. Paul Feig and Katie Dippold have written for two of the shows closest to my heart (Freaks &amp; Geeks, Parks &amp; Recreation), so it makes sense that they would ace this seemingly impossible challenge: Make a film that both honors and respects the original, but is also fun and original in its own right. The homages - cameos, quotes, similar scenes - are an absolute joy for their nostalgia AND imaginative reinvention; this is a film that only a die-hard fan could make. Like its source, it expertly blends silly, scary, and the genuine triumph of four friends bringing out the best in each other to save the best city on earth. The leads are terrific, they have their own wonderfully weird humor and rhythm, with only superficial similarities to the characters who came before. This film clearly exists not to replace the original, but to celebrate it and bring something new to the universe. Well-freakin-done, you guys! I have the 80's cartoon action figures, the film figures that (finally) came out in the 2000's, and I will proudly display Abby, Erin, Jillian, and Patty beside them!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of awkward comedies. I HATE most romcoms because of stupid miscommunication being the only thing that seems to launch the story forward. There's an awkward factor in Ghostbusters, but it works so well as to be enjoyable. The special effects are solid too, and crisp even in faster paced 3D shots. There's a teasing of some 4th wall breaking that is just so well timed and you can see the synergy and chemistry between the cast. I'm terrified of crowds, and often avoid a trip to the movie theater unless I just feel like I need to go. I'm glad I braved the crowds, and I plan to do so again - this movie was AMAZING and a part of me is sad to see it getting panned by a lot of folks.It doesn't replace the original, and it's not less just because of some gender-bending, but it's damned entertaining, and visually appealing. I recommend it in 3D if you can watch it that way, but I'm going to see it a second time in 2D so I'll either update this review or reply to it afterward.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst film ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first review cause I feel I have to say something. Don't go and see it is all I can recommend. It is a complete waste of time. The whole film is just a big sexist statement. They could have made it a Ghostbuster 3 out of it and continue the story, but did instead this crappy reboot. There was nothing new to this film, nothing...just same old jokes. They even try to duplicate the personalities of the Ghostbusters from the old classic, but with girls. The original classic was way better. I see from the other reviews here that most feel the same way. Good! The positive reviews is clearly an attempt from the producers side to try to save some dignity....whats left anywayMy 9 year son however liked it, but that about it. He likes everything with special effects though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The NIckelback of Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before trashing this movie completely, I'd like to say I respect these actors and fault the era that this movie was made in. This movie flopped due to the predictability of its writing and over the top attempts to be politically correct. It felt like a social experiment disguised as a crappy remake of the great original "ghostbusters" (1984). It was cheesy, and there was not good chemistry between the cast. All in all it felt forced, and I believe this movie best serves to document the negative aspects of 2010's culture. There was no bad intentions making in this film and it is an interesting thought experiment by having an exclusively female led cast, plus the role reversal of a male secretary who is sexual harassed but it wasn't good at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Originally I never anticipated seeing this movie because of the trailers, but initially having a negative opinion of a movie has served me well by being pleased with a much better product than anticipated. So I ponied up the cash and took a date. I truly did not expect to be as underwhelmed by an effort as this. Save your money, people. Save the precious moments of life that could be BETTER spent writhing in pain from a wild animal attack. There was no originality, no three dimensional characters and absolutely no heart to the performances of the main four. There was a "your mama" joke that actually fell flat, though. I imagine upon seeing the progress of the film, the studio assumed that they either had to scrap the whole project and start over or just punt and run out the tape and hope for a good opening before the reviews. This is just bad movie making and the studio, director, writers, actors need to be held accountable. I feel bad for the original Ghostbusters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Jocular Movie with an Inspiring Message for Girls all around the World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's rather ironic that this movie is being criticised for being 'sexist' when other movies have done the exact same 'sexist' actions, but with men instead of women, isn't it? The only real male hero in the film is a hilariously stupid receptionist who was mostly hired because of his looks. How sexist towards men? If only us ladies could feel this pain. It's almost like we've dealt with this issue our entire lives with hundreds of movies and panned as a 'rabid feminist' when we try to speak up.What is being called a 'man-hating film' is actually a rather inspiring tale for young girls. Let me explain, as a young girl, you see lots of women on the screen, but they're never the heroes. And even if they are, they always get saved by men. Women are often there because they're attractive and Disney movies like Cinderella and Peter Pan suggest to you that women should do the housework. It's very difficult to grow up with ambitions to do something important when you're constantly surrounded by the 'damsel in distress who needs a man' cliché. It feels like you can't ever do anything important if you don't look 'sexy enough'. That does wonders for your self-esteem.This movie changes that; it's turned on its head. They may be damsels in distress, but they can handle it. Anyone who calls it 'man-hating' has missed the point. They're blatantly oblivious of the blatant obvious or they're just ignoring it to find a non-existent fault in the movie. Maybe the women have saved the day while the men were frozen, but that doesn't make it sexist. That is positive enforcement for young girls. I have spent my entire childhood feeling like I could never be as good as a boy, am I not allowed to have this triumph? I will spell it out for you: A WOMAN'S TRIUMPH DOES NOT EQUATE TO A MAN'S FAILURE.None of the women were sexualised needlessly like they are in so many women. The clothes are not tight-fitting or showing skin which would be completely impractical, but we can all ignore that for other movies, right? They sat and ate food normally. They weren't eating to be sexy and no 'fat jokes' (body-shaming which can be incredibly damaging for people with eating disorders)were made at their expense. It had women eating because they were hungry. I'm sad that this shocked me and it should say enough about the sexism in society.The women had incredible chemistry and were jocular; I didn't stop laughing the entire time. It had diversity and wasn't white-washed. Leslie Jones was particularly amazing in the movie and I had a literal nerd-freak-out every time she explained a historical anecdote. These women were intelligent, they knew what they were doing and what they were talking about. Another thing that I found shocking which is ridiculous. Why are women never portrayed as intelligent? We are.There was no shoe-horned romantic subplot which I will give a round of applause to. Not every movie needs romance, but almost every movie has it. I'd much rather see a developed platonic relationship than an undeveloped, ludicrous 'romance'. If characters need to kiss for us to understand they're in love then it's an undeveloped relationship.I particularly found the soundtrack amazing and the music did very well in building tension and setting the mood for a scene. The Fall Out Boy remake isn't for everyone, but if they had just rehashed the original, I'm sure the meninists would have added 'theif' to the negative stereotype for women.I'll admit, there were a few jokes that didn't quite hit the marker, but that comes with comedy. It's subjective. Just because you didn't find something funny, it doesn't mean it's universally unfunny.I didn't particularly feel like the villain's storyline was developed enough, but Neil Casey did it justice as the antagonist. The homages to the original were witty and very enjoyable. The balloon ghosts were very creative and served for an amusing sequence. As did the taxi-driver scene.The movie isn't perfect. Some of the editing is choppy and there are times where jokes weren't funny. I'm not going to call it an Oscar-worthy movie, but for what it primarily is, a comedy, I find it great.The social commentary is great. Anyone who's calling it sexist and man-hating has missed the entire point of the movie. The movie is a gender reversal and puts the men in the shoes of the women. You can see how women feel watching almost all movies. You get a taste in our battle against sexism. There was a subtle line involving a pen knife and every woman needing 'to be armed' which I loved. It's a subtle reference to rape culture and how as a woman, I have been taught how to not get raped from the age of 12 while Brock Turner has basically gone free for his crime. The movie isn't attack against men, it's a portrayal of how women are treated for men to relate to. If you don't want to take this chance, then don't, but I'd like to remind you that it's the twenty-first century. Women aren't useless and only for men's sexual or romantic desire. Take Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, for example. This movie isn't about proving that women are better than men, it's about proving that women are equal to men. This movie is for young girls who need this confidence, who need this nudge that they can do anything they want and their gender shouldn't hold them back. That's why I've given it a 9 out of 10, because, yes it has it's faults, but it is a magnificent message for young girls out there. If I ever have children, this will be one of the first movies they watch, regardless of gender.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie reminded me of the way that videos have a reputation of ruining licenses. What I mean is that because they have a well know title or brand then the makers of the said game don't put much effort into making it. This ghost busters reboot is ghastly. How can anyone really think they could top Bill Murray. Hemsworth makes even worse with his paper thin performance. McCarthy is just terrible and should only be movies that require an overweight actress. Special effects are terrible, the original actually looks better in this respect. Jokes are delivered with shocking timing, leaving you to wonder if you are just watching a 90 minute commercial for ghost busters merchandise. Only watch this movie if you are a hard core feminist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What do you get when you take four actors, stick them together and have them all doing their own bit? The answer is a movie that feels more like a skit than a comedy. Combine this fact with marketing campaign that is almost in the lines of Citizen Kane "The movie no one wants you to see" but in this case it's "See the movie or you are a sexist". Now that we have gotten that whole point out, let's talk about the actual movie. Ghostbusters is a reboot of the entire franchise. The first two movies did not happen and the original cast members that make cameos aren't playing the characters they should. The comedy is a hit or a miss for most of the times. I personally do not find jokes about slime in every orifice and cracks to be that funny, even if it made me smile a little. The main problem with the humor is that it's not in the style of what i think of when i think Ghostbusters, it's more like a poor mans slapstick with cheap jokes about queefing and penises. The skit about the stupid male secretary was also flat. The whole "My cat" joke was just horrible, the fish tank joke was just sad. Sadly, the movie is also full of filler scenes that are just here because they do not contribute much to the movie overall. And do not get me started about the nut-shots and other scenes like where they talk about some ghosts virginity. One thing i actually like was the fact that they used the bad CGI as a joke with the whole "Oh it's so fake" skit. But was it really necessary to do it two times? Again, this is a part of the movie that feels like "We're doing it because we need more stuff on film".Now let's talk about the main bad guy and the ghosts in general, the main bad guy is just a big crybaby that have the power to control human beings, why? Because it's something easy to do. Combine that with the fact that the movie looks down on the audience by having the bad guy explain his plans, like it was convoluted or something like that. This is a movie where you try to sell the idea more than you try to sell the movie, yes it would be great to see more movies with women as the main name in them but this movie would have been just as bad if there was four random dudes who suited up and went to catch ghosts, and why? That is because the thing that made Ghostbusters good was not the plot or the setting, but the characters and how they were together. All in all, Ghostbusters 2016 is not a good movie. It is not the worst movie i have ever seen and it doesn't deserve all the ones that it has gotten, but it sure doesn't deserve all the tens it got either. It's a summer movie that is there to rake in some cash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decently entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a 38 year old male who grew up on the first 2 Ghostbusters, and the original REAL GHOSTBUSTERS animated series. Always loved the first movie and the cartoon, merely found the 2nd movie to be "okay", though as an adult i find it is better then i thought it was as a kid.I took my 7 year old daughter to see the new Ghostbusters. Seeing normal women doing cool things is just what the doctor ordered for someone trying to raise a confident, self-assured girl in the current day. My daughter thought the movie was fantastic. First thing she said as it ended was "when can we buy it on Blu-Ray?"I thought the 4 leads had a decent chemistry. Kate Mckinnon is the standout, stealing most scenes that she is in with her mugging-style that she has perfected on SNL.I also felt like this was one of the better examples of 3D visual effects that I have seen. There are multiple scenes where the ghosts seem to come right out at you which are very effective.Finally: Who knew that Chris Hemsworth could be so funny? His jock- ish, jerkish nimrod of a secretary is actually quite endearing.Is it a great movie in-line with the original? No. This is not a classic by any means. I think the original relied so much on the comedic timing and brilliance of Bill Murray, and no one in this cast can match that. However, i don't think it is an awful film. It serves as a decent origin story and a solid girl-power effort that is not as disparaging to the male species as some people claim. I would go see a sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can you say? Awful director, terrible actors, pathetic story... Anyone involved in making this assault on cinema should be banned from any form of entertainment going forward.Hollywood should stop trying to remake classics. Zemeckis and Gale got it right when they said as long as either are living, the rights to the Back to the Future franchise won't be sold for a reboot. BUT, if you're going to try the impossible task of capturing lightning in a bottle twice, at least be smart enough to hire decent creative talent and don't insult your audience. Now that this turd has flopped, let's give Paul Feig a gold watch and wish him well in retirement. Maybe we can find the cast jobs waiting tables at TGI Fridays. I hear the Boise Herald needs an obituary editor. Hint, hint writers. Who ya gonna call? Roto rooter. Somebody has to snake this steaming pile down the drain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am glad i did not pay to see it in cinema, it is so horrible that if written, produced and shot by some group of amateurs it would end up better than it is. Comedy which lack of all fun and story which is actually non existent.So if you go to see it... expect immature humour which is not funny, that movie is trying to show all other then women stupid, shallow or pure evil. When you look on SGI you would not see anything new in fact what was done in late eighties as CGI is looking better and well created instead of the lousy remake of effect within the movie. I do think the whole turn over of this movie is only from people which like me loved previous two and when they sit through this abomination first 20min they wanted to go and get money back.My suggestion is then, do not go for that to cinema, wait for home as this movie will be out from cinema and given to TVs and cable in packages, since Sony will have to pay others to even take it. Thats how this movie is bad...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into Ghostbusters with a clear and impartial mindset.This remake is terrible. The beloved franchise from our childhood was completely gutted by the feminist, social justice warriors, PC Crowd.The big problem with 2016 Ghostbusters is the uninspired, boring script. The script lacks intelligence compared to the the original movie. The original movie focused on the bumbling government bureaucrats not the ghosts.The new version paints men as the enemy and is pro big brother. The movie makes all men seem useless and stupid.The plot is incoherent. The movie completely is incapable of laughing at itself. The special effects are horrifically lazy and ugly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I didn't enjoy this movie...am I sexist?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a casual fan of the original 80's film so I wasn't foaming excess saliva at the mouth for a new movie or anything. But then, I see the trailers; awful CGI, dated pop cultural humor, horny mom jokes, prat falls, and even an "aw hell naw" spoken from a sassy black character. I kindly removed my spectacles and said with a sombre tone "With God as my witness, this is abysmal".And then I went to see it because I felt like it. Though it wasn't as awful as I thought it would be, it still was quite awful. Bad jokes, too many obvious nods to the original (yes, we've seen the original, what's your point?), annoying characters, video game CGI, mediocre directing, and a lackluster story. I also found Chris Hemsworth as the dorky sidekick to be ungodly irritating, and every joke where someone fawns over him graces me with much disdain. While there were some decent jokes and I found the climax to be genuinely enthralling, I don't think the positives outweigh the negatives. It's a lackluster experience overall, and I don't think it's worth paying green for tickets.But I go online to express my feelings on this movie, and I'm met with shocking criticism. "You didn't like it because you're sexist" "You thought it sucked because you hate women" "You'd probably enjoy it if it stared men" and then I asked myself...is this true? I've been married for three years and we had previously been dating since my freshman year of high school, and she's my best friend in the whole wide world....but now that I hate this movie, should I divorce her? We have a daughter on the way, should we see a medical clinic about that? Should I distance myself from all of my female coworkers? What about my mom? *gasp* What about my grandma? But my wife disliked the movie too for mostly similar reasons, does that mean she's a self- hating misogynist? So many questions, so little time! I've always seen women as my equal, but clearly, the reasons of disapproval must link to the fact that women star in it.Because of my recent enlightenment, I've written a new review: Boobs aren't funny. Boobs are boring. Boobs are for morons. What guy even likes boobs to begin with? I've never met a single guy who enjoys boobs. When's the last time you heard a guy say "I'd like to see pair of big boobs"? Never, because no guy thinks that way. Don't even get me started on butts, because guys hate those too. The best part about the movie was that MAN Chris Hemsworth, because he didn't have boobs or butts. I don't even see the corny jokes in this movie, nor did I see the poor CGI or obnoxious fan-pandering references to the original, I just saw boobs and occasionally I saw butts. Therefore, I give this movie a -1000/10 star rating. Worst movie ever.For people, big names like Dane Cook, to call me sexist and misogynistic because I dislike a movie that happens to star women is absurd. I suppose if I disliked A Haunted House, it's automatically because I'm a racist? I suppose if it I dislike World Trade Center, it's automatically because I'm a conspiring liberal? Why thank you for enlightening me, internet. Now I know the truth!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Thoughts on Ghostbusters 2016</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to give my honest thoughts on this film and I feel necessary as this movie has brought out toxicity on both sides of the political spectrum and has similar toxic behavior from Sony and the cast and directors. Honestly this is not a good film and definitely not worthy of a movie going experience, rental if you're interested perhaps but there's an ugliness to this film that is hard to shake. Like other poor movies the first 20 minutes has a promising start then goes down hill. The cast while having their moments feels awkward and not fleshed out, no warmth or likability that the originals are known for. Most characters in this film lack joy or empathy, Leslie Jones is the exception that shines in bringing laughs and being likable. Reflecting on it men and women alike act in really ugly, dumb and mean spirited ways through out the movie. Humor is very hit or miss and my girlfriends hit it on the mark saying it was family guy style comedy. The jokes are constant but not smart or subtle or endearing 1/5 is going to hit. Special effects were a bit silly, proton beams looked great, but over all not selling points just there. The inclusion of a villain was also odd he was not fleshed out, like the effects there to get to A to B. I prefer the originals faceless ancient threat and miss the final 80s fab Gozer. A point for the original orchestral score.I'd say save your money and check out Dory or possibly Pets. Not worth getting upset about but not worth supporting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a really poor effort from Sony. They could never equal the original, but at least try and make a good film. Whoever wrote this should be sacked. I paid money to listen to fart and crack jokes. Slap stick humour that made me grit my teeth. I feel sorry for the cast who had nothing much to work with, plus they have to put up with a lot of woman bashing lately. I especially feel bad for Leslie Jones who has deleted her twitter account recently for receiving racial abuse. Her character in the movie is quite good, and not the stereotypical black woman some people have said in there reviews, although the trailer did not do her any favours.The casting of 4 women in this movie has nothing to do with the fact that this movie sucks. They could put the original actors in this and it would still be bad. Aside from the annoying slap stick humour, the movie has no soul. I cant believe it cost 140 million dollars. The CGI is awful. I mean the ghosts are like cartoons. Apart from the 1st 5 minutes there is no horror element. As I said before, the actors didn't have much to go on. Chris Hemsworth was great though. His stupidity was the only funny thing in the movie. Kate mckinnon who I was looking forward to the most from watching the trailers was good fun as she is ab-it mad, although she kind of got a little annoying as it seemed that she was trying too hard every time the camera was on her. Kristen Whig who is in my opinion the funniest in real life among her co stars, couldn't do anything with the awful material, as well as Leslie Jones. I leave Melissa Mccarthy last because I don't like her in anything. In ghostbusters its the same Melissa mccarthy you get in all her films. Loud slapstick humour that is just forced down your throat.As for the director, I feel hes used the woman bashing the cast have received to camouflage how bad the film is. How he managed to mess up so bad il never know. The movie lacks effort. It has no soul or imagination. Im a huge fan of the original which I knew couldn't be equalled, but I tried hard to give the reboot a chance on its own. There is talk from Sony already of sequels. Well I tried get on board with your reboot but that's it from me. Please leave the godfather alone for Christ sake !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What did I just watch?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this movie a rating of 2 because that's how many times I slightly chuckled, and also how many times I considered walking out. I'm a huge fan of the original franchise. As a kid, I watched the movies so many times I could quote every sentence. I consider them movie masterpieces, and always kept out a hope for a 3rd movie. When I heard that a 3rd movie was being made, I was ecstatic. I became a little less ecstatic when I heard it was going to be a reboot instead of a continuance of the original storyline. But I still kept an open mind. Even when I heard that it was going in a different direction with an all female cast, I still kept an open mind. And I'll be honest, when I heard that it was gonna star Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, and two very funny SNL cast members, I gained some excitement because I am a fan of their work and I find a lot of it pretty funny. But this movie just stepped on the throat of not only their comedy, but of the Ghostbusters franchise completely. Here's the great thing about the original movie: It was a story driven movie with a great storyline and the comedy just came with the great acting so it felt very real. The movie focused on the actual science fiction side and the phenomenon of catching ghosts, and we saw the Ghostbusters rise into stardom as they swept the city of New York with their services. There was progression and a mystique about the overall main villain. This reboot did exactly none of that. They tried to force a joke down the throat of the audience every single second, and all but a couple of the jokes fell completely flat. The characters were shallow, and I won't even expand on how bad the character that Chris Hemsworth played was. The main villain was not in the least bit threatening, mostly because there was no explanation about him. He was just a bullied guy who wanted to get back at society for some unknown reason. And the continuity of this movie is just awful. One second they can catch ghosts, the next second they just "kill" them or turn them into slime. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. We see them catch one ghost, and suddenly that just makes them as big and famous as the original team in the first movie. The only thing that kept me in my seat was the cameos of the original cast. And the new theme song is just bad. No other way to put it. Overall, I don't blame the actors because as I said, they've done good work before and it felt as though they were being limited to do just what was being told to them in this film. At some points, it felt even as though they were reading straight from a script. I blame the writers for this one. If you're a fan of the original franchise, just do yourself a favor and skip out on this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The whole Feminist/Anti-feminist stuff was a smokescreen for the real problems.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all there has been a lot of controversy surrounding this movie regarding the cast. With myself, I supported this movie up to the first teaser. When I saw the full trailer after I knew it was going downhill when it got released. First of all the ghosts aren't actual ghosts as there is no supernatural or mythological elements in it that the first movie was made famous for. They may as well be an MIB rip off or call them Alienbusters. Second the cameos are wasted, they only last a few seconds to a minute. Third the effects are disgusting. It says a lot when the original movies effects look timeless and fourth the overall storytelling was a bland, shallow shell of what the original was all about. Feig was pretty clever in making the early accusations as while most of the idiots were fighting over the "Political aspects" of it. It allowed him to slip the real things wrong with this movie by without a hitch. His feminism angle was nothing more than an overly sensitive Trojan horse. Don't hate it because politics, hate it for being a stupid movie, forget about it and watch the first two instead. All this was good for was getting people to watch the old ones and bringing back Ectocooler.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Made me want to puke. I love a movie with a strong leading female roles (thinking of Aliens or Kill Bill) but this is absolute crap. This movie has the worst script writing since Trolls 2!!! CGI equally as bad as the newest Scooby Doo movies. No explanation for anything that happens in the movie. Just a dumbed down version of one of the greatest nerd classic movies of the 80's.The biggest kicker was Sony and the director of this movie blamed fans that were being critical of it sexists. Their is sexism all over this movie but not towards women, towards men. Every man portrayed in this movie is ether evil or an idiot. I dare you to find a single example of anything different. You won't find it and I lost count of how many men got shot in the balls in this movie. As if it wasn't funny the first 5 times, they just keep running with it. I want to see another Ghostbusters movie that takes off from the first 2 but this movie is not that and then some! Waste of time and to be honest, was so bad that now I look at Sony in bad light for allowing this garbage to pass for a movie. This Ghostbusters movie couldn't pass as a successful straight to DVD title. A fan made movie done with a 10th of the budget I know would have been far better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoiler alert* The humor was set with the first fart joke and ended with the big bad getting a crotch injury. This is the type of humor for five year old little girls. Not to mention the "leading" male is nothing but mentally challenged or lobotomized eye candy, so I'm going to throw in sexist as well. It was just not funny and most certainly not witty.It completely lacks the occult authenticity of the original ghost- busters, instead this new one feels extremely cheap and trick or treat. In all, this is a political film with a agenda, not actual entertainment. You can have a all female cast without being utterly hateful about it or reducing the women to anything, but Sony hasn't figured that out yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched the original Ghostbusters hundreds of times. It's an original, well written, funny classic. This epic mess pisses on the original so badly I don't even know where to begin. I have no issue with the gender swap or even jokes for the X-Factor Generation but I can't quite understand who this movie is for. The story is structurally similar to the original with no new creativity or originality yet it manages to present itself as a poor knock off with terrible writing, gags and special effects. Just think what could have been if they invested the cash into a proper sequel. With the original cast showing up for a pay check and clearly some agreement to praise the movie, Sony should not deserve to profit from this disaster. Harold Ramis will be spinning in his grave. Shame on you Sony.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Worst movie I've seen? No, as bad as batman v superman, no, but it's forgettable, tedious, boring, long. Most of the jokes if you can even call them that miss the mark. They emasculate men for the sake of emasculating men. They put in stuff to make you think of the original like Stay puff, the logo, even the song. But the movie just fails to capture the dry delivery the way the original did... Standing on its own though, its just a forgettable movie and barely offers anything but a waste of hours. It's not even really bad enough to make fun of so if you're going in hoping to laugh at it you won't even't have that going for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to like this movie because who doesn't love the Ghostbusters franchise? Unfortunately the script writing was terrible, the jokes were juvenile, and things seem to have gone even worse in editing leaving out important parts of the plot, or they were so low-key that I missed them.You can really tell the actors were trying though and kudos to them for their efforts, possibly with the exceptions of Wiig (who plays the exact same straight-faced character she plays in every other role I've seen her in) and Bill Murray who looks like he had a gun to his head and didn't want to be there.I can ignore the controversy over the movie. And the gender of the characters and whether the ghosts are CGI or not is not important - everything there is fine.But the movie just isn't funny. I've read reviews that people were laughing at this. Laughing at what? I admit I might have had an *inside* chuckle here or there but that's not enough to carry a comedy; the "jokes" are more like puns. It's a movie of puns. You can't do that, it doesn't work, puns aren't funny enough to carry an entire movie like this.By the end I felt I'd watched something of a low-budget fan remake of the original movie. Whomever did the prop making was having a bad day/month/year because all of the ghost busting equipment looked unilaterally cheap and fake. The plot was also stupid. The antagonist's motivations are just not there.Between the puns, props, plot, and editing, the whole movie is a flop. Save your money and wait until you see it in the $1 DVD bargain bin.</fullReview>

The acting and the attempts at humor however, were what killed this movie. It was not funny, not at all. The cast, especially Leslie Jones, was atrocious.

I heard the back and forth between people on both sides of the argument.I still went into watching this with an open mind, after all McCarthy and Wiig have made great funny movies in the past, Paul Fieg has directed good movies. Chris Hemsworth is one of the hottest actors on the scene today. So I thought it can't be as bad as they're making out.I was wrong, so SO wrong.Let me say it's not the fault of the cast, they try their best but whoever wrote this godawful script with literally zero humor needs to never be allowed anywhere near screenplays again. Who actually read this screenplay and actually thought it was something worth shooting, let alone dropping 150 mill on it?There is no humor, there is no effort, there is no character development. It's the same one dimensional jokes pounded into the ground over and over and over and over. Kate McKinnon's character is the crazy one. Leslie Jones is the black one. Chris Hemsworth is the dorky himbo. Kirsten Wiig has got a schoolgirl crush on Hemsworth. IT. NEVER. STOPSI tried. I tried so hard to find one positive, just ONE thing that I liked. The best I could come up with was Ernie Hudson's cameo. That is how bad this movie is, where you see the original cast and you realize you wasted $15 this pile of crap when you could have stayed home and watched the original.Don't watch this. For the love of god don't watch this. There is no directing, there is no coherent storyline, there is no character development, there is no redeeming factor for any of this. There is pain. Only Pain. For 2.....goddamn....hours.If you want to watch a good Ghostbusters movie, watch the original.If you want a good McCarthy-Wiig movie, watch Bridesmaids.If you want to watch a movie with a strong female lead in a rebooted franchise.

At least not in this movie, with its poorly written and tired lines and "jokes". That has nothing to do with hating women. Just as I can hate a movie with men in it, without hating men!It has nothing to do at all with the original Ghostbusters movies (that I love). It's more like a SNL parody of the original Ghostbusters. If you like fart jokes, vomit jokes and vagina jokes you will probably like this movie, because there are PLENTY of that here.

The four women who are portraying the heroes in this remake massacre it in style. Melissa McCarthy tries her best with the same humour i found funny in Spy, but ended up with the lack clustered not funny, OTT you may recently find in The Boss. The Egor (harold Ramis character - Genius) does a Gd job with her role, combining the GSOH of Michaelangelo and the brains of Donatello (quite a few plagiarism elements). Kristen Wiig character (thinking Dan aykroyd style) makes this film into a re-run of a darker version of Bridesmaid, which is for chicks (no offence, but true) her attempt of breaking away from chick flicks, always trying to thick with her loveless heart towards Chris Hemsworth (who is absolutely funny and steals the show - think Jason Statham in Spy). Patty character (the non science folk) tries her best but screams, shout, and the front runner for sexism attributes all the time. Please avoid if u want the classic Ghostbusters reinvention to be a breath of fresh air, stick with the originals, save your money and wait for TV...AVOID</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I am probably being a little too harsh on this film, but there are just some movies that should never be remade, even if the creators decided that a few extra things might make the film somewhat more interesting. In my opinion Ghostbusters is definitely one of those films ? there is no way that a film in 2016 is simply going to be able to recreate the electricity that the original film produced, and even though I swore that I wouldn't see this film I ended up doing so simply to prove to myself that I was indeed correct (not that I actually needed to do this).While the original wasn't perfect, it was still a great film, and simply didn't need to have any changes made to it. For instance, making the Ghostbusters all women simply reeked of what one could consider excessive feminism ? it simply didn't need to be done. This was one of those films which pretty much made all of the men either bad, or incredibly stupid (as was the case with Kevin). In fact the inclusion of Kevin simply felt as if it was payback for all the times that movies have used the stereotypical dumb blonde. Sure, that stereotype is pretty appalling, but by making the dumb blonde a guy simply is bordering on somebody going out of their way to be offensive ? something that the original film never tried to do.The plot is pretty similar to the original movie ? a couple of scientists are trying to prove paranormal activity and are laughed at by the academic community. Actually, we have one character who is a professor at Columbia University and is trying to get tenure, except that a book she wrote in the past, which she believed that she had destroyed, has come back to haunt her. Upon discovering this (and a couple of other damning things), the Dean kicks her out and she is forced to team up with an old friend, and a rather eccentric engineer. This is when the ghosts start appearing, and as a way to make money, they decide to fight them. Mind you, unlike the first movie, we don't have them running around collecting ghosts and sealing them away ? they only fight two of them before the grand finale.As I suggested, the engineer and her gadgets were pretty cool, and there were some funny moments in the movie. While I did enjoy it, and it did do some good things, I still couldn't help but pine for the original film, and mourn at the fact that in the end the original film was so much better and should have been left alone.</fullReview>

I do not get the concept of taking a beloved franchise going to any length to destroy said franchise with poor writing, directing, and acting. Other than the video and audio this was a great movie. On the bright side hopefully this will keep Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon from making many more movies. I am also not a fan of Paul Feig IE Spy.

Straight off the bat they lead with logo and production title ,wow not even a 10 minute run up, Cinema sins will be raging already..Poor typography and forced into frame. 10 minutes in, looking alright this could be OK , excellent might shut up the internet fanboys ... then it went tits up.Pacing is horrible the cuts start to miss key changes, CGI is bellow par but I will blame time and budget restraints , i'll let that slip for now.damn I should have clocked the red flag that this was going to be a chick flick just from the trailers before the film, Bridget Jones and two Zac Efron films but sweet baby Jesus this went full throttle all that was missing was a tampon hanging from Melissa McCarthy, was that sexist? "good because for the entire film men are portrayed in the same manner. this film is a perfect example of how to stereotype and create further division between genders, it completely had the reverse effect, how black does an actor have to be? Leslie Jones black apparently, all that was missing was a cameo from Chris Rock. SPOILERS: shooting proton packs over peoples head "what?" sorry missed that meeting Slimer and has Wife " what?" don't even start me on the CGI regarding that Shooting the boss in the dick "seriously ?"I'm not even angry , I am hurt that you can take a franchise and absolutely rape it for every penny it's worth even the original cast they somehow managed to make you hate them.I remember walking out of Ghostbusters 2 as a kid wanting to ride the statue of liberty , wanting to be a Ghostbuster , I spoke to my daughter after the film and none of that buzz was there 5/10</fullReview>

The writing was poor and the jokes were most all shallow, distasteful and immature. The casting seemed poor and despite a visible effort, the actors never seemed to fit into their roles believably. Most offensively, the CGI seemed extremely outdated to the point where it was unwatchable. It reminded me of the decade old Scooby Doo movies.The entire movie builds up to the four ghostbusters simply shooting their guns at the antagonists and winning. Obviously little thought and creativity went into this remake. It feels as though it was quickly thrown together to make money with little regard for the audience and the franchise's fanbase.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is flawed and utterly biased towards sexism. And example of one the flaws is that they describe the proton packs on this movie (and the previous) as a weapon made to contain ghosts, so they can be trapped. So, in no shape or form, it has the ability to kill them. As you can see, they throw that canon piece of logic out the window as soon as you get to the "big fight scene". That utterly looks like four people fighting with a green screen behind them.And biased. All male characters are depicted as inept, dumb, aggressive and very poor at their jobs. Every single one of them. Sure, you can sprinkle it here and there for comedic effect, but that was not the director choice on this movie. It makes it look like a man bashing film, because it "kinda" is. The only exception they made was the villain, and even so... let's just say he's not the sharpest tool in the shed. It is so man hating, the final scene, who was already spoiled on the trailers, so no spoiler warning here, the way they defeat him is a proton pack to the crotch. Yeh, let's talk about emasculating moves.About the characters. They are four fine actresses, and I love their work on previous gigs (SNL, for instance). So much so, the movie itself almost looks like a hour long skit. They didn't mesh well, and it showed, time and time again. Maybe because they were made so cartooney, all suspension or disbelief of reality were just impossible to reach. I have to point out the work of Leslie Jones, tho. She played the role of the token black women, and all they said to her was "be the loud, in your face, cliché, over the top black woman you can be"... and she delivered. Is that funny? For the first 30 seconds. After that? No. And the "male Janine". Yep, Thor. That was introduced as eye candy for women. And they empathize that. He was hilarious, almost the saving grace of this movie. But, if the roles were reversed, feminists would cry foul, and they'd be right. That's your logic right there. Regardless, we always knew Chris Hemsworth was capable of a comedic role in his bag of tricks, he just proved he was capable of that with a very poor written script.The cameos were also almost the saving grace of the movie... until you realize they were there to pull the heart strings of fans to go see it. But, the way they were written in, they could have been done by anyone else. It's almost like the ex you were terribly in love with, wanted to spend the rest of your life with, but things ended, and badly. And now you fail to acknowledge them when you walk pass them on the street. Yeh, a smile, a nod, two or three words, but nothing to remember in the end of the day.But i'll give 5 stars on this movie on one aspect. The cringe factor. I wont say details, I'll save the surprise for when you see it (or don't see it), but they went the extra mile by not going the mile, so the cringe is there, and it's real.I could really go on and nitpick on everything that is wrong on this movie, on screen, and out of it. The list, sadly, is long, and the reasons are well based. It's a shame what the movie is and ended up as being, and for the longest time I hoped that all the bad publicity they were festering were just a publicity stunt. You know, a big joke and the punchline was actually a watchable, fun, blockbuster movie. What they presented... was a ghost shaped turd with a bow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without a doubt, it's the worst movie I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the same vain as George Lucas ruining the original Star Wars trilogy with the prequels, the producers and director of this Ghostbusters reboot have permanently damaged my senses of another fond childhood memory.I've only given a few movies a 1* rating but I really wish there was a -10* rating because just when you think "50 Shades of Grey" and "After Earth" were the worst movie ever made, this turd-pile comes along.The acting was atrocious, the plot was disjointed but the worst part was that the attempted "comedy" managed to silence the entire cinema. I would have enjoyed myself more if I'd bought a baseball bat with my ticket money and beaten myself over the head with it.I wish I could get a refund and erase my memory of having watched this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfunny, Unnecessary and Unworthy of the franchise it leeches off of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was, to put it bluntly, a mistake. After the originally planned Ghostbusters III project died following the sad passing of Harold Ramis in 2014, the franchise should've been left as it was, left to enjoy the legacy it left upon Hollywood. Why it was felt necessary to then re-sculpt this perfect concept is beyond me, even more so considering it's chosen re-designer was Paul Feig. PAUL FEIG. But this was just the first of many bad decisions. They opted to completely reboot the franchise, rejecting any of the original plot devices. They gave the original cast pointless cameos, teasing at the many opportunities that were wasted. They made the characters two-dimensional caricatures with no substance or interesting qualities. And all this before the film was even released, but I decided to give it a chance - I was greatly (but not unexpectedly) disappointed. This film was, quite frankly, as much of a mess as it was a re-hash. It simply rides off of the legacy of the original films, but brings nothing new to the table - The plot very closely resembles that of the original film; all that's new is an incompetent script and some new CGI effects (that are somehow less believable than those used in the original two films from the '80s). So asides from using the power of nostalgia to fool people into watching this film, what does it bring to the table? It brings together a group of four actresses (two of whom I know to bevery talented after seeing them in other films) and completely wastes them on a script so cringe worthy it sounds like it was written by a 14 year old. The characters, as I mentioned, are badly written, none less so then Chris Hemsworth's character, whom is so stupid that it's almost painful to watch. This act is supposed to, somehow, be funny; however, most people over the age of 12 will probably feel otherwise. And it's very noticeable that basically every male character in this film is portrayed as being idiotic, cowardly or an arsehole. This film does focus a lot on gender. We get it. The film has been gender swapped. Very clever. It doesn't mean you have to constantly remind us. We know, just focus on making the movie funny instead of forcing the main cast to spend half the time gawping at Hemsworth. I have no problem with their being a mainly female cast, most of them are very talented actresses; my issue is with the writing and the way they had to make such a point about the fact it's been gender swapped. The script was immature, and simply just tried to hard - It failed to deliver. Another issue is the gadgets and action sequences; this film focuses far too much on these things - It just ends up becoming noisy and unbelievable, the plot gets very little attention. Another thing that gets very little attention is the direction. This films relies heavily on jump cuts and just isn't shot very smoothly - It becomes almost a little jarring to watch at times. In fact, I'm hard pressed to find any real merits at all with this movie. I only laughed once throughout the whole film, this came thanks to a certain screaming man (you'll know what I'm referring to if you've seen it). But asides this, there really is nothing worth seeing in this movie. The original cast cameos, that many people were excited for, were all boring and pointless (they made Bill Murray unfunny...how?!). And the entire film is a boring, unfunny mess with a CGI heavy finale that is sure to disappoint. So on the whole, if I were you, I'd save your money for a different film...any other film. And if you want a proper Ghostbusters sequel, play Ghostbusters: The Video Game (on Xbox 360 or PS3); this game has all the original writers and cast; it's practically the third film that never was...and you get to be a part of it. Basically, don't bother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible hate-filled movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to watch this movie with my life partner Dan. Dan is a trans persons and did not want to stay till the end of the movie, because we were so shocked at the blatant racism and misogyny in this movie. The actors and actresses all depicted very stereotypical tropes. I am African American and the way that the black ghostbuster was portrayed, as a dense brute, was disgusting. This is the last movie that I watch from Sony. All of the white female ghostbusters were depicted as having very high levels of intelligence. The only thing that the black ghostbuster was able to contribute was a knowledge of New York and that she had a car. Why not make the black ghostbuster a scientist also? You do know that we are capable of more than just manual labor, right?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start by saying the reason i gave it a 10, is not because it was the best movie in the world, it's a low quality comedy with very cheesy line and extremely dumb almost slap stick humor. But in the low qual Comedy it's a 10. Here's why. It's really light and stupid funny, I have NEVER seen the original ghost buster and my judgment of this movie is not based on that.The movie is exactly what you would expect it to be, fart jokes, sexist jokes, stereotypical humor. And not slightly terrible cgi. None the less you don't go see this movie with the same mindset as Avatar for example or Mommy from Xavier Dolan. But when you expect just that you can immerse yourself in a very fun and youthful Wiig and Mccarthy humor filled movie! I laugh the loudest the WHOLE movie, i might have stopped laughing for 5 min at the most, i was giggling throughout.The other reason i gave this movie a 10 is because of it's all girl cast, not because i'm a feminist because i'm not. But because remember how the first Ghost Buster marked the past generation, and just picture how important this movie will be and how much it will mark the girls of our next generation and i am very happy they now have kick ass, funny girls to referrer to as models.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was hilarious from the get go. From the very first scene, we were laughing out loud in the theater. I was surprised because usually when a movie has this many former SNL cast members they tend to be painful to watch, but I think the actresses did a great job creating and inhabiting their characters. There were cameos from former Ghostbusters cast members, but they weren't overdone. The 'science' of the story line is fake, and was fake in the first movie-- I don't know why anyone would expect to walk into a movie ABOUT GHOSTS and not think there will be some suspension of disbelief required, but whatever. It was so much fun watching these women building crazy machines and kicking ass. I loved it and can't wait to see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Look. I understand that this movie has legitimate criticism, but I am not going to focus on that in my review, as there is something much more important I need to discuss.I understand all the pain Chris Hemsworth's character is causing everyone on this review site. After all, no one deserves to see the only person of their gender represented as a vapid, idiotic, useless piece of eye candy. No one deserves to sit and watch as they are told that they are only good as a sexy side character in an action movie.Oh. Wait. Hmmmm... Hey has anyone seen how the female characters are treated in the original ghost busters? And, uh... almost every other sci-fi action movie? No?Anyway, here's what I wanted to say. Please, please, please, let us have Ghostbusters. I'm already aware that some dudes are giving this movie negative reviews without actually seeing the movie out of spite. We NEED more movies like this that positively depict women as characters that get stuff done without having to look attractive. These are the characters our daughters need to watch. No matter how conscious of social issues you think you are, most white men will not understand how important it is to see yourselves represented in the media. So I ask you to not scream and cry about one of your favorite movies being rebooted for a different audience. All due respect, your childhood is over. You can go back and watch the "ruined" old ghost busters any time. What you're forgetting is that there are childhoods still happening right now. (I KNOW shocking, right?) I find it important that our girls and our boys grow up seeing that girls can get it done. I WISH this was around when I was younger to show me that YES, I can do whatever I want to do. And this is important because most of the time, the media is already telling this to the boys. If you can't recognize this, please look up "privilege"My 11-year-old brother and my father both adored this movie, and both of them are big fans of the original. And guess what? They both had legitimate criticism, as did I. But they understood that Chris Hemsworth's character was poking fun at the way women are typically treated in film. If an 11-year-old can get the joke and understands why it was in the movie, and you can't, please have several seats.PS look at this picture at the premiere and tell me again that this movie was a waste of time. https://www.buzzfeed.com/davidmack/kristen- wiig-ghostbusters</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie today because I watched the trailer and thought it looked so cool. I really didn't understand why people were hating on it, I didn't notice anything looking too bad. I honestly think this movie is getting so much hate due to the overzealous fanboys of the original. Like, hate to break it to y'all but franchises get remade and rebooted all the time and no matter how much whining you all do in YouTube comments it won't stop people from enjoying a funny movie. This movie doesn't try to recreate the original frame-by-frame, instead it gives a new modern twist to the franchise while still paying homage to the original Ghostbusters. The cast was super funny and all had good chemistry. Chris Hemsworth's character was such a clueless little puppy dog--which apparently makes some people mad for portraying a man as stupid and clueless as if they haven't been doing that to women for years.The final fight scenes throughout New York were totally awesome and showed women as friends kicking ghost ass. Totally a fun and enjoyable movie and I hope all the stupid hate won't stop you from watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As someone who loved the 80s version as a kid, I was of course skeptical of the reboot. I was happy to be wrong. I loved this movie, I saw it at a drive in, which compounded the feelings of nostalgia mixed with something new and fresh. The gender role reversal was brilliant, the jokes were funny for the most part, with Holtzmann stealing the show. The dumb guy was also a brilliant touch, we don't usually see that, and it was so refreshing to see the trope turned on its head. So, sorry man-babies, sorry that a movie hurt you in your nostalgia feels, but we are going to get movies aimed towards us and you don't have to like it, but you are going to have to learn to deal with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read seventeen pages of reviews of this movie with whiny babies weeping over their cheeto-stained faces about how man-hating it is. If you're a rational person, there's so much to enjoy about this movie if you allow yourself to have fun and go into it without being determined to hate it beforehand. I found this movie much better than the first original Ghostbusters, it had much more action, cooler gadgets, and the characters had distinct personalities rather than all being the greasy-looking shmos from the original. (still not sure why they made bill murray look like he hadn't had a shower in weeks, but i digress) The visuals are bright and colorful, a welcome change from the monochrome baddies of most action / paranormal movies. the gadgets are cool, there's enough weirdness to make you laugh. The theater i was in were laughing at all the jokes in the movie. Yeah there's camp, but the movie is well-aware of it's goofy elements and makes the most of them. The movie works well as a fun time for most age ranges, i'm 25 but i could see how a lot of kids would really enjoy this along with their parents and older siblings (in a good way, similar to the level of humor in the originals which was a little goofy too) Kate Mckinnon was definitely the highlight of the film and what made it really stand out for me, with Kristen Wiig, Leslie Jones and Melissa McCarthy each bringing their usual brand of humor to their characters. If you're a normal human being, there's plenty to like about this Ghostbusters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Please don't listen to the fanboy hate about this movie. The only thing that it will do is keep you from seeing such a wonderful, funny movie. The new Ghostbusters was everything and more of what I expected and come to love of the Ghostbusters. First off, it was hilarious like to the point I had to stop myself from laughing and it wasn't easy. I laughed so much that my eye's started to blur from the tearing up. There were so many gut busting moments that I couldn't help but crack up. Leslie for me stole the show with her bold personality. I kept wanting to see more scenes were her in it. Kate was also hilarious. All four of the ladies were strong in their own ways and they worked very well together. There was a lot of chemistry.The graphics and ghosts were amazing. I definitely recommend seeing it in IMAX 3D if you can. I really felt fully submerged into the Ghostbuster world. There were times that I was actually scared by the ghosts and jumped out of my seat. I don't ever remember getting scared in the first two. There were a lot of fun references to the first two and really did a great job of honoring the legacy. I loved all the cameos by the original cast. Sigourney Weaver was my favorite by far! Dan Aykroyd was pretty funny as well.I loved this version so much that I'm going back to the theater to see it again this week. Like I left the theater wanting more. Also stay until the end of the credits, trust me on that one. I really hope they make more as I love a world where all four leads are four intelligent, strong, bad-ass women!!! It will open the doors for so many girls and women alike, who might not have normally been brought in. Who am I going to call? Kristen, Melissa, Kate and Leslie!!! That's for sure!!! I give it five ghosts out of five!!! I really hope that it does well enough to make more with these four fantastic ladies!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went into the movie with no expectations, and I found it funny and an enjoyable summer blockbuster. Some of the one liners were hilarious: Patty saying, "That ghost is gonna be the third scariest thing on that (subway) train." The uncle thinking his car being "on the other side" means it's in NJ. Music score was meh. I haven't seen the original in about 20 years, so can't compare it to the original, but I think a lot of the negative reviewers need to get their panties out of a bunch. I didn't hear anyone complaining when the new star wars came out and was almost the same plot as the original. How many times they gonna do batman? I feel like a lot of the reviewers either went in expecting high brow humor and got mad at the family guy level, or are angry manboys in a twist that the ghostbusters are all female. Don't see them complaining that the original were all men. While I feel they should have toned down some of the man ridicule in the movie, it doesn't deserve the vendetta going against it that started before it was even out. These are probably the same ugly misogynists who caused gamer-gate and dump hate on female video game players. I hope their moms slap them upside their heads, cause they clearly need it.</fullReview>

The girls have chemistry on the screen, the jokes are on spot. Chris Hemsworth is funny also. There is a clever tie in at the end, although not explained that well.

		<fullReview>I'm a child of the late 80s/early 90s. My knowledge of ghostbusters was seeing it replayed on cable, the cartoon, and Ecto-Cooler juice boxes. I'm not a die-hard fan but I've always loved the movie.That being said, I went into this movie with an open mind. I've heard nothing but "It's hilarious" and "It's the perfect nod to the movies" from friends - and I was not disappointed. The chemistry between the four leads - and Chris Hemsworth - is fantastic. Their comedic styles are all different but it WORKS. We were loudly laughing with the whole theater to the point that our stomachs hurt. And on the flip side, the research and conviction towards the paranormal and science was what you hope for with the franchise. We laughed, gasped and clapped for every cameo. It doesn't try to be the originals - it doesn't need to. New universe - new story. But the nods to the originals - and NY - were perfect.I will be seeing this multiple times. Thank you to the cast and crew for doing right by this franchise. I can't wait to see a sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is funny as hell, and the four main actors really made this film their own with hilarious quirky characters. Yes it is like the original, that's the nature of a re-make. But the characters are not clones of the originals, if you are expecting a line for line re-make that's not this. Of course there is a similar story line (again: remake!) Brilliant cameos from the original GB stars, including a sweet nod to Harold Ramis near the beginning. (Stay for the credits to see one more!) The special effects are well done, and it's scary but not too scary for the older kids. The one thing I would have liked to see is for Leslie Jones' character to also be a scientist. Of course many of the (male) reviewers hated the tables being turned, with Chris Hemsworth playing a gorgeous but grievously dumb secretary. Down with Hollywood misogyny! Go see it.</fullReview>

All four women do an outstanding job, but the shining star is without a doubt Kate McKinnon as Jillian Holtzmann. Chris Hemsworth is hilarious as the role reversed cute but not so smart secretary, and the cameos by Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts and Sigourney Weaver are pure gold.

It's not because the cast is female, it's bad because it's not funny, does not feature any compelling characters and... oh dear, it's supposed to be a comedy and the jokes just. Are. Not. Funny.There is a long string of positive reviews here but I am certain that these are made for political reasons. They are way, way too positive to be honest. I can believe it that some people might find this movie "ok" or "worth a watch" but it's literally impossible that anyone finds it a "10/10" and "hilarious". That's just not possible.Whatever your politics, whatever you think of the female cast, whether you are a feminist or not, female or not, young or old, here is the full, uncensored, sad truth: This is a bad movie. See it at your own risk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Funny. Not Scary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was supposed to be a comedy but the only jokes were about how dumb the handsome guy was. I thought it was supposed to be scary but the only thing that scared me was the bad acting. Also, the ending where they jump down the hole makes no sense. And why are there only like fifty clown ghosts they have to fight? Shouldn't there just be a wave of ghosts from the thousands of years humans have been dying? And what about our prehistoric ancestors? Where is the cutoff from them to humans? And why aren't there any animal ghosts? I had a real problem with how they kept shooting those lasers all willy nilly when it was clear it would kill them or an innocent bystander if they got hit? The whole thing had no thought put into it. Seemed rushed to the theaters to capitalize on the whole pc thing.Do yourself a favor. Stay home and watch the second Ghostbusters. The one with the evil painting. That one is a milion times better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A tribute to the original. Anything about Ghostbusters and it takes us back in time. The Ivan Reitman project was hands down colossal. You watch it even in this era and it still manages to leave its impression on you. Paul Feig's Ghostbusters comes nowhere close to bringing that old anxious charm of the original. It is funny alright, but there is nothing that could bring it close let alone surpass the levels of Reitman's work.DIRECTION AND PLOT OF GHOSTBUSTERS Ghostbusters skims on the surface of the original, so there is nothing extraordinary that the movie has to offer, except for glimpses, characters and ghosts from the past that fill you up with nostalgia. There are plenty of elements from the 1984 gang strewn all across the movie. You might go, "Ah! There he is!" or "Oooh! Oooh! That's from the old one!" Clinging to the original fun theme of the movie, that neither goes too dark or stays too aloof from it, Ghostbusters manages to walk well on what it was proposed to canter on. However, there isn't an element of surprise lurking anywhere here. The world Paul Feig creates is unaffected by ghosts, the multitude of dumbness, who stay unfazed by the lives of any ghostbuster, unaware of what's going on. They seem to come in as they please, react when it seems fit to them.Feig's direction goes to awkward enclaves when he constantly keeps chopping off frames quickly moving on from one scene to another without caring enough for the audience to take it in. You can witness the shoddy editing go strangely awry at so many points that it creates a portal of disconnect.GOOD BITS TO CHERISH Chris Hemsworth as Kevin is probably the funniest thing in Ghostbusters. The only notable and memorable element that you might want to talk about in the long run, owing to the levels of dumbness he is shown scaling. Kristen Wiig's Erin Gilbert has an instant apparent crush on him and she aces it with her superb comic timing.Kate McKinnon builds up a strange character Jillian Holtzmann which is oddly satisfying. She does most of the work for the team. She has this eccentric cool style that will make you love her instantly.CAMEOS AND GLIMPSES FROM THE PAST (SPOILERS OBVIOUSLY DU-UH!) There are plenty of cameos to watch out for. First of all, all those major characters from the 1984 movie pop up every now and then at odd hours namely: Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Ernie Hudson. Not to forget Annie Potts who reprises her role as the desk receptionist here as well. Ozzy Osbourne shows up at one point too which was a pleasant surprise. Slimer the green ghost gets to drive the Ecto 1. It was good to see him revived after so long.The ugly part of it all was that their inclusion seemed oddly forced. There was no subtlety to it. No jokes flew when they were there and that makes it look utterly fabricated. Camera zooms in at a lot of places to deliberately show a past reference. Easter Eggs are like lying in front of the camera for 2 minutes for you to notice.FINAL VERDICT If you divide the movie in subsections, you will realize that the movie does fairly well in the first half. In the later half Ghostbusters' humour simply drops dead. If you focus on how it manages to bring back every character from the past, you will have nothing less than goosebumps on your body. Humour comes naturally with the inclusion of Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig. But if you look at it as a complete movie, sadly it fails to dilate your eyes.Read all my reviews here: http://straightfromamovie.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who you going to call? Well, it's not 2016's 'Ghostbusters'. It was a bust to me. I didn't like it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even before this movie trailer even came out, its production spark a lot of negativity hostility over the choices that director Paul Feig has done to reboot the 'Ghostbuster' series. One of those decisions, was the idea of replace the old and aging original actors from the 1984's film, 'Ghostbusters', with new female cast, playing new characters capturing ghosts like Melissa McCarthy as Dr. Abby Yates, Kristen Wiig as Dr. Erin Gilbert, Kate McKinnon as Dr. Jillian Holtzmann &amp; Leslie Jones as Patty Tolan. Personally, for me, I would little to no problem with this, if only, Feig choose to do something new with that, instead, of hiring the same tiresome two actresses, he work with, the last several 5 years. Me, personally, I'm not a big fan of Wiig or McCarthy's past works, but I'm still willing to see, their movies if they deliver, something funny. Sadly, they were not. They were by far, the weakest of the main characters. Surprising, both McKinnon, and Jones's characters were a lot funnier. They weren't as offensive as the trailer make them out to be. However, I can't say, the same for Chris Hemsworth as Kevin Beckman and the other men characters in the film, whom comes across, as too dumb, horrible or mean-spirited. The movie is more misandry than misogamy, it seems. I also didn't like the cameos of the original actors in different roles. It was too jarring and sad. Sadly, this movie didn't hit my funny bone, much, too. It was mostly a miss for me. I was more disappointed, than angry. Yet, I did think, other critics and fans, went a little overboard. Even before the film even came out, people went totally insane. If you thought it looked good, you were betraying the original. If you thought it looked bad, you were a sexist and racist pig. There was no in-between. If you wanted to go see it, you were wrong. If you didn't want to go see it, you were wrong in not seeing it. Talking about 'Ghostbusters' has really became unpleasant to talk about. I kinda miss, the old days, where the only debate was if 1989's 'Ghostbusters II' was meh or not. Now, it's a bloodbath cover in political/social yellow tape. It's hard to talk about this movie, without addressing all of "controversy" surrounding it. So let's start with the reasons, why there is a reboot in the first place. The reason why there isn't a third 'Ghostbusters' is because one big reason: Bill Murray. His refusal to commit to any studio blockbuster project as the main lead, really hurt the production. Personally, he wish to act less and not deal with the studios; so he continue to have a career in smaller quirky melancholy Indy films taking supporting roles; only showing up in bigger films if he was voice-acting or playing a minor character. For the most part, it was somewhat alright decision from him. However, it killed any attempt on a 'Ghostbusters III' sequel. Add to the fact that Murray suffers from mood swings that often butt-heads, with original co-stars, Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd, then you know why this idea fail. Honestly, in my opinion, Columbia &amp; Sony should had made the movie without him, years ago, as it pretty clear, that his trolling with them. If you got anybody to blame for this movie existing; blame Murray's stubbornness and Columbia's cowardly to greenlit the production without him. Yes, it's a big pill to swallow, but you will swallow it. Harold Ramis's death in 2014 was the death nail, yet somewhat its revival. It's finally gave Columbia &amp; Sony's some balls to go against Bill Murray for dragging his feet on a planned "Ghostbusters" reboot. Now, this brings us to Sony Hack Scandal of 2014 in which North Korean hackers released private information about oncoming movies on the internet in revenge for mocking their leader in the 2014's film 'The Interview'. It's here, that expose the misguided influence of the studio. They knew that Feig had some strange and essentially blasphemous ideas he had for a sequel/reboot, which they knew would stir up enough controversy and hype towards the project. In a leaked email, it was revealed that he had pitched some concepts that could appeal to the highly popular, 'Social Justice' Movement. Later emails has also show, Sony "rigging" of YouTube comments for the initial trailer, removing any negative comments that don't expressly address the misogynistic, anti-women angle, as well as discussing what the original 'Ghostbusters' cast thought about the project from behind the scenes, contrary to what the media would have you believe. While none of this is a valid excuse for the marketing failure, it at least answers some questions as to why they felt the need to create such an insulting representation of such a beloved franchise. The more and more backlash I see against this film, and all the controversy surrounding it, I just have to ask: why are we getting so hostile over something like 2016's 'Ghostbusters'!?! It's a stupid premise movie. Nothing was really that special, besides 'women attraction', the plot and character traits is pretty much recycle, just now full of unneeded exposition; because of that, this movie suffers from bad pacing. The villain is also forgettable and generic; plus his unlimited powers is not explain well. The action scenes with the ghostbusters look fake and unrealistic. It's seem like Feig was a fan of 1986's 'The Real Ghostbusters' TV cartoon series, because the CGI ghosts look too cartoony, like if they were leftovers from 2003's 'Haunted Mansion' and 2004's 'Scooby Doo 2 Monsters Unleashed'. Last, but not least, the modern remixed of the classic 'Ghostbuster' theme by the band, Fall Out Boy, was horrible. Overall: I wanted to really give this movie, a chance with me, but unfortunately it is just below average. I can't recommended watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ghostbusters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr. Yate's hand-held, symmetric photon gun did the trick. Ghosts like driving cars and destroying whatever is in their path. It all begins when a tour guide at an historic house in NYC investigates a noise made behind a locked door where a man's daughter had been kept. Inside the room is a floating, glowing female ghost that was locked up in the room because she had killed her dad's servants. All that expelled green stuff is from dehydration, I guess. That's when the Ghostbusters get a call. The movie's animation is very good and colorful. Some of the Ghostbusters' acting resembles the Three Stooges. Ghosts can get very big. They live anywhere they can, i.e., they can use things as a host like the ghost that was a prisoner hidden in an electrical box along the subway tracks. A Ghostbuster member put a sign of Ghostbuster on the car door. Earlier, a man spray-painted it inside the Seward subway stop. Dr. Gilbert studied the life of a ghost put in a container by the Ghostbusters. One Ghostbuster made a bear trap for ghosts. How inventive. Bill Murray, from SNL, makes a cameo appearance as an authority on hunting ghosts. He's attacked by a ghost while sitting. He's the same very funny Bill Murray. Can the existence of ghosts be explained scientifically? Dr. Gilbert (Kristin Wiig) is funny too and very handy with the Ghostbuster know-how and weaponry.</fullReview>

A 1 means you were attacked or rubbed or beaten and they destroyed your life.Stop being a smart-ass!

		<shortDescription>From a Woman's Perspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a woman. I am also a huge fan of the original Ghosbusters movies. I was very reluctant to watch this movie, and I finally broke down and watched it for free. Let me tell you, this movie is absolutely horrible. Not funny. Throwaway characters. Recycled plot. I couldn't even find a single thing I enjoyed. What's sad is this movie seemed to have all of the best ingredients to make a five star meal. Sadly, this is not even tolerable. There are crude anti-male messages scattered throughout the movie. It's like, "Hey! I get it. Men are evil or stupid." I don't understand how this film would even be appropriate for children. Sure, some jokes (like vaginal farts!) may fly over their neophyte little minds, but I think it's not a good idea. Any parent that thinks this is appropriate for kids needs to have their kids taken away by Social Services. Seriously. This movie does not promote feminism or girl power or any other such nonsense. It was labeled as a reboot, when in reality, it is a remake, through and through. The jokes are unoriginal and downright stolen from other movies. The feminist supporters and their ridiculous attempts to trick people into seeing this movie almost makes me embarrassed to have a vagina. If you like original movies, funny movies, and even have a modicum of good taste in movies, AVOID. This is just a cash grab and nothing else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly my comments has nothing to do with cast choices .I'm saying this because I saw the interview with the producer that try to justify the bad feed back the movie gets just because the cast has only woman's.What caught my attention was and enormous quantities of dislike of the previous video release of the movie, so I decide to watch any way since this can't tell with the movie is bad or not.The movie itself was an attempt to do an remake write, but in my opinion he fails. Ghostbusters 2016 movie fail to delivery something simple like "fun" unlike the previous one that did that very well.BoSSi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much for that Franchise idea, Sony</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The new Ghostbusters is a troubled movie. It can't possibly hold up to the 80s classic, but at the same time it can't possibly be as bad as many predicted (or indeed wanted) it to be. On the plus side, it's no Fant4stic. On the other hand, it's simply not good enough to be above average. Feig gives it a fair shot but only succeeds in showing that he's really not cut out for directing a big blockbuster. If you are in two minds as to see this movie, don't worry you already have. The Entire Plot of the Movie is revealed in the trailers and TV Spots, from the Library opening to the ball blasting climax. Where the original Ghostbusters was filmed, and works, as an actual horror film, this is more Scooby-Doo, played for laughs rather than chills. And that's its main failing. It's played For laughs. The original cast played their characters totally straight. The new cast almost nods and winks through the fourth wall as if to say "Hey, isn't this funny?"Melissa McCarthy is, once again, Melissa McCarthy, although not as much Melissa McCarthy as her recent disappointing solo outings. Her one joke schtick is already passed its sell by date, and even though she works best under Feig's direction, there's no sign here of her expanding beyond the "I'm fat and obnoxious" level of comedy. Kristen Wiig is actually on paper the central character, but her character is so bland she has very little to make her stand out, and is reduced to the straight man for McCarthy and Jones' shouting and slapstick. Kate McKinnon is a comedian/actor I'm unfamiliar with. In the UK we don't get SNL so this was my first take on her. She plays Zany very well. The problem is once it's established she's "the Zany One" you know exactly what she's going to do. Leslie Jones' character is by no means the "token black", like Ernie Hudson, but her performance is So over the top and cartoony (I almost expected her to scream "A g? g? g? GHOST! ZOIKS!" before running away after pedalling her legs in mid-air with a DL-DL-DL-DL sound effect), so obnoxious and so ridiculously, stereotypical "Shouty Black Woman" that even a racist would say "Steady on". Rounding out the team is Chris Hemsworth, showing once again he can pull off comedy, if in small doses. Although completely over the top, the few genuine laughs I had watching this film was from Thor in Father Dougal mode. However, even this started to wear thin after you realised "He's dumb" was the one joke the character served. There's also a nefarious bad guy played by Neal Casey, but his role is so sidelined it's more or less blink and you miss it. Overall the movie is a disjointed mess, with brief glimpses of a good film trying to get out. The library opening works well and is genuinely fun, but the movie drags after that, with a series of flat joyless comedy sketches, that appear to be largely improvised. The climactic battle in Times Square is where Feig's failings as a director come to the fore. He is well out of his depth in a big FX heavy action movie. The battles with the ghosts and the final conflict at the portal are painfully obviously green screen, and the actors' "Look out! There's nothing there!" reactions kill any believability, and wrench you right out of the movie. The SFX/cgi by itself isn't really all that bad, it just seems over done and already a little out of date, like you're watching a film from 5 or 10 years ago. In the end the movie falls flat because it simply tries too hard. It tries too hard to be funny, so there's no wit or charm of the original. It even tries too hard at being respectful to the original Ghostbusters, as every reference brings everything to a halt, not letting the film just be it's own thing, and makes you wish you could just see Ghostbusters 3. All the males - ALL - are either idiots or insufferably condescending douchebags, or a mixture of both. So much so that I think this is an insult to female heroes. What kind of message does the movie project? That women can only be capable if the men are total F#wits in comparison? Then In the end the team blast the giant Ghostbusters logo In The Dick! Symbolically emasculating the Ghostbusters. I could only take that as a giant "F# You!" to the fans who have criticised this project that Sony studios have beaten to a bloody pulp from the original Ghostbusters 3 concept. As to whether they will be granted this franchise depends on the box office. Personally I can't see this movie being anything other than a moderate success. With a budget of over $140 million it may clear pass this post, but I doubt it will surpass it, justifying a sequel and spin offs. On top of that, the promotion and producers and even some of the cast have already alienated the fans they were relying to flood the cinema seats with nostalgia, and the movie itself does nothing to heal any wounds (one scene even blatantly thumbs its nose at online critics, making this film unique in that it actually acts like a bit of a dick to its intended audience). If you are a 1984 Ghostbusters fan you are going to range from being indifferent to outright hating this movie. If you're an average film goer you'll probably be mildly entertained, a good little laugh, but afterwards totally forget what the fuss was all about with no real outstanding memory, like all of Feig's films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If This is What Passes for Comedy ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wife and I don't get out to the movies often these days but when a close friend who works at a local newspaper offered us free passes to a midweek showing of Ghostbusters in exchange for our feedback we figured we both count ourselves as Melissa McCarthy fans so there was nothing to lose. How wrong we were. What can you say about a movie that you see for free and still feel like you were cheated? Well here are a few things.Leslie Jones, wow that was terrible. Truly painful to watch and one of the worst performances in a movie ever witnessed. Not merely because of her lack of acting chops, the character itself is not so subtly reminiscent of something from a minstrel show, so it's doubtful anyone could have done much with it and you can't help but feel embarrassed for her. Imagine Eddie Murphy's SNL skit Buckwheat Sings the Blues, but presented as a legitimate recording artist in 2016. Leslie should fire her agent immediately for having even brought her this script.Note the qualifier ONE of the worst because ...right there next to her is Kate McKinnon delivering a far worse performance in the same film. Stiff, monotonous, funerial, utterly unbelievable ... sorry those words don't even begin cover it. If there were a way to make such a wager, place your money on - she was reading her lines from cue cards someone was holding next to the camera she was staring into. More than a couple scenes where she tried to spin hipness into her squint character with some truly awkward physical "comedy" that where literally cringe inducing. At least Leslie's poorly conceived character provides her some measure of cover, Kate McKinnon's epic failure is all her own.Beyond the those two horrific performances the screen writing was an unmitigated disaster. From one early scene with its painfully obvious anti-Trump "joke," it quickly devolves into one poorly delivered left-wing sucker punch after another not one of which was even remotely funny. Very sad to see Melissa McCarthy involve herself with such a caustic and unpleasant project as she may never be able to wash the stench of this catastrophe off of herself.Unlike the majority of the twenty or so people who were in theater with us when it began, we hung around until the end wondering if it could deliver one, single solitary laugh, a chuckle, a chortle ... anything ... but alas none were to be had. Lots of head shaking, eye rolling and a few exasperated WOWs exchanged between those of us leaving as the credits rolled.Indeed, as we started to say, if this is what passes for comedy in Hollywood today then nobody should be wondering why they're taking a beating at the box office lately and the people who made this mess deserve to take a bath on it.</fullReview>

The cast is garbage, Kristen Wiig is like cardboard, Melissa McCarthy is a less talented Chris Farley, and Leslie Jones is a 1970s blaxploitation actress. I'm old enough to have seen the originals in the movie theater and this version is a black mark on those two. I pray that that no one dares consider making a sequel. I quite enjoy ghost related programming as well, things like ghost adventures, which makes this film even more of an affront. I can still watch the original, years later over and over. The chemistry of Ramos and Murray cannot be reproduced. The movie is horrible, absolute waste of money.</fullReview>

They did this political crap with Annie making her black I'm just because people don;t want her black don't mean they're racist! Hate this crap, I really do! But yeah the gender change was sh*t &amp; furthermore unnecessary considering it was 4 men playing the parts! I also didn't find the film that interesting or fun in any way! It was sloppy, all over the place &amp; badly slapped together! Like a messed up sandwich that has been made in 10 seconds flat! It was so boring &amp; flat, I even didn't know what to say when the film ended! It was just grey! Can't find the words being honest! But that just shows you how much I disliked this film.The film itself did n't have any redeeming qualities about it! I can't think of 1 thing I liked about it being honest! I also disliked the sexism too portraying the men as being evil or stupid! Again, another thing I hate in the day &amp; age when women want to be more empowered but put men down in order to make themselves feel better! Which is also a thing I hated about this film, though it was few &amp; far between you still felt that vibe throughout the 90 odd minutes of the film! The end part annoyed me quite a bit!The effects weren't anything special &amp; not really that interesting! So yeah! I mean they were terrible but not great &amp; didn't get me interested in the film whatsoever! It even got me lost as I didn't find it fun! I overall didn't like this film &amp; found it to be quite boring &amp; sexist not to me mention flat as a wizards c*ck!Watch the 1984 Ghostbusters with the guys in it! It was &amp; still so much better than this waste of space of a film! 1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This piece of feminist pablum deserves to burn in the 9th circle of hell for besmirching the franchise with its offensive odor. Theodious Paul Feig himself should be tarred and feathered for inflicting this travesty on the Ghostbusters faithful and for attempting to insert more politically correct clap trap into an established franchise.I really don't give a flying fart if anyone wishes to consider me sexist for what i am saying or for what i will say. What i speak is the truth and a truth that is quietly understood among people who are not slaves to the matriarch men in particular find themselves under.The story isn't just implausible, it'd downright absurd. 4 females investigating paranormal creatures when most females are apt to be frightened by mice skittering across the floor? Yeah right. Tell me another one.I have little confidence in the collective intelligence of the average movie viewer (especially after the success of garbage like Lucy and Mad Max Fury Road) but i will hope against hope that people still have enough synaptic functionality to avoid this movie like the plague. This movie is a prime example of why piracy is still alive in well in the movie industry. No one wants to pay exorbitant ticket prices to be eye fed a politically correct agenda underneath a poor excuse for a script.I hope it bombs and bombs hard!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't going to post a review - but seeing as how countless SJW's are posting reviews without seeing the film, then I will do the same. The reason I am rooting for this to fail is simply - I want more quality, new, fresh ideas with movies. The more reboots that occur, the less innovative ideas we get. If reboots start really failing at the box office, movie companies will be FORCED to come up with new ideas for films which, in turn, could lead to new great films. These cheap, lazy "cash grabs" will prevent them from doing that though if reboots like this, Clash of the Titans, etc are successful. So I am giving this a 1/10 to balance out the SJW's who are giving it 10/10 without seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sigh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I get into specifics which may or may not contain spoilers, I want to get this out of the way. Younger kids will enjoy the new movie. There are a lot of things going on, goofy moments, and other things that kids like. I foresee the movie being a good way to introduce new toys and other merchandise that kids will want.With that being said, as an adult and a fan of the originals... trying to take the bias thoughts of being a fan out of the equation, this is not a Ghostbusters movie by any means.This movie plays out like a poor parody of The Ghostbusters, and would have been better served by not taking on the namesake and being marketed as a similar movie in the same genre with a similar story. I was literally sick at my stomach during and after the movie to even think this could be associated with the original property in any shape or form.THE MOVIE: This was a forced comedy with forced winks that were unclever and honestly gave no addition to the enjoyment of the movie itself. Too many aspects of the movie were overkill. From the overabundance of CGI and non interesting ghost, to a new forced joke every few moments, I found myself just sighing.I feel like the director wanted to really wanted to create his own vision but felt that if he didn't force everything upon us it wouldn't sell. That is where he made his mistake. The backstory, what little bit there was, was boring and skipped over anything that could be remotely entertaining.The nods and forced comedy were mediocre at their best. The overall storyline played out in what was a disappointing first act, alright second act, and very underwhelming third act in a movie that seemed to go by quickly, but not quick enough.THE ACTORS: I LOVE Kristen Wiig, Melisa McCarthy, and Leslie Jones. All three of those women are terrific actresses and very funny.Just not in this movie.Kristen Wiig was annoying. her character made me sigh every time she opened her mouth and the role was just so irritating I kept hoping she'd just be killed off. I feel as if she was supposed to be the Peter Venkman type of character for this movie, and they failed horribly.Melisa McCarthy's characters was annoying and immature. The jokes they had for her were some of the most forced and her true comedic performance could never shine through as she delivered what I can only imagine were lines she just wanted a payday for. This is by far the worst role I have ever seen her in and it may have turned me off of her for a while.Leslie Jones. Type-casted from the start. She plays the same role she ALWAYS plays but damn it, I wanted something different this time. I wanted her to take this major role she's been given and give us something we haven't seen before. The writing for her... man... I would have rather they kept her part down to the size they gave Ernie Hudson in the original movies than force her to be so up front with how ridiculous they wrote her. She was bland, not funny, and quite sadly given a "token black character" role. Shame on you Sony. Shame on you.Kate McKinnon. This is the one person I was NOT familiar with at all going into this, but also the most interesting of the 4 core actresses. She played her character amazingly. The little things she did and how she delivered her lines were just entertaining and felt organic. If there is a stand out performance for the movie, it's this woman.With that being said, the supporting cast was more entertaining than the main cast (sans Kate). Chris Hemsworth was great and gave me a chuckle a few times during the movie. Bill Murray's cameo was good but too short lived. And nice nods to the other originals.Except for the main bad guy and the tour guide who started the movie out. Those guys annoyed me every scene they were in. Terrible, TERRIBLE acting. The characters were horrendous, and I think they had a major part in ruining the entire movie experience for me.THE NODS: The nods to the original were good, but mostly forced as previously stated. Bill Murray was the best of the cameos, Ernie Hudson was only in the very end with a very predicable role, Dan Akyord was just a few moments and felt out of place with his dialogue. Nice to see the original actress to play Jeanine as well as Sigourny Weaver. That was quite a surprise for me. The Staypuft Marshmellow Man cameo was great.Too many other forced nods. The theme music played like 5 different times in 5 different ways. The firehouse was forced, just none of it needed.OVERALL: Do not pay to see this movie. Wait till it's on TV or Netflix. Or take the kids to it. If you do go to see it, go in with the thought process its another bland comedy but in a ghost catching genre. Do NOT go in with ANY expectation that this will come close to touching anything in the Ghostbusters universe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another bad SNL skit with some funny parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw it last night at a special screening. Sony even set it up with IMAX 3d for the free screening. The cameos were depressingly sad. The story was non-existent. The movie had some real good funny moments followed by a ton of "meh" in the middle. It was like a mediocre SNL skit. Mckinnon was good but by the middle she acts like something off of a 10 year old's Nickelodeon TV show and becomes annoying. Jones is good for a few lines at a time before you realize she can't act. Hemsworth is Hemsworth and his character is done so bad you can't figure out how he functions as a human being. This version is a very empty shell of the original. No depth in the story or characters and the talent is nothing compared to the original at all. And the movie is designed to set up this argument "If you don't like this movie then you are a sexist". Sorry it fails all on it's own without sexism.And it even fails on it's own not being compared to the original. Maybe they need to stop casting "Buddies" together and write better. The "we hire everyone from SNL" stuff should stop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film tried so hard to make ever man seem so full of misogyny. It's not even funny. The jokes fall flat. The action their is sucks. crude humor not even delivered well, Dick jokes, man babies, token virtue signaling girl power. Basically everything you should expect from the complete shills that made this film. In fact, I'd say the best joke of all is expecting this steaming pile to make money. I think if they had instead gotten a bunch of Apes and strapped vacuum cleaners to their backs we would have ended up with a better film. They also managed to shoehorn in really bad relationships. So, if you wish to waste your time and money go watch this film, or you can do something a bit more fun like watch paint dry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine someone made a remake of the Original movie for Youtube. They collect their friends together, jot down a few ideas on a piece of paper. Come up with a few gags. Then they film themselves in the back yard and upload the film. Someone then takes their idea and spends millions on it with a shiny cast and lots of CGI. The original foundations of the idea still show. It's a poor attempt at throwing money at something to try and make it good. Don't bother. I wanted to like this movie but from the start it just feels forced. I would recommend watching the original. That's what my kids will be doing. You would be better off buying the Bluray and saving all that money at the cinema.</fullReview>

The movie is similar to the first one; but, does not have the good directing, writing, acting, on-screen chemistry, special effects.I guess if you wanted to copy a Billy Madison movie quote: "Principal: Mr. Madison, what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it.

		<shortDescription>Depicts men as inferior in this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another stereotypical movie but this time it's also men-bashing movie that is designed to fulfill someone's agenda of men-bashing. It claims to be equal or progressive but it is anything but. The "man" in the movie working as a secretary is treated like dirt and is treated like an object, which I am very uncomfortable about. He is belittled and sort of used like a dog and scenes where he is "hired" based on his looks sends the wrong message. That is pretty sexist to me in this day and age. Where is equality in that? This is not funny, not progressive and certainly offensive. Why was there a need to degrade male culture? Why??? If you want to be equal, BE equal, not offensive. If it were a female character being treated like an object, such as the case in the new GB movie, except it's a male secretary in the movie, there would have been a backlash. Jokes are not funny, and are forced, this movie is TRYING to be funny, instead of BEING funny. And lastly, what genre does this new reboot movie belong to? I thought the original idea of ghostbusters is more of a sci-fi/horror with some elements of humor. However, the new movie seems to try too hard to be a silly joke after joke...and fails at that. Whether you watch it or not, try for a moment to imagine the scenes where the male secretary is treated like dirt, if it were to be the opposite gender. Would it be OK? The popular media would have been all over it.If they wanted to be equal and all that, they should have employed humor on all genders, without 'targeting' males, in order to prove their true intentions of being equal, progressive and neutral. I think the director has some issues with males/men and probably took something personal to him and reflected it in the movie to show his disrespect towards an entire gender. Basically, to serve his or someone's agenda. What a way to alienate an entire gender from disliking the movie, aside from the movie being crap. If you want to sell/market a movie, don't alienate your customers - should be the lesson learned here!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a huge fan of Ghostbusters, the movie was a great experience in my childhood, the original Ghostbusters was a near perfect film.I went into this one, with my son, and it was a huge disappointment.There is no chemistry between the actors, wooden acting, and the comedic elements are flat and artificial. There was no inherent creativity in the making of the movie, just a by the book cash grabbing project.I thought that due to the fact, that it was only a women cast, could give this near perfect franchise a nice twist, adding a new dimension to the whole idea.. Unfortunately it didn't, the cast feels like a randomly thrown together group which in no way relate to the characters which they are playing.It's cringeworthy as how much effort the cast puts into this, to fit in the shoes of the original cast, but fails miserably as they don't seem to be able to relate to original genius of the previous cast, which made Ghostbusters great.A missed opportunity, and a wrecked franchise is the result of this experiment.. Too bad..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High hopes.... maybe too high...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a "hater" by any stretch of the imagination. I am a fan of the Ghostbuster franchise, loved both the original movie and the sequel as well as the animated cartoon show. I went to this movie looking forward to a refreshing new take on the Ghostbusters and was very disappointed with what I got. Firstly, let me say that I'm not a GB fanboy/fangirl by any stretch and I'm not comparing this Ghostbusters to the original because it can't be compared. I wanted to see four powerful, smart and funny females rock this movie and show the ghosts who's boss. Sadly, despite my high hopes, this movie fell flat. Kristen Wiig's "leading lady"-ish when it should have been Melissa McCarthy as the lead. Kristen's jokes were stale and the same jokes I've seen in dozens of her past movies, nothing particularly new or funny about it. Melissa McCarthy I felt was just a toss away in this movie. Why she wasn't given more lines, more starring scenes, I'll never understand. Perhaps because she's not an SNL alumni? I don't know. I felt like she was vastly underutilized and it's a crying shame because she is comedy gold in my eyes. They didn't use her enough. Her scenes that she did have a bigger part in, were funny. Kate McKinnon was great in her role. I see her becoming a new comedic lead and I honestly really love her and Leslie Jones from SNL. They're both very funny women but I feel like they weren't given enough room or a good enough script to let the comedic genius inside them shine bright. The movie apparently attacked anti-feminists before coming out and angered a lot of fanboys and I wasn't one of them but as a female leading movie, I think it was in poor taste to constantly bash men in the movie. I couldn't stand the guy who played Thor in his role and the overall anti-male tone of the movie just didn't sit well with me. You can be funny and feminist without constantly beating up men with jokes and remarks... The original Ghostbusters didn't sit and cut down women, why the new take on it with an all female cast felt the need to bash men just baffles me. It distracted from what could have been a great movie. If they replaced all of the man hate with jokes and maybe even a storyline ala Peter and Dana, perhaps with Kristen Wiig's character and male, it would have been a much better movie. Let's be honest, a lot of the content/premise was taken from the first movie but switched around a bit and less funny. The hint to Zuul in the after credits scene had me cringing. If they do a sequel let's hope for more laughs, more jokes and less hatefulness in the movie. It was just too much bashing and too little laughing for my taste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Female Engineer, Please Do Not Go, Have your kids watch Original Ghostbusters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all the melodrama surrounding this movie, I figure it's important to disclose my mindset. Since criticism of this movie is being deflect with ad hom attacks. I don't really care about casting choices. As someone sign up with MoviePass I usually go to every movie. I also enjoy listening to movie podcasts. I'm of the mind set, let's judge a movie by the actually quality of the final product. The trailers had me alarm, but maybe it because I'm getting old it's rare for a trailer to get me excited. I think Prometheus was the last trailer to get me hype, but it could of just been Riley Scott returning to the Alien series.None the less, to get on the topic. Ghostbusters 2016 threw away every good about the original Ghostbusters and replace it with a lack of chemistry and actors mugging the camera. I've sat here for 15 minutes trying to think of a good quality about this movie and I simply cannot. The best I got is Chris Hemsworth is attractive but they made his character an imbecile. In the original Ghostbusters the secretary was an intelligent women who stood up for herself who had the classic lines, "I've quit better jobs than this" and "Ghostbusters, Whaddaya Want?!"The main difference between the originals and the 2016 was 2016 knew it was a joke and treated it like a joke. While the originals had goofy yet believable characters in a "possible situation". With Ernie Hudson playing the straight man that everyone could relate to.The 2016 there is little justification for these characters to be working together, they are not "goofy" they straight up one dimensional making the characters dull and uninteresting, and the way men are portray is flat out insulting with no redeeming qualities(at least Bond movies the girls are smart/skill/sexy).If you have children, I beg of you. Please let their first experience of Ghostbusters be the original Ghostbusters movies. I love those movies as a little girl and they help inspire my love of science and started me down the path towards engineering.Thanks for reading my review!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to re-boot a franchise...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I begin - anyone who believes that this film is somehow empowering or is buying into the 'sexist' narrative should probably research the sub-sub genre. From the moment this film was announced, it split opinion and caused a sensational backlash from all corners of the globe. People sharpened their keyboards and began to form their schisms, based upon their own agendas. You cannot be so naive to think that this wasn't all a part of the filmmakers agendas. Knowing that they could neither add to the GB universe, they took the unfettered approach to attach an idea to the production. Before they even began filming, the producers decided to cash in on the notion of sexism in Hollywood. It is funny how that, for years gone, Sony hadn't tackled this issue (which is an issue), but then attempted to create a campaign for this film that relied upon such a political issue. On one hand, the producers and attached cast bombarded the media with distracting notions of feminism, whilst the fandom (with females included), blasted this film's approach to producing such a cultural classic. You see, this film is a 'boys with toys' film - true, not a properly refined sub-genre, but no less, a product of its time. Fast forward a couple of decades, and you now have a totally different culture of fan. This is the crux of the trouble - did the filmmakers knowingly create a political artefact to open up the cash cow? Or did they genuinely want to create a piece of entertainment for all? - you be the judge. Anyhow, I was 'treated' to an evening tonight to watch this film and whilst it has a few decent scenes - by enlarge, it is exactly what it looks like; a torrid re-boot of a classic that really didn't need it. The cast do not gel in the same way that the four originals did and the dialogue is hammy as the acting. It is like four people desperately trying to show you a representation of the characters of the original - whilst at the same time, using it as a platform for their own agendas. Overall, however, we are left with a film that doesn't know what it is. It looks like a 'Ghostbusters' imitation but doesn't feel like one. It feels, in fact, like a vehicle for the actors involved, and a precursor to a serial of merchandised films that has no real direction, nor story in itself. The scenes begin pretty well, but are tied together with a loose plot that resembles the original 'Ghostbusters', as if someone had to remind them that it is a 'Ghostbusters' film. The music is dire, the CGI looks like it was created in Sony Vegas, and then we have to speak about the third act. The third act is supposed to tie the story together and give us a rounded ending. This however is obviously gearing toward a video game, and possibly a canon of films that will undoubtedly be as terrible as this. There are a number of cameos to give the fans what they want, but they are terribly underused and don't even fit into this world, that... fits into the world of 'Ghostbusters' - confused? I'm not - I fully expect the original characters to be brought back with 'new' actors in order to slap fans in the face one more time, with a "We told you so". Overall, this film is nowhere near as good as the reviews would make you believe - I'm not sure how the producers got this film rated, but the fact that there was a review embargo in place should tell you a lot. In fact, when you read some of the reviews, there is a definite split of opinion - and those reviewers who have recommended it, do so in a half-heart-ed way which is, in itself, a backhanded essence of 'Well, they tried, so you might as well go and see it'. There is no real substance to the reviews and seem biased from the off. If you have a spare ticket or have someone who wants to go and see it - I would suggest that you let it go. Not only is Hollywood now resorting to politicising an issue that does not need politicising, but they appear to be selling us an idea that this is somehow good for the female equality movement of Hollywood. But the action, story and dialogue are somewhat spawned from this notion and this leaves a terrible taste in the mouth. So to summarise - this is no more Spice Girls, than it is All Saints. Anyone, any actor, any director would have ran into the same issues that, at the end of the day, plague this film. The core issue is that, it is a film that has been made for all the wrong reasons - with Paul Feig in the corner, plying some notion that this will somehow empower the gender issues within Hollywood. I spent the entire time wondering how on earth this film got made - it is bewildering to think that anyone thought this would be a good idea. However, as long as it sells and it gets merchandising deals, then I guess that is seen as a success. I gave this film a 3/10 - because I will certainly not be forced to 'answer' any call (which doesn't make sense at all).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard there would be a Ghostbusters reboot with an all female cast, I was extremely happy. I hate to sound like a 'feminazi' but having a classic movie remade with all the main characters as females made me overjoyed. Keep in mind these characters are flawed, they aren't the typical 'Marie Sue', and it's different to have females in a popular well-known movie who aren't extremely sexualized. I was expecting bad reviews but after reading said bad reviews I was stunned at the completely idiotic reasons for hating such a fun, light, and all around pretty enjoyable film. People say it was 'not needed' to have a sequel, but are they aware that this film franchise took no time to pump out Ghostbusters 2? Newsflash, the reason films are created is to make money, they don't care how. Also a very common complaint is the movie is 'man hating', this is by far the less intelligent complaint of all. How is the film man hating? Is it because there is a ditsy male main character? I am not sure how long these reviewers have been on this planet, but if you have been watching movies, i'de say it's pretty damn common to find an airhead female character. People are so quick to insult a movie with a dominantly female cast, it's insane. All in all, the movie was very funny, had lovable characters, and had nice cgi.</fullReview>

Not to mention the politics behind it.Just couldn't enjoy it. Oh, and the special effects and acting was really poor. Lots of hamfisted and "quirky" jokes too that just weren't funny. Not intelligent humor. Kids might like it, I guess.Even the plot was just a rehash, and they didn't even do the ghosts right.I don't know why they didn't just go with practical effects rather than CGI. The ghost ended up being a pretty big guy, and actually I was discussing this film with someone after and when I brought up the ghost they said "for you" and I didn't really get it. Overall it's just completely lacking the charm of the original and feels like a cheap politically motivated Hollywood cash in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually watched this movie. It's obvious many of the reviewers here haven't- they are just hating on it. Many of the reviews were written before the film showed in theaters and that's a shame to hate on it before you even watch it. The Ghostbusters 2016 reboot is hilarious! These women and Chris Hemsworth are a great comedy team. *Spoilers ahead* . . . . .Erin Gilbert, played by Kristen Wiig, and Abby Yates, played by Melissa McCarthy are childhood friends who co-wrote a book about their scientific theories of ghost and the paranormal. Erin didn't want the book published as she was pursuing tenure in an academic career only to find out that Abby published it without her knowledge. The university is not thrilled about the publication and denies Erin tenure. Her confrontation of Abby about the book brings these two women back into each others lives. Along with Abby's coworker and engineer, Jillian Holtzmann played by Kate McKinnon, these three women encounter an actual ghost and through a series of events end up forming their Ghost Busting team. Eventually they are joined by Chris Hemsworth as their secretary named Kevin and by Leslie Jones who plays Patty Tolan. Together Erin, Abby, Jillian, and Patty hunt ghosts and try to figure out why they are appearing in greater frequency while Chris Hemsworth plays their hot but dumb secretary. Together they discover the person behind these apparitions and work together to thwart his plans. That's as much as I want to say without providing too many spoilers. Some people have accused the movie of being man hatting because Kevin is hot but dumb- are men not allowed to be both hot and dumb? They don' hate on this character- Erin has a huge crush on him. This is merely a reversal of a troupe in movies that have hot but dumb female eye candy. This movie has a solid plot. It is hilarious! My daughter and I were cracking up throughout the movie. Many members of the old cast appeared in this movie! It is well worth it to see this movie in 3D. Stay until the very end of the credits because there is an extra scene at the end!</fullReview>

Yes, it is comprised of scenes only or I cannot really join them together. Without any experience of previous Ghostbusters, I cannot really understand why writer and director set up the movie in that way. What do they want to tell? or sell? I might be able to force myself to laugh but I cannot as it is not funny at all! Every character looks non-sense and definitely does not belong to this planet.

		<shortDescription>Watchable, but really bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ignoring the vitriolic media coverage and backslash to fans isn't easy in the case of this movie. Those who like the movie are getting called 'paid' for their opinion, and those who dislike it are called 'misogynist' and 'sexist'. It got so bad that one can't seriously write about the movie itself without touching on this issue. I just wish those criticizing the negative comments would realize that many women also hate the movie, just check youtube pre/reviews as proof.Now about the movie:- It's a wreckage of bad gags, I don't know if it's the fault of the actors or the script. I assume mainly the script and director.- There are better MOMENTS in the movie, but the whole movie is overshadowed by 'product placement' adverts - The movie is full of references to other movies, most better jokes are also revolving around them.- Just as in case of politicians I don't care what their gender is, as long they do their job right, which isn't the case here. - If you've seen the trailers you pretty much already saw it all. - The only black female character in the team of 4 is a walking bag of stereotyped black women, a racist insult in 2016. - The characters are forgettable, the main villain is forgettable, the cameo appearance of the original cast is forgettable and feels out of place. - People walking out on the movie when the theater is just half full also means something. Just to clarify: It doesn't mean people leaving are sexist (especially girls), it means the movie is BAD. - The movie is a forced caricature and parody of the original movie, there is no need to see this instead of just watching the original movie. - All the male characters are caricatures and targets of jokes, it's like a female mirror version of movie sexism. Annie Potts as Janine Melnitz was not an idiot, why did the male version become one? He is still the best character. - There is no character development, only stereotypes and bad jokes, did I mention the racist depiction of the only black woman yet?- Pixels was far better at grabbing interest with its nostalgia for old things than this ...thing that is definitely just a cash grab. (especially considering the product advertising everywhere) - The actors are not that bad, but the script just makes it all terrible, and drags them down as well.tl;dr - This reboot is a terrible parody and caricature of the original movie with bad jokes(?) and an insult to black women. Actually, an insult to everyone who liked the original movies, or the animated cartoon series, or the Extreme Ghostbusters series (which would've been a far better choice for a real, more inclusive sequel movie). There are scenes in the movie which make it feel the whole fan-insulting campaign in the media over the last few months was actually a planned part of the marketing as the movie mocks the fans and original movies more often than not. It will have fans among first watchers of the franchise, many will support it simply for being 'different', and while it's true that many original fans never support a remake or reboot, this won't become a masterpiece even without them just because of genderswap and bad gags. It won't reach the same good review scores as the original.I don't suggest to stay clear of it, but I do suggest to show only the original movies to your children instead of this mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BRILLIANT! - My favourite movie this year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never seen the original, it's too old for me and the bits I saw were just not that good so I had no interest.But when I saw this new updated version with a full female cast I was so excited to give it a try and DAMN am I happy I did! It was an amazing film! I found it funny, so much so that during the Metal concert I was nearly peeing myself, I couldn't breath I was laughing so hard! I liked all the characters (especially Holtz) because none of them were supermodel or your typical Hollywood female who kicks ass easily but still ends up as the damsel in distress. They all got a nice build, a nice introduction. The story itself followed along nicely and was interesting enough that it kept me entertained and the climax, my god, the climax! It was beyond amazing! It was so exciting! I was so into that final fight, especially Holtz with her guns and my God it was just a really good film! I also found the villain to be a good one because he had a good back story but he also wasn't a pathetic whiny loser, not really, because in truth he was really smart, even outsmarting the girls for a bit, as well as independent. He didn't have hired help or muscle men. He did it all by himself, so I don't get the people complaining that all the men were all idiots. He certainly wasn't. I also found Chris's satire portrayal of a typical dumb secretary good. It was a little over the top but then it was meant to be. It was making fun of all the other characters who played the same role, so even that was good.All in all I give it 10 out of 10. I normally tear films apart (even those I love to bits) but I genuinely could not find a flaw in this film. To me, at least, it was perfect and I am really hoping for more.This film is perfect, especially if you have young girls interested in action and supernatural. This film will give young girls and women someone to look up to and something to look forward to. I highly recommend it, so much so that if you do go, give me a call and I'll come with you to see it again! I loved it THAT much! I swear it is not the disappointment people have labelled it to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful - the problems with this film could fill a warehouse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't listen to a lot of the professional critics on this one, I suspect some are happier as their wallets are a little heavier after giving this a 'good' review, while playing it safe to appease the crowds. But their lack of honesty then requires real viewers to be honest in their observations and write about it.Some of the issues with this film: - The Characters - They are often too over the top, especially Kate Mckinnon, she becomes very annoying very fast, like a 13 year old trying to be funny. Kristen Wiig plays it less goofy but her issue is she looks like she doesn't want to be here at all. Chris Hemsworth provided a few 'bright' spots but certainly not enough. Leslie Jones was OK when she was not yelling, but she does this too frequently, it feels like a stereotype. - The Script/Jokes - Far too many rapid 'jokes', many miss and the standard is low throughout. Too many gross out, immature gags that often are just a cover for a lack of good writing. - Excessive Noise, Color - This whole movie is very noisy, ugly and in your face, they didn't say you can get a free headache with the price of your ticket too. - Reeks of a Feminazi Message - I love women, but I hate feminazis and the often hateful message they spread. Certain scenes are for sure geared towards this malicious group - such as the shooting the villain in the crotch, castration, to 'save the day', good message for kids there... - Runtime - I was checking the time throughout, it is overlong and the pacing is off, too many needlessly long scenes. Overall: The original Ghostbusters (and to an extent the OK Ghostbusters 2) had a subtle humour, this film is the opposite of that. Even if it wasn't a Ghostbusters film it still would be very bad, but to hijack the name of a great franchise to get your movie more popularity, that makes it worse. I was almost tempted to ask for my money back at the cinema afterwards, but then I knew what I was getting into as the trailers were everywhere, so I didn't, I did this to myself.--- So unless you too want to have the same feeling of being robbed after walking out of the cinema, I would highly recommend spending your hard earned money on another movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would have given this film a zero, but it doesn't allow comments unless you give at least one star! Ignore Rotten tomatoes assessment. I tried to post my review of ghostbusters, but for some reason my negative reviewed could not post! Funny how positive reviews are allowed though!The levels of sexism in this film are staggering. All the way through not a single male character is portrayed in a positive light! And don't get me wrong I LOVED bridesmaids, enjoyed Spy, and there are many many films with strong female characters. But somewhere along the way Paul Feig has decided that men are the bad guys and he MUST downplay them / denegrate them at all times. Even the boss is destroyed in a way that makes men feel uncomfortable.Now ALL of this could be forgiven IF it was a half decent movie, however it fails there as well!It has many cameo, but they are there simply for the sake, they add nothing to the film and if anything break the flow. I'm not a massive fanboy of the original - I enjoyed it, but not a massive fan. But this is unmitigated garbage. There is NOTHING to recommend this movie!As the title says - AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first "Ghostbusters" was a classic American comedy film from 1984. Written by actors Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis and directed by Ivan Reitman, it was about three parapsychologists (Venkman, Stantz and Spengler) who ran a ghost hunting outfit in New York City. This year, a reboot of this film with an all-female main cast written and directed by Paul Feig is released. Dr. Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) and Dr. Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy) have been interested in ghostly phenomena since they were in high school. After a period of estrangement brought about by differences in career paths, they are reunited when they were called to investigate a ghostly sighting at a local museum. Together with nuclear engineer Dr. Jillian Holtzmann and her prodigious talent for inventing weapons and New York subway employee Patty Tolan, they formally launch a ghost hunting business, later dubbed by media as "Ghostbusters". For their first major case, they track down a mentally-disturbed janitor of a local hotel who had been causing malevolent spirits to appear all over New York City. Never would they have guessed that this case would actually lead to a city-wide ectoplasmic apocalypse. Melissa McCarthy was not annoying here as Abby, unlike her early films. She continues her winning run following "The Heat" and "Spy" (also by director Feig). Kristen Wiig is so geeky, so self- deprecating, so delightfully funny as Erin. It took time for me to warm up to the unorthodox comedy styles of Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones, since this is the first movie I have seen them in a film. They eventually do hit their stride as the quirky badass Holtzmann and the loud excitable Patty. coming up with their own comic highlights. The scenes with their pretty but dumb receptionist Kevin were so awkward and cringe-worthy. But only because he was played by Chris Hemsworth, the against-type casting actually worked to make this character hilarious. In addition, I found the scenes accompanying first part of the closing credits featuring Hemsworth were so embarrassingly funny. You won't see Thor the same way again. While this Kevin character could also be seen as feministic male-bashing, but I did not take offense because of the good-natured comic treatment.Being a reboot of a beloved film, comparisons, fair or otherwise, will be inevitable. Most evident would be that the comedy in the original film was more subtle and mature, while the comedy in this reboot can be gross and childish. The disparity of male and female team dynamics and interactions are very clearly noted. There was none of the sexual innuendo and smoking which were prominent in the first film. The ghosts of this reboot had the same colorful and cartoony style as the first film, but the technological advance of 30 years is evident to make them look polished.There was no mention of ever having a previous Ghostbusters, which may bum out loyal die-hard fans. However, I enjoyed seeing many references to the first film, like the logo, the old firehouse, Dana's apartment building (now a hotel), Ecto-1 (now a hearse), Slimer and the Marshmallow Man. I had fun seeing the original cast members (Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Annie Potts, Ernie Hudson and Sigourney Weaver) in cameo appearances, though too bad that they were not as their old characters. The late Harold Ramis was cited in a dedication at the end of the closing credits. There was also a very short extra scene at the very end of the credits when the song faded out. There was a mention of a name which can be recalled from the first movie. Was this just another nostalgic throwback or was it hinting a possible sequel?My sons and I had so much fun watching this light-hearted and happy- vibed film. I was actually laughing out loud so much at some pretty side-splitting silly gags. The interaction between the four ladies started off uncomfortable and rough. But as the movie got on, they really hit it off very well, and their individual comic styles gelled very well as a group as they spouted all their pseudo- scientific jargon and wielded their sophisticated proton-pack weaponry. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whoa. So much better than I thought it would be... Fantastic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me be clear that the original Ghostbusters is my favorite movie of all time. And so when I was angry about the remake (and I was angry about the remake), it has nothing to do with gender, but with the fact that it would be a hard reboot, and not in the continuity of the original films. I was an idiot to worry about a film I had not seen yet. It was fantastic.I spent a good chunk of the movie trying to figure out which new Ghostbuster was supposed to be which old one. Was Kristin Wiig the Egon? Or was Kate McKinnon the Egon? And as it turns out, they aren't the old Ghostbusters. They have created four new, compelling, and unique characters, and I applaud them for it.Was the story similar to the original? Yes. It was supposed to be. It says in the credits "Based on the movie Ghostbusters, by Harold Ramis." And the tributes to the original were everywhere. And yet, it was different enough to surprise me and not feel on the one hand like a rip-off, or on the other hand like a random movie with the logo slapped on it for marketing reasons. This was a Ghostbusters film, and it was a new Ghostbusters film, and if you liked the original I can't imagine you not liking this one. The sense of fun and humor is there the whole time.Best of all, as we walked out of the movie my wife turned to me grinning and said "Wow, I really liked it. Like, I can't remember the last time I liked a movie this much!" And my daughter, who was also with us, couldn't stop talking about it the whole way home. This movie will create a new generation of fans, and it will please the old ones, if they can just get over themselves enough to allow themselves to enjoy it. Because seriously, this was one of my favorite movies of the past decade. The Ghostbusters are back, baby!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The new Ghostbusters is about as funny as the original - that is to say it is not a gut-busting comedy, but rather a continuously enjoyable movie. The animation was updated from the original, but kept the classic green ghost goo. Every original Ghostbuster also makes a cameo in a creative and hilarious way, and I can see why all of those guys love this remake. I only saw the original once or twice, because I couldn't get into it. I couldn't relate to any of the characters. But I'll watch this movie over and over, probably at least once more in theaters. Perhaps my favorite thing about this movie is how often the actresses say "I am a scientist / we're scientists!" That is an incredible thing and something I never saw growing up. A must-see movie for families and fans of the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots more of fun than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you (like me) consider Bill Murray humor more cynical than funny then stop reading and go to see this very well done re-make that really improves a lot on the original. If you are not still convinced; let me tell you why. The original GHOSTBUSTERS was about 3 misfit nerds, an African American guy and a girl (the love interest). Only the girl and one of guys has a lot to do in the movie; the rest of characters were heavily underwritten (specially the black guy).In this remake; there are three nerds (women), an African American (woman) and a love interest (guy, cute but not smart at all). But this time, screen time is shared, everybody has a few fun time (even the stupid guy) and the African American girl is lots more better written than the blonde one.This is obvious a McCarthy and Wiig movie; however Paul Feig (the director) let the others two shine and the chemistry between the four women works even better than the original.In terms of jokes; there is lot of slapstick; some women/men sexual jokes and even sum digital FX jokes that make the kids laugh. All that is far more than you can tell about the original that if you see it again now; you will find it kind of boring and not that entertaining than this one (I just did before seen this one).Forget the classic; contrary to even my expectations; this one came out quite right</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was really, really terrible!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They shot it in the bits!That line both speaks to how the final big bad ghost is brought down and also to the film itself. The creators of this rubbish absolutely shot this film in the bits with this script. It's so bad, and not the 'so bad it's good' type of bad, it's just utter rubbish. Maybe Americans will like this brainless, insipid, and funny-only-because- it-sucks-so-bad film, but no one I talked to leaving the cinema in Watford actually liked this, and it's not getting very good reviews from anywhere in the UK or Europe, except from those married to the 'not liking it is sexist' narrative started by the Americans. Well, I'm a woman, most of my friends are women, and none of us who went to see it together actually liked it. Best rating from any of us is 4 stars, but she was a bit sloshed before it even started. Breaking it down: Script: 1/10 (the script written by a computer algorithm was better than this)Acting: 3.5/10 (not really the cast's fault...they were brought down by the script)Effects: 2/10 (seriously, even the original Ghostbusters was more believable than this. Why did they have to make this look so horrible and obvious green-screen is obvious?Score: 1/10 (will leave you thrilled to get back out into the world and listen to traffic)Casting: 4/10 (this cast just didn't mix well, not even close to the great casting of the original)Plot: 0/10 (you can't set up a premise in the beginning of a film just to throw it in the bin and go another way later. What happens in the middle and end of this makes no sense given the premise set up by the original film and the beginning of this film)Politics: 3/10 (obvious man-hating is obvious...could have toned it down more than a bit, yeah?)Paid ?13 to have my brain attacked by this horrible remake. Don't waste your money. Go to the pub like a normal person and enjoy yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is going to haunt me for the rest of my life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been just a little over 24 hours since I saw Ghostbusters, and it still haunts me at how awful it was. I wanted to give this movie a chance, tried to see it with an open mind, but alas it did nothing. When the first 5 minutes is the only slightly good part and only me and possibly other ghosts are watching in the cinema, you know it's going to gives you shivers.Where did it all go wrong? Could the concept of the Ghostbusters being all women work? Well, maybe(?)... if they hadn't been written so annoying and obnoxious for me to give two craps about them. Let's make them have no funny jokes and whine all the time! The new secretary guy? Make him dumb and have all the women get the hots for him, oh and plenty of failed jokes one after another to go along with that too.To be honest, the CGI isn't that great. I think the 1984 original had superior special effects. Oh, and the theme song? Way to go at ruining the iconic theme guys! What about the original Ghostbusters? Don't they appear as cameos? Yes (and this isn't a spoiler)... for like a minute each! What a waste! Any positives? Well, I guess you could argue it doesn't play out exactly the same as the original, except that's pretty much cancelled out for everything being written worse and reminded it's supposed to be a Comedy.I adore the Ghostbusters franchise, I really do. Ghostbusters II gets a lot of hate, but it truly feels like a masterpiece compared to this abomination. If you can't give us characters to care about and not be likable or redeemed, why bother? Yes, some of the original Ghostbusters were jerks, but they all had a heart as well. Where were the laughs? Why change the iconic things about the series? You know what? Just stick with the Ghostbusters Video Game as the last Ghostbusters, and pretend this so called Ghostb... I mean Ghostjokers never existed.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected this movie to be fun, maybe like Ivan Reitman's Evolution (a movie often compared to the male version of Ghostbusters he directed in the 1980s). A good enough popcorn movie. I was looking forward to it more as an event (a new Ghostbusters movie!) than I was looking forward to the movie itself, which I expected to enjoy, but not, you know, love.But when it came out on Thursday night and people actually started seeing it? And talking about it? Oh my gosh, did my excitement grow. I saw women talking about the relationships among the characters, I saw queer kids talking about how amazing Kate McKinnon's performance is, I saw a lot of things that I don't often see when people are talking about blockbuster summer fare.And lest the usual crowd of malcontents pop up to say that women and queer people aren't a reason to see a movie? No one said they were the *only* reason, and decent representation makes for a heck of a tiebreaker, let me tell you that. I didn't have a chance to see it until Sunday, but by that point things had reached a fever pitch. I can't remember the last time I was looking forward to a movie as much as I was looking forward to this one.I saw it in a packed theater, and I was not disappointed. It blew me away.It's not going to be as iconic to me as the original was, because I saw the original when I was five and grew up with it. But boy, do I envy the kids for whom this is THE Ghostbusters movie. They're in for a heck of a ride. This is a better action movie than the male version was (though in fairness, it wasn't trying to be). It's funnier. It's scarier. The characters are deeper and better written, and they're also kind of better people? Even the deeply flawed (and utterly amazing) Jillian Holtzmann is still fundamentally a nicer person than Peter Venkman. I wouldn't necessarily want to be stuck in an elevator with either one of them, but I know which one I'd rather be at a party with.Well, I take that back. Holtz would probably be able to get the elevator moving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The real issue with the feminism of this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The issue with this movie is not so much that it is trying to push some kind of political agenda (all though that is still problematic in and of itself. Ghostbusters isn't about pushing anyone's politics. Go make your own feminist franchise if you care so much), but that there's NOTHING else going on with film except the feminist dogma. This movie is basically the feminist equivalent to Christian rock, or some piece of crap like God's Not Dead (for the record, there are great Christian films out there, such as anything by Bresson or Andrei Tarkovsky. I'm just mentioning those Christian products that have no value whatsoever besides the fact they are Christian). Can you social justice lunatics even comprehend why that is a problem? The only merit of the film is that it promotes the right agenda and ideology. That's it. Nobody in the production of this film cared one iota about the concept behind the setting or story. You could have had Adam Sandler make this pile of trash and it wouldn't have made any difference because this is a move meant for a religious cult, not anyone who actually enjoys films and cares about the art form. Can feminism be done well in a movie? Can you push a political agenda into a film without necessarily interfering with the quality of the movie in question? Possibly, but that isn't the case here. If feminism truly had a profound meaning for you, you would abhor such a film as much as a true Christian would abhor some poorly written, sentimental garbage that yammers about Jesus and doesn't convey any of the deeper aspects of the religion. Instead, you want to stamp your feet down and defend the indefensible at all cost, because all that matters to you is unconditional subservience to the dogma. You don't want to convince others to your cause with solid arguments, extolling the merits of your ideology. You just want blind obedience. You want us to sing hollow praises to your Jesus and ignore the needs of our intelligence and our very souls. To that i say: go screw yourselves, and take what's coming to you, because the more you push this crap, the more you are going to lose.BTW, The irony is that the original wasn't exactly flattering to men, which actually wasn't atypical for 80s comedies. Indeed, all of the main male characters in this film are basically losers. Venkman was a scammer and a con artist who could only attract women dumb enough to fall for his cheap tricks and phony flattery (and it is dubious whether he really scored all that much in the first place). Stantz was just some nerd with an obsession for the paranormal who probably didn't get laid a whole lot, if at all. Spengler was a completely dour brainiac who most likely had no conception or understanding of what a normal social life might have been like. As for Winston, he was just some dude who needed a job, and was down on his luck to the point he would have done anything to earn a steady paycheck. And then of course we have Louis, starring Rick Moranis, the actor who played the butt of the joke in almost every film he's been in. And who was the most flattering character in the movie? Dana, a beautiful woman who was a world class classical musician who lived in an expensive New York apartment and hanged around prestigious characters. So why did we like any of those people? Because despite everything they were portrayed as normal human beings, who had many faults but also many good qualities. Even Venkman, the most unlikable of them all, showed us he wasn't such a bad person after all (I.E., when he refuses to take advantage of Dana), and you know that for the most part his attitude was just an act and that in truth he was just as vulnerable as the others. And that is precisely why you wanted to root for those characters. Because at heart they were good people who's quirks and oddities made them social outcasts but who ended up becoming unlikely heroes when the city came under a threat only they were equipped to deal with. And so we come to this new version, which was made purely to satisfy feminist chauvinism and narcissism. There is no reason to feel any sympathy for any of those new characters, especially in the way they were presented in the trailer (when this sh*t storm started). Those women are cool, independent, strong, everything the original characters were not. Hell, in the original, Spengler's scientific brilliance was seen as an actual detriment to the character (big brainy nerd, what a loser). Here, we see Kristen Wiig flicking the guns and acting all cool in front of a board covered with equations. Why? Because she's a woman who can do quantum physics, isn't that COOL? Then, we have Kate McKinnon double wielding two proton guns (note: the original proton packs weren't guns, they were trapping devices), licking one like she's some kind of cool cowboy. Why? Because woman who can fight like a man, AWESOME (also, did i mention she's an incredible engineer?). Leslie Jones? Sassy black woman with tons of street smarts who probably needs no man ho hell no. And on and on like this. And of course, all the male characters are either idiots or bastards. But here's the kicker, because the most likable character in the film happens to be... Chris Hemsworth. Why? Because he is actually the underdog you want to sympathize with. By making Kevin so dumb, they actually forced us to feel for him, undermining the misandrist motivation behind the character (lol men can be dumb secretaries too TAKE THAT). I just have no words.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen the trailers I can honestly say I wasn't expecting a great deal, however I went along anyway to see what the full film would add to the rather damning trailers.Unfortunately the film really didn't hold very much water, it had the 4 actresses which didn't really gel together with the chemistry not really hitting the mark. We had every single male character portrayed as either a complete moron or as creepy or as some kind of evil character.The jokes in the film were not very funny and the stereotypical lines given to some characters were offensive to say the least. To top it all off if there wasn't enough sexism and gender bias in the film already, they then had the final boss being fought by you guessed it being shot in the groin.Overall I think this film has been a huge disappointment. Every time a film gets given the opportunity to make use of female talent in a positive way, all we seem to get is a massive over reaction by feminist writers to spread hate, sexism and stereotypes. Is it any wonder so few people want anything to do with feminism these days when this is the type of film that gets produced when directors listen to them.The Heat (same director) was also guilty for a lot of the same flaws this movie and even ironically ended with the same sexist attack with the villain of that film being shot in the groin as well.I genuinely hope this film suffers as a result of the sexism and a lesson is learned here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a rule, I really just generally dislike remakes. There's never any good reason for them. They always remake a movie that is good (if not a total classic), never one that was bad. It rarely adds anything new that is worthwhile. In general it is what 95% of all remakes are: A cash-grab. This new "Ghostbusters," however, doesn't even try to attain that lowly standard.The plot is basically the set up of the original, with a group of female (as opposed to male) scientists, as they battle the supernatural and public perceptions. There is cameos galore here, too, as they try to play up to the long-time Ghostbuster fans. But ultimately, it all feels disrespectful to the original version.I've never found Melissa McCarthy very funny. She's the stereotypical Chris Farley, fat, loud-mouth style of comedian, only less "charming" than he was at it. Here she does her usual shtick, only trying to pretend she's really brainy while doing it. It works as well for me as it has in every other movie she's done this in (which is pretty much most of her career), that is it wore on me very quickly and just kept getting progressively worse. Then you have the SNL brigade of Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones, both who remind you why they are known for SNL and not great cinema experiences. McKinnon spends pretty much the entire movie mugging for the camera, even in scenes where she isn't the focus or that it is even appropriate in. Meanwhile, Jones gets to play every black stereotype you've seen in films like "Friday." Loud, obnoxious, foul-mouthed, and belligerent. They would do better to stick to television, as they show why they are "not-ready-for-prime-time players" here in spades. I guess I shouldn't forget Kristen Wiig's character, but her performance is so forgettable here that it's hard to not do so.The only person to bring even a few laughs (which are few and far in-between in this film), is Chris Hemsworth as the ditsy male secretary. He makes the most of what his limited character can do. It's quite a departure from his turn as the "God of Thunder" in Marvel's "Avengers" films, that is for sure. And in all the various cameos I mentioned before, none of them really stands out in any good way. Most feel shoehorned in. Bill Murray looks like he wants to get the hell out of there and I don't blame him.The CGI effects aren't any great shakes, either. The big battle sequences, near the films end, has the ladies looking like they are paying more attention to the green screen they are really standing next to, rather than facing such horrors of monstrous ghosts rampaging the city. The 1984 film, with its puppets, looked less phony and less dated, than the CGI here does.Paul Feig, who directed and co-wrote this travesty, shows he not only has no respect for the source material and original film, but no respect for men at all. Every male character, every single one, is either inept, a creep, or the butt of a joke. I suppose this is his version of "girl power," by humiliating every man in the film to make the women seem superior to them. It's just a pathetic misandrist display, that only betrays Feig's own prejudices. Nothing more. They could have renamed the film "Male Bashers" and it would not only have been completely appropriate, but more accurate. The final battle scene has the "Busters" stop the male monster, by shooting it in the crotch. Ho-ho, ha-ha, what a blow for "women's equality," huh? Never mind that doing so, isn't just done out of spite for men, but even goes against the plot of their own story, where they state earlier in the film that proton packs only hold ghosts in stasis, until they can be put in a containment unit. But who cares about story consistency? We got us some men to belittle! This film and how it was done, has only made me see Feig as a small and petty man. He should rightfully be laughed right out of the movie business after this train wreck (even though, sadly, I know he likely won't be).The only thing this pathetic remake did, was to show the true agenda of the filmmakers. And it wasn't to make a fun and action-packed blockbuster. It wasn't to make a respectful update to a classic film. It wasn't even to make an entertaining effort. It was a blatant gut-punch to males and those who loved the original film. That's all. They say it was to show "women empowerment," but they seem to think that can only be achieved by tearing down and belittling men. That's more sexist towards women, than anything I can think of. The cast deserved better than this. The fans of the original GBs and the rest of the viewing audience DEFINITELY deserved better. The best thing anyone can do, is not waste their money on this stinking turd! Take your kids to see "The Secret Life of Pets," or hold off until the next Star Trek film. To reward this utter garbage with your money is only to embolden the filmmakers and the studio to produce more trash like this. And that is something all of us, be we male or female, can do without! This film is an embarrassment to movies, remakes, "women's empowerment," basically everything it tried to be. I'd say the only place for this putrid pile of male bashing is the city dump, but even the rats and seagulls deserve better than that!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's been a lot of controversy surrounding this movie, some about the cast and a lot about the fact that remakes and/or reboots of existing properties are just terrible. The first trailer is the most hated on Youtube of all time, granted that trailer was awful but come on.. I still went to see it, because I like stupid summer movies and Fieg is one of the best comedy directors working today. Turns out, what a lot of what people feared was right. A lot of the jokes where just lowest common denominator, real basic stuff, and why does comedies today relay so much on cameos? Never Stop Stopping, Zoolander 2, now Ghostbusters. All just fill it up with cameos instead of plot.. oh well. If you've seen the trailers you get who the characters are and their motivations, and the CGI looks average by today's standards. All and all, it's a passable movie. But it's weighed down by being tied into the Ghostbuster franchise so much it's hard to get that weird taste out of your mouth... If your standards are low and you haven't seen the originals or don't hold them in such high regards, I guess you would have a good time watching this. Otherwise, stay away!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ghostbusters was better than I expected from the trailers, not to suggest that it was particularly good, but it was better than I expected.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a team of paranormal researchers are outed from their university, they go into business capturing ghosts. Through their activities, they come across a nefarious plot that threatens the world.I expected Ghostbusters to be terrible. I think just about everybody did. For some (me included), the trailer suggested lame jokes and nostalgic references. Consider the official trailer (which, incidentally, is one of the most disliked YouTube videos of all time). It lacks a sense of fun and pacing. It begins with this slow piano cover of the "Who You Gonna Call" song and then switches over to like a pseudo-dupstep sound. The music is broken up by extended exposition or jokes and it really throws off the rhythm. Compare that to the "GHOSTBUSTERS FanCUT Teaser Trailer HD (RECUT)" by Bevan Bell. Bell's trailer was exciting, fast paced, and sprinkled with jokes. Ghostbusters is such a pop-cultural image that we know enough already; we don't need an introduction to the characters or the driving plot. The differences between the two trailers makes me wonder about movies trailers. I mean, I wonder if there are certain requirements for the official trailers. The official one is over two and a half minutes while the fan-cut is under a minute. I wonder if they had to contractually include certain characters in the trailer too.In any case, the jarring pacing of the trailer is something that plagues this remake. There are a number of jokes that are funny but instead of making a joke and moving on to the next one, the camera lingers in silence, as if the awkward silence will provoke more laughter. It doesn't. It just kills the moment. I feel like someone ought to make a fan-cut of the film, removing all of the pauses to see how it improves.All of the characters are pleasant. They're all pretty likable and they seem to work well together. Chris Hemsworth is the stupid but attractive secretary for the Ghostbusters. It's a running gag in the movie of having the protagonists ogle him, though Wiig's delivery seems forced. For a movie like this the draw is the chemistry between the cast, not the plot, so it's pretty minimal. They gotta save New York and the world. Boom. Done. It's sufficient to facilitate jokes. There is some character development in the sense that Wiig's character learns to accept and be proud of her experiences with the paranormal.Ghostbusters jumps aboard the nostalgia train. I feel like a broken record but Ghostbusters is making me say it again: a reference just for the sake of the reference is bad, lame, and will probably be unsuccessful. Just having an original cast member pop on camera isn't going to make me enjoy the movie. In much the same way that having pretty graphics can't fuel a movie, neither can nostalgia.Overall, I wouldn't recommend Ghostbusters. The jokes that are funny don't quite deliver because the pacing is off and the references to the original feel cheap. Instead, if you are looking for a spooky comedy, why not try something like Shaun of the Dead, Beetlejuice, Young Frankenstein, or Scary Movie? That's a pretty good survey of different "spooky comedies" (that was my Google search to find the above options) depending on your taste in comedy. Without thinking about it too much, I might recommend them in that order too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty ultimately pointless remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ghostbusters is probably one of the most high-profile average films to be made in recent years. It's not terrible, but it's not good either. It's WAY too over-budgeted for such a creatively lazy film, which is essentially a parallel universe what-if scenario of the classic original Ghostbusters and the special effects don't look like they were worth half of the $150 million production cost.There were glimmers through all the been-there-done-that's though; Kristen Wiig's performance was damn fine, so was Melissa McCarthy's. However, even with those top-caliber actresses, it dissolves into a toilet-humored story that thinks it can make up for all the gratuitous cameos from Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson, Dan Aykroyd and Sigourney Weaver. I'm sorry, but appearances of actors from the original isn't going to elevate the status of this film for anyone too much; they're just... there. Chris Hemsworth is also in it; in case you didn't know...Ghostbusters 2016 is essentially a oh-look-at-that movie that is a pale imitation of what came before, though slightly more entertaining than Ghostbusters II.

It's pretty much ranging from 5.5-7.0 in my opinion. The cast was funny, although I think they can do more with mellisa mc carthy on the cast, she is less funny here than the other movie she ever been on. The cameo of the old ghostbuster cast was pretty fun to watch also ( bill murray dead again just like on zombieland lol ) overall it's a pretty decent movie you have to admit it. If you can bypass some of your old nostalgia ego and stop complaining about the ridiculous change of "women cast" this movie was pretty fun and not a bad remake</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't understand all the hate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always was annoyed by hates and hypes. My problem with them is that people prejudge a movie and mostly won't watch it without having these opinions at the back of their mind. The result is that many viewers will give in this case bad ratings because they are either too lazy to build themselves an own opinion or just to go with the hate.The hate about "Ghostbusters" already started with the announcement of director Paul Feig, who has a small "hate-base" with his previous installment "The Heat". It even got worse when the first trailer was released on YouTube and storied as the worst trailer on YouTube ever. I agree it wasn't that good, but here I also think that people just disliked it because to be part of the hate. It happened the way it had to and the film was teared up by the viewers. The review titled "Dead on arrival" is a prime example for a 1/10 review which just is there because to prove the hate. I don't want to assume every 1/10 reviewer here, that they have no own opinion but at least 50% went with the stream and gave it a bad rating because they didn't even give the movie a chance. My point is that I don't understand the criticism at all.The most known core message of the hate reviews is that the movie is "man hating" and racist. So many times before people moaned about that women can't be main characters and that they're just there to be sexy in the background. This movie turned the tables by letting Chris Hemsworth's character be a dumb yet sexy assistant who delivers nothing to the plot. I as a male have to say that his character was hilarious and it was fun to see how men also can be totally useless in movies. I wouldn't call it "man-hating" rather sarcastic. At the racism point, I have to admit that there are a few jokes which go on the cap of Leslie Jones' skin color, but guys please learn to understand some black humor and don't call it always racist. Anyway, some scenes also seemed to me slightly too much. And I don't think any quiet normal director wants to live out his hate about black people in a blockbuster movie.Many also criticized the non-discernible story, the forgettable characters, and the non-existent jokes. The story is for me on the same level like the original "Ghostbusters". The plot has a pleasant pacing and there is enough space for the main characters to be introduced (except for McKinnon's character). McCarthys' Abby, Wiig's Erin and Jones' Patty will stay longer in my mind because they had a very good on-screen synergy and worked nice as a team and provide together many funny jokes. Some may be a bit too childish (fart jokes or giving someone a bird joke) but overall they're good.Another reason why this movie is hated is the fact that everything is stolen from the predecessors and doesn't give enough new ideas. This is something I'm always curious about. On the one hand, people want to see a whole new movie and that the filmmakers are creative. On the other hand, they don't want that the movies' spirit gets destroyed and that they stay to the roots. "Ghostbusters" found a good middle course. They took the setting and idea of a ghost hunting main characters and a ghost invasion with lots of slimes but changed distinctive elements like the gender of certain roles, the look, the main characters properties and the villain. For me, this was an excellent mixture of new and old. The fact that Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Sigourney Weaver all have cameos satisfied my "retrospect-desire". The point is that you can't have a whole new movie with fresh ideas, whole new story, characters and setting without destroying the old movies' spirit. While reading this you should get where the crux is ...And last but not least many moaned about the horrible CGI and soundtrack. The effect of the movie fit totally to the rest of it and help it to give it more "old-school-charm". If a CGI ghost spits real slime out of his mouth it doesn't have to look hyper-realistic, it has to look proper. At some points, you could catch up some bad greenscreen effects but that's not such a big deal like everybody is saying. The soundtrack isn't as unique as the original' was, but like I already said you can't expect a whole new soundtrack and it is still OK."Ghostbusters" don't deserve all this hate at all. Question the asininity of the conflict and get behind how dumb the con arguments are. It had a bad trailer and some may not like its jokes, but after all many many viewers obviously didn't give this movie a chance and wanted to join the hate. Don't be one of those fools and get your own opinion and give this movie a try. It had lots of funny moments, the good synergy between the actors, fitting special effects, cool throwbacks to the old movies and has still enough innovation to stand on its own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun remake with a brilliant CGI filled third act</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When numerous ghost sightings and other paranormal events occur all over New York a group of paranormal investigators team up to get rid of this supernatural threat.It's very evident that many people have said bad things about this film. This might explain the 4.9/10 user rating on IMDb, or it might just be thousands of people using multiple accounts to complain about a film which they haven't even seen yet because it hasn't been released in their country yet!! So what does someone who has actually seen the film, the entire film!, think? Well I thought that it was alright actually. It was actually fairly funny. After the opening I did have thoughts that I was going to be watching some form of Scooby Doo influenced Ghostbusters remake but as the film went on I thought it was alright and there were a fair amount of funny moments. Most of the characters were quite good and many had some funny lines. The effects in the film were also very good and made it more realistic and despite this being a 12A comedy it was scarier than this years 15 rated horror film The Conjuring 2. When it comes to the plot it does have a lot in common with the original Ghostbusters but this is obviously going to happen with this being a remake, but this remake does have a lot of original content and does still feel fresh. It is also fairly fun and the characters, plot and CGI make it even more fun and the same goes for the successful gags. There are one or two weird moments which do either drag a bit or have no real relevance to the plot apart from to introduce a cameo of a star from the original 80's Ghostbusters film. There are a lot of scenes in this film that have no real relevance to the plot and just don't have any relevance to anything but lengthening the film's 116 minute run time out. Not that the film is too long it's a decent run time and doesn't really have any problems with going on for too long apart from when scenes are just there for cameos.Quite a few of the jokes are good but they do lack in the brilliant third act but Ghostbusters is a fun remake, unfortunately it seems to lack something at certain points.*** &lt;-- Three Stars</fullReview>

Not quickly, Erin as a character works, but once they introduce Abby and Holtzman it slowly begins to unravel as there is no good chemistry. Compounding this, The biggest detriment to the movie is the need for constant dialog that simply doesn't work. This would have been better suited as an hour long straight to DVD movie. The biggest compliment I can pay this movie is that it is not outright atrocious, but it is the kind of movie I had to force myself to watch the entire way through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A misfiring, beguiling reversal of the original film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Practical minded university understudy Erin (Kristen Wiig) is having trouble landing any real credibility, while unsurprisingly her more wild and whacky friends Abby (Melissa McCarthy) and Jillian (Kate McKinnon) are even further impaired. But after reportings of a series of paranormal activities around New York, they come together and form their rag tag little group called the Ghostbusters, who come in handy when a disgruntled hotel worker named Neil Casey (Rowan North) plots to unleash a swarm of ghosts around the city.To some degree or another, some films find themselves in for a mauling even before they've been seen, because their very existence is to challenge, or to tamper with, something held in such high regard by so many that they've already drawn the knives before the finished product is shown. It's even more so this way when the makers attempt to totally reverse the formula of the original product, and have everything a little topsy turvy, like having women in roles that were originally done by men, as director Paul Fiig has done with this re-imaging of 1984's phenomenally successful Ghostbusters.In these more politically correct, equality diverse times, the sentiment behind the film might be to highlight female empowerment, in a way that might not have been so when the first film was made. Of course, this in itself wouldn't be such a terrible thing, except just as all the original male roles have been replaced, so has one of the main female roles from the first film, and Chris Hemsworth's role is as ridiculously stupid as they come, which does kind of give it the feel of being like this in a more aggressive kind of way.Fiig has made two other comedies with McCarthy before, Spy and The Heat, and here he has her far more restrained and less trashy mouthed, but not really any more hilarious, while McKinnon has a role that has no real personality of its own stamped on it. The one who emerges with the most presence and star quality is Wiig, but that certainly can't be said for Tolan, who's portrayed as a typically loud, obnoxious black character, that totally sets back everything Ernie Hudson delivered in his original minority role.The plot feels as though the makers tried to mould the plots of the original two films together, without really developing much of a solid, structural story for this film on its own. As such, the lack of any real laughs is even more affecting. To top it all off, it has to try and make up for the lack of quality with an endless succession of cameos, including all the original stars of the first film, bar the one who passed away. With the effects and humour of the original film still so amazing over thirty years on, this sanitized, watered down, PC modern version really can't stand on its own. **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, I expected a really bad movie because of the bad critics. Yeah the critics are horrible but the movie isn't. It's a funny, nice movie. Not a great one but good in it's own way. A lot of people criticized Chris Hemsworth role . Indeed his character was stupid and I didn't like him but this character wasn't against man, it was just stupid one and we met his kind in almost every sitcom before e.g. Big Band Theory's Zack, Two and a half men's Jake etc. etc.. So what's the problem?A lot of people called this movie a pro-feminism one and men would hate it because of that. No it's not a really pro feminism movie and unfortunately the characters stick to popular clichés e.g. Patty. Well, she is black, but why couldn't she be a scientist? Nope, a scientist needs to be a nerd and has to be white. Too many clichés for my taste but despite that I loved Holtzman.The bad guy was worse and the plot thin. But I didn't expect a great story or villain so I was quite fine with it. It's just a summer blockbuster with a feel-good-feeling. Switch off brain, enjoy the movie and have fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fitfully-paced but ultimately-raucous reboot of the 1984 Ivan Reitman Ghostbusters lacks the superb technical &amp; satiric polish of the original but does make for a dopily-urban/paranormal comic montage. Now inherited by a new female quartet of frustrated researchers (including the ropey, wittily-uncomfortable Kristen Wiig), a technical tinkerer and a Transit booth employee, the new Ghostbusters girls--who take a bit too much time 'trying on' the old franchise in what's supposed to be a scarily building adventure; remembering Mr. Reitman had earlier in his career directed a gruesome black comedy for American International, 1973's CANNIBAL GIRLS--discover a hotel employee who's connected metaphysical power-lines undergirding NYC's geography and opening a massive interdimensional portal to unleash thousands of variable-sized ghosts to destroy the city. Directed by SPY's Paul Feig, the film's zesty use of locations, good-to-indifferent staging (perhaps constricted by the very numerous effects-scenes requirements), and increasingly-brisk editing makes good use of its comedienne-actresses (although, oddly, Melissa McCarthy seems to defer to her fellow cast members much more than her earlier work with Mr. Feig, resulting in Leslie Jones' more outspoken Patty Tolan unexpectedly becoming the highlight of many scenes) and spunky support cast. The result is more of a series of knowing sketches stitched together well using the first film's basic imprimatur instead of the comically-ascending epic crisis of the original Harold Ramis (I would think he would be pleased by his cutely-snarky inheritor here, Kate McKinnon, who ends up growing on you)/Dan Aykroyd screenplay, but also needing the artistic filtering provided by the original's superb master craftsmen (John DeCuir, Laszlo Kovacs, Elmer Bernstein). By the end, when the team has finally gelled together very well and has a much more equal chemistry, you accept them for finally getting it instead of the original team's almost-instantaneous fourth-wall satirical viewpoint and PhD-minded, collaborative resolve. Fun, respectful, professional, hysterical-in-moments, GHOSTBUSTERS (2016) should get it right in the sequel with a tighter cast but it is possible in this day &amp; age this is the best we could have hoped for.</fullReview>

Long version: Everything you could want from a Ghostbusters reboot is here (REBOOT, not sequel, is the operative word)- funny banter, cool new gadgets, creative ghost designs that toe the horror/comedy line nicely, awesome action scenes, a well-paced story that DOESN'T completely retread the original (looking at you, Ghostbusters 2), and most importantly, four bada** ghost-hunting characters that are hilarious and even a little compelling when combined. After thirty years of waiting, I ate it up from start to finish.That said, I can admit it was deeply flawed. While most of the jokes hit, the ones that miss REALLY die. Also, every scene with Kevin made me cringe- I get the feeling they were trying to use him to make a point but he was SO over the top I can't begin to tell you what it was. Finally, I loved most of the OG GB cameos, but a couple of them did feel a little forced. Still, taken as a whole, it was a solid, above-average piece of entertainment. After this summer's generally morose superhero offerings, a campy, action-packed foray into the land of the undead is just what I needed. Give it a chance, you'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True to Ghostbusters 1984</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all the movie doomsday prophets/critics that we have on open media these days, it becomes very easy for personal taste and offence people take to "an old favourite" being "rebooted". For some perspective: Ghostbusters was the first film I ever saw in a cinema back in 1984. I have rerun my own copy of this film (along with Supergirl which I saw in the same cinema the same season) probably more than 30 times. It sparked my interest in cinema and the performing arts of which I would eventually become a custodian. Let's immediately cut past all the fluff of reviews which tends to be full of either unsubstantiated criticism, personal preference references or elation based on their own framework. Yes, there is a lot of CGI ? but then again so was there a lot of CGI in Avatar. Yes, the cast and characters have been completely turned on their heads (there is more than ample reference and nods to the original) and yes, it follows a very stylized and structured formula (well, that is why it is a franchise). If you do not like any of these concepts, you would probably be better suited not to watch a sequel of any kind and it would be advised to stay away from anything that follows suite of an original idea. And please avoid Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Horror and most other genre's outside of art-house, drama and thriller. I have never been a big fan of remakes or reboot attempts of big successful classics. With the exception of Star Trek, Superman and a few others, it has seldom proved to work. My main criticism of Ghostbusters 2016 will also be that this film should have been Ghostbusters 3 and the story was perfectly believable to be adapted into a follow up of the original. Why it had to be produced under the banner of a reboot makes absolutely no sense from either a brand point of view and neither does the premise of the new cast and their journey deem it necessary. Getting to the actual movie, it would always be close too impossible to recreate the original first installment. So what do we expect from a sequel then? Definitely a little of the same, yet something a little different. So we definitely want "something new" but to remain true to the soul of the original. Without a doubt Ghostbusters 2016 delivers on this. Though there was ample CGI giving a really new modern feel to the film, it has absolutely no lack of gadgets and science paraphernalia that was VERY TRUE to the original in looks, style and function. The humour of Ghostbusters must be one of the elements that has always set it apart from other productions in its category. Again here the film does not let you down. There is Easter-Eggs galore and Ghostbusters 2016 definitely has the same fine, sharp and undertone humour of its original 1984 installment. I was never a fan of Ghostbusters 2 and Ghostbusters 2016 definitely delivered, for me, a better sequel to the original that the second installment ever did. The acting style is 100% spot on, the directing is fast paced with slower moments to allow the viewer to breath in just the right places. All in all, through impeccable timing, respectfully honoring the original, loads of breath-taking creative CGI and themes that have clearly made some critics uncomfortable, Ghostbusters 2016 definitely hits most of it's marks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let this movie be an example of what happens when you attempt to create a movie based on social agendas rather than seeking to actually make a good movie.A complete and utter disaster from top to bottom. The fact that this is "certified fresh" on Rotten Tomatoes astounds me, and speaks volumes about the movie critic community.I am going to start placing bets on companies tanking and flopping when they introduce "diversity initiatives" because I could have told you from the moment this movie was announced that it was going to be a flop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am so horrified that they slung this drivel at us in the guise of a reboot. How could they have done this to us? It was boring, it was not funny, it was ... just plain bad!We loved the original. I could have seen a changing of the guard movie where they hand off to a new cast. But this was just SUCH a bad re- imagination. The whole ... You can't do a movie on special effects. I don't care how good their goo monsters are. I don't blame the cast. Most of them were good in other movies. Melissa McCarthy was good in Spy Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones were Saturday Night Live Vets. How can you go wrong with Charles Dance? But NO, they managed to do it - somehow. It was an epic failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly sexist.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Visually impressive, with an amusing plot. However, its explicit misandrist view (all men are stupid, gay and/or... stupid again) makes it unwatchable. For a movie which strives for gender equality, this movie does a lot worse than the original, it is stereotypical, at times disgusting (fart jokes en masse) and at its core utterly sexist. The movies has its high points, esp. visually and a great cast. But the dialogue reveals the sexist attitudes of Sony, of the writers and that does not bode well for a movie which is aimed for the masses. Mind you, half of it is male. This is a movie about sexism and not Ghostbusters. This could have been a great installment (why reboot anyway?) with many nods towards original, but in the end it was just a kick in the groin against all men (oh yes, and it is homophobic too).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going into this, I knew I would have two options coming out either I would love or I would hate it.The short version: I love the 1984 edition. So if you want to watch Ghostbusters, go there.So the positive, Chris Hemsworth shows his range and plays dumb really well, but to bad the part was dumbed down to where it makes no sense and isn't funny.The best actor in this movie was Zach Woods as the tour guide, that part was the only thing they spend anytime on when writing this and then the thought, its ghostbusters if we make some great effects people will love it (Overall they are better in the 84 version).The broken friendship is so poorly written, it is rarely funny and when it is, it feels forced and uninspired.The cameo's, oh ghost of Harold Ramis, may he rest in piece, but it felt like he turned in his grave laughing so hard that he was not part of so corny a tribute, its a crime to call it a tribute to the 84 crew.Holtzmann over the top tech talks, why are they in the movie? they bring nothing to it and when she has a new invention its almost by magic, hey you guys look what I pulled out the dumpster, this can capture ghosts, lets go shoot at a paper target? what? again story line there is no break from when she is in the scene to the next and then there was new tech and the testing of the devices was just to spend the last dollars on special effects, it doesn't move the story forward and are just awkward.Ecto1 was part of the crew, here its the reason why Leslie Jones is part of the movie, I saw a ghost, now I am part of the team, uh and my uncle has a fleet of 32 year old Hearses he is using, we can borrow one, really? The sound track, oh boy did they make it, so horrible bad they should be sued for spoiling my childhood memories. Who are you gonna call, my lawyer.I would really have loved to like this movie, but I just can't see the point with it, they could have done so many other things, why not be the kids of the 84 ghostbusters and go one from there.Reboots I do not like this trend when its this poorly made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun reboot of a landmark movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Ghostbusters from 1984 wasn't exactly high art, but it captured the imagination of a generation. No wonder there's always been rumblings about that series continuing. The time for a second sequel to that film has passed and this movie pays a great deal of homage to the original film while striking out in its own new directions.Like 1984's version, this one centers around a team of paranormal researchers who discover a plot to create a supernatural cataclysm. Everything starts from this nucleus of friendship and moves out into a great action comedy movie. There are lots of winking references to the first movie, including a long list cameo appearances by the original stars. But, this film takes a lot of the ideas and technologies from the first film to a new level that adds an additional, original layer of fun. Fans of the old Ghostbusters films should really like this one as an exploration of the same themes as the originals, without being an attack on those films.I had a blast watching this film. I only wish it would have been made sooner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of Ghostbusters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mayor Bradley (played by Andy Garcia) getting offended when someone likens him to mayor Larry Vaughn from the movie Jaws. College dean Thomas Shanks (played by Steve Higgins), finding new ways to give people the middle finger. Sadly, these instances don't directly involve any of the main characters. And sadly, these are the only times I chuckled during 2016's Ghostbusters (my latest review).Anyway, they say good movies should never be remade. Such is the case here.Now if you think I'm gonna compare this patch job reboot to the original film from thirty-two years ago, well you'd be correct. In truth, Ghostbusters doesn't try to be like the first installment. Guess what though, that just makes it feel like an even more inferior product.Paul Feig directs "Ghost" and does what I feared he would do. He for reasons known, turns it into a Melissa McCarthy vehicle. The dialogue is grating, the improvisation is overwhelming, the lead actresses don't really click together, there are minimal laughs, and McCarthy's voice sounds like someone with a bad cold. Who you gonna call? How about the guys from 1984 instead.When Ivan Reitman helmed the original Ghostbusters, he created cinema that combined the eerie and scary with the humorous. He had Bill Murray providing one-liners and quips. He also inserted a foreboding, musical soundtrack to add to the film's epic statue. When the dust settled and the box office receipts came in, a perfect summer blockbuster was born. With this new Ghostbusters, nothing seems to be at stake. Feig generates something stock about four woman teaming up together as ghost catchers. Their story is laughably rushed. By the time all the apparitions and demons have been eliminated via Times Square (spoiler), there's no one to really root for.Basically with the first Ghostbusters flick, the people of New York identified with their heroes. A close relationship (and a romance) was formed between the two. With this modern day Ghostbusters, the girls with the proton packs seem alienated from most citizens in the "Big Apple". They do their job, snap at heavy metal concert goers, and complain about receiving lousy Chinese takeout. It just doesn't work. Bottom line: Kristin Wiig, Kate McKinnon, Melissa McCarthy, and Leslie Jones aren't at all cooler than Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Rick Moranis, and Ernie Hudson. I'm not saying that because I'm a guy. Heck, it's just a fact.Granted, 2016's "Ghost" does provide an upgrade in the special effects department. The phantoms may not be scary but they have a unique look to them (kind of like metallic cartoon characters). Also, there's more ghosts this time (plus the return of the Stay Puff Marshmallow Man) and more disgusting slime than in the first Ghostbusters. My problem with this current re-imagining is the weak yet tech-savvy script, the hapless cameos by stars of the original (Aykroyd, Hudson, Murray, and Sigourney Weaver), and the notion that the new ghost wrangler babes rent out an apartment (above a rundown restaurant) for $21,000 a month. Huh? In this flick's nearly two hour running time, they don't make any money in their paranormal profession.Neither scary nor funny, Ghostbusters concludes by mimicking a flash mob. It thinks it's a success and blatantly begs for a sequel by the time the end credits roll. Somehow somewhere, the great Harold Ramis is turning in his grave. Rating: 1 and a half stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, and entertaining. Calm down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, it's finally come. The remake that would ruin all childhoods, emasculate everyone, and bring about the complete and total breakdown of society as we know it. I've seen rants, raves, fits, and complaints leading up to the release, but was pleased to see that the critical reviews were pretty good. Of course, it was not without the dissenting voices and man-babies, but I went to the movie expecting to enjoy the work put forward by the cast and the director.At the end of it all, who was right? I was. Ghostbusters is fun, funny, and entertaining, while it isn't a replacement for the original, it doesn't seem to be trying to be either. It's a fun expansion, or torch passing even. Starring the 3 living actors from the original film, and delivering fantastic comedic performances from a wildly talented main cast. Let's talk about that then, the cast is a great place to start. This was one of the things that people were inexplicably so irate about, as the cast had been gender flipped, putting 4 women into overalls seemed to be the worst thing anyone could ever do. The new Ghostbusters are played by Kristen Wiig (Brides Maids), Melissa McCarthy (Spy), Kate McKinnon (Sisters), and Leslie Jones (Saturday Night Live). While Wiig and McCarthy are consistently funny, and bring their usual game to this one, it's McKinnon and Jones who really shine. The pair of them are hilarious, and make me wish I was still watching Saturday Night Live. The four have good chemistry, and seem to be really enjoying themselves.Rounding out the cast you have Chris Hemsworth (Thor) as the hilariously dim receptionist, Neil Casey (Inside Amy Schumer) who plays the rather lacklustre villain; Casey does fine in his particular character, but feels a bit hollow when compared to the original film. You've also got an appearance from the always wonderful Michael Kenneth Williams (The Wire) and a number of quick and funny cameos from the original in the form of Billy Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver, and Annie Potts.I mentioned that the villain seems disappointing when compared to the original, and I think this might be the problem with Ghostbusters. Not with the movie, but with the fans of the franchise. While I have seen and enjoy the 1984 film, I am not filled with a burning and irrational nostalgia for it, which seems to fuel a good portion of the hatred directed towards this version. No, this movie will not go down as an instant classic, or replace the original, but we have to stop looking at movies like this like they are making an attempt to do either of those things. No one is coming to your house to steal your copies of the original, and no one is forcing you to see this one. Did there need to be a remake? No, there almost never does. Would it have been nice to see these actors work together on something original? Hell yes it would.However, they did remake it, and now it exists. No amount of tantrum throwing is going to make it go away, so maybe it's time to calm down and let those of us who enjoyed it enjoy it. Also, if your reason for disliking it is the gender flipping, then you need to grow up and I have nothing to say to you anyways.There are a couple of plot and pacing issues, but none of them stood out in a way that ruined the movie. Kristen Wiig finds herself separated from the team later on in the movie, for no real reason except to set up her heroic scene. The ending is a fun and exciting fireworks show, and makes for a fun final sequence. No, it's not the same as the original, and that's fine. The story is simple, and the movie as a whole is well directed and well shot. The scenes with slimer and lady slimer were stupid visual gags that didn't add or subtract anything and I was engaged enough with the main characters not to care about that, or any of the other pieces that didn't work.One of the things that surprised me was how effectively creepy some of the ghosts were. The opening scene with Zach Woods (The Office) was atmospheric and, particularly the first few, ghosts were relatively well designed. It's not a scary movie, but then the original wasn't either. The tone leans much farther over to goofy, but I don't have any issue with that to be totally honest. Apparently there are some who were unaware that the 80s film was a comedy? I don't even know how to respond to that.All in all, Ghostbusters is a fun and entertaining ride with a good director, and some deeply funny comedians leading it. Which is exactly what it needed to be, and exactly what the original is. The 80s version is a funny film with strong comedic actors, that happened to hit at the exact right time. This isn't a new classic or anything, but it's a great bit of fun. Watch it if you want, you'll probably feel exactly how you expect to feel about it, and if you're the kind of person who's nostalgia is so deeply ingrained that you feel the need to ruin it for yourselves or others, then that's got to be a whole lot of work to maintain, and I kinda feel bad for you.For the rest of you, it's fun, and I liked it. Do with that what you will. Or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine going to a Three Stooges Film Festival. After anticipation, you arrive at the theater and find out every short contains your wife and her friends pretending to be the Stooges. Never accessing the chemistry, the A-list material or even the effects of your long time favorite comedy team. Peppered throughout the film you catch glimpses of the "real" Stooges with their hands tied behind their backs and gagged (not in a funny way) from any proper tribute nor the opportunity to shine. No Curly, no Moe, no Larry, no "this house has sho gone crazy!" Black guy...NOT EVEN SHEMP! This is the heartfelt disappointment experienced from viewing this "film". SNL newbies and "Bridesmaids" dressed up like the beloved "Stooges" with no timing...no material...not near the recognition or "chops" and sketch comedy that fails to ignite laughter from ten year old let alone adult fans of this title. Can't help but feel like a nail,was driven through the coffin of comic legend once again with a very shoddy, cheap effort. One has to wonder if Ackroyd and company viewed this mess before release and gave it his blessing...material they would've bludgeoned into submission in the "salad days" of their careers and would've never seen the light of day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe all the haters out there, very sad, get a real problem!! And remember it's only a movie, and I LOVE movies!!! This movie was very good, a fun experience:)! It even made me want to see the first one again. I would even go so far as to say it was BETTER than the first one, and I LOVE Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, et all!! It was NOT sexist, racist or any of the things these haters are saying. All the actors were great in those roles, &amp; a good back story of how they were connected. Love Kate McKinnon's character, and we were all laughing, my 29 year old daughter said don't miss it, and she is quite a critic, so VERY glad I went. Chris Hemsworth was hilarious as well.The original is from my era so I enjoyed it at the time, and I see a TON of movies, always have, but I don't review a lot, may now with retirement, I usually just like to write positive reviews, if they stink I don't bother. If you like a good laugh and fun experience with a friend or family member, see this movie. Not for smaller children though, a little scary I would say. Cameos were all good too and stay through the credits, we usually do anyway. And if you can find it,look for Dan Ackroyds rant on a Canadian talk show about all those haters, it's GREAT!!! I thought the writing, directing,editing,was all good.Definitely worth seeing in the theatre on the bigger screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring, way too long and not funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first hour and a half is very boring. Nothing interesting really goes on, attempts at humor are all misfires. The only two things that saved it so that I decided to watch the last half an hour were Kate McKinnon's and Cecily Strong's performances - while not really great, they're (contrary to the rest) something, worth a watch.Last half an hour is at least somewhat interesting. There are actually a few small jokes that kind of work. They could have cut the first hour and a half to a half an hour and we would have a short film that is not good, but not very bad. Unfortunately, as-is, it's (way) too little (way) too late.There's an interesting thing, though. That last half hour has some serious problems in directing (bad cuts and such). Don't want to speculate why is that, but, it makes you think - like, maybe the rest would have been better if it had more such problems?Compared to "Heat", this actually has less misandry. But, it doesn't help, really. I understand that a lot of women dream of having Chris Hemsworth as their (stupid) secretary, so, let's ignore that - though it would have been much better if any of his involvement was actually funny. But, wasting Bill Murray like he was in this is borderline criminal behavior. Similar goes for Andy Garcia, but, fortunately, quite a little bit less so.Bottom line - apart for a few little jokes near the end and a few times they played the original Ghostbusters theme song, this was boring and bad. Maybe this trend of doing "the male movie with a female cast" should finally come to an end. There are movies to be made with female casts, so do those - if they're good, men will watch them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ghostbusters(2016) is an incredibly funny movie. THere isn't one dull moment in the whole film. Although it will never be better than the original Ghostbusters (1984), Ghostbusters(2016) isn't a bad movie. I can understand why so many people didn't like it. People didn't want the Ghostbusters franchise (1984) and (1989) to change. I think although it isn't like the first two, Ghostbusters (2016) is a good movie for the next generation to enjoy. I will say though it isn't a film for children under 10. Some of the ghosts can be quite scary and there is some comedic swearing. That doesn't make it a bad film, in fact it makes that little bit funnier and better actually. All four of the Ghostbusters are funny and likable. All of them resemble the older Ghostbusters. Overall Ghostbusters (2016) is a great movie for children who haven't seen the original and/or good for a laugh and enjoyment.</fullReview>

The actors are very funny, the script well written and the appearances of the original actors in the remake are a nice touch.

		<shortDescription>"For Harold Ramis"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film tries to stand on its own, and be its own story, but it throws out references to the first film so often, and largely follows the same structure and progression as the first film, but with more farting jokes, and a lengthy discussion about the museum curator taking a dump in his pants in an early scene, before doing a variation of the library ghost from the first film, and kicking the leads out of the college they had been working in. Wonton jokes. Lots of wonton jokes were also added to the plot for some odd reason, and lots and lots of word salad. The first film used a lot of technical, descriptive words to describe some events, to good effect, but here, it seems like the writers just put together as many polysyllabic words as they could find in a conveniently located thesaurus. When that, in and of itself, does not generate laughs, they just have the characters shout louder, because louder automatically means funnier. There is a complete lack of location here, whereas the first film was obviously Manhattan. This film had no geographic identity. It could have been set, and filmed, almost anywhere (but perhaps that was the point)The special effects were colourful, and I did like a few of them, like Slimer's return, but during the chaotic and confusing climactic scenes, a lot of the ghosts looked like, as one character even described them as, balloons in Macy's Thanksgiving Parade.100% predictable, to the point where I felt as though I had already watched this, after watching the original, and seeing the trailer for this film. No spontaneity, nothing clever, nothing memorable. Most of this film just in one ear and out the other.As a final slap in the face, the closing credits say this film is "For Harold Ramis" Speaking of the closing credits of this already overlong film, they lasted for twelve minutes, and included scenes which appeared to be omitted from the body of the film, likely due to last minute editing in response to the scathing reviews of this film's trailers. Incidentally, before anyone claims that I am one of the supposedly sexist people who are opposed to this remake just simply because of its female cast, notice that at absolutely no point in this review did I mention the cast, only the screen writing, and the effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the worst excuse of a film I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never before have I ever just watched a movie, and been so utterly drained. I sat there for over an hour and was just exhausted by the end. Nothing notable or interesting or bloody gripping happened the entire time. It was just the exact plot of the first movie: four smucks save New York from an invasion of ghosts. But to add insult to injury, they ripped out all the comedy, tension, acting talent and all the overall good bits from the original; and jam-packed it with cheap throw-backs and cameo's. Just because Marshmallow Mans there for no reason am I supposed to be thrilled. Am I supposed to be blinded by nostalgia. Because I wasn't. The CG was awful; the original effects were better than this.At the end of the day; the first Ghostbusters was certainly dumb, but it just worked thanks to the people involved at the time, who clearly had a passion for what they where making. This just came across like another dull Hollywood reboot designed to make a quick buck off of an already existing film and with no talent or effort put in. Just because its recognisable it doesn't mean that people will care. And I know people are criticising Ghostbusters fans for claiming that this ruins the original (which it doesn't), but it must be bloody painful to see these companies treat something you're passionate about as a money making product.So, to summarize: this film was an abomination from start to finish, with no talent or effort put in, terrible CG, it was unfunny, awful acting and directing (curtsey of Mellissa McCarthy and Paul Feig as per usual), was full of clear sexism and racism (despite its bullshit attempt to be gender equal: changing the gender of already existing characters is not gender equal, its pushing for the exact opposite by promoting that women are better than men and centering the entire film around this premise, just look at Star Wars: TFA for how to be gender and racially equal properly) and overall, I would rather shove a garden trowel up my own arse than watching this crap again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1. script is awful. There are literally no funny lines in this movie whatsoever.2. cast is awful - I haven't seen worse acting for ages, they're not playing characters they are just being themselves.3. This movie is extremely sexist. Every, I mean each and every one, of the men in this movie are portrayed as complete idiots, useless, bumbling fools, and flat out a** holes.4. the movie appears self-aware, which ruins a lot of the movie. By this I mean it is inferred that everyone are "in on the joke".5. I thought the concept of the ghost busters was catching/busting ghosts? I shall say no more.6. this movie defecates all over the previous films and invents it's own putrid universe where these godawful actresses have invented everything7. this movie is racist! yes, that's right! It's flat out racist! The token black woman is portrayed as a shouty dumb ass with no education and little understanding of the world. She's basically one of those Jerry Springer participants who fight over the same pimp, and tear each others weaves off on stage.8. Sony movies and the director of this movie, have gone to extreme lengths to portray everyone who dislike this movie as sexist, women-hating, basement-dwellers, nerds, geeks, scum. They have been active on twitter, and even made a TV-trailer for the movie to this point. Sony have made this horribly anti-man-sexist-movie, and let's not forget how they portray the black character as a complete IQ-of-60-idiot. I say we hold them responsible for their actions and remember what they did, and vote with our wallets in the future!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brief Ghostbuster 2016 Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first, I'm not going to bother comparing this film it to the 1984 version, because NOTHING would've come close to capturing the feel and impact it had on Film goers in 1984. And I think Paul Feig was set up to Fail from the start. That said I don't understand why it's doing so good in theaters (158 million as of today) a few key things that bothered me...1. NONE of the Ghostbusters (save for Patty, in a bad way) had any personality, at all. All of them try to be "The Funny one" consistently through out the film. I understand that Paul and that awful team of his, he calls "writers", didn't want to succumb to one being the Tech guy, one being the Scientist, etc etc. But that's no excuse, because they all ended up being the same, all cracking jokes and being "funny" in every single god forsaken scene.2. All men in the film are treated like morons. There is a scale of character, yes men can be stupid/annoying/misogynist but this movie seems to take pop shots at men in general in a very stupid immature way that doesn't add to anyone being interesting because of it.3. The Fake controversy that followed. Some men on the internet became very outspoken and said VERY inappropriate things about them being woman in Lead roles, which isn't a new thing in film. Women in lead roles? Try Pitch Perfect, Million Dollar Baby, Alien, need I go on?. So now Sony has flipped the marketing to stuff like #BustTheCeiling. The film does not break new ground when it comes to women in film, it's a market gimmick Sony and Paul Feig cooked up when a few *beep* who happen to be men made stupid comments about the all female cast. I'm sorry those guys where man babies, but the core of the film has nothing to do with a feminism movement, they just want you to think it does.4. Overall everyone was in on the "Joke" no one took there role seriously, or played it with a straight face. I really don't think there was a solid script, I think everyday Paul came to set rolled the cameras and the 4 main actors just did improv until he said cut, Which can work in films like, Ace Venture, however it did not work here. Jokes fell flat, and since like I said before everyone was trying to be funny consistently which caused the humor to get old real fast, no build up, no pay offs, everything was just flat. Scenes lingered to long (Testing the Proton Packs) and while I occasionally giggled at some of Kristen Wigs Dry line delivery (which worked because it was subtle), the rest was just awful. Comedy can be a hard thing to pull off, I personally don't blame the cast, even though I feel Elizabeth Banks is funnier than all these woman combined. I blame bad writing and a complete lack Of direction by Feig.So that said, it looks like the majority of the USA thought the movie was "Great" Funny" or my favorite quote "Can't wait to see a sequel" I'm not sure what America is smoking, but I want some.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Characters and Sophomoric Humor Are This Movie's Downfall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forgive me. My willpower wasn't strong enough. I had to see the new Ghostbusters for myself to form my own opinion while it was in theaters;, but on the bright side, since it doesn't appear to be doing too well at the box office, what's the 12 bucks I spent gonna do to help?Anyway, about the movie itself... it certainly lived up to my expectations. I'm going to be comparing GB 2016 to the '84 version quite a bit in terms of how both movies handle certain aspects, which I think is fair because GB 2016 uses the same darned title of the original and the outline of the story of the new movie follows the beats of the original JUST enough to warrant comparison, I think. I'll give the GB 2016 this: You certainly can't compare the personalities of the new Ghostbusters to the original ones, except MAYBE Melissa McCarthy's Abby Yates to Dan Aykroyd's Ray Stanz (but not really). And Kate McKinnon and Chris Hemsworth's characters are as polar opposite to Harold Ramis and Annie Potts' Egon and Janine as you can get, but that's not really a good thing because...Almost all of the characters in Ghostbusters 2016 are either: Idiots (OH GOD CHRIS HEMSWORTH), A-holes (Melissa McCarthy), a combination of the above (Kristen Wiig), or plain old craaaazy! (KATE MCKINNON'S HOLTZMANN WAS THE SCARIEST PART OF THE MOVIE and the director should've told her to tone it down.) Surprisingly, the only character I was close to liking was Leslie Jones' Patti, since she was written consistently and was the most relatable Ghostbuster, while other characters randomly make total 180 degree switches in their personality and/or are WAY too over the top to be relatable. Compare this to the original movie, where the actors and the script make the main characters charming despite their faults, thus making them fleshed out as a result.The new characters had the potential to be funny and memorable, but unfortunately the script and presumably the ad-libbed parts are what REALLY bring this movie down to the cellar. A lot of the jokes go on for way too long (though it's not like they were funny the first five seconds), and there's some cringe-worthy toilet humor in the beginning. If I went on about the "humor" of the movie, I'd be here all day, and I seriously can't express in writing how bad the comedy is; you can DEFINITELY tell when lines are ad-libbed. Hemsworth in particular struggles with ad-libbed gags like the name of his dog (named MyKat). Maybe that type of humor isn't for me, but to me, it doesn't hold a candle to the dry wit of the original, where the writers let the audience figure out the jokes for themselves instead of bashing the punchline over their heads as if they were a bunch of seven-year olds.The writing and direction doesn't just fail in the humor department, it also fails to create any sort of real creepy atmosphere. The ghosts in GB 2016 are too cartoony to be unsettling, and the new villain is absolutely unmemorable while Zuul and Gozer were very threatening and a step above the regular ghosts like Slimer. I know I didn't discuss the actual plot of the new movie much, but when you get down to it, the most important aspects of Ghostbusters should be the characters and a balanced combination of humor and horror, and while Ghostbusters 2016 had a little bit of potential, the 1984 classic outdoes the new movie in all the ways I mentioned above.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is going on here?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fact that this movie is controversial shows that Hollywood is still broken and that the movie industry is sexist. Let's be honest, the original Ghostbusters wasn't that great, sure a lot people remember it fondly, but that's just because they grew up with it. I don't get what's going on with this website with the mix of 1/10 and 10/10 reviews, I reckon the 1/10 reviews are coming from the 18-25 male who wanted something like the original, and the 10/10 reviews are coming from 30-55 year old women who are the demographic for Paul Feig's other films. Having said that, I believe this really could have worked...But it really didn't. The cast were awful, the worst part of this. This was a chance to show you can have an all-female lead in a franchise, and they blew it. They are an abomination, sure the jokes and writing were bad, but it just doesn't work. Kristen Wiig and Kate McKinnon were OK, but Leslie Jones plays a typical black stereotype, and Melissa McCarthy is still just playing the fat character and it's beyond tiresome now. There is no chemistry between them and at times it's just awkward. The CGI looks like it's out of one of those spoof movies, there are a few questionable plot holes, and why are men treated like idiots in this? Is this a vehicle just to annoy them? A different cast and a different approach and this could have been huge like Jurassic World was last year. One day, we'll get a good female-lead action/comedy film. Not this, though, not even close.</fullReview>

I had decent expectations and have never done this before.The comedy is REALLY broad and obvious - kinda like how SNL is now a days. So maybe if that's your thing, you'd be OK. I was literally groaning out loud (one of the reasons I decided it would be better to go). So many of the jokes don't work or are completely obvious. Other elements are beat to death!

		<shortDescription>A legitimate attempt to reboot a franchise that falls flat on its face</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was pretty much clear after the first trailer that we were not getting a belated sequel to a beloved classic and a flawed but still passable second movie in a series. Consequently, when I went to see this movie I tried to not overburden it with expectations but rather judge it as a work of filmmaking in its own right made in a new age for a generation of movie goers who grew up with very different movies. So my point of view was not to see if it held its own when compared to the Ghostbusters of 1984 but rather if it was a good movie compared to some of the newer effects-driven movies. Would I recommend this to someone who liked "Guardians of the Galaxy"?1. Equipment and special effects/CGI Probably the first disappointment was that the equipment did not look like actual pieces of engineering. They were obvious movie props which fit in nicely with the CGI effects which belong more in some Ghostbusters theme park than a movie. Modern effects can create new visual worlds. This movie created nothing like it. It was a constant series of immersion breakers. Some of it was done right but the overall performance of the CGI team was sub-par compared to modern standards in filmmaking.2. Acting I know that these guys are talented. I've seen them nail parts in comedies which were funny as hell and surprisingly layered but there was little of it in this movie. The characters were one-dimensional and never developed any team dynamic and that was to a certain degree caused by bad acting. Not a single role convinced me that I was actually watching human beings in a difficult situation. I always was painfully aware that I was watching actors who struggled with their source material which leads me right to the next point: 3.Writing Plot holes as big as the Grand Canyon, failed pacing and lame sometimes cringe-worthy jokes. The backstories were bad or non-existent which made the characters amble about devoid of any emotional connection to the audience.4. The men vs. women "sexism problem" I actually asked a female friend to watch it with me because of it and she actually found a bit more merit in the movie than I did because she thought it nice to be able to relate to an all female main cast but she agreed that the movie was deeply flawed in many ways. She said that it was a wasted opportunity to show women as equals in a competitive and difficult environment because the writing team portrayed men as either stupid dolts or plain evil villains. It belittled their efforts somewhat because the writing team took the easy way out and made them look good by putting them up against weak opponents.5. Verdict It's an uninspired and flawed attempt at rebooting a franchise. For the most part it's just not entertaining enough by any standard old or new in filmmaking. And no, it's not the worst movie of all time as some people will want you to believe and some of the comments here are filled with unnecessary vitriol but even a neutral or well-meaning individual cannot overlook the many problems which turn this into a bad movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most disappointing film I have ever seen?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is this the most disappointing film I have ever seen? It is probably not the worst, though it could easily win this year's Golden Raspberry, it is just heartbreaking to see an absolutely classic film from one's youth turned into something so much less. Kirsten Wiig is watchable, Melissa McCarthy delivers the kind of role you fear she will after you have seen one of her trailers and everything else swings from being a waste of time to abhorrent. Notable negatives include the reliance Nitpickers guide to Star Trek Technobabble generator, and the morphing of Jar Jar Binks into two different characters, one the comedic disaster half, the other the happy natives playing banjos in the sun stereotype, both 'halves' actually performing an exponential magnification of the eww factor, making Jillian and Patti at least 4 times more annoying than the clumsy, well-meaning Gungan outcast. The thing is, given the tools at their disposal, the film makers could have made something terrific. Great franchise, sweet concept, New York locations, practically unlimited budget, available talent, how could they even do this? I'm actually angry! They even had Bill Murray, but not as Venkman! He was an old professor, but a different character, identical in demeanor, who seemed shoehorned in for no purpose whatsoever and then defenestrated without having contributed dick to the story. As each minute ticks by my opinion of this film sinks. I left after about an hour, I wish it had never been made. Yes I'm racist, yes I'm a misogynist, but I beg for films to illuminate and amuse me, and perhaps influence me to making better choices. This just makes it worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed as a woman viewer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd like to start out by saying that this is my first review of a movie EVER on IMDb because I felt strongly enough to review this movie. I went into this very open-minded and hoping for a female-led movie that I'd really love. Unfortunately, I walked away feeling disgusted - seriously! I have grown quite tired of what Hollywood views as the "perfect equation" for making movies like this. They really should have more faith in the intelligence of their viewers and not depend on so much exposition. The writing was poor, the jokes fell flat (I think I laughed 3 times total) and the only thing that carried it was the CGI effects for the apparitions. Otherwise, every single man in the film was hated and portrayed as either dumb, a villain, or sexist, the women were portrayed as clumsy, stupid, and "typical" in the way they drooled over Chris Hemsworth, and the reality they were asking the viewer to suspend was not even a reality at all! I mean seriously...you're in NYC and you're eating Papa John's pizza? Are you nuts? How many times do we have to hear about the won-ton issue with the soup? You get a hearse for the Ecto and one scene later, it is completely painted with a nuclear reactor on the top and Homeland Security cares about ghosts but not that? Also disturbing was how the "villain" was portrayed and it started with the line "it's always the pale, sad ones." How are we truly supposed to respond to that? For a movie that was so clearly meant for all audiences, there were many lines that had me scratching my head due to their offensiveness and blatant insensitivity to current events/issues in our country. I know, I know - I should not be reading into a movie like this so much. I really didn't want to, but a day later, I'm still sitting here bothered by these things. I could have held my comments off if I felt like this would be a good movie for our daughter, and I thought about writing this review within the context of "maybe children under 10 could enjoy this," and that may very well be true - but when I really thought about it, I would not want my daughter to view these women scientists the way they are portrayed in this movie. They weren't strong, smart, humble, independent characters - they were portrayed as sexist, clumsy, incapable, and uneducated. Sony decided to fight the damaging comments they received early on by packaging this as an empowering set of roles for these four leading women. When you set the expectation for that and then it is so obviously NOT that, it is hard to disregard. This movie has a serious identity crisis - and by trying to include stereotypes of everyone, it ended up alienating everyone.</fullReview>

The comedy was not fluid or natural, but rather forced upon the audience like one of the Naked Gun flicks. The girl power, all men are evil premise is crammed down our throats for the entire film. The mysterious power looking to take over the world in '84 has been replaced with the old worn-out "evil rich white man" that can only be stopped by struggling brilliant women. The ghosts are not original or scary. The jokes are tired, poorly constructed, and predictable. Mr. Feig and Sony should be ashamed.</fullReview>

CGI that looks like Spy Kids 3D, stupid 3D gimmick cinematography all lead to completely ruin the suspension of disbelief.Replacing the leads with females opens critics of this move to be called sexist. That can only be the explanation of the favorable reviews of this terrible movie. In fact this movie does disservice to women, by making the female version of GhostBusters terrible.Do not reward their mediocrity just because of the controversy.

Oh and for all you feminists complaining we are hating on it because it has women, that's not the case. This movie is pure trash. It would be just as bad with men in it. And if you really want to complain us men are being sexist, why aren't you complaining at the fact that EVERY man is portrayed as stupid or evil. One of the characters (Kevin) is hired only for his looks, even though he is dumper than a brick. But nobody complains about this being sexist, only "funny". But I guarantee if this was a woman character, the internet would be in fury over that being extremely sexist. So yes, this entire movie is extremely sexist (towards us men). In short, do not go and see this movie, it is utter garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this film even though the film had been slated well before it's release. I have also seen most of the cast in other movies and enjoyed their performances so all should be good for a decent reboot of the classic Ghostbusters. How wrong could you be! After about 20 minutes I started to feel a bit sleepy and almost nodded off! The story isn't that far removed from the original apart from the Sigourney Weaver love interest and the other world gods. I won't even go into he plot as it was rather forgettable to be honest. Save your hard earned $$$ and buy the originals on disc instead. I'm sure it will do well at the box office mainly due to the publicity it has received but it doesn't deserve it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went to see this on the weekend with my wife and kids (ages 8 and 12) so here's some perspective.My kids enjoyed the film and I can see why because the film is geared towards them. If they had made this a cartoon then it wouldn't be out of place, even with a poor script.I was 8 when the original came out and the differences are huge. The original was funny, quirky and dark all at the same time whilst this is just a poor film.Not because it has female leads, its script it quite frankly terrible.There were some good ideas around the weapons in it but all in all I could have sat having a crap on the toilet and had a better time.Glad I only paid a 2.50 to see it! Judge for yourself but be warned!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I HATE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!They finally crossed the streams(very bad)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't laugh. I didn't even smile. How did this movie ever get approved? They tried so hard with the jokes and was just boring and stupid. I would fire everyone that had anything to do with this movie. Chris Hemsworth should stick being an Australian Thor because his acting, playing a stupid white man was way out of line. This was made for man-haters. If I pay to go to the movie it's not to watch 4 non- entertaining girls. Every stereotype is in each Ghostbuster. From loud black girl saying "Hell Naw" and being loud from the 80's, to a fat tub of lard that is boring, bossy, obnoxious. What is this fat girl that I'm watching? Did I just pay money to look at this thing. Someone stab my eyes out and gimmie back my 15 bucks!!!! Everyones acting was drama101 from high school. My drama class had better actors than this!!! Can you tell I really hate this movie?? This movie is on the level of Batman and Robin which killed comic book movies in the 90's</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A weak story line and special effects don't make for a good movie. Watch the original from 1984, which ran for 105 minutes. Watch this turd for 115 minutes. After you are feeling better compare them. The original did more scenes and had a coherent story line. I watched a pirated copy of this movie and I still feel cheated! The View meets Jar Jar Binks then filter it through Inaccuracy 2006. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387808/?ref_=nv_sr_1Very little character / plot development and too many borrowed gags. What was the obsession with the soup? How does a janitor afford to build a nuclear reactor? The original cast members should be ashamed of themselves for appearing in this film. Fortunately Harold Ramis died before he saw what was done to his character. Egon was turned into a mash up of Howard from "The Big Bang Theory" and Lori Petty's "Tank Girl".</fullReview>

Read up on history: "You must understand, the leading Bolsheviks who took over Russia were not Russians. They hated Russians. They hated Christians. Driven by ethnic hatred they tortured and slaughtered millions of Russians without a shred of human remorse. It cannot be overstated. Bolshevism committed the greatest human slaughter of all time. The fact that most of the world is ignorant and uncaring about this enormous crime is proof that the global media is in the hands of the perpetrators." -Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</fullReview>

With the awful acting of the racist ape, Les.Jones (imdb doesn't allow me to write the ape's full name), and other casts, this movie has once and for all killed the franchise. A feminist propaganda would never work here, it was an absolute mistake to make this movie. And don't bother spending your money on a ticket for this garbage, it's waste of money, and time. I personally didn't enjoy the trailer and had the feeling of which this movie would probably be a totem of failure; and I was right. The trailer was less awful and more entertaining.

		<shortDescription>Woefully bad even if you lower your expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the controversy about the all female cast and the unappealing trailer I lowered my expectations and decided to watch this movie without measuring it against the original Ghostbusters. I didn't pay too much attention to the gender of the characters and their positive or negative attributes. The movie is just not funny. The plot is messy and the exposition is very poor. It is very difficult to root for the protagonists as they are flat and there is no sense of the magnitude of the threat and you have a very unclear sense of what is going on. That forces you to rely on the original as a reference as it had a very clear enemy and a bunch of funny sidekick ghosts. The end is pretty weird and sort of comes out of nowhere.I would not criticize too much the actors as the lines they were given after not very funny to begin with. The action is pretty much missing and scarce for a two hour long movie. And somehow all the time that is spent introducing us the characters and their motivations is lost. It's like they wanted to rely on the charms of Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig, but as charming as they are you have to give them something to work with. The interaction of the Ghostbusters with the government is not very funny either. I'm not going to introduce spoilers here so I'm just going to say that it was not an interesting parody and it tried to rely on jokes that didn't have to much punch.All the scenes that i remember from the trailer, that were pretty alarming, are played in the movie with the results you expected. Not a good thing. I feel sad about the movie because given the nostalgic value of the original and how well it still stands despite the defects it has, I would had really liked for this movie to work, the idea of the reverse gendered Ghostbusters could have been made well and even taking advantage of the female perspective on things. I feel bad for women, they deserved a better movie and you sense that a funnier and smarter movie could have been made with the actresses cast for this remake.From an amateur critic perspective, I think the movie makers forgot the the original Ghostbusters was a parody of many things: government, politicians, horror movies, fringe scientists, and romantic relationships. The movie had a lot of dialog comedy and pure slapstick but it didn't rely on them only. Obviously the 2016 version of Ghostbusters sets the way for a sequel at the end. I just hope they find a different scriptwriter and director to make it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First joke at 1 minute in is about a queef. It doesn't get much better than that. The new Egon is some kind of whacky borderline retahd. The black girl is just the racist loud violent black stereotype. The jokes fall flat. The "ghosts" aren't ghosts, they are like people and get thrown around in the physical realm. Campy. Long. The CGI is bad enough it reminds of GI Joe with heads going through doors and walls.The pace of the movie screeches to a halt every 5 minutes to force some unfunny cameo from the real movie. They are also pushing Sony merchandise in your face about every 20 seconds. I feel like I just visited a used car lot and got hit with some high pressure sales pitch for a bunch of crap I do not want.Seems like the reason for this movie was for a cash-grab from low- information voters who like low brow fart jokes. If you live in a trailer, you'll love this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GHOSTBUSTERS (2016): Ghostbusters is DEAD!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by: Paul FeigWritten by: Katie Dippold and Paul FeigStarring: Kristen Wiig as Erin Gilbert, Melissa McCarthy as Abby Yates, Kate McKinnon as Jillian Holtzmann, Leslie Jones as Patty TolanIt's really sad that stuff like "Ghostbusters" pass off as comedy nowadays. No, I am not talking about the comedic masterpiece that came out in 1984. I am talking about the shameless cash-grab by Sony.Now, people'll tell you that Ghostbusters II/Extreme Ghostbusters ruined the franchise much before this new one. Well, tell them they are wrong because both Ghostbusters II and Extreme Ghostbusters kicked ass. Ghostbusters II usually gets most of the blame and yeah, it's similar to the original and it can be said that it plays it safe with it's comedy but it still had the subtle, sly humor that the original was known for. The new one throws that out of the window to make way for slapstick, queefing and pretty much all of the "in your face" kind of jokes. And let me tell you, it's bad.Alright, the jokes aren't any good, what about the scares? There is none. This movie feels so tension-free that I couldn't get invested in the characters. This movie is just failed joke after failed joke after a chuckle. The humor is extremely childish. Ghostbusters II seems like Porky's compared to this.I think the cast knew they were in a bad movie so they tried to make the best out of it. The cast is great, the characters are not. Everyone except Jillian are the same. They are straight women. Blues Brothers 2000 suffered from the same thing. All of the characters were same, and there weren't any chemistry between them. Jillian was the "Oh, I am crazy look at me!" stereotype. Abby, Patty and Erin were "Elwood, the underplayed character" stereotypes. Kevin (Chris Hemsworth) was the "I am stupid and I can't do anything without people's help" stereotype and to be honest I chuckled at some of the scenes with him. I liked him in that role, but compared to Janine from the original, his character falls short.People are telling me "Don't compare this to the original, review it as it's own movie." Well, it's hard not to compare because they named it the same thing! The cameos don't help either. They feel sad, pathetic especially Bill Murray's cameo was so sad. It's like he just had a stroke or something. Dan Aykroyd's cameo was cool though. Is there anything good to say about this movie? Yes. The cast is good like I said before, the effects sometimes looked nice and Dan Aykroyd's cameo was cool. That's about it. You know your remake is not good when one of the highlights is a cameo from the old cast member.This movie destroyed Ghostbusters. It's not the same universe anymore. No Ray, no Peter, no Egon, no Winston, no Louis, no Janine, no Dana. Instead, pave the way for Rowan, one of the most embarrassing attempts at a villain in cinema's history since Mr. Freeze from Batman &amp; Robin. Rowan is just a stereotypical basement- dweller virgin nerd. You know, the stereotype Melissa McCarthy and Paul Feig like.To sum this up, Ghostbusters is a shameless cash-grab with childish comedy, no stakes, badly written characters, embarrassing villain and pathetic cameos. Sony had huge potential in their hands, that it's sad that it got wasted on this garbage heap of a movie. Sony should have listened to Max Landis and they should have went with a sequel/passing the torch movie with a mixed-gender cast.This is a level 9 stinker alright.</fullReview>

First joke of the film is a queef joke. Really, Sony? That's the best you could come up with? The characters are awkward and don't mesh. And the gaping plot holes only add to the confusion in this abomination. (How can you "kill" a ghost that's already dead?

		<shortDescription>Another "Meh" Summer Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is it Earth-shattering bad? No, it's nowhere near as bad as everyone thought it would be. However, it's definitely not good either.The first real joke of the movie was a generic fart joke. That's what kind of movie this was. I'll be honest. Chris Hemsworth may have been the funniest character in the movie. which totally disappointed me.The good: It was a lighthearted, goofy, "something-to-do" movie. I would not recommend paying to see this at the theater unless you're going with children (and even then, there is too much crude adult humor to be comfortable with that). I did end up liking some of the nods to the original Ghostbusters film, though they did have a LOT of them.The bad: They are really milking the sexism thing - Immediately following a surprisingly cool fight scene, we hear some forced joke about how women are always late. Ugh. They clearly want to continue the dialogue about the casting (any pub is good pub, I suppose).The cast was surprisingly out of sync at the beginning of the movie. There was no real chemistry or flow between the leads. It got better as the movie went on, but it was kind of choppy at first.Did not like how Leslie Jones' character was portrayed. The loud and black one that isn't as smart as everyone else. I'm tired of it, and that type of wacky character wasn't needed at all -especially in this film. I would have preferred one rational person in the group instead...someone the audience could relate to. Overall: It was okay. Like the title says, a mediocre summer movie. I had a couple of chuckles. There were some eye-rolling moments to balance them out. It's something to check out on Netflix one day. In my opinion, it's not worth going to the theater to pay for unless you just want to relax and watch something goofy. I can see how some would like it, but most probably won't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Casting women wasn't the only change.... comedy got sidelined as well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's two things the trailers did, and one of them was wrong. Firstly the trailers made the movie look like rubbish, and secondly made Lesley Jones' character look like a ridiculous stereotype.Lesley Jones got shortchanged in those trailers.I don't necessarily dislike changing the original male characters for female ones, but it has to be because of a raft of improvements over the original. Just changing the sex of the main characters is not "edgy" or "cool" and it sure as hell is not "empowering" either.The original Ghostbusters was a supernatural comedy, and thats all the remake/reboot needed to be, it didn't need to be about "women" and "girl power", and if the focus was on making a good and funny remake, the fact that it was all women wouldn't have even be a factor.And thats the problem. Ghostbusters 2016 is simply not funny. I didn't laugh once, two smiles throughout the movie do not construe a comedy.I simply don't think this kind of franchise movie lies in Paul Feigs skillset. He seems to excel at the raunchy smaller indie movies, and for the most part, i've liked everything he's done before, I have no downer on the guy.The same can be said for Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig, both been in funny movies, Wiig has even written funny stuff, and frankly she was the most hilarious thing in the movie Paul.McKinnon and Jones I have no experience of, but in this movie, I found McKinnon irritating, and Jones was actually OK, she sure as hell wasn't the stereotype the trailers made her out to be. OK, lets temper that with, "the power of Patty" and "I don't know if it was a race thang..." lines still featured, inspite of those scenes in the trailers REALLY irritating people, but for the most part, she was OK.The VFX were good, obviously better than the original...... but then every time you see the VFX, you're reminded of Scooby Doo, and that doesn't compliment your $144million movie!The villain of the movie...... i'm not sure if they couldn't find a more pathetic antagonist if they tried, but his motivations were "I was bullied so i'm going to bring hell on Earth"....... scriptwriters must have had sleepless nights coming up with that :/Its hard to not compare it to the original, but in no measurable way does the new iteration come off better than the original except the VFX, but stylistically, the original has it beat even there.The original movie, whilst a comedy, also played it serious. The new one felt like the characters were in on the joke.I'm saddened that this movie got greenlit so quickly after Harold Ramis died, because its as if people behind the scenes gave up on the notion of a Ghostbusters III, and opted for this instead, and very quickly this one was turned around and made. And it shows.And this is my biggest complaint.... this isn't the movie I wanted after 25+ years of waiting, Ghostbusters III was what I wanted, one last hurrah of the original cast, even if it had been a "passing of the torch" idea, it would have worked, because any future scriptwriters would have had to follow the same formula that was set down in previous movies, THIS movie would have been different, and would have been better for it, and everyone would have won.No-one wins in this movie, the original actors certainly don't win, McCarthy and Wiig don't win and we know they can deliver the goods with a good script, certainly Paul Feig doesn't win as its clear a big budget franchise movie is not where he is at his most comfortable. Worst of all, fans of Ghostbusters don't win, because when this movie fails as it undoubtedly will, any further Ghostbusters movies will take just as long as this one did to come about.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've abstained from writing any reviews 'till this point because the movie/s in question had a rating and review level that was appropriate to the film/s. But after seeing the reception: 60% on metacritic, 75% ON ROTTEN TOMATOES. No. Just no.I'm rather upset so I will keep this short: the movie is an effective failure. The characters were bland and boring and did not gel together at all. And that is a shame considering the talent behind some of the actresses/actors. The story is just a rehash of the same old deal regarding it's previous installments. The more I think about it the more I believe that this was just a blatant cash-grab attempt, trying to suck up the money from the poor nostalgic fools (me included) who have fond memories of the franchise thus far. No. Avoid this movie, send your money to a charity or something, this movie is not worth the money, nor the timeOne point for the good special effects. One point for an attempt at girl power that unfortunately whithers away in the face of the poor movie it is stuck to.2/10. Watch something else.</fullReview>

I would not recommend this film to any movie watchers, for the fans of the franchise though, I feel great pity, it is a massive letdown to them, one of whom is my friend. For those of us who are not fans, the disappointment will not be as big but the movie certainly fell far short of what it was parroted as being. Overall, I gave the film a 1/10 owing to not only its extremely bad story-line and dialogue, but because of how much of a deterioration it represented compared to the original, the filmmakers took a great franchise and trashed it utterly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite more than adequate performances by the main cast the film is truly difficult to watch, and even more difficult to laugh to. The problem isn't that the Ghostbusters are women, it is the truly awful writing and production. The movie is basically a steady progression of placement adverts, cameos, and homages interspersed with underwritten gags and jokes trying to mask a massive failure to create a plot. In the end, it was impossible for the women to inhabit the characters because they were merely a veneer over a rehashing of a style of comedic acting that is more stale than the Ghostbusters franchise itself. So to Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, Kristen Wiig, and Leslie Jones: if by some miracle you are reading this, don't take any scat over this movie, it was Dan Ackroyd, Ivan Reitman, Amy Pascal, Katie Dippold, and Paul Feig's fault this movie scat the bed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disgraceful Atrocity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was hard going to see this film with an open mind, especially since I love the original film and couldn't bear to see it remade. After the film ended, I wasn't disappointed because as it went on I realized just how atrocious it was. Here's why the Ghostbusters remake is a terrible film. The pacing was horrible. McKinnon's character rides up with the hearse they recently attained, and it's suddenly and inexplicably redesigned into the Ecto-1. The team rides through New York in it and emerge from the vehicle wearing their Ghostbusters outfits. The film took a huge jump here and didn't spend any time introducing the suits or the car. The transitions between other scenes are terrible. After ghosts invade New York the film rushes right into the finale. Much of the Ghostbusters' dialogue is them using big scientific words and phrases. It's not bad for the film to do this a few times - let's say three or four - but on at least twenty occasions do they talk about these scientific things that seem to only be stated to make the characters seem smarter. When not used excessively, it definitely shows their intelligence - but it's forced into their dialogue and that makes it worse. The original film's cast makes cameos in the film - Billy Murray actually has a small character who is apparently killed off, and in my mind rightly so because had he agreed to do Ghostbusters 3 this abomination would never have been put to screen. Slimer also appears in the film, and as much as I love him he really served no purpose other than nostalgia. The movie ended with Ernie Hudson's cameo (Sigourney Weaver appears in the credits). Squeezing them in was really painful to watch, it was the final nail in the coffin. All males in the film are stupid, helpless, and rude. It doesn't matter how big the characters are, they are portrayed this way - including the cameos. Chris Hemsworth's character is supposed to be the comic relief and as much as you will laugh at him, ALL his dialogue is nonsensical and humorous to a ridiculous extent. He is the embodiment of the clueless/stupid male stereotype in the film. I couldn't help but laugh because of how stupid they made his character. The black Ghostbuster is a street-smart subway worker who is also racial stereotype. She exorcises a Ghostbuster by slapping them in the face, and also has a line where she says, "I don't know if that was a 'race thing' or a 'lady thing' ...". Her character is terribly misused. The film's final battle is horrible and rushed. The Ghostbusters fight a legion of ghosts in Times Square for only three minutes before being faced with the main villain, Rowan, who is now a colossal manifestation of the Ghostbusters logo. The logo manifestation is only in the film for two minutes - I kid you not, it's laughable how quickly he is defeated and also how he is defeated. The Ghostbusters fire proton lasers at Rowan's crotch (take that, males), and he falls into a portal - but not before pulling Abby in with him. There is a pointless scene where Erin jumps into the portal and saves Abby. I gave the film a two for having a great soundtrack, which was composed by Theodore Shapiro. He incorporates the Ghostbusters theme in some stellar ways, and all in all produces a great score that will really catch your attention. Some of the new concepts that worked did give the film some credit, but even so they are very overshadowed by the atrocities that come about through the characters and story. I recommend not seeing this film. It's offensive, badly written, poorly paced and very painful to watch.</fullReview>

Mostly I was bored and waiting for it to end.CGI was very good. No charisma between the stars. It was if they threw a bunch of strangers together and none of them cared about the others. As a result I didn't care about any of them. Playfulness among the characters seemed fake and forced as did any excitement they showed. Seemed like they mostly were thinking "What am I doing in this movie and how much longer do I have to endure this?"Pointless cameos added nothing to its entertainment value (except perhaps the giant ghost that unintentionally looked like John Goodman).Those under 25 that have never seen the original may find this more entertaining than I did.Might have given it two stars if I had seen it free on TV.</fullReview>

My biggest disappointment other than the remaining original cast had bulls!t cameos(they deserve better than that) is the final incarnation of the villain which really pisses me off and as it should of any Tim Burton fan. His final form looks just like Oogie Boogie from Nightmare Before Christmas. This movie is absolute garbage.

They are are all stereo- types and not interesting ones. Yes its Ghostbusters, yes there are some interesting visuals but if you're expecting some intelligent humor here, like the 1980 Ghostbusters movie - prepare for disappointment. The first funny joke is a fart joke (female fart joke). Thats right, you heard me. Where there were funny looking and interesting Ghosts in the previous Ghostbusters, this movie we have boring ones which actually kill people. People die in this movie. There is a bodycount here. What were they thinking?This literally is an insult to the Ghostbusters license. This could have been a good movie, but what we have here is neon-in-your- face,rattling keys in your face, catering to idiots; you are being treated like your an idiot.Do not see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every bit as awful as the terrible advertising suggested</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original 'Ghostbusters' is still enormously enjoyable entertainment, that fares even better from an adult perspective. The sequel was a step-down and not as good, but it has enough to make it watchable.'Ghostbusters' (2016), coming from somebody who has seen the film and saw it with an open mind, was a complete and utter mess. To be honest, expectations were extremely low, it was a terrible idea from the start, it had some of the most terrible advertising of any film in recent memory, the practical war-zone online from both sides but especially defenders was reason alone to put me off seeing it and hearing the theme song was enough to make one squirm.However, there are plenty of films out there that are badly advertised but actually turn out to be good to great films (for example, was expecting to dislike 'Lilo and Stitch' and 'Galaxy Quest', for examples, but ended up really liking and loving them respectively). Plus Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig and Chris Hemsworth have given good to great performances in the past. So this reviewer gave it the benefit of the doubt and made a real effort to judge it as its own entity.It turned out to be every bit as awful as the advertising made it look. It's a disgrace to the original film but is a truly bad film on its own as well. Other than the spirited and reasonably entertaining performance of Cecily Strong, there is next to nothing about 'Ghostbusters'.Visually, it's not pleasing at all, with the incomplete-looking editing and very artificially cartoonish special effects particularly standing out in a bad way. The music is generic and over-bearing, the theme song also has to be down there as one of the worst theme songs in film history.Whereas the original 'Ghostbusters' has a great blend of comedy, horror and action, the reboot completely fails at all three. The horror is practically non-existent, there's too little and it's severely diluted by heavy overload of unintentional comedy, increasing predictability and lack of suspense and such. Action, if any, is barely noticeable.Especially pitiful is the comedy, which suffers from being continually forced and contrived jokes-wise and a severe lack of wit in the script. The references to the original could have been affectionate, but felt thrown-in and forced. It's not for the easily offended either, the backlash against the film has veered on misogynistic admittedly but with its subtlety-of-an-axe, obnoxious and racist and sexist stereotypes (especially Leslie Jones' offensive, irritating and out of date character and the depiction of men) the film is every bit as guilty.Story is paper thin, and when there is any it feels so rushed and incomplete that sense is next to zero, charm, heart and fun are all in the minus figures and the incomprehensibility factor is high. The direction is lethargic at best and inept at worst, chemistry between the actors is barely there, you couldn't have asked for a more pathetic or lamer villain and apart from Strong the acting is poor all round. Hemsworth has been described by some as a bright spot, but to me his scenes do slow down the film and the character is so much of a dumb dope with no likability that Hemsworth's easy-going charm, comic timing and swaggering charisma do not come through and he just grates. What a shameful waste of talent.The four leads either phone in (especially a bored-looking McCarthy) or over-act, particularly Kate McKinnon. The less said about obnoxious Leslie Jones the better. Wiig fares best, but isn't enough to save it. Don't rely on the cameos or the supporting roles to give an entertainment or nostalgia factor, they are just an excuse to cram as many as possible and nearly all of them consist of wasted talent actually looking as if they were bribed into taking part, while they are placed very clumsily most of the time too. The return of some of the actors in the original 'Ghostbusters' add nothing, they have screen times too short and look miserable.Overall, a pointless and awful reboot that improves nothing on the idea, that screamed of disaster from the get go, or the terrible advertising. 1/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What the hell did i just watch? This honestly doesn't involve with the original Ghostbusters at all, yet they made it like a comedy stand up show rather than the movie itself! I thought the CGI was terrible, not frightening as the villains in the original Ghostbusters films were. They really made Kirsten Wigg, Leslie Jones, Kate McKinnon and Melissa McCarthy look bad as comedy actresses. As much as it was a good idea to have female Ghostbusters, it still didn't work out! God I just think they made such a balls out of this. Dan Akyrod should've done a third sequel or just forget about people trying to make the franchise alive. It just turned out rubbish at the end of the day!I found the story line dragging on that ?t bore me to ultimate tears! The jokes weren't even funny, like I tried to laugh at them but just couldn't! The characters needed to be more themselves instead of being stereotypical. This has got to be one of the awful and horrible reboot movies I have ever seen in my life! Worst film of 2016!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should have done GB3 instead. Minor spoilers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 80's GB was huge! It had subtle humor, great quips and one liners. And even some scary scenes! It was played straight and serious and the guy's weren't in on the joke.This film misses that point entirely! The Ghostbusters are in on the joke. Between Patty screaming most of her lines in an attempt to be funny. Making the males dimwits! (Poor Hemsworth) and the ridiculous dancing number by the cops in the later part of the film, and overall cheesy slapstick humor, with outdated references and blatant sexual jokes. You can't tell who this film is geared too. Not kids. Not the adults who grew up with it. Not current teens? Who?You also have the unoriginal concept of the Ghost Logo being a villain, and false nostalgia draw in of having the original GB's come back as cameo's that are NOT even their characters (Even having Ray be corrected on the Who you gonna call bit?) This was a nightmare!They even hint at Zull for a sequel just to keep pushing forward the lack of original thought in this film. Let's not get into the although brief scene in the film of Slimette. You know so Slimer can have a spin off! Maybe with wife and kids! Wait for Redbox or Netflix IMO!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This had to be the worst example of political correctness being shoved down our throats.Seriously did anyone think the original Ghostbusters even need to be remade and destroyed with a cast of teenage boys with breasts?If you need a reason America is so incredibly screwed up these days then just look at the absolute crap they are churning out on a daily basis.There use to be imagination in Hollywood and now everything is just trying to brainwash you into thinking the government are the good guys.If you remember the original Ghostbusters then the Ghosts were not the problem. The problem was the bureaucratic government never listening to reason and just getting in the way of a developing business but in this the Ghosts are evil, the women are wannabe men pushing the division even further between black and white and male and female and the story is a vomit inducing cesspit of political correctness.Wake up America and see what is happening to the country!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An abomination, insult to the original and new cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was rather interested to see a female lead Ghostbusters... There, I said it. I'll admit I had reservations but thought it could be interesting.That all went down the drain when I heard how Sony's Amy Pascal and Feig were bullying the old cast and driving false ideology into the film, still, I thought the cast seems good, Kate's a pretty funny girl.I saw it earlier today and left pretty depressed, I can't believe Feig took some of the funnier women in the business and pulled them down. The movie just... wasn't... funny! At all!The effects, people have been harsh since the first trailer, whilst they are by no means bad, there aren't good either, like a mid- 2000's TV show.The cameos are also forced and feel really out of place, Bill visibly doesn't want to be there and most of the other men in the film are portrayed as idiots bar Chris's character.The story is a mild rehash of the original and it doesn't help itself that it somehow makes the story awful. I won't spoil it but the ending is complete and utter garbage, showing the world that Kevin Feig and Amy Pasal are nothing but colossal sexists.I'll be flying back to the states tomorrow after spending some... Quality family time, watching this train wreck unfold on the big screen. You can be damn sure I'll let people know just how bad this was. It was an insult to the original cast and crew and damages the reputation of the great new cast and I feel sorry they agreed to help make this film.I think we can all hope this ends Feig's career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Decided to go and check ghostbusters out today to see if all the hate is warranted and I think it's safe to say that the hate really is warranted !! Never seen so much sexism and racism in a family friendly movie. Not once did I laugh in the movie and not once did it shock me with its it cartoony CGI ... I paid 4 quid to watch this and I feel like I've been ripped off !! disgrace of a movie. I strongly recommend avoiding this film at all costs !!! The cameos were the best bit only just to see the old crew on screen again ! But other than that this film is a stinker and derseves the hate ...4 quid a ticket. And I feel ripped off. That's how bad this film really was ! Even my son did t like it and he loved the originals and he's only 12 .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And the Razzie Award goes to..... Ghostbusters 2016</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this with no expectations. After seeing it my conclusion is that this movie was absolute garbage! The special effects where overdone and the comedy tried too hard. I had no problem with them using an all female cast. I'm actually a big fan of Wiig. MacCarthy was just annoying in this and Chris Hemsworth character was BAD! This reboot did no justice to the original movies. This made Ghostbusters 2 look like a masterpiece. The only draw to this movie is the Ghostbusters title. I don't know how much money the studio had to pay all these sites, critics and bloggers to give this movie a good rating but they must have done something because no normal human being will like this movie. The ghost in this movie where beyond cheesy. This is just another failed attempt to reboot a classic! Save your money on this one. There's better choices to go see.</fullReview>

I can only conclude that the people who are giving this 10/10 are either very easily impressed, raging feminists who were going to like the film no matter what or paid for reviewers.The film is just not funny, it's not original and goes a long way to showing the lack of creativity and originality in Hollywood today.

		<fullReview>This has got to be the worst reboot I've seen since Godzilla. If this doesn't ruin Paul Feig's career especially with his behavior towards the people who didn't like this movie, then there's something wrong with Hollywood. Dialogue is cringe worthy and nothing is quotable like the original. For a movie that was made in 2016, the CGI is garbage. They capture 1 ghost in the entire movie, and then crap all over the lore in the final battle as they straight up start killing the ghosts. The 4 have no chemistry and instead of being fleshed out are just basic caricatures. Shy nerdy girl, Fat obnoxious girl (physical comedy, she fall down), weirdo girl, and loud black woman. Every man is either an a**hole or an idiot which of course because this is a "feminist" film, we need to show off the sexism against men (IMDB wouldn't let me put the word for hatred of men for some reason) and don't tell me it's not there. Feig released a article exclaiming men weren't funny just the other day from the time I post this. The climax involves them shoot the crotch of the totally original and not all Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, I'm sorry the Ghostbusters symbol. This movie is the fever dream of a white knight feminist "ally" who has to show the women how he totally isn't like those other guys. Ironic part is that the best character in this movie is Chris Hemsworth's character. A man is the best character in your feminist film where you intentionally tried to make them men crappy. Paul Feig, you need to quit your day job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insulting, And Hypocritical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Went and saw this movie Thursday even though I swore I'd never watch a reboot of Ghostbusters or Back to the Future (hopefully they never make one)This movie is complete garbage. I saw all of the positive reviews, and those "critics' are either A) Bought off by Sony B) Idiots C) SJW shills or D) Too scared of panning it for fear of being labeled sexist. Because if you read some of those reviews even some of the more positive ones talk as if the movie wasn't that good, but because women are in it they praised it. Some "professional critics" only focused on the gender of the cast, which tells me they know the movie is a stinker but the feminist agenda has to be pushed, so they'll ignore it being terrible to push the agenda. And people wonder why I think it's stupid for people to base their decision to see a movie on whether or not some paid stooge says to see it or not.The effects are horrible. Look at the ghosts in the original two movie, most of those ghosts in the original films looked creepy. But this movie? It looks like the ghosts from that crappy Haunted Mansion movie Disney crapped onto the screens a decade or so ago. The final battle was horrible, with them obviously being in front of a green screen.The movie breaks it's own rules. One minute they can't kill ghosts with their proton packs, the next minute they can? Why? For convenience of course. And sheer laziness.Patty was a racial stereotype, which was kind of funny since this movie was made solely to be SJW pandering. Guess SJWs are fine with racism as long as they are the ones doing it. I've seen SJWs try to defend Patty being a stereotype by claiming Winston was just a "token" in the original. Which is pretty racist of them to say. Because anyone who has actually seen the original Ghostbusters knows that Winston was the everyman who just needed stable employment and found himself thrust into the crazy world of the Ghostbusters. He was the most relateable of the crew, because when you as a viewer didn't understand the scientific/paranormal jargon Winston usually said out loud on screen what you were thinking in your head. And some of his lines were the best. "Ray, if someone asks you if you're a god, you say YES!!!" Classic. The only time Winston's race was brought up was by him when talking to the mayor he says, "I've seen S**t that would turn you white." The whole cast has horrible chemistry, and the jokes weren't funny at all. The acting was pretty much what you'd expect from a horrible comedy made this century. They think you'll laugh your butt off, but instead you think "is that supposed to be funny?" The original movie was funny because it was made like a serious paranormal movie but the line delivery of the cast is what got the laughs. Like the scene where they meet with the mayor and Venkman calmly tells the mayor about what Peck is lacking.Now, where the movie is hypocritical. All men in this movie are depicted in a negative light. Either idiots or jerks or both. Now, imagine if the roles were reversed, the same people praising this movie would be protesting outside the studio and whining about the lack of positive women roles in the film. But since it's men being treated that way? No issue from SJWs. Chris Hemsworth character is an idiot only hired for his looks. Which is another double standard. It's okay for women to ogle attractive men but when the roles are reversed those same women cry about how evil men's standards of beauty are.They beat the main villain by shooting him in the crotch. It's obvious this was to flip the finger at all men in general, because this whole movie was just "Ra Ra Feminism Ra Ra Down with Men!!!" Imagine if this reboot had starred Adam Sandler and his crew of unfunny friends. Beating the villain by shooting him in the crotch would have had everyone bashing the movie. The movie would have been critically panned just for that scene. But since it's women? Praise. Pathetic.Don't waste your time. It's a lame attempt to cash in on nostalgia, but they spit in the face of the fans by labeling them all as sexist and Sony's horrible marketing which was just an attempt to call anyone who didn't want a reboot a sexist was insulting.I remember when I first heard about this movie being made. I was on my favorite movie/comic/TV news site and the second I saw the headline "Sony Pictures Announces Ghostbusters Reboot", I immediately went to the comments and said that without the original cast making a true Ghostbusters sequel I wasn't interested. I didn't even read the article. But suddenly I was flooded with "You just hate women!!!!!!" comments in response. So I didn't even know the movie was going to have an all female cast until after I had already declared my intention to not see it. So why would any man want to see this movie when men are depicted as moronic jerks in the film and Sony and the cast and crew have done nothing but insult us every step of the way?I have a hard time believing anyone genuinely likes this. The people giving this high scores either didn't see it, or are only rating it high because it's a feminist agenda movie. I literally saw someone's review say "I gave it a 10 to counteract the negative reviews."1 out of 10. Only because they don't let you give half stars or zero stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You have heard all the...buzz about this movie. Abysmal reactions, much hated trailer, and harsh responses by the studio. Pretty much saying that everyone who hates this movie is misogynist is a great defense for themselves. That way, they can blame all those stupid people and won't have to ask themselves whether they maybe simply messed up, big time. It's not about the female cast! It's the fact that this remake was unnecessary. And I can imagine guys sitting at a meeting going "Guys, we need a summer movie for 2016. Any ideas?" "Yeah! Remember Ghostbusters? 30 years ago, that one was a smash hit, and people still love it" "Cool. So there is our idea" "Uhmmm, should we maybe try something new inste..." "Shut up, dude, we are up to something. So what do we do with GB?" "Uhmmm... well, let's replace the cast with all females. That will be enough of a change so that people will accept this simple remake" "Genius, man! Something else?" "Yeah, well, the people loved the mixture of a bit of scariness with some humor by these former SNL guys..." "Cool. But let's add more jokes. Funny stuff, you know? Slapstick and such! FUnny hats! B*tch-slapping someone! Neurotic big city humor!" "Awesome. Now that we have the plot, let's get going".The point is - it's not about the Ghostbusters suddenly all being female. They could have replaced them with aliens, kids, cats, wrestlers or iguanas. None of that would have been a cool idea, or a refreshing change, or a justification to simply remake a film people loved, but make it worse.It saddens me how Hollywood is so out of ideas that they either make too many unnecessary remakes or too many sequels (which feel tired and out of ideas eventually). This movie is not funny. Those jokes might work in SNL, but feel cliché, old, unfunny and embarrassing in a triple A-budget movie. The jokes are predictable, and totally ancient. The characters are tired clichés. The CGI is nothing special. There are plot-holes so big, the Marshmallow man could walk through them without touching the edges. The final battle and the...tactic is embarrassing. I mean, they call fans misogynistic but the big battle is the four ladies shooting the baddie in the crotch? Seriously? Who fought this was FUNNY? Remakes are hard. You need to have a good reason, a "hookline", other than "let's squeeze more money out of an idea a guy had 30 years ago". Why not let the original movie stand for itself? Why not leave it alone, instead of staining it's legacy with a jerkish, unfunny, badly directed, badly written, bursting at the seams with cliché embarrassing remake, even giving it the same name? Yeah, the guys at the studio can keep defending themselves everyone calling everyone who dislikes it misogynists. That way, they don't have to look at the silly, half-cooked mess they created and ask themselves whether this just wasn't a bad idea from the start, and was badly executed. This is just sad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If Bridesmaids was the Hangover, this would be the less funny version of Grown Ups</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Non-Spoiler reviewFirst off, I'd just like to get this right out the way: I genuinely believe the majority of positive reviews are by paid shills or bots, as ALMOST ALL OF THEM came the same day in a very narrow time period, some before the movie was even released. And yes, I am being 100% serious, in saying that. When Movies have to have huge profit margins, this should be expected, especially given the unprecedented negative reaction to the trailer. I find it incredibly odd that professional reviewers have rated this movie an average of 6 stars, when the average fan voting barely exceeds 2. Only conclusion I can think of is the reviewers were either bribed or were too afraid of coming off as sexist.Let me also say, that I feel I am a rather open minded viewer, with no real nostalgia to the original GB. I have enjoyed female cast comedies before, and Bridesmaids is one of the dozen or so movies I've actually purchased in the past few years. This is not bridesmaid however. Remember in middle school when everyone in the class had to do a presentation, and the two weird girls who were overly sheltered and for some odd reason loved horses got grouped together and tried WAYYYY to hard to make it funny? This is that same feeling of cringe and secondhand embarrassment, only for nearly two hours.I'm not even going to go into the blatant sexi... err I'm sorry, Feminism Counter-sexism, or the incredibly awkward and played out Racism where the one Asian and one black character are literally walking caricatures, and just stick to some of the laziest stereotypes I have ever seen, but instead focus on the worst part of the movie; It simply was not funny. Cheap and crude laughs are easy and annoying, but they do occasionally at least make you smirk, but I can say with absolute sincerity that this movie did not make me do anything but mildly smile once. The CGI was terrible, most of the actresses genuinely felt embarrassed to be there, and the plot was beyond boring. Look, we all knew what this was, no one expected Casanova or an Oscar winner, but if you're going to be crude, at least own it.It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it was certainly one of the most boring and forgettable ones. My only concern is when this movie flops horribly,and it will, that people don't play the sexism card to excuse it and kill the possibility of the next "bridesmaids". This was just a bad movie, and no actor, no matter how funny they were, could save it from it's poor writing. Blaming the poor writing on misogamy is lazy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK firstly I just want to say that yes I am a massive fan of the original movies, but this is in no way a 'fanboy over reaction' as some critics have shouted,this has nothing to do with the fact that 4 females play the lead and nor am I a 'Troll'. This is MY genuine review of MY experience of ghostbusters 2016, there will be comparisons to GB84 but what do you expect when you remake a movie?The movie actually starts off OK, within the first 10 - 15 minutes I thought that this could have promise, but that sharp fizzled out. I went into the cinema with low expectations after seeing the trailers, however I was open minded and hopeful after reading an early review. Reviews at this stage are mostly favorable, well I can tell you now in my eyes (and most others) they are wrong.Despite a relatively strong cast on paper with the exception of Melissa McCarthy who plays.. well Melissa McCarthy in every movie. The movie was poorly written, no character development with a villain straight out of Scooby Doo /Beethoven the 8th/ Home alone 57 (Yes that bad) and CGI that rivals it. Kristen Wiig who I have found funny in other movies just didn't seem convincing and her ogling over the 'dumb but hot' secretary was funny at first but grew old, Kate McKinnon was OK, but again probably just over done, Leslie Jones served a purpose as the knowledge of the city, and with the exception of a few bad lines wasn't too bad, but i'd say the acting overall was below par and the comedy was well... not that funny, it seemed like a dress rehearsal, there was no chemistry, it was forced,and seemed as though they hopelessly fishing for laughs to distract from such a mediocre script.The beauty of 1984 GB, is that the comedy was subtle, sharp and relevant. You believed in the characters and they clicked, 2016 had no direction, we had no straight character to bring them all together (such as Egon), it was 4 people fighting for screen time to delivery terrible jokes. Que the 'dumb but hot' secretary - Chris Hemsworth - Who raised the odd smile, but this was overdone too.The villain was ridiculous, the kind of Villain that belongs in the Spy Kids world,completely unconvincing, we knew nothing about him other than he 'didn't like people' and wanted to 'cleanse the earth'. I was looking forward to the odd nod towards the original, but that was overdone, the cameo's for me didn't really work and served no other purpose than to try and appease the fans, it took away any originality that it could have had.When I first seen the CGI in the trailers I actually thought that looked like the best part, but in truth again this is something that was overdone (common pattern), I get that Feig doesn't have experience with CGI and was probably a little overzealous with it.The movie just didn't have the feel good factor of the originals, part of the romance with the conclusions of these was the sense of coming together and almost wartime spirit, which I think in this day &amp; age would have been great, they certainly missed a trick. But instead we had Chris Hemsworth dance us out, which my 4 year old enjoyed but in truth was just as cringe-worthy as the rest of the movie. I've read up how people have said that it is 'Sexist' and possibly 'racist' I didn't get that feel to be honest, certainly no more than other movies I have seen, yes it is probably directed more towards the female audience but that wasn't the issue here. It'll be easy for Feig and Co to hide behind the 'you want it to fail because its women' tag. The problem is that it is just a bad movie, badly directed with a bad script. Kids may like it, fans of the original will hate it and anyone who is a fan of cinema will most likely just be disappointed. I give it a 2 and I think that is being kind.</fullReview>

But hopes don't make up for flat jokes, forced acting performances and a movie that ultimately takes a very unflattering view of its own fans.The original Ghostbusters movies were marvels of dry wit in comedy. The actors were portrayed very much as a bunch of blue-collar bums, out of their element, and trying to make the best of situations in awkward, and often-times hilarious ways. Every gag shot, for example the classic scene in the elevator when Ray's proton pack is switched on for the first time only to see Venkman and Igon shuffle eerily into the corner away from him as the pack whistles to life is the stuff that belly-laughs are made of. It was dry humor, witty and sharp, and it just clicked. It was simple but sophisticated, and done to a tee by masterful actors.This movie by comparison has all the subtle intelligence in its humor of a Saturday morning cartoon strip. The jokes fell so flat in most cases that it was painful. If the original movies were Calvin and Hobbes, GB2016 is Gasoline Alley. The plot is poor and fairly predictable, with many nonsensical decisions by the cast, and in particular the villain, being directed, I felt, more as backlash against the film's Internet haters than made to produce a quality product. I gave the film a shot because I wanted to see what a female cast of talented comedians could bring to the Ghostbusters universe, in what I had hoped would be a piece at least comparable to the originals. From the absolutely terrible script and stale humor to the cartoonish and utterly unintimidating CGI, it failed.Ultimately, the film also failed the one true test of a good movie: When I walked out of the theatre at the end and thought back on the last couple hours of my life, I did not feel like like the ticket or my time had been well spent. See something else, folks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was not asked for,it isn't very funny,and in my opinion takes away something from the original movie.All it tries to do is cache in on nostalgia from the first movie. The humor is forced and very more miss than hit. At almost 2 hours, I spent time just looking at the time, wondering when it would end. The cringe comedy is not my idea of funny, and the delivering of the some lines sound like the actresses don't want to be there. I am all for gender equality and female roles, but I don't really want to sit in a movie that is just there for the sake of being a female remake of a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie tries too hard in every way and fails in every way. The cast simply wasn't funny. What they were was loud, obnoxious, and cringe-worthy. Everyone in this had no idea what made the original great. I feel embarrassed for everyone involved.Durative - Unfunny - Horrible CG - Setups with no payoff Can we just pretend it didn't happen?I've just got a feeling towards the end they were planning on just using this is a vehicle to sell the originals at Walmart and promote regressive political agenda.What else can I possibly say other than if I had it all over to do.. I wouldn't have even pirated it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I start, I want to be honest with you: I didn't watch that thing and I probably never will. But I decided to review it anyway. I can imagine the bewildered eyes, wondering why reviewing it when you didn't watch the movie? I'm telling you why: because it's payback time for the utter disrespect the Sony management and film cast have shown since the first trailer went on to the fan base. A behavior that killed this movie even before it gets released.This is even more heartbreaking when you realize that this movie could have had such a different outcome. Many fans came forward urging the management to not release that movie because it's going terribly wrong and straight to the wall. Some have even proposed new and fresh ideas and their vision of how Ghostbusters should have been. The staff could have accepted the critics and say OK we messed up, we wont release the movie until it matches your expectations better.But no they never did that. Instead they deleted the comments, insulted us as sexists and misogynists and they even used bots posting generic comments about how this movie is gonna be great. They will certainly do the same thing over here soon enough. There's no limit to save the face.It makes me so sad because they are also insulting Harold Ramis memory and legacy. He, Dan Aykroyd and Ivan Reitman had worked on this project for several decades. They put their art and their huge talent in Ghostbusters 3. The fans would have adored it without a doubt But Amy Pascal and Paul Feig have thrown it away replacing it by this politically feminist, poorly written vision. I'm shaking my head in disbelief for the incredible disdain those two Texas sized Egocentric characters had displayed since they took over that project. They even included Ivan, Dan and Harold within the credits in order to associate them to that disgrace. How insulting!So yes, I'm more than delighted to see that this disaster is getting lashed out because that's all they deserve. I wish those two will never ever be hired to direct or produce another movie. I wish it to be a lesson. I loved Ghostbusters so much. I loved its fantasy, its humor, its casting and all had been ripped off by those two clowns. That's why i won't watch this movie, never ever. Like when one of our cherished ones is leaving us, I will remember Ghostbusters as the first two movies in addition of the video game they released a few years ago. Dan Aykroyd consider it as the third installment and so do I. So I wont waste any time on this 2016 bad prank. And so should you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Scripts Make Bad Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here are the major problems for the movie. The original Ghostbusters was a vehicle for Bill Murray, nothing more. Murray was a hot commodity coming off Caddyshack and Stripes and a strong supporting performance in Tootsie. If anyone else but Murray had been cast as Peter Venkman, even the original would have bombed. Most of the comedy comes in Murray's slacker/con-man manipulation of the other characters and no one does that better than Bill Murray. He's a guy living off of Government grants for junk science which played very well in 1984 when everyone loved Reagan for calling out Government ineptitude.The new movie is NOT an obvious vehicle for anyone. There is not one person in the movie that has captured the goodwill of movie goers the way Bill Murray had with his previous roles. It's not the concept of an all female Ghostbusters that is making it tank. It's that they annihilated the very recipe that made the first one successful.They actually COULD have made a really funny movie with the female cast. But they needed to make it a clear vehicle for one of them; and they needed to keep with the theme of a cynical con artist gaming the system for her own selfish ends. That was the key element that made the first movie tick. Vinkman didn't believe any of the stuff he was promoting. It was the work of his two assistants who were real scientists that threw him into the world of real ghosts that raised the stakes for Venkman.This is Plot Development 101 and they ignored it completely, opting instead for a preachy SJW plot of "women not being taken seriously by stupid men". THAT's why the movie is going to fail. It's a bad script that disrespects the audience.</fullReview>

It's really sad that good talent in film making is wasted on crap like this, behind the scenes that is, but in front of the camera, there is little, some of the worst characters I have seen in in years, horrible and crude, the costume design is a real let down I have to say, only Kirsten Wigs high heels looked good.Thinking of starting a Kickstarter project to get everyone who paid to see this their money back.Avoid this, sorry, I just can say anything else but the truth on this film.</fullReview>

If you're a fan of the original Ghostbusters, I suspect it won't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A huge Huge HUGE disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like a good movie fan I gave the controversy a very wide berth. Wide eyed and innocently I sat waiting for something fresh and hilarious(kind of like the originals).The first bit was promising, but then it just turned into a sea of derivative pandering cliche's. The humor is awkward, contrived and lacking. Even Melissa mcCarthy(whom I loved in bridesmaids) was a massive let down. This is clearly aimed at fringe feminist elements, and probably not die-hard fans. I felt like I was watching impostors doing a bad impersonation. If Hollywood was trying to make some kind of point they failed miserably. It did not resonate with me, and certainly not with my husband. By the time the inevitable gratuitous shot/ kick/ punch to the jewels had arrived he was cooked and ready to leave. Its a bit like a chef who only eats her/his own cooking, refusing to get any objective opinion.Normally I don't bother writing reviews, but I feel cheated. This was not worth the money we spent. How could they get it so wrong?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is as bad as people thought it would be. Don't believe the positive reviews that have been bought and paid for.Warning some spoilers ahead.The first Ghostbusters HQ is a Chinese restaurant and they don't get the firehouse until the end. Chris Hemsworth becomes possessed in the film and becomes a villain. There are brief cameos by the original cast but they are not playing their old characters. The whole film is basically a really bad SNL spoof of the original 1984 Ghostbusters. The comedy is forced and not funny. The special effects are a huge disappointment considering how much money was spent on the film. All the talk about feminist man hate is true, which explains why the Ghostbusters are women now. Honestly this film is for feminists and all that support the "girl power" movement. The film only uses spoofs of the original Ghostbusters to make a quick buck off people. Save your money this film is a box office dud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the original and the sequel back in the 80's. Both of them were good. If your a fan of the original, don't waste your time or your money on this one.But whoever thought of creating a reboot of Ghostbusters needs to be sent to a lunatic Asylum or Exorcised. Because it was crap.Apart from the special effects and cheap rate gags in it. It doesn't have a great deal going for it. Some of the original cast are in it, but they only play cameos along with other celebrities.A couple of things I did find funny was having Mr and Mrs Slimer driving Ecto 1 as well as the Marshmallow Man in the shape of a balloon.Don't get me wrong, I think having a female cast as the Ghostbusters isn't a bad idea. I felt as though it focus far too much on the comedy (asuming there was any) and far too much CGI. There was hardly any story, in fact it was just boring.My advice would be stick to the original Ghostbusters (1984) and Ghostbusters 2 (1989) and avoid this one like the plague.Harold Ramis must be turning in his grave and would properly rise from it as well, if he ever knew just how crap this one is.</fullReview>

The only funny character in the movie was Chris Hemsworth. AND HE'S NOT EVEN IN THE MOVIE THAT MUCH!!! The special effects are mediocre as hell for what's supposed to be a summer blockbuster. The movie contradicts itself TWICE and it comes to a grinding halt every 15-20 minutes to make a reference to the original source material to try and save itself, which it fails miserably at. And every single male character in this movie is either a complete idiot, an outright douche bag, or an antisocial weirdo in the case of the villain. This wouldn't be a problem if the whole marketing campaign was built around how "all haters are misogynistic men." The hypocrisy is REAL.Ghostbusters 2016 is an unfunny, hypocritical mess of a movie.</fullReview>

It should have been used to show cinema goers and children and women and men that it's OK for women to be leads. I hate this movie. And don't say because I am Male that I am automatically sexist. I genuinely feel sorry for Chris Hemsworth and Sigourney Weaver and Bill Murray and all the talented actors and actresses who were involved in this monster. The Script is awful. 40% of the lines are Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig rambling and bickering on and on and on... 20% is Leslie Jones' Stereotypical Loud Mouthed, "OH HELL NAWWWWWW" Patty. 15% is cameos from Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson,Dan Aykroyd,Sigourney Weaver and Ozzy Osbourne. 15% is Kate McKinnon's weird remarks which leaves you sitting there debating whether to awkwardly laugh or to sit there and think "OK....." The other 10% is lazy unfunny sentences. The acting is appalling. These are talented people and to go and make them do this is just wrong. The CGI reminds me of Grown Ups 2's Deer. This was a movie made to reboot a classic franchise into a more modern era. It just ends up being sloppy and all girl power with no real power.In the words of Comic Book Guy.

		<fullReview>This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and trust me - I've seen a lot of bad movies.You probably saw an Adam Sandler movie once and thought it couldn't be worse. Well, guess what this is on a whole other level of unfunny.Keeping in mind that we're in 2016, the special effects were god- awful. If you have ever watched a sub-5.0 Sci-Fi TV-Show, this should give you a hint of what kind of special effects you should expect. I'd say the directors would probably have been better off hiring my 14 year old son, to do some CGI in Adobe After Effects for a few hundred bucks.The fact that the movie has all female main roles, is not a problem for me. But the fact that every man in this movie is portrayed as either an incompetent idiot or evil, while literally every female in the movie is portrayed as a hero made me want to walk out after the 20 minute mark.!!! SPOILER !!! The movie ends with Melissa McCarthy shooting a big ghost in the groin. This should tell you what kind of anti-male humor you should expect throughout this movie.The fact that any director in the world, would invest just 10 cents in this movie, makes me wonder whether they're in it for the money, or just want to turn their career into a suicidal defeat. I wouldn't even recommend you to watch this movie ironically. Only watch this movie if you have literally nothing else to do, and by this I mean you'd probably have more fun watching a newly painted wall drying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly, as the title says, adding the title of Ghostbusters and adding CGI (not even CGI that is mind-blowing for the time) to this movie does not make it interesting, entertaining, nor even suitable to hold the title Ghostbusters. Whereas the original Ghostusters is a massive hit/cult classic, this movie manages to destroy everything the original stood for. Gone is the witty humor, instead forced pandering based on modern feminism, gone are the down to earth characters, including Winston who was a personal favorite of mine, just a realistic man who was helping out; replaced by a large loud obnoxious woman who completely destroyed the original character. The CGI looks horrible, in comparison to the original which had a measured affect on cinema and on fans alike. I could not name one thing that this movie does better than the original, and along with a director who would not listen to fans, and the atrocious forced acting and script, I wouldn't be surprised if the actors denied the ever took part in this garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off this film comes off like the people involved are trying to prove something to serve some sort of agenda. Like, "look, it worked before and we can do it too."With that being said, that may be the biggest downfall of this movie.If you removed all of the Ghostbusters imagery, no one in their right mind would ever consider this a Ghostbusters movie. This is a generic rehash of the classic formula used as a tool to say "we can do it too."It doesn't work. Instead of being all powerful to the female audience, it ends up falling into the abyss of people saying "I told you so."I actually saw people in the theater shaking their heads during the movie. It was awful.There were a few laughs here and there but most of those came from young children laughing at the fat flops and fall downs.I was a bit insulted with the movie and it's constant ignorant view on men.The special effects were a cartoon mindless mess. I'm guessing they were targeting this towards young children, but PG-13 states otherwise.If their agenda was to empower women, they failed miserably. If you want to empower women, come up with your own idea instead of living in the shadows of a successful franchise created by men. You are just mocking yourselves at this point.The story lacked greatly, in fact, there really wasn't one. This is just a rehash of what we remember from the 80's.The whole movie comes across like a group a fans are "playing" Ghostbuster instead of being one.The cameos were meh. It was cool to see a Ramis statue and Sigourney AFTER the credits rolled, but the cameos played no part in the movie.I walked away learning that Sony used this film as a huge advertising platform. The product placement is just INSANE. The movie plays out like one gigantic commercial for Saturday Night Live. That humor may work well for 3 minutes, but this movie was too long to begin with. Blah.Hemsworth was a saving grace and this is coming from a guy. But even then, he and every other male in the movie were made out to be idiots. God forbid men have feelings too and have every right to call out sexism when we see it.The movie was horrible. This just goes to show you that the powers of the studios and their money can market something intensely in an attempt to make a buck and the product is horrible. It's like they think we are stupid or something.Regret seeing it. Wait for Netflix if you are really that curious, or just check out reviews on YouTube. Those have more humor in them than the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Likes : Right first of all this review is not a reflection of the female casting for the film , it an honest &amp; fair review on the film itself..Judge by the trailer i knew something was off about this film, so i went in to watch this film with low expectation so not to be disappointed , i really wanted this film to higher my expectation &amp; come out the cinema impressed with it to say it was good sadly this doesn't i will explain in dislikes.Its so easy to compare the original Ghostbuster film with this film as a few thing in the film pay homage to certain thing from the original, they didn't do a bad job with the cameos of the original cast , two scene with ghost weren't that bad they were kind of creepy just by the nature of their reaction &amp; manor.As for cast Melissa McCarthy &amp; Kristen Wiig really were the only two to stands out with performance , Leslie Jones &amp; Kate McKinnon do there best to bring comedy to the film with the script they are give but too many flaws in this film that complete drags this film down.The only two to really stood out was Chris Hemsworth play the geek dumb guy &amp; Neil Casey who playing the villain in the film, he stood out as the villain creepy off hinge person hell bent of open a portal to destroy the world which if done better would have been a great film but sadly this was poorly done, there is a end credit scene if your will to stay after the credits roll.Dislikes : Where do i start , i was hoping this film would prove me wrong &amp; actually turn out to be a good film instead it was the most pain film I've ever sat through that i almost walked out on. In all honesty this did not feel like a Ghostbusters film due to it lack of story , there were long scene where they just aren't doing anything &amp; testing equipment instead of having scene like they did with the original film going out &amp; capturing ghosts.Where the comedy? ..........Seriously i mean this is meant to be a comedy the joke were just awful this is the major problem this film had, with the original it was funny because the cast bounce off each other with banter, sadly with this casting just didn't work on screen. This casting might be funny on SNL show with short scene but trying to be funny through a whole film just wasn't the right casting , Kristen Wiig is a good actress but she just hasn't got that comedy in her because she more of a serious role actress &amp; Kate McKinnon was seriously uncomfortable to watch it was like she was trying to force the comedy which made it even worst.(spoiler alert) There is a scene where the villain freezes everyone in what look like a dance scene like the mask but never happened thank god but this scene just felt so out of place wasn't necessary for the film, don't get me start on the scene after with the main villain , the film already lost me attention half way through but that scene just killed the film straight way , because it was like something out of a bad who framed roger rabbit scene.Although some scene with the C.G.I were pretty well done, there are moments with seriously bad green scene effects that just look awful on the screen making seriously obvious that it was green scene that complete lost the shoot of the scene realism. The film as whole felt more like a bad cartoon turn to a poorly made film , because the villain at the end as a seriously rip off of the original stay puff just a more creeper version , it just poorly written with a poor concept story that could have been done better, because i mean the film is meant to be about capturing ghost yet the scene in the new York square contradicts everything the film is meant to be portraying which a bad mistake for the film.All i can say to Sony is don't allow Paul Feig to direct another Ghostbusters film ever again, because this was a very lazy poor attempt at revamp the franchise.4 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie isn't that good. Granted it does have some good legit funny scenes, but it's pretty terrible. The stupid man trope isn't dying anytime soon and the fact that they killed off Bill Murray and the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, oh god. Most of the "humor" is references and the CGI looks REALLY terrible. The weapons and action are cute, but the villain is so obvious, you could just have a arrow saying "he's the villain" So to round up, it has some good scenes and I won't mind buying it on DVD, but the fact that it's got bad comedy, CGI, an obvious villain AND the stupid male character trope, that's it's best to not see this movie.Just go watch the original, it's SO much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay,let's begin,Is Ghostbusters a good film? No. Is Ghostbusters a bad film? Kind of. The first 40 minutes or so I considered to be pretty strong, especially the opening 10 minutes which had me wondering if this was actually going to be good!? So the 'first act' I really enjoyed. Not all the characters pop, but those that do really shine. Chris Helmsworth and Kate McKinnon Im looking at you.Sadly, its all down hill from there. There's more horrible cameos than I care to mention and some terrible cringe moments especially when it comes to music choice for the films soundtrack. DMX "Up in in here", the the terrible band in the concert scene and the butchering of the original theme tune would leave me wincing in my seat.I reckon this film will have a fairly average take when it opens in the US this weekend and then disappear in to the bad remake/reboot garbage pile.Ghostbusters 2? I don't think we'll need to worry about this happening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why did they have to reboot such a good movie? Now every time I mention the name ghost busters, people will think I am talking about this terrible film! Melissa McCarthy, from The Heat, Mike And Molly, and Spy, leads this movie along with Kristen Wiig. Sounds like an okay cast, right? Well, yes, except for Melissa McCarthy. The only good movie she has acted in is Spy, however Spy was mostly saved by Jason Statham. This Ghostbusters "reboot" relies on crude humour, like the movie The Heat offered. Of course, I did not enjoy the movie The Heat, however I was hoping this movie would of been as good as Spy, despite the awful trailer that lowered my expectations of the movie. Unfortunately, this movie made me feel sick, and I kept feeling like the movie was trying to be bad. So far, I would say that this is the worst movie of 2016 so far, and yes, I am serious. But the worst thing is, Rotten Tomatoes actually likes this!! Do not listen to Rotten Tomatoes, because this movie is garbage. You will not laugh at all in this movie, because you will be too busy trying to cover your eyes through out the movie. This movie has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and the sad thing is that this movie is getting positive reviews so far. Do not listen to them! This is just a sexist movie who calls others sexist! Do not watch this movie, unless you have no other choice! DON'T watch it, and instead go watch another movie at the cinema. There is plenty of other good movies on, and I am sure you can survive without this terrible so called reboot. Overall, I rate this 0.9/10, and that is just being nice!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Movie Ever!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review will have some spoilers you have been warned. Ghostbusters 2016 is one of the worst Remakes of all time even worse than Conan the Barbarian the acting is awful from all 4 leading women, the plot makes no sense which i will spoil later as i write this review, the men are all stupid, the soundtrack has nothing to do with this film and dear Paul Feig this movie is not for Harold Ramis because the man has now become a ghost himself running around the world the same goes for Patrick Swayze. Now the cameos except Ernie Hudson and Annie Potts everyone else was painful to watch Bill Murray hates everyone in this film and he acts like he is bored he is basically the reason why a 3rd film never happened, Dan Aykroyd knows pretty much everything about ghosts and he is a goddamn crappy taxi driver and then Sigourney Weaver made me like Alien3 more then we have the classic ghosts from the 1984 film which is Slimer who steals the car and also has a lady slimer and they're both jerks and then Stay Puft Marshmallow Man who is even worse. The villain is one of the worst villains of all time he was bullied and will basically try to bully other's now and for some reason he knows a lot of things about Ghosts and he works in a Hotel makes sense right? Chris Hemsworth was easily the best part of this crappy remake there were some laughs from him some times before it becomes annoying and full retarded and did i forget to mention that the logo turns into a cartoon and then he turns big and he gets shot in the balls which he doesn't have and it hurts him for some reason they even throw Murray out of a window and they never catch the ghosts they kill them for no reason. And the film is not funny except 3 or 4 times that's all and it's stupid it makes no sense the Mayor is retarded he says that the Ghosts were fake a whole goddamn city nobody had a phone? Also the way it's edited the film is wow it goes from a scene where they talk to a scene where they are in their Lab it makes no sense. They even copy Ghostbusters 2 except the Original and if you think this one is better than Part 2 you're stupid i'm sorry you are Terminator Genisys has a 25% and BVS alongside Suicide Squad have a 27% and 26% alike but this one has a fresh rating of 73% what's wrong with this world really? The Fall Out Boy Theme Song is mediocre and the whole soundtrack belongs to some epic film not this one this isn't Ghostbusters it's a stupid parody and what's wrong with all the references to Jaws, Exorcist, Scarface, Batman and even Garfield for the love of god even the product placement all around the city especially Sony they destroyed Spider- Man and now they want to kill Ghostbusters also but thanks to a smart audience the film is a bomb and a sequel is unlikely we hope so also we don't want Zuul you probably will turn him or she in a stupid parody also. Ghostbusters 2016 is even worse than Batman &amp; Robin i give it an F and a 1 out of 10 aww and before i forgot the guns were pretty cool other than that bury this once and for all please Hollywood and Sony we don't want a sequel we got one in 1989 and it was Perfect. Plus the CGI was Mediocre i liked the train station ghost at first but when it started moving it was awful also the dancing part was lame as hell the final battle was mediocre and no i'm not Sexist or Feminist i just want to see a good movie or a reboot in this case movies such as Resident Evil which they aren't perfect and kinda dumb you have a strong woman and the upcoming Wonder Woman that will come out on 2017 sorry Paul Feig but go make Heat 2 or Spy 2 i don't care but leave Ghostbusters alone.

		<shortDescription>So, I saw the same movie 3 times (screen)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As GB2 was too much similar with GB1 and as this GB3 is the reboot of GB1, so it's indeed the 3rd time that I see scientists believing in paranormal expelled from NYC university and doing business busting ghosts, annoying the mayor and saving the city, meeting a giant walking thing in the streets and a big green Slimer! But finally I wasn't bored by the plot but more by the way of telling it: it took ages to bust the 1st ghost and to test the weapons; the following paranormal threat wasn't really gripping, NYC fever wasn't really felt but most of all, this is more an action movie than a comedy! I didn't laugh or smile very much and for sure it's not as acid or funny as the men's team! By the way, their cameo are cool but not as much as the last line of the credits that says for Harold Ramis and honestly, Moranis was much better than this poor Asgardian!On the other hand, I was delightedly surprised that this GB3 was a normal blockbuster without the awful blue / orange grading! Next, the special effects are really good and it's simply unbelievable to see how effects has evolved since 1984. At last, this female team is excellent: I didn't know them but as newcomers, they really act better than some big names as they really personalize their characters: each one has a cool, distinct, detailed character, stays open to those crazy beyond realm and share an excellent chemistry all together!For sure, Jones bashing is totally unjust and stupid but one final note about the sexual orientation of cute Dr Hollzmann, just because it seems to be also the great buzz of the movie: Frankely, the question doesn't really matters and as shown in the movie, it's useless to ask it: at work or between friends, you are together to do the job or to enjoy the moment so you don't really care what others do with consensual adult in their intimacy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really like Paul Feigs previous movies, and I could never believe that this movie was as bad as the Youtube- and blog-commentators thought it should be. Okey, the trailer was probably the worst trailer in Hollywood history, or at least in the last 10 years. But goddamn it, trailers are made by other people than the director! It turned out that Ghostbusters 2016 was a sloppy soup of nonchalant mediocrity, that became insipid after the beginning of the movie and in the end was going straight down the drain. Paul Feig doesn't seem to care a blip about the movie -- the money he got for directing it was probably enough -- and I am sure he and his PR-team at least had a great time with provoking the critics and trolling media with the notion that all is about "anti-feminism" and "racism". One of the biggest points that the critics did beforehand was the ugly racial stereotype written for the role Leslie Jones need to play. This is true -- and it was written by Paul Feig.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The plot made no sense after 30 mins in and this movie upset me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lets begin by saying the ghost busters francise is supposed to be a little bit of sci fi, comedy and action. What we got from this movie was just silly randomness that made no sense what so ever and was like watching hormonal teenagers fight for attention. This movie started off sensible, and for the first 30 min's it was a good movie at a steady plot pace and reveling the story, the first two ghost looked good and you could discover how they came to be. You even started to like the characters up and it was going well until. Jilian Holtzman ( plays female Egon ) kept making up stupd weapons like, the ghost chipper, or the ghost laser trap, the ghost hand gun, the ghost nuke, the ghost grenade etc etc. and the time it takes her to make these are instantaneous yet while make all of these she didn't think mmm where will I keep caught ghost, until the very end of the movie when its all over, her character was attention grabbing in the plot made it seem like she did all the science work. The new ghostbusters where like children playing in the park, during they film they appear to be having fun and shouting this is great. at no point in this film did they care about harming each other , there is a scene where one ghostbuster is firing the proton blaster and flapping through the air like a deflating balloon while the dangerous blast destroys the backdrop while the remaining crew sits there smiling with stupid looks on their faces not at all worried they are about to die at any point and its like that after half way in. Spoler warning:For some reason this random bellboy dies and becomes god where he can control anyone by possession then control all of mankind with a single click of his finger holding them as long as he feels, yet when the ghost busters show up he lets them defeat him. NO SENSE AT ALL.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>does it live up to the hate???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, the Ghostbusters reboot that has been hated on since before it even got a chance. The hate for this film was very evident since back when we first got to see the trailers for this film, which was of course not very good. But how is the actual film? The thing to make clear of is that there is nearly no way that this could ever surpass the originals but there is also no way that it deserves the amount of hate that it has deserved.I think that Ghostbusters was a good time actually, lots of funny scenes and a story that is quite alright. Unlike the original the two main members of the team were a lot less interesting instead the supposed "supporting" members of the team were very well realized, Kate McKinnon's Holtzman was really great in this film and so is Lesly Jones' Patty. Also I must add that Chris Hemsworth was actually quite funny in his role as the 'receptionist', Chris Hemsworth is really funny as this really stupid guy. Along with pretty great characters and chemistry between the characters we also got great visuals and action sequences. An issue that I do have is that this film seems to be pushing this whole all female team thing too hard. All the male characters in this film are either bad people in general or total idiots, now I think that it is perfectly fine to have a female team of ghostbusters but there shouldn't be a need for villainising all males and making it seem like the film has some sort of grudge towards men. Which could've been in my opinion why it has received so much hate.Now this isn't the best movie ever but I would say that I had quite a good time watching this remake of Ghostbusters and despite its targeting of men whether on purpose or not the hate that it has received is definitely way too much more than it deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank god: not a sequel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The more you know the less you can enjoy... So let's watch this movie being completely ignoring the past...We get a great opening, a nice plot, some cool visual, good music, good laughs, a catchy movie from the first to the very last second. Quite entertaining!My biggest problem with it? The media and marketing! All the trailers I had seen would have prevented me from watching this one. Clips felt boring and forced and cold. Same goes for reviews and interviews... It's like this project was doomed to not stand on its own feet.In detail: The acting feels often wooden and the timing overstretched. Maybe the director was aiming at the the cast's stand-up qualities? Too much ad lib? The development of the main plot was a little under motivated. Questions like "why?" or "how?" shouldn't be asked. So the final act falls behind its visuals...Something about taste: All female cast + Kevin... maybe overdone, maybe done just right. Up until here, the movie could easily deserve a 7/10!Now let's include our memories of the old ones: Many things and motives are simply similar to the old movies, so you can't help but to get a "been there done that"-feeling... maybe this justifies the tone of the all female cast and "Kevin". Since there are so many things that have to be repeated, why not focus on other aspects of the group dynamics. Accepting this, many of the negative reviews simply fade away as a bare expression of taste mixed with the unwillingness for an open mind. People hate exactly two things: when something changes and when nothing changes at all. ;) All cameos felt just right and I enjoyed them all! Though I cannot help it but to feel that Bill Murray simply hated being involved. Still I loved his part. Paranormal cameos: also nice!Still one of the better movies I watched this year!Let's express some hope here: Maybe this was just a story to kick off some franchise so the story and motives will be explained in a sequel... maybe there is a good explanation for Kevin, too? On the other hand: this is the feeling I had after seeing Matrix2 and part 3 didn't do much of the needed connecting or answering...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite the juvenile internet backlash, much better than expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When original Ghostbusters creators teamed with director Paul Feig to reboot the Ghostbusters franchise, there was little reaction on the internet. Largely because despite a tepid 1989 sequel, there is a lot of juice in the Ghostbusters canon. However, when Feig and company announced that the new Ghostbusters would be played by four comediennes, the internet erupted immediately into a juvenile frenzy comprised of outraged man-babies who apparently felt the original would now be forever soiled by this all-female GB team infecting it with girl cooties or something, withering misogynists who turned every movie site talk back section on the internet into a toxic spill filled with profane words describing the women in the cast and "traitor" Paul Feig, and those "high-minded" people who were only now so incensed by Hollywood's effort to remake/reboot everything (something that has been going on for generations...hello!), who hoped all would overlook that suspiciously only this particular film was the target of their rage. And all of this was before a single frame of film was shot.After all the rage, withering commentary, sexist profanity, attempts to undermine the film at every turn, and assorted vapors by aged geekboys taken to the fainting couch, how does the film actually stack up? Surprisingly well. Is it in the same class as the original Ghostbusters? Hardly. Nothing could possibly have the impact of the original which was a surprise success in its day. That said, this film certainly has enough genuine laughs to rank it a success, it has a strong cast and it is much better than the pleasant but thunderingly disappointing sequel that the original Ghostbusters cast and crew reunited to perpetrate in 1989.Professor Kristen Wiig discovers to her horror that former associate/friend parapsychologist Melissa McCarthy has released their little known ghost-hunting novel online which could jeopardize her tenure. When trying to convince her to remove it, Wiig gets dragged into a ghost-hunting expedition that ruins her tenure, revives her passion for the paranormal and throws her back together with McCarthy and oddball techno geek Kate McKinnon. As they investigate increased phenomena around Manhattan, they are joined by NYC subway worker Leslie Jones and dim receptionist Chris Hemsworth.The story hits many of the same beats as the original, but works best when not being slavish to the original. There are moments that are on-the-mark funny, moments that you wish were funnier and moments that just don't work, but there are enough successes to push it over. Ironically, the film works best remedying two minor nuisances from the original. First, whereas the original was dominated solely by Bill Murray and squandered the guys playing the other Ghostbusters, this version spreads the material out evenly, allowing everyone to have their moments and have just enough to do. Second, having a main villain, a sort of a Ghostbuster gone bad responsible for the paranormal disasters, is inspired.The visual effects are well done and incorporated quite nicely. Perhaps not as dazzling as the original, but much better than the ho-hum effects of Ghostbusters II. The opening sequence at the haunted house and a later sequence in a bathroom are actually rather creepy considering this is a comedy.The cast is uniformly good, but there are those that fare better than others. Wiig and McCarthy pretty much play the whole thing straight. In particular, McCarthy seems oddly restrained and one keeps waiting for the moments where her character really has an explosive comedic moment that never comes. By contrast, Jones and McKinnon are having a ball. Unlike Ernie Hudson's extra wheel Ghostbuster that never had anything to do, Jones comes into the action early, is incorporated quite well in with the other team members and bring a lot of energy, comic chops and pizazz to her part. Her reactions are often priceless, my favorite being when she walks into the room of mannequins while hunting a ghost. McKinnon creates a character all her own. Sporting an oddball hairdo, bizarre glasses and an attitude that seems to indicate that she is joining us from a higher consciousness, McKinnon capably walks off with the film. This is the kind of performance one suspects Harold Ramis would have given if he (and Aykroyd) were not so busy lavishing everything funny to do on Murray in the original. Truthfully, if they spun Jones and McKinnon off into their own film, I would not be upset. Also worth mentioning is Hemsworth's performance as the sole male in the group. Hemsworth undoubtedly had enough clout to do anything, but kudos for taking such a change-of-pace. As Kevin, the sublimely incompetent receptionist, Hemsworth seems to be channeling the ingenious cluelessness of Gracie Allen. His lack of social graces, issues with answering the telephone and puppy dog energy of being one with the Ghostbusters team, combine to make an endearing and fun character. Plus his over-the-credits dance mix while possessed is one the film's highlights. Contrary to naysayers, this is not a one-note beefcake part (in fact Hemsworth is refreshingly dorky here), but rather a pu pu platter of comic riches. I also must admit that I found Andy Garcia's turn as the ridiculously upbeat, glad-handing mayor rather amusing as well. Although his thunderous reaction when Wiig tells him not to be "like the mayor in Jaws" belies the jerk that lies beneath. There are also nice cameo bits from the original cast, with my favorites being Bill Murray as an obnoxious paranormal debunker and Sigourney Weaver as McKinnon's mentor.After a bit of a slow start, the film hits its stride fairly quickly and stays with it. What problems arise are easily fixable for potential sequels (if there are any). This end result is no classic, but is most definitely a fun and feel-good summer flick. Those wanting to be upset about the defiling of the original Ghostbusters actually have more cause to direct that enmity towards its unfunny 1989 sequel than this promising reboot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, i am not a sexist or anything even close. I love women. they are great ;) For this movie, i went in really hoping it would surprise me! Okay, lets start!!! I loved some of the comedy, i laughed more than a few times! And i felt like i was on a ride with it all!!!The ONLY things that let the movie down were the lack of consistency in one of the lead actresses, i don't remember her name, but it's the blonde one. She was so out of tune and her acting was very up and down. I couldn't get into her character, and it ruined the movie for me. One second she is dancing around and being fun and weird and loving.. the next she is apparently some crazy gunslinger who can do all these cool action scenes.. and then finally (Thing that completely ruined it) she tried to be disconnected and intrusive when she does her toast. I don't know if it was a joke or whatever, but as a normal viewer (no professional opinion here) of the movie, her acting kept me from enjoying the movie. While i did like the comedy, not all of it was really that funny, some of it felt like it was trying too hard, and a lot of the movie was just trying to bask in the previous two cult classics. In my opinion, seeing the old characters come back was cool... But very forced. I would have loved the movie a lot more if this movie was a sequel, and we got to see some of the original characters play small roles in helping these girls become better Ghostbusters.. Dunno people, this is my first review, and it probably isn't helpful! I would recommend seeing the movie though so you can make your own judgment on it. And hey, 5/10 isn't bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The disappointment from a fave original!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK so like most of today's films in the 00-10's are bad remakes of the once successful 80's classic!!They typically feature a "funny cast" and/or the "actor/actress of the moment" . we all know Kevin Heart would have been all up in this movie had it been a male cast!However, I did enjoy Chris H and Leslie J, bringing some fresh and slightly unexpected comedy to this movie. And even though I deeply love both Mell M &amp; Kristen W. remakes are becoming the 3rd American Pie the Wedding, which of course was terrible. This Ghostbusters was highly anticipated by me as I LOVE all the originals and I like most of the casts past movies.Unfortunately the best parts for me were the guest appearances from the original cast - like Bill M, Ernie H &amp; Annie P.This movie is a decent watch, out of the Cinema or if you're in your 20's and never seen the original.Ghostbusters in 1984, however poor in technical and visual appearance, will always be a fave of mine.But I do plead that NO-ONE and I mean NO-ONE, EVER, EVER try and do a remake of The Goonies as you will fail. Take that from every 90's kid, you WILL FAIL!! and we will hate you forever.... just saying!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to see the latest version of Ghostbusters because of the who-ha that surrounded the release. Actually who-ha ensued prior to the release just based on rumor and casting. I wanted to like it because there is no reason talented people can't make a good movie switching gender roles from male to female. The actors involved are all talented and quite funny in other material. McCarthy, Wiig, Jones, McKinnon, they're all great. I could spend hours going over just how funny these people are and how much entertainment they've provided me. I am in awe. I also really didn't like the personal attacks, especially on Jones, who is funny, talented, well spoken and well, zany. She's a special talent and has the ability to command the screen whenever she's on it (SNL wise). It makes me sick to think people are still being attacked because of their race, size or any other physical characteristic that people want to jump on to belittle them. Not cool. So I really wanted to like this movie. Yeah, if you don't like the movie, you're sexist, etc., right? Right. AND revisionists have said that hey, the 1984 movie wasn't all that good anyway. Right? Anybody who has been overly critical of this movie's comparison to the original doesn't realize the original wasn't very good anyway. But no. My wife and I watched this one and went back and re-watched the original and no. This movie isn't very good and the original is charming and fun. There are many, many reasons for that but suffice it to say: No reason not to see this remake other than it isn't very good. If you are curious, go see it. I would recommend waiting until it comes out on DVD or to Netflix to satisfy your curiosity. Having said that, I would recommend anybody who didn't particularly like the movie to refrain from character assassination of the actors. They didn't write the script, direct or produce the effects. They hit the lines and said the words. Sometimes its magic and sometimes it ain't but god-bless them for trying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Below Average and Bafflingly unfunny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: the behind the scenes stuff has ZERO effect of my watching of the film.First I will say some good things about this film so that I don't get accused of having "ulterior motives" (BTW, if you haven't seen the film, don't rate it, no matter how bad it looks).1. I laughed twice in the film 2. I was fine with the look of the ghosts and gadgets, the CGI people are having fun and are compensating for Feigs' lack of directorial skill. 4. Slimer was great and used appropriately and I didn't mind his Girlfriend at all. 5. The horror parts were effective and handled with respect. Now to the bad stuff...I am incredibly surprised at the lack of jokes. When there ARE jokes, they are repeated too many times and go on for 3 times what they should due to actors improv e.g Hemsworth covering his eyes, the spitting coffe, wontons, the "body in the back of the car" scene, the "Cat out of the bag" scene and the Patrick Swayze bit. When they aren't doing repetitive jokes, they are doing old, stale ones you've seen a million times before, including crotch shots, a man screaming like a woman, middle finger jokes, low blood sugar jokes and fart/queef jokes. I also hate this "stating the obvious" humour where the actors spell out the jokes after said joke is complete, not only do those happen literally dozens of times, but there are at LEAST a dozen unfunny movie references, not through visuals (Feig is a terrible visual director, he is honestly one of the least talented and unambitious directors in Hollywood) but through the actors mentioning films from the past as if that will earn them brownie points. The reviews praised McKinnon and Hemsworth, but I honestly found them the worst parts. McKinnon's Mugging to the camera reminded me of a teenage guy trying to make his friends laugh in a school drama skit. Hemsworth's is the dumb character we've seen on every bad TV comedy in the last 40 years, yet somehow worse. I found myself pretty bored due the excruciatingly slow pace. There are far too many scenes where the pacing is thrown out because the editors keep chucking in out-of-place improvisations, couldn't decide which ones were best, so they kept them all in. The villain is just a walking blob of exposition. Not only is it contrived that he doesn't just kill all the GBs in one click of his fingers, but he chooses the form of the destructor? This confuses me because they want Gozer in the next film. The music wasembarrassing, when it wasn't cookie cutter score, it was horrific covers of the ghostbusters theme. The cameos were all bland and didn't add to the film, though Murray's obvious lack of enthusiasm was wonderful to watch. The ending was a mess, it was overblown, impossible CGI schlock that reminded me of Superman 64, where the developers just surrounded everything in smoke so they didn't have to animate anything complex. It looked like Feig was trying too hard to do the whole "GURL POWER" thing and forgot to add humour to his action scenes like an Edgar Wright or a Miller/Lord film would. The film also ends almost mid-sentence on Ernie Hudson's cameo but then the film carries on during the credits when it could have easily had those beforehand? I am honestly baffled that this less than average broad comedy got a 73% on RT, yet I guess I can't be too surprised when trash like "The Night Before" and "Central Intelligence" get good reviews. If you look at this film objectively, it lacks any ambition or originality. How to fix this film: Get rid of Feig, he has never been a good director, he is interchangeable with Apatow, Stoller, Dennis Dugan and a hundred other broad comedy directors. He adds nothing in the way of visual comedy and neither does the editing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nope. Not worth the hate.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying you can make a movie that promotes female equality, have strong female roles, and be a nostalgic pander-fest... while still being a competent movie.Really, the only reason this exists is to appeal to two types of people. The first is radical feminists (god damn, they really seem to ruin everything, do they?), and the other is a small percent of people that wanted another Ghostbusters movie. The first will be the people that will give the movie a 10/10 on sight, without looking at the movie in any kind of depth (or they'll just say "this isn't how women are"). The other group would be very displeased with how it turned out, with bad special effects and somewhat bland humor. So it comes down to the people who don't fall into either of those people, or the 90%, to figure it out and decide whether or not the movie was bad. And surprise surprise, the movie is pretty bad. Not absolute garbage, but pretty bad.I will give it credit where the small amount of credit is due: every... half hour or so, there was a joke that was actually funny. But I sat through many minutes beforehand not laughing, but instead cringing. The CGI is bad. The characters are unlikable. Heck, I hate the whole idea behind the characters: gender-swap the cast, then dumb down everyone who was swapped to be a male, like the secretary. Good lord the secretary was stupid. Come on people, I know you're trying to appeal to those dastardly radical feminists, but at least TRY and make relate-able, likable characters. Just try.Don't waste your time ranting about this one, just leave it be and ignore it. It'll fade into obscurity, and nobody will bring it up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complete Cinematic Indifference</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cut to a city wide climatic ghost battle in final act of the film where Kate McKinnon's character is tooled up with a variety of cool ghost battling weapons and that classic Ghostbusters music score is in full force whilst she dispatches ghost retribution and you go 'yes this is awesome' it's just a shame that was the only time I got really excited whilst watching this film.Yes I'm a massive fan of the original film but I'm one of the few who was actually hoping it would be positive and surprise me as too many people had criticized it before it even got onto our screens.Now having watched it I'm left in a state of complete indifference as to what I've just seen, a lot was made about the casting of this group of female actresses/comedians but the problem isn't the sex of our leads and more to the point of whether the film encapsulates the spirit of the original films and to another more simpler point of whether it's funny or not, with my overall input being 'it had it's moments' but it is in no way worthy of me shouting praise its way with it be just so inconsistent.Now I will admit I've had indifference with Paul Feig directed films before, I watched Bridesmaids after a lot of hype therefore I was always going to be left disappointed, on the other hand Spy really did surprise me with how much I enjoyed it, so I've had both ends of the scale, so maybe Paul Feig's, Kristen Wiig's and Melissa McCarthy's type of humour is not always going to appeal to me, it's interesting because I thought the pieces of humour that worked better were provided by Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon, although even McKinnon had plenty that just didn't hit their mark. The Chris Hemsworth attractive idiot character was funny to a point but is was walking a shaky tightrope of gender ethics, I mean if it was a dumb but attractive woman in his place it would probably be derided in the media, but then again that situation has occurred way too many times at the expense of women in the history of cinema that you kind of almost forgive this representation of the beautiful idiot as a piece of retrospective (if unintentional) gender revenge.The film actually opened pretty well giving a great feel of the old films, the story narrative really isn't too dissimilar to the original and is actually pretty solid structurally but the question does have to be raised in regards to these reboots or sequels...if they are so similar to the original films why not go back to that source material and watch that instead? It's a harsh point of view but in the last year I've watched the likes of Jurassic World, Independence Day: Resurgence and now Ghostbusters with the thought of 'I really wish I was watching the original' and this is not because the new film was particularly bad but purely because it's constantly reminding you of them and how much you enjoyed them therefore creating the tone of indifference of which I talk about in reference to the films I mentioned.Talking about being reminded of the old film, I have to mention the cameos, was it me or did they just feel weird? I kind of expected the Dan Aykroyd one given the amount of effort he had exerted in trying to get a new Ghostbusters film to the screen but more confusing is the Bill Murray one which is really a small supporting part given he appears in two scenes during the film but I suppose I shouldn't try to understand the enigma that is Bill Murray.As I alluded to with my opening paragraph I feel this was without doubt a missed opportunity for the filmmakers to have made something that could have really connected with a sense of absurd blockbuster fun that was different from the plethora of superhero films that are currently dominating the cinematic landscape.So what do Ghostbusters (2016) and Independence Day: Resurgence share in common other than an acting Hemsworth brother?...my complete cinematic indifference.</fullReview>

It has a slightly misandric tone to it too which feels really out of place. And the in-joke stabs at YouTube commenters make the filmmakers appear childish, small minded and petty. No professional film-making here.On a positive note; the character animation was actually very well done, Slimer in particular. But it's really unfortunate that the (clearly very skilled) animators had to beautifully animate very dumb ideas. Oh well.Kristen Wiig, imo, is the world's funniest living actress. I'm laughing before she even speaks, she owns my funny bone. But she cannot elevate this film. I feel it is beneath her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The very definition of a thoroughly average so-so film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something strange in the neighborhood, who you gonna call?Well, not Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, or Ernie Hudson anymore (although all of them make cameos throughout, even Ramis who passed away in 2014).This time around, we have new actresses taking the same types of roles as the original. The role of Peter Venkman, that of a serious and skeptical scientist who eventually comes around, is now played by Kristen Wiig's Erin Gilbert. Ray Stantz's true believer role is now Melissa McCarthy's Abby Yates. Kate McKinnon's Jillian Holtzman is the new Egon Spengler, the tech genius and socially awkward. Finally, Winston Zeddemore's down-to-earth realist role is now Leslie Jones's Patty Tolan.Plot-wise, honestly if you saw the first Ghostbusters film or the second one, a lot of the points are going to be copy-pasted from there. That's not the real issue here.What matters is the humor and the chemistry between the cast members, and that's why this is such a so-so film. The hate and stupidity that was spewed on the film's trailer like so much ectoplasm is just that: stupid, because these women do work well together in their respective roles. The only sexism at work is in good spirits and no, this film won't end up being the shining beacon of radical feminists, if that's what they were afraid of.What's bothersome, though, is the chemistry seems forced and some roles work better than others. In the original, it was supposed to be a team effort but everyone eventually was drawn to Bill Murray, and he ended up stealing every scene he was in. This time around, it seems like the same thing was supposed to happen with Wiig's character Erin but ended up happening to McKinnon's Holtzman. Honestly, this movie could have used more Holtzman throughout, McKinnon's performance was excellent. The pace of this movie also feels a bit incongruous; at times it's an action movie, others a horror movie, almost nowhere does it feel like a true comedy. The humor rarely feels natural, and more times than it should the jokes get stretched too far when they weren't all that funny to begin with.In short. This is not a terrible film. This is not a great film either. It has its moments, certainly there's enough to make the experience enjoyable, but overall it just feels... average. No doubt, though, the next generation of Ghostbusters fans will grow up with this film and see it as the norm, and that's neither a good or bad thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>more Girl Power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My husband wanted to see this, and I said I wasn't interested because my impression was it was a feminist Girl Power vehicle. And only girls in a movie is boring to me. But he wanted to go so we did. And we both didn't like it.Something that I don't see mentioned much in these other reviews bothered both of us - the movie acted like the other two Ghostbusters had NEVER happened. Now I'm assuming that a lot of the people who went to this movie are very familiar with the original two, and a third sequel would make more sense. But to completely erase the first two in favor of a reboot was annoying. There were cameos of three of the original four and a bust of the late Ramos, but they were TOTALLY different characters! I would expect their original Ghostbuster characters to be retired and they show up to advise the new crew or something. And the only heterosexual relationship that remotely happened was Kristin W's lusting after the clueless beefcake male receptionist. And that went nowhere. Just as well because he was an idiot.Ironically, in order to somewhat follow what's happening, you have to know some of what happens in the original movies. But then you don't want to consider the original movies because then you're wondering why the heck this third Ghostbuster isn't a continuation?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the few honest reviews of a terrible movie - Wait for it on Bluray</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie deserves a solid 5/10. Only because it is a high budget film with good talent, and I personally found the CGI entertaining. Yes, its cartoony, but I'm not looking for super realistic avatar level CGI. As someone who grew up with 90s CGI, I'm not too picky.The jokes? Well, they made me cringe and uncomfortable. Poor joke writing, poor dialogue, slow moving story, boring, yawned frequently during the movie. Let's put it this way. I was more comfortable and laughed more at Pixels (that horribly reviewed Adam Sandler movie). In fact, Pixels was at least 1-2 stars better than this.There are moments of excitement and some good Chris Hemsworth humor, so it really does deserve a 5/10. It's not a B-movie, but its still pretty bad. Felt like I wasted my time and money.Keep in mind there is an unfortunate psychological situation going on with the reviews of this movie. First, everyone trolled it with 1 star. I don't believe any movie in existence with a budget this high and actors this famous deserves 1 star. It's just not fair. But then, on the other side of the spectrum you have people giving it 7-10 stars ONLY to counter the 1 stars. So I think if everyone was being honest and unbiased, this movie would be a true 5/10.Also, I've noticed its very suspicious that the "10 star" reviewers for this movie are people who haven't reviewed any movies before on IMDb. Almost makes you think they are paid by the studio just to post false reviews. Who knows. Maybe I'm just paranoid.</fullReview>

I don't remember laughing much at all and I can't remember any especially good scenes. The cameos by Mr Murray and Mr Ackeroyd are kind of cool--they are two truly unique talents. The main villain is lame, the ghosts aren't all that, the soundtrack is unmemorable--sort of the opposite of the original Ghostbusters.

We decided to see this movie when nothing else in theater really peaked our interest (so many children's movies are out!). I went in without high hopes since I LOVED the O.G. movies. It started off slow, I couldn't stand Kate McKinnon's character and thought.. this will be a lonnnnggg 2 hours. Once things got heated up and they did their first trek the movie took off. I found it funny, entertaining and really not that bad. I found Kate McKinnon's character entertaining, Wiig and McCarthy OK, but Chris Hemsworth, absolutely sold the movie to me. Not only was he amazing eye candy but his character hilarious! Leslie Jones annoyed me a bit but it was her character that read "token black person". They could've done without her the same as Ernie Hudson, only difference is they really stereotyped her I thought. The cameos were also pretty amazing. In the end, wasn't worth my $16 3D experience, plus $20 in snacks but I would recommend someone to check it out when available on Netflix.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The kids version of Ghostbusters nobody asked for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paying no heed to the gender politics dominating every discussion of this movie, I walked into the theater open-minded with unloaded expectations, prepared to receive a new take on a classic, or so I thought. I was ready to leave the original safely on the shelf, always there whenever I need a fix. I was ready for something new. But what I was not ready for was a children's movie. And that, sadly, is what Ghostbusters 2016 is. For the kids.Though a lifetime fan of the 1984 original, I have laughed at the works of each of the new Ghostbusters, mostly on Saturday Night Live. Jones, Wiig, and McKinnon are hilarious (not a fan of McCarthy, I'll admit). I was ready to embrace this new cast. But as the story unfolds, the jokes consist of seemingly unscripted and unfunny ad-lib banter (if those were written, God help us), and it becomes clear there is no humor in this cast's chemistry. Each scene moves the story along, then offers a few seconds for mechanically forced jokes. The story gets lost in the vast number of terrible quips, many of which consist of fart jokes. That running wanton soup joke gets worse with every iteration.But the worst of it is Chris Hemsworth's Kevin. I figured the moronic receptionist would get a joke or two, then recede to the background. How wrong I was. I laughed when it's revealed Kevin is not wearing lenses in his glasses, then the film rapid-fires dumb-Kevin joke after dumb-Kevin joke. I was done laughing. The problem: Chris Hemsworth is not funny. Not at all. He is the least funny thing about this movie. Worse, as the story progresses, Kevin becomes central to the plot. He is inescapable and ultimately ruins the movie.The lackluster first three-quarters of plot-and-jokes repetition offers little ghostbusting, and what's there is uninteresting. A lot of time is wasted on seeing the new Ghostbuster tools in the design stage (for sake of bad jokes, of course) rather than the team actually using them. But when the finale arrives, the action perks up, and the film becomes tepidly entertaining...in its last 20 minutes. And the villain? I won't discuss him, not because I don't want to spoil the plot, but because there's nothing interesting to say.During one of the movie's fart jokes, I heard a cackle of laughs from the pee-wee audience members. That's when it hit me: Ghostbusters 2016 was made for the kids. And that's fine. The original, though with loads of adult humor, was huge with kids. It'd make sense to calibrate this film to a kid's simple sense of humor. If only they'd have marketed it that way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Today I finally went and watched Ghostbusters...Spoiler Alert!To be fair it is a lot better than the awful trailer made it out to be.It starts very good.The four characters are interesting and quite likable.Kevin is quite funny in the movie.The writers really, well and truly missed the perfect opportunity to introduce these characters better. Instead of having Holtzman's character have Weaver as her mentor and have it in the end credit scenes...why not have her as Egon, Ray or Peter's protegee. or relative Hudson is Patty's Uncle...fair enough...but why not have Hudson's Winston character be her Uncle?More to the point, when they did not want to be compared to the original or be a sequel why bother with the original cast cameos...just utterly pointless. I am not to sure what to make of this movie.The characters were likable and there was some really good parts in the movie but the humour and overall story line just wasn't that great. In some instances it did feel a bit like a parody movie.The villain was really boring and uninteresting. Is it great? No. Is it as bad as I thought it would be? No. Could it better? Yes.The concert scene is a really wasted opportunity. A cringe worthy scene of the band playing followed by a brief cameo appearance from Ozzy Osbourne saying he is having a flash back. Why not just have Ozzy and his band on stage? That would have been far better.Having every male character and even some other females be stupid really did the film no favors.After the final battle the ending really, really drags on.How could this movie have been better? Maybe not have an all female cast. Have a bit of diversity. Not rely so much on humour, such type as it is. Remember the original movies were sci-fi movies with comedy, not a comedy with sci-fi movie. Base it after the events in Ghostbusters 2 instead of wasting so much screen time with them investigating making the equipment etc. Consider how unrelated it is to the originals just don't waste time with original cast cameos.Believe it or not I will say I enjoyed this movie A LOT more than Batman v Superman!This movie had some good parts but quite a lot of silly faults that hold it back. I don't love it, I don't hate it, it's a fun enough okay movie. But it is frustrating at what a wasted opportunity this movie. Strange humour, to much reliance on jokes, a needlessly long introduction and boring villain really hold it back.The portrayal of every male and even some other females as being really stupid also does the film no favors.These faults are nothing to do with the cast or the female cast, just a problem of the writing and directing.3.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS FOR A FEW PUNCHLINESKate McKinnon and Leslie Jones are worth the price of admission. McKinnon's Jillian Holtzmann has the confidence (the brazen flirtation with Erin) and smart-mouthed one-liners ("Jillian Holtzmann, Radio Times") of Peter Venkman and is as comfortable with the Aykroyd-ian techno-jargon as Ramis and even Aykroyd himself. People who have only seen the trailers believe that Jones plays a one-note black stereotype. True, she says "Oh, hell no!" at one point, but that's only at one point. In the rest of her screen time, she has knowledge of New York City minutiae that the other characters don't: "That's where that ghost came from. That location has a lot of bad history surrounding it."Jones and McKinnon are also the only two leads whose performances felt grounded in reality. Venkman, et al were believable as real people with real quirks, while Erin, Abby, and many supporting characters (the tour guide in the opening scene and the dean of the institute in particular) come across as characters in an "SNL" sketch, saying things real people wouldn't say unless they were trying to get a laugh.This brings up another point: many of the jokes were funny (the cab driver inexplicably knowing exactly what kind of ghosts are surrounding his cab), but had unfunny tags attached ("I ain't afraid of no ghosts"). Further, and as in many of Feig's recent productions, the jokes often went on too long ("He soiled himself").But then there's the awesome climactic fight scene in Times Square. More than just standing still and shooting lasers, the Ghostbusters kick butt and wipe the floor with their adversaries, Holtzmann especially.Most importantly, though, is how iconoclastic the film is. It shows the strength of friendships between women, doesn't sexualize any of the female characters, and doesn't try to define any of them by the romantic relationship they're in. In comparison, Dana Barrett was defined by being a love interest to Venkman, and "needed" to have a sheer dress draped sexily over her at the end while Louis was only slightly ravaged. In the meantime, the one male lead of this film was a pretty-boy moron clearly there for his looks. Sounds a lot like the token women in '80s films.Final thoughts: I enjoyed the movie. The original "Ghostbusters" is not some holy text. Balloon ghosts? Like ghosts of balloons?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not even funny enough to be a D movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ghostbusters is a movie that should not have been made. It is one of those movies that are so hard and painful to watch because deep down you know it should have been great. This movie is nothing but a cash grab, plain and simple. It's an insult to the previous movies, especially the cameos that were incorporated. Almost all the cameos felt force and added nothing to the film. They were better off making a direct sequel than a reboot. I have no problem with an all- female cast, just write the movie better and have a cast that more fits the roles written. Bits and pieces are enjoyable but not enough to make it a hit. Individual characters are written all in the same vein with nothing to differentiate between one another. A blockbuster no, a one-time watch, way yes, painful one at that. This movie could have been good. Just dial down the dumb comedy, do a better story that gives a more meaningful reason to get together and fight these paranormal elements. Probably the most important character, have a well written villain and a talented actor to portray him or her. This movie has the worst villain and story to go along with. It's not even funny enough to be a D movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To start with i don't hate this film because it's an all female lead cast, i hate this film because it's just a bad film.When i heard three or four year ago there was plans to make a 'new Ghostbusters film' with female leads, i cringed. When i saw the initial Trailers, i felt embarrassed for them and eventually i decided to stream this film( i'd refuse to pay ) and all my fears were realised.I detest this fixation in recent years of taking old Films and rebooting them and i'd love this one to be the one to break the Camels back. To essentially take a classic film, and attempt to reinvent it is lazy film making, to take that classic and swap a male lead cast for a female one is a sad indictment of today's society, where everything has to be Politically Correct and inline with this Third Wave Feminism which is sweeping majestically across the Universe.This Film is poor on many levels. The script is awful, the jokes are lame, unfunny and all too obvious. The Cast are terrible. They're just not funny, regardless of whether they were Male or Female - It says it all when the funniest one is Hemsworth who, lets face it, isn't known for his Comedy roles. The Females almost stumble through their lines, their ability and delivery of this lame material is boring and from what i've seen of them in the past, typecast. The Story is a clumsy reworking of the originals and nowhere near as engaging. The original had its faults, it wasn't a perfect Film but it had a storyline. This has a loose storyline which is far to stupid for words. They've added a few nods to the originals, obviously in an attempt to garner a bit of support from fans of those films but even these are handled clumsily and lazily, seemingly thrown in randomly just for the sake of it.They went all out for joke after joke after joke, making the Film seem like a near 2 hours of the worst stand up in the history of stand up. Almost every line is a set up followed by a punchline, followed by another set up....... Yet the jokes just aren't funny and Wiig in particular has such a dire delivery of lines ( in anything i've seen her in), always unsure, mouse like, shy, retiring. It's all fair enough if the character calls for it, but here she's meant to be a Professor and therefore presumably intelligent, not a shrinking, oppressed Secretary too scared to voice her opinion.I found it hard to believe that these four Women are actually Comedians and from what i understand, they're well thought of Comedians. That is a terrifying thought. I know funnier Women than these four who work down the local Supermarket and naturally funny, unforced.As other reviews have touched on,every Male character in this Film was either braindead or Mr Evil. The Women held the power and obviously so. This was an extremely lame attempt at 'Girl Power' which for me, only resulted in denting the true Feminists stance. It's time for the White Knight who is Paul Feig to climb on his trusty mount and ride off into the Sunset with the four leads in shackles being dragged behind him while wearing only Loin Cloths.This is a travesty of a mockery of a sham.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what It could of been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I'll say I loved the original Ghostbuster's movies. They were original, fun to watch, had a funny story, and I understood where they were going during the course of the film. This movie was totally opposite, I didn't understand where the movie was trying to take me. I didn't get why the characters had to yell their dialog through most of the movie. I also don't think these characters where developed much. I think their motivation was simply "you're hunting ghosts". The jokes were not funny at all, it was as if this screenplay was written in a weekend and then touched up a month or so before production. I guess we now know that you can't always succeed with comedians in a comedy. Isn't that ironic that even when using comedians the production team still couldn't make this movie funny. I guess you could say it was like an episode of Saturday Night Live, the non funny years. The bad acting really came out and I've often noticed that any movie that Chris Hemsworth is in aside from Thor really sucks. Hacker, sucked. In The Heart of The Sea, sucked. Red Dawn, sucked. Dude take an acting class, one with feeling, you can't always get by with your looks. Also on a side note, the costumes in this remake were not that good, very poor design. The costumes where part of the heart of the Ghostbusters. If they were a sign of things to come, then what was coming wasn't going to be very good, and it wasn't.Well in the end just like other remakes (Total Recall, Fright Night, Conan The Barbarian, etc.) this did not live up to the name. I wish it would of, but at least it's come and past, like my upset stomach I had the other day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well - bit the bullet and went for a look.....my thoughts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did a lot of reading of these reviews, both good and bad, and finally bit the bullet and watched it last night. Yes, I'm a male. Yes, I loved the first Ghostbusters. No - I'm not concerned about the leads being females. BUT - I'll admit it up front I've not liked any of McCarthy's films, purely as the humour is not my bag.As mentioned a lot - the first 30-40 minutes of the film was really GOOD. I really enjoyed it, it had suspense and the characters did a really good job. But from there it really lost its way.Now - don't get me wrong - the problems below for me are not attempting to knit-pick - but are real holes in the plot/continuity of the film. I've not seen anything this bad in a blockbuster film before.Some really glaring things for me: Editing in the Concert scene. One minute there are three ghostbusters on the stage, next cut the four of them are getting the ghost from four different angles. (lets not mention the music choice) The 'bad' guy - who is he and why is he bad? How did he get all the tech (from reading a book apparently). How did he know about the hotel location and its meaning? Holtzmann - far out what can I say, just an awful character. I understand 'weird' - but that character just did not suit the film. The car. One scene is a normal car - next scene a complete Ghostbuster car. Maybe have a 20-second montage of them upgrading the car? The new guns - don't really care they can kill ghosts (not just catch) - but the same as the Car - show a quick montage. First Ghost catch - they store it - then have nowhere to offload it. Slight under-sight one would have thought! :-) The final scene's. Why would the bad guy transform? He'd just frozen a bucket-load of people - why not do the same to the Ghostbusters? For the easy win! The 'troll feedback' scene - really people reading too much. Was one line in the film and didn't come out as being a glaring thing. Didn't mind it at all to be honest. Male Secretary. Was funny but hated it after a while. We get it - he's dumb! But HOW dumb. Kind of like Dory - OK, we understand you forget things - STOP telling us! The original Ghostbusters did not show the female secretary in a bad light - or any character really. NOTHING REDEEMING ABOUT THE FILM. Watch once, throw away was my final thought. Cameos. Waste of time.One other thing, that may not have been mentioned - MARKETING. No redeeming ghosts, no redeeming characters, no redeeming cars/other items. Nothing new to market. In this day and age of marketing being a real money spinner they really should have spent some more time creating iconic things to sell to the kids!Overall the movie was watchable - but I was surprised about the glaring holes in the film and the serious continuity errors. I will never say 'dont watch' - but you really need to suspend your reality when watching this, for all aspects of the film not just the ghosts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surpasses the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie. The original Ghostbusters movies are iconic and very difficult to follow, but I felt this movie did them justice.There were quite a few shoutouts to the original movies that I really enjoyed (as did pretty much everyone in the theater, judging from the laughter and applause), but it still felt like a great stand alone movie. Instead of being copies of the men from the original, each woman was her own character, and each was likable, funny and relateable.The special effects were fantastic, and they were so much fun to watch. I have rewatched the older version several times over since childhood, but honestly, it holds up less each time. It's really great to have a version that meets the standards we have in place today.This movie felt familiar, but fresh at the same time. All the main characters were complex, with both positive and negative traits, but ended up being wonderful on the whole. The entire theater was laughing, whooping and clapping throughout. Original cast members popped up throughout the movie, in fun and unexpected ways. While there was some occasional gross out humor, it didn't rely solely on it to be funny. I found so much to like about this movie, its pacing, its innocence (there's so much focus on gritty/edgy movies and shows now, and I was really glad this movie didn't follow suit), its stand out characters, its self awareness, and the ways it played to both old and new fans.There are a few jokes that fall flat, in my opinion, and I don't know that I would consider this movie 'hilarious' like some have. But that's a good thing. Yes, it's fun to watch something that is purely comedy, but it feels better to watch something that's more well rounded. It means rewatches can be just as satisfying (for me, at least). And I found myself really caring about the characters and what happened to them.Honestly, the one and two star reviews for this movie simply aren't justified, and it's blatantly obvious they're coming from misogynists. Maybe a movie like this isn't everyone's cup of tea, and that's fine, but I can't find much to criticize about it. (There is some valid concern about Patty being a stereotype, but I still think Leslie did the role justice and I really adored Patty as a character.) When you remake a movie like Ghostbusters, there's always going to be people who feel like nothing can stand up to the original, but the hatred for this film feels like it goes way beyond that.This is a great film, for a lot of reasons, but especially because there are women kicking butt in it. I can't think of many movies with a female character that is allowed to fight and be gross and weird, nevermind several of them. Holtzmann, who has more or less been confirmed as a lesbian, is such an important character for nerdy girls/women, particularly if they are gay/bi or neurodivergent (mentally ill, autistic, etc). The women are different heights, ages and weights, and none are unfairly sexualized, and it was so incredibly refreshing. All the women are brilliant in different ways and totally own it, and I'm so very excited for all the young girls seeing this movie, who will finally get to see characters like them on screen.Please see this movie, it's fabulous. I know the original holds a special place in a lot of people's hearts (mine included), but the remake really holds its own, and even outshines its predecessors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally got round to seeing this last night. And I have to admit, it was really good. The story seemed to go at its own pace, which I kinda liked, it also managed to fit in developing the characters and all the ghost busting stuff too. Which, when it comes to a movie. It works incredibly well. The special effects are really good. The ghosts look a lot more realistic, and all the scenes with the ghosts are incredibly thrilling and really keep you on end with the excitement of it all. I thought Kevin was an incredibly funny character, because he's just that bumbling idiot that kinda helps the ghostbusters, and the villain was a great character too. I loved his plans, and it really gets you thinking, how could these plans work? But they seem to work for him. And those end credits, they were so random, but incredibly funny. So overall. Go see this movie. You will not regret seeing it. It is just like a lot of the audience were saying. You don't want to miss out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of people are giving this movie serious grief because it's ladies instead of men! Personally I'm glad they did something different with it since an outright sequel never came to be. I feel casting guys in the roles would have been to hard to live up to with the classic performances from the original cast. Introducing new characters for me was the best way to go! I loved all the little nods to the original films and cameos while never claiming to be part of the same universe as them! The movie was funny and shows that women can be smart and funny! Another critic I have seen of the film is that people feel Chris Hemsworth role is pointless and they are upset that the only male lead is a stupid eye candy character. Clearly these people don't get that, that was the entire point of his character it was a play on the way women are usually treated in male films as either pointless, dumb, in need is saving, eye candy or a combination of these so it was intentional the way his character was treated and portrayed in the film and this is just clearly over some peoples heads. Mostly I feel people wanted to not like this film and that most people are just looking for excuses to complain about something! A lot of "bad" reviews of this film seem to stem from bigots or racists who hide behind computer screens and are nothing more than weak, cowardly, cyber bullies!</fullReview>

But it was time for a remake. Could it have been funnier? Probably. But I laughed plenty and caught a lot of the hidden humor that maybe others missed. Who didn't love the concert scene? It was hilarious! It was also worth the extra cost to see in 3-D too. I liked all 4 of the funny ladies who were the lead actors. Cecily Strong was okay but perhaps someone else could have done her role better. Kate McKinnon stole the show. I thought Melissa McCarthy, Leslie Jones or Kristen Wiig would be but Kate was just magnificent. I have enjoyed her on SNL since she started. But all 4 ladies were good in their roles. I loved the cameos from the original Ghostbusters cast as well. Chris Hemsworth was also good in his role. All in all, I thought it was an excellent remake. Much better than Independence Day. Why some people rated it 5.4 was just mean IMHO.</fullReview>

And then the moment that everyone has already heard about: Chris Hemsworth as the gorgeous, dumb secretary. His performance provided the only comic relief until the credits started to roll.The credits were fast paced, funny, and delightful in sharp contrast to what preceded them.

		<shortDescription>After all the controversy, this is what all the fuss was about?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So Ghostbusters (2016) may go down as one of the most controversial movies of all time. From the Youtube trailer being the most disliked trailer in history, to the eternal twitter wars being fought by both the so called "SJW's" and what I like to call the anti-feminist crusaders, this is the result of months of controversy. A mediocre, forgettable film that would have been held in the ranks with other mediocre, forgettable reboots such as Robocop (2014) and Total Recall (2012) had this movie not served as the battleground for ideological warfare.The movie starts on a rather dull note with a joke about queefing and that sets the tone for the rest of the movie. Admittedly this film is not devoid of any humour, Leslie Jones who had probably the worst moments in the trailer, actually has probably the few funny moments in this film all to herself. A lot of the criticism from the trailers was that she came across as a stereotype towards the black community, but she probably serves as the only character throughout the whole movie who is relatable and undergoes any kind of character progression.Unfortunately, this means that the other 3 Ghostbusters played by Kristen Wigg, Melissa McCarthy and Kate McKinnon as well as their bumbling secretary Chris Hemsworth all are 1 dimensional, characters with no real evolution towards their character. And as for the villain Rowan North played by Neil Casey, he may very well be the dullest, most unsympathetic character to grace Hollywood in years, which is a shame because the potential of a bitter man, traumatised by how people have treated him all his life, whilst not the most original idea, has potential to flesh out a character. As for some of the cameos, if you ever need a perfect example of phoning it in, check out Bill Murray's cameo in this because he clearly does not give a damn.Perhaps the fairest criticism of this movie is the use of CGI, it does look exactly like the Scooby Doo movies and the Haunted Mansion movie of the early 2000's, in most movies this would be a disappointment, considering how recent movies like Warcraft have pushed CGI to their limits, but in a Ghostbusters reboot that made great usage of practical effects back in 1984, this makes it all the more frustrating.Overall this movie is a bland, forgettable movie. But it's not a "man-hating" mess or "Feminazi propaganda" this should just be pushed back into history along with all the other bland to terrible reboots in a bid to force Hollywood to come up with creative ideas in this era of soulless cash ins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After All That.....Meh.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After all that's been written and said about this movie, the most disappointing thing about it was how.....average it was. I was dubious, wasn't a fan of the gimmick casting and thought the trailer was terrible, but the reviews have been decent and I wanted to give it a chance.Here's what's good: There are some genuine laughs. The film is clever and funny in a few spots. Kristen Wiig is mostly very winning, except when she's going looney over Chris Helmsworth, which is embarrassing for both of them.Mostly, though, the movie just sort of plods along, not boring and with some inventive ideas, but a lot of standard, tired dialog ("Let's do this!", etc., etc.) and uneven performances. I love McKinnon best of all these actresses, but she's sooooo uneven here -- charming in a couple scenes, really hams it up elsewhere, feels forced and too theatrical overall. McCarthy does her schtick and I'm sick of it, Jones does as best she can with a thankless, typecast role. The grand finish is the worst part, pretty standard big budget fights, explosions, SFX, and so on. That started to get boring. But overall, i laughed more than I expected and I wasn't bored. I'd never see it again, though, either, so that puts it right in the middle of the pack, a 2-star movie, or a 5 on IMDb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave the film a 3 and I think that's being kind. I saw Ghostbusters last week, tried to write a review of it but the site wasn't working so I'll do it now. I saw the original Ghostbusters when I was 6 years old and I was hoping this film would bring back the memories of being in a crowded theaters with laughter and screams of joy. Uh-this film is not that. I love the idea of an all girl cast of The Ghostbusters but this film was just...dry. I went to the film last Saturday June 16th and it was somewhat crowded and their was hardly any laughter at all. I was like "What is going on here? It's comedy people. Where's laughs?" I loved Leslie Jones on SNL but I didn't see the same spunk in the film that we saw on the show every Saturday night. It was a bit tame, I guess because it was a PG-13 and she had to watch what she said but still she was the only reason the film had any kind of humor. Melissa McCartney, Kristen Wig and Kate McKinnon were okay but they could have been funnier but that's just me. I thought it was okay, it wasn't like my childhood but if you want to get out of the heat of summer, I guess you could see this film. But their are tons of other films that are coming out that you can see to beat the heat. I would personality watch this one of Redbox. I wish I had seen Secret Lives of Pets instead of this.</fullReview>

I certainly wouldn't recommend this for young children, and, the sexist attitude in this movie is both heavy handed and juvenile, despite some very funny gags. If the gender roles were reversed, there would be headlines in most western newspapers with scathing attacks on the writers and directors. The show rings more of a comedy sketch than a coherent story. None of the characters are memorable, which is disappointing as I'm a fan of Kristen Wiig's work. There is a cameo from Bill Murray, but it's not particularly funny. Save your time on this one. There are some very funny gags, but they are overshadowed by heavy sexism and lack of a decent story. It doesn't even deserve a 4, but it took a risk and bits are funny. Bring on the girls version of oceans 11 instead. That's a reboot worth talking about and hopefully, praiseworthy.</fullReview>

I didn't watch the original Ghostbusters movies, mostly because I'm tired of seeing mostly white men blow up cool stuff, and I admit I just watched this one because I didn't have to pay for the ticket. So let's start with the things I didn't like: 1. The antagonist was so flat and boring. Sorry, not buying this. 2. You know, I appreciated Kevin and his endearingly dumb escapades. And the revengeful part of me enjoyed seeing the roles reversed. But for future notice, I want my eye candy to be three-dimensional, not a reversed sexist trope. 3. I loved Patty but she was a stereotype. Apart from that? It was absolute gold. Funny and entertaining and badass. There was no romantic subplot, which was a relief, no sexist jokes, and guessing from my partner's comments (who's seen the original movies) there were enough cameos and references to the first two movies to please the first generation fans.I'd definitely watch a sequel.</fullReview>

Although the plot is pretty much the same as the original, it didn't feel like the first film at all. And that's mostly because the main characters. All four of the leads were astounding, hilariously funny and unique in their own ways. Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones in particular were the funniest and completely stole the show. Chris Hemsworth plays the hunky eye-candy who ends up being just as funny and lovable as the girls. People don't think women can be smart or funny, or do anything except be sexy and silent. Well this film proves the contrary. More movies like these which challenge the status quo need to be made. Never be afraid of no ghosts, or misogynists or racists.

		<fullReview>I've decided this deserves more than a 1, more than a 2, but 3 seems to be about the point at which the line in drawn in my cinematic mindset in terms of what happened to this outing by the director and his oh so chummy cast.Let me say, I don't live in the USA, so other than a passing awareness of Melissa McCarthy and Kristin Wigg (spelt correctly or not), I had no idea who the other two female leads were. I saw the press about the female cast, and one could not avoid the subsequent diatribe about how to dislike this film was based on sexism rather than the merits of the film or the concept themselves. So assuming no great awareness of the lead actors, but a deep sense of childhood around this film, i'm 44 so right in that demographic who were terrified by but loved the original Ghostbusters, I have to say I was simply disappointed. The acting, disappointing. The story line, disappointing. The direction, disappointing. The special effects, disappointing. The cameos, disappointing. Chris Hemsworth, very disappointing.Overall, the basic premise they adopted here made sense, but the execution of it was not good. The bad guy was simply terrible, who was he and how did he get that acting gig? Just poorly thought out, poorly executed (excuse the pun), and very poorly delivered.The lead actors, I'm not a fan of Melissa, or Kristin to a huge extent other than Bridemaids and the Skelaton Twins respectively, but I was just disappointed - it really felt like they just didn't want to be there - I know both can deliver more, but here they failed - do we assume they went for the easy pass given any fingers pointed at bad acting could just be called sexist and ignored.The other two leads, well yeah, I will say say I can't say badly done because I don't have anything to compare it to - but there was nothing standout in terms of their delivery either.Chris Hemsworth. The more I see him in films the more I find myself just wondering how the hell he gets so much work? OK, THOR and the body, I get that, but really, his acting is pretty dire, and the list of ruins he leaves behind as his acting resume must sooner or later call someone to ask like me, why is he in so many films. Sure, if he wants to model, nice, or be a stripper, awesome... but acting, no, not so much.The director, well my understanding is he's more a comedy/Rom-com sort of fellow. I'm not sure that this rehash has a genre as such, but I just don't think it's the right one for this guy. Not good, all over the place.Lastly, the story, yeah it was OK and that is about the only good bit I can come up with.It gets a heap of crap thrown at it because it deserves it, not because we are all sexist and thus bad people, but because this is a decidedly poorly made movie, poorly acted and directed.I think whoever green-lights these things at Sony needs a good hard slap in the face and a termination notice because really they simply are rubbish. Passing off this sort of nonsense to those of us who had hoped it would be terrific given the improvements possible in CGI and some great actors and writers around these days is unforgivable. Basically just don't do it, not unless you can find it for free or cheap which I don't doubt is where the Blu-rays and DVDs will be within weeks of release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a forgettable product</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rarely feel the need to write a review, since there are already plenty to choose from and from better reviewers, but in the case of Ghostbuster 2016 (known also as Ghostbusters In Name Only, GINO) I almost feel compelled.First of all I'm not a fan of the original. I like it, I own the Blu Ray, but I don't hold Ghost Busters to sacred standards. It's just an enjoyable, silly movie worth my time.On with the review now. GINO is not a bad movie, but not good either. Not even mediocre. Simply put it's not a movie, but a series of short comedic sketches tied by the same characters and some semblance of plot. Not for one moment I felt like watching a proper movie, but just an endless series of scenes put together in a hurry and a flurry.The frenzied editing doesn't help because the 'movie' jumps relentlessly from scene to scene without respite and I was left dumbfounded, often wondering what was going on and if it was really that important in the context.On some level this may sound exciting and a synonym of non-stop action, but it's not. There's very little going on in terms of actual plot and what's going on is often boring.I was pleasantly surprised that Melissa McCarthy wasn't foul mouthed as usual, but aside from that I didn't laugh a single time. Not even chuckled or smiled. Maybe it's a cultural thing, since two out of the four leading ladies are stand up comedians known in USA only, I don't know. Anyway McCarthy is not at her best (which can be a good thing), Wiig is simply unfunny (she was the weakest link in every movie I saw her, even Despicable Me), Jones just screams and McKinnon tries too hard to be kooky and to steal the scene. Thor, err, Hemsworth is good, but Kevin is just a bad character, so dumb that your suspension of disbelief is really put to test.The characters are paper thin and never gain depth. By the end of the movie you still don't know anything more than was showed at the beginning, nada, niente, rien. The viewer is told in broad strokes who the four Ghostbusters are and what they do and that's it. No arc, no growth, just one change towards the end that was too little and too late.The cameos are unfunny as well and I don't understand what was so exciting about them. The major part of the old cast comes back in different roles. Big deal.Last but not least, when the credits rolled I was left with a burning question: is this really what people are fighting over on the internet? This is a totally forgettable product (yes, not a movie, a product) that would've totally been ignored if it wasn't for the big words thrown around by 'haters' and 'lovers'. This product is not worth anybody's time and energy, so I'm quite sure that all the fuss was just a clever marketing ploy and the people from both sides were successfully duped.Watch on TV only if you are really curious, otherwise there are better ways to pass time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is just what you would expect. Another remake that hopefully will be forgotten tomorrow, and by going to the movies and seeing it I know I am part of the problem. I gave them my money for it. Meaning they will be able to go on and do mediocre work of stolen ideas and stereotype humor.The sad part is that Sony used the feminism card for everyone who dislike it. This is sad because the movie is bad, really really bad. We shouldn't associate this to feminism / misogyny. If we do that actually means women are inferior in some aspects, this movie being a good argument in misogynous favor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a review of the reviews.This movie started out as lower than 4, no it's 5.4 I was watching the reviews to decide whether I want to see the movie or not. I went to the low reviews first. People with a reviewing history of years. Read the reviews, understand their point. I went to the high reviews. The 10 star ones. People with only one review under their pocket. Their only review, this movie. And one guy with more than one reviews, a guy that gave Dark Knight Rises 1 star...... So basically 10 star reviews, completely fake. So it's decided. I refuse to watch this movie. Reasons: 1. It has such low ratings 2. All the high ratings are fake 3. The publishing and production company labeled any single person that dislikes this movie a misogynistic sexist pig even though if you read their reviews they have a huge bunch of valid reasons to not like the movie 4. I am tired with all these reboots and remakes, what's next? Back to the future? I refuse to support stupid cash in reboots because all our childhood movies are getting ruined one by one</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw the original film back when my hometown multiplex had only four theaters (rather than the present half-dozen). Since then, it's undergone about three or four different changes in ownership. And an upgrade in technology.But, if this movie was supposed to be an upgrade to the original and its only sequel, it failed.Don't get me wrong! I loved the Hitchcockian cameos by most of the original cast members. Plus, the bronze statue commemorating the too- soon-taken Harold Ramis. But, Bill Murray, as Dr. Heiss, was nowhere near as lovable to hate as William Atherton's Walter Peck of the EPA. And, the sadly absent Rick Moranis should've played Dean Tom Shanks rather than Stephen Higgins (whom I've never heard of before). Then, there are the stars of this remake. As with Higgins, I've also never heard of Kristen Wiig. That goes double for the even more forgettable actress who played Jillian Holtzmann. Melissa McCarthy is definitely funnier on TV than in feature films. And the only reason Leslie Jones, as Patty, steals the show from her fellow females is because the other three don't have enough collective chemistry to balance her literally overpowering acting! I refuse to even discuss the hip-hop remake of the original theme song.One of this film's few saving graces is the production number seen in the ending credits. Sort of a combination of the Zombie Hustle, from Michael Jackson's "Thriller," and the Jim Carrey rendition of "Cuban Pete" from THE MASK! Chris Hemsworth's dancing in that is funnier than all the intended jokes in the film's dialogue (especially the ones spouted by the racist eco-activist tour guide at the beginning of the film).In short? If you want to see this movie just to spot the cameos from the original two films, wait till it comes out on DVD, three months from now. At least the rental price will be cheaper than six bucks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HILARIOUS Movie. Worth the watch. (I'm tempted to go see it again.)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching Ghostbusters when I was younger, I had high expectations. I watched this movie with some friends and we all loved it! After, I went to check out the reviews and was surprised to see how negatively it was received.A lot of the negativity is coming from there being an all-female leading cast, with the male receptionist being portrayed as stupid. I've read a lot of complaints about all the men being either evil or stupid. First let me tackle the dumb and vain receptionist, Kevin. I think Kevin's purpose was for satire. To turn around the role traditionally played by women and then put a man in it to make a statement. This is the first movie I've ever seen that uses a male as the stupid character. Usually its always a female who's stupid... Why are some men taking such offense? Why is it OK when it's a female occupying the stupid role and not a male? Now as to answer the question "Why are all the men evil?" The mayor in this movie is male, which is reasonable because most political positions are occupied by males. The other antagonist is the mayor's female accomplice. Him and his female accomplice publicly shame the Ghostbusters, even denying that ghosts exist after the huge outbreak in the movie. I do not think it is unreasonable to have a male/female evil duo here. (Why do people think that's unreasonable?) The main villain who causes the mass outbreak is also a male, but he could have easily been a female. I think one of the reasons they may have cast a male is to give some variety, since all the leads are female (which was done in order to give a little flip to the all-male Ghostbusters. Cause why not?).I also don't see the issue with the female leads. They were all hilarious. (And apparently the audience agreed with me cause all I heard PLENTY of laughter in the movie theater I was in.)The actor who REALLY made me laugh was Kate McKinnon as Holtzmann. She was just so funny...one of my favorite scenes is where she was dancing with a fire going off and then danced to extinguish it as Erin freaked out. I also loved her solo fight scene where she pulls out two mini guns. Her licking the gun, her reaction to Abby being weird when she leaves the restroom, her general disregard to dangers, her toast at the end...all great acting. She was just phenomenal in this movie. Kristen Wiig as Erwin was a gem, and I think it was a great choice to open up the movie with her. She gets fired from her job, but then doesn't let that get her down in the dumps. She is a strong, intelligent, determined character. The type that would jump in after her friend into a strange portal without a moment's hesitation. Definitely a character to look up to.Leslie Jones as Patty was on point. Patty is one of the bravest and most confident characters, quitting her job at the MTA because she was not gonna accept a no for joining the Ghostbusters team after the crazy ghost activity she witnessed. She puts herself at risk by allowing the team to use her Uncle's hearse, and she helps them out with her extensive knowledge on the history of the city, constantly coming up with ideas. Although her character is stereotypical in speech and attitude, it is not a full stereotype like many claim because we can clearly see how smart she is. She is obviously a valuable member of the team. Some of her funniest scenes were her reaction to the moving plastic dummy and her trying to get the ghost out of Abby.Finally there's Melissa McCarthy as Abby. She is the glue that holds the team together; and she remains confident even when everyone is talking on the news about how crazy the Ghostbusters are. She reminds the team not to take heart to what the media is saying and focus on what is important. I like to think of her as the "mother" of the team. So there you have it. I think the four leads were casted perfectly.Loved the appearances from the old cast and references to the old movies.There are some plot holes. Where does all the money for extra equipment come from? How so they fix their packs so quick after Abby destroys them when she's possessed? And some other details. However I can easily overlook these because of how damn funny the movie was.The credits were awesome too; my friends and I ended up staying until the end because of the never ending clips and scenes behind the credits. They were quite entertaining. I really hope there will be a sequel to this version of Ghostbusters.</fullReview>

No doubt others will have another view point than my own. I don't want to spoil the movie for others, but if you saw the first and wanted to see more than you might feel like me. It the time they took to tell the story, I think it could have been much better told.I didn't care for the all girl cast and making men look stupid. This may be classified as a political film as it has a unbelievable feminism agenda. I found the characters shallow and unbelievable.The special effects were great.

And, because, surely, investors and movie producers would finally stay away from the classics when their greedy pockets get hurt. Racial discrimination, sexual objectification, and social segregation of people with mental disabilities (yes, Melissa I'm looking at you) are the real ghosts that are wrongly faced in this excuse of a movie, and they lost the battle before even start.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The much anticipated (for better or worse) Ghostbusters refresh hit American soil for mass consumption last evening. Before we venture any further, let's just address the Stay Puft sized elephant(s) in the room: the trailers are bad, the marketing has been an exercise in futility, and I was not looking forward to this film. Much to my surprise, I did not walk out of the theater in a heated rage and my childhood affection for the original film and cast was left completely intact. I did have quite a few light hearted chuckles, but those were negated quickly by cringe worthy and shallow plot devices. This film has been shrouded in controversy and it's not outside the realm of plausibility that the true spirit of the film was left on the cutting room floor with a gentle nudge from studio handlers. In all regards, the finished product delivers juvenile attempts at humor, underwhelming performances, whiplash inducing tone shifts, and special effects you swear you've seen in the last Scooby Doo movie.Read more at www.SlackJawPunks.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I had planned on skipping this movie altogether but I got dragged to a 3D screening by someone and ended up giving this a chance anyway.It's not good. The jokes were old and stale and flat. Chemistry was marginal between the main characters and the only black Ghostbuster was portrayed as a stereotype. The men are all stupid or evil, as others have said. In the original, the receptionist was smart and sassy and sarcastic. This remake, he was DUMB and DUMBER. The whole movie was insulting to men and sexist. The gadgets didn't make sense and their effect varied across the plot line. The ghosts were a little dated in terms of CGI effects and were not scary at all.Unlike the original, where the comedy was organic to the plot line and situation, this story tried to set up obvious punchlines throughout.But no, it wasn't absolute garbage, just a bland attempt to remake a studio-franchise. The cameos by the old cast only frustrated me more as they reminded me of what could have been a much better movie integrating the old cast with the new. Watch it on Netflix for free when it comes out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When word hit the streets Bill Murray would provide a cameo, the anticipated GHOSTBUSTERS reboot was rumored to be a sequel ? nothing doing. Bill, the sarcastic cool dude who grounds the original, plays another version of "Dickless" here... True fans will get that reference and for newcomers, he's a complete jerk ? but not the villain, by any means...That title should go to the writers, Katie Dippold and Paul Feig. And yet as director, Feig provides some scary, suspenseful moments, almost as if he really, deep down, wanted to make a bonafide horror flick with a side-plate of comedy. And there are times when the four girl Ghostbusters geek-out with a genuine flow of scientific expository dialogue, especially Melissa McCarthy as Abby, a hybrid of Dan Aykroyd's soulful buried-lead and a cerebral Harold Ramis... Meanwhile, Kristin Wiig has the most to lose, at first, working at the same University where the original Ghostbusters were expelled. Uptight and anxious, she must adhere to the subtle goading of tomboy Kate McKinnon as Jillian, the token wild card who acts as if we know her character already. In fact, in many ways, Feig's GHOSTBUSTERS seems more like a dull sequel to a first (proverbial) venture that, like SPY and BRIDESMAIDS, actually worked...But they really don't have much at risk (like Aykroyd's Ray, who took a Second Mortgage on his parent's house to get the ball rolling) and way too much time's spent with characters trying to be witty ? who just aren't. This includes our main trio, so comfortable with each other they don't have to work in order to gel and/or smooth out any rough edges, and side-characters like THOR sex symbol Chris Hemsworth as the perfect looking yet vapid secretary along with Leslie Jones's Patty. While he reminds everyone "I'm great looking and don't act as such," she's a sassy expert on the history of New York City to aid the science-minded former- bullied Wiig and McCarthy, and yet their camaraderie leads to nowhere. And the foursome's rags to riches climb to be taken seriously ? from finding a logo to perfecting weapons to landing their first gig hired by an uptight building manager ? mirrors the Ivan Reitman directed comedy classic like THE FORCE AWAKENS did to STAR WARS: stalking the premise in an accidental yet intentionally contrived fashion (although not quite as much; and there's an evil ghost frying from an electric chair current, liken to the 1989 sequel).The jokes, either in an overboard Judd Apatow style or your typical "polar opposite buddy banter," falls flat on top of a story that's almost intriguing, and hell, even somewhat original, leading to an overlong finale which, as you'd expect, seems downright blasphemous ? then again, maybe it all is, or... was. Because it doesn't matter if bundles are made on the opening weekend; this reboot probably won't have legs ? most of us remember the horribly flawed GHOSTBUSTERS II. In the case of the entire franchise, with an overall theme so outrageous and far-fetched, it's really something that needs to be perfected upon the first attempt, which 1984 was and 2016 ain't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The one movie that was so horrible that I felt writing my first IMDb review is an obligation toward betterment of human race. Here's the sin list:* Copy n' paste original movies' plot line without understanding how to mimic the success or why it was successful in the first place. * Not sure if it's fault of the script or the director, but this movie is a mess of plot that doesn't know what it wants to be, bad spacing and jokes that don't hit the mark.* Characters are underdeveloped and flat and they never grow into any direction. Only redeeming character being Holtzmann, who is the most interesting out of the bunch. The worse character in whole movie is the main villain that is so forgettable that you might not remember him existing at all. * 200 million marketing budget apparently buys a lot of shill marketing and paid reviews. Don't trust anything you read on the internet about the movie, gender issues are just a smoke screen to hide movie's bad quality. * Cameos are mostly unnecessary and embarrassing. They just keep throwing them at you randomly. Only exception being Phil Murray who's ghost skeptic character works okay for the short moment he appears on screen.* Movie's internal logic and rules get bend in the last action sequence where suddenly ghosts don't have to be trapped due their lasting ghost form, but instead can now be killed... by slashing them into pieces. There are few cool action scenes in the end but they don't fit in with the characters who didn't grow into any direction during the movie. From audience's perspective they are still inexperienced trainees in a profession no one has ever done before, but suddenly our main heroes do all kind of cool battle stunts and gymnastics despite of having background as a scientists. If they had background and expertise in other areas it sure was not told. Another spacing wrecking moment is the part where several ghost destroying equipment gets introduced out of the sudden but these machines of death are never used in the movie, well apart the one that was never introduced before. * Product placement. In Sony movies the only place where end battle can happen is at New York's Time Square. The reason? It has the most product placement real estate of all of the locations in world. Pringles, 7eleven, H&amp;M and Starbucks came out of nowhere without any reason for being there and one of the main characters might have just turned their eye contact directly toward the camera and sang a commercial in middle of the movie out of blue. It would have been a lot more sincere. I wouldn't advice anyone to see this abomination. As far as reboots go, this is just as bad as the new Robocop was.</fullReview>

But it does start to alienate me when literally every man in the movie is portrayed as either; a dick, a creepy loser, or a moron. At one point Chris Hemsworths character literally reaches for a phone shaped decoration in fishtank by repeatedly hitting his hand against the glass like some kind of forcefeild. On the flipside, the female characters are these genius heroines here to save the day and deliver overblown technojargon at every turn with the exception of Leslie Jones' character, who was here to play the token black character who spouts lines like SHIIIEEETTT! or AW HELL NAW!The pacing was terrible, most of the fight scenes are spent standing around delivering awful one liners.There are occasional jokes that made me laugh but that doesn't excuse the other thousand terrible jokes, including a tastefully delivered queef joke that rode in on the coattails of a fart joke.TLDR Vaguely racist, overtly sexist, downright badly written trash. skip it</fullReview>

This was a script that was so simple, it was not thought out at all, nor any resemblance of a decent story. Yes they tried to market it by saying all us movie goers were trolls, urrm no we were not, you guys just made a terrible movie. Mr Feig you can't make a movie that only you want to see, you need to make a movie that the audience is excited to see, and that's where the problems was. Feig was so busy telling everyone he was right and we were wrong that Sony also lost sight of what the movie should have been. Well its going to probably cost Sony over $100m+ loss, so Sony by all means keep listening to Mr Feig I'm sure you'll break even in about 40 years, because I'm sure Mr Feig is not going to empty his own bank account to cover your losses and expenses. I still would love to see an decent Ghostbusters reboot with the original cast passing the torch, and Sony should not be put off from that, because I still think in the right hands ( NOT Feig) it will do very well. Will that ever happen? Lets hope so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The amount of hatred around this movie from both sides of the aisle is just insane. Anyone who likes it is a fanatical feminist or a social justice warrior and anyone who hates it is a backward misogynistic man-child. Going into this movie, I'm going to admit that I wasn't completely unbiased for two reasons. First of all, the marketing for this movie was really bad, those trailers were pretty unappealing. Two, I never had a problem with the new Ghostbusters being women but I'm tired of Hollywood remaking classic movies and the remake having little to no understanding about what made the original special. But I saw the reviews were good so I decided to check it out. While I'm admitting that I didn't like Ghostbusters, I want to reiterate that if I thought this movie was good, I would admit my change of heart and say so. Unfortunately that's not the case.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* The movie starts at the Aldridge mansion in New York City. Garrett (Zach Woods) is leading a tour group through the mansion and tells them of how the daughter of the owner of the house murdered the servants and was locked in the basement by her father. A candlestick falls over near the door to the basement which creeps the group out. Later we learn its just a show put on by Garrett. He's just about to leave at closing time when he hears noises, the doorknob on the basement door rattles and things begin to levitate. He retreats into the basement but the floor starts to break apart with green ooze coming out. He tries to vacate the basement and the title card flashes as a ghost rises from the floor and Garrett begins to scream.I'll start out with what I liked about the movie. The studio obviously had a lot of faith in this movie because it carried over a $100 million budget and it shows. The CGI and the visual effects were pretty top notch. The ghosts and the paranormal look great and although the execution is mixed, I was impressed. Although I though some of the acting was weak, I thought there were some bright spots too. Chris Hemsworth stole the movie, he actually has some pretty good comic timing and maybe this movie will lead to some more comedic roles (Channing Tatum style with his breakout in 21 Jump Street). I also thought Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones were funny in certain scenes. They weren't consistent but they each had their moments.The biggest reason that I didn't like this movie was that I just didn't find it funny. Most of the jokes fell really flat and there were some really awkward parts where I just wished the movie would move on. The original movie is a classic not only because of how many good jokes it had however but also because the main cast had some really great chemistry together. I just didn't feel that here either. Wiig and McCarthy worked the best together (they've worked together before) but again in that aspect, it just paled in comparison to the original.Getting to the acting, it was largely mixed. I was shocked at how unfunny I found Kristen Wiig to be here. She's been really great in other stuff but she's super awkward here (that's also her character but it didn't make me laugh). McCarthy was pretty restrained, which was a good thing but again, I didn't find her funny. She usually works really well with Paul Feig (check out Spy it's really good) but it didn't click for me. McKinnon and Jones were intermittently good, they definitely were throwing the most into it and I appreciate that. Hemsworth was solid but the villain Neil Casey was really annoying both as a character and the actor. Some of the cameos were good (I liked Sigourney Weaver, Ernie Hudson and Annie Potts) but others seemed forced. It's good that the Ghostbusters reboot had the support of the original cast but the cameos seemed more like fan service than actually serving the movie.Watching this movie just made me sad. I wanted to like it, I really did. I watched it with two good friends and we all left the theatre saying pretty much the same thing. The visuals were solid and I did laugh a little but this isn't essential viewing by any means. I just wish that they had let this franchise be, I didn't even feel this movie worked particularly well on its own even putting aside the original two. If people genuinely enjoy this, I'm not going to ridicule them for it. Honestly, good for them. It just didn't work for me and I feel like people are being too kind to this movie in certain respects just because of the large amount of heat being generated by it now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unconvincing mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one film that I honestly never had any intention on seeing. We have all heard of the terrible marketing it had and that it's first trailer is one of the most disliked videos on YouTube ever. But what made me not want to see it was the way that this backlash was handled by the filmmakers. Calling people misogynist just for saying that the trailer was bad. Couple this with a film that looked incredibly similar to the movie that it's rebooting and I was all but out of this one. But due to the flood of people asking me to review it, here I am. Of course, the terrible marketing isn't something that I will hold against the film, because a film should be judged on its own merit.Unfortunately, I was completely correct in assuming that this movie was identical to the original. Its plot structure is essentially ripped straight from it with minor cosmetic changes being made. The film opens with a group of scientists on the verge of confirming ghosts existence. They do and are disgraced by the place they work for it. After that they proceed to continue their work flat broke. They manage to construct make shift ghost catching devices and nab one or two. The city then mostly accepts them as the Ghostbusters and life is good until a bad guy does a thing. Sound familiar? Aside from a hand full of scenes this film rarely veered from the original take in any way.Not to mention the blatant lack of any interesting characters. There's a dumb dude, a smart girl, a token black character, and an insane person. This short sum up is all that each character is. They never do anything out side of that summary and never progress into anything. So when the climatic battle takes place, are there any stakes? Nope. It's hard to get into a fight scene when you don't care about anyone or anything that is happening. Not only that but did anyone really think that anyones life was in danger? I certainly didn't. This is the kind of film that tells you early on that there are no risks and that nothing will pay off in any compelling way. And nothing does. Every time it introduces conflict or risks they are resolved so quickly that it's impossible to feel the gravity of the situation.That is only heightened more when the characters don't seemed worried at all. This boils down to the performances of the actors. Which were all pretty alright. But I believe the reason they were so unconvincing at times was due to poor direction from Paul Feig. Any time CGI is implemented on screen it is not only incredibly unconvincing, but it has no real presence. The actors are simply reacting to a green screen, and it shows.A lot of the time it looks like they are reacting to nothing. That being said, the cast is probably the biggest saving grace of the film. While they seemed to be playing themselves, they play themselves fairly well. Their SNL bonds show in the film. They all have great chemistry together and bounce off each other pretty well.While the comedy writing wasn't really my thing, their bond with each other did generate some genuine laughs. And as a whole, I thought the film was fairly well paced. There wasn't many scenes where nothing was happening. And for a film like this, I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't check my watch more often. So, I can certainly see why many people love this movie.It's fast paced, has a great cast, and offers some decent laughs. That being said, it's so alike to the original that it was near impossible to be surprised by anything. It plays out in the exact way you'd think it would and doesn't really have any depth to divert your attention from that. It's to well casted to say that it's a horrible film but it's to nonsensical and predictable to call it good. It's a movie that will disappear from my mind with in no time at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one funny joke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all let me say that the movie was not funny. None of the jokes were funny. The only joke that I found funny I am not even sure it was meant to interpret it like this. The lesbian chick compares the proton gun with a balloon. But Melissa MCCarthy looks like a red balloon so that was funny.The man hating stems from this movie really hard. i could have ignored the dumb blond receptionist guy although saying that he is retarded would insult people actually retarded. I could have ignored the guy that screams like a little girl or all of the ghost buster crew treating ghosts like nothing. No surprise no fear is just a run in the park. When you see this kinda thing the first time you get startled, but they do not seem to know how to act seeing something scary.What I had could not ignore is that even the evil dude could not be left to be the evil genius archetype. No, he just stolen their invention because hey apparently in that pamphlet of a book there were detailed schematics of something they did not think of inventing yet. Also except for the smart chick that leaves the teaching position you cannot empathize with those women. They are angry mad as hell feminists.If that thing were real I would be more afraid of them instead of the ghosts.I mean they are the archetype of the mad feminist. So basically the whole movie is an attempt to prove that women are better and smarter than men. Also the CGI is way worse than the 2 original movies.Literally every ghost except the marsh-mellow man and the logo ghost are literally Normal bad 3d objects to which blue o green smoke effect has been added. Think about a Scooby Doo movie.</fullReview>

The original Ghostbusters movies where tops, this women remake with no chemistry no real comedian's to speak of unless you let the drive by media tell you who is suppose to be funny is just another eye sore on Hollywood's long list of failures. The cast seemed they where pushed into liking one another nothing seemed to roll out effortlessly. The cgi if you could call it that was shotty at best and the outfits were plan like the script. The story behind the original Ghostbusters had chemistry, excitement, comedy, and a A list of actors that made it to the top by themselves, you didn't have the media hype them up like today's actors and actresses..... This atrocity will never be in my movie library nor would I support buying their new Ghostbuster items or games for friends or family. Save your money and for god's sake's save your time, because your worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Painfully Dull and Unfunny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Already turned off by the terrible trailers, the casting of Melissa McCarthy, and the feminist rhetoric surrounding this movie, I finally went to an industry screening of it, and it was pretty much what I expected, if not worse. McCarthy, in my opinion, is not the comedic genius the studios seem to make her out to be. With each passing movie, her performances should be garnering more Razzie awards. She is the female Adam Sandler, her movies are terrible, we know they're terrible, but yet people still go to see them. I don't get it. This is a movie that is instantly forgettable. Nothing stands out. Not the characters, not the "story", not the sleep inducing dialogue, and certainly not the effects, which 3D couldn't even help. There is little sense of urgency, the pacing is the equivalent of watching paint dry, there is nothing to make me care about the characters at all, and there is not ONE laugh to be found. All during the movie, while the Busters were looking for ghosts, I was looking for a point. Never found it. Chris Hemsworth's character was completely unnecessary, it was only there to drive the feminist point home of how smart these "girls" are, and how utterly stupid men are. If the roles were reversed, the outrage would be through the roof. Leslie Jones, as the one sassy black Buster, couldn't look more out of place. She towers over the other ladies by a mile. I also think the studio panicked over the negative press her stereotypical performance in the trailers was getting and trimmed a lot of it out of the movie. None of the characters are memorable, you won't care about what happens to them, you won't be on the edge of your seat.. ever. You'll just be looking at your watch. Avoid this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this sh!t gave me aids don't watch please i beg u now don't watchNational Socialists! At that time you probably all felt that this step was a bitter and difficult one for me. The German people has never harbored hostile feelings against the peoples of Russia. However, for more than two decades the Jewish Bolshevik rulers in Moscow had been endeavoring to set aflame not only Germany but all Europe. At no time did Germany ever attempt to carry her National Socialist worldview into Russia, but on the contrary Jewish Bolshevik rulers in Moscow unswervingly endeavored to foist their domination upon us and other European nations, not only by ideological means but above all with military force. The consequences of the activity of this regime were nothing but chaos, misery and starvation in all countries.I, on the other hand, have been striving for two decades, with a minimum of intervention and without destroying our production, to arrive at a new socialist order in Germany, one that not only eliminates unemployment but also permits the productive worker to receive an ever greater share of the fruits of his labor. The achievements of this policy of national economic and social reconstruction -- which strove for a true national community by overcoming rank and class divisions -- are unique in today's world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is without a doubt, the worst film in the history of any movie that has existed, is currently existing or anything that will exist. The plot is is quite possibly the worst plot that has ever been conceived in the history of writing.Let me give you a brief description of the movies "plot". The main characters consist of a fat screaming "OH HEEL NAW" black lady, another fat women except this time, she is white as a snowman, has messy hair and looks straight outta a horror movie. The next two characters nobody cares about (actually none of them I could give one single flying banana about). The characters names are Person #1, 2, 3 and 4. The "le epic story" is that 4 females were walking down a street when they decided they were tired of being called fat and ugly, so they decided to become transgender, so that anyone who calls them ugly is trans-phobic and must kill themselves. Next, they saw the ghost busters walking down a street, so they mauled and killed them. Then they wore the ghost busters clothes. The 4 women decided to become the ghost busters and prove that they are just as capable as men (but fail horribly).Are your eyes bleeding yet? Well, this story was thought up by Paul Feig, a fan-girl and SJW of feminism, so he hired some Tumblrinas and they wrote the worst story of any movie ever. The humor is some of the driest and blandest humor I have ever heard. Most of the jokes are just worn out memes that 9 year old wouldn't find funny. The special effects would fit right in with Scooby Doo. This film is so bad that even Satan wouldn't accept it if you offered it to him. So in conclusion, this movie is the greatest movie of all time. 10/10 would fist a baby.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's every bit as bad as you think it is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm gonna start this off by saying that if you're a fan of the original Ghostbusters, you really aren't going to want to see this movie. There. Now that rules out almost anyone who'd really wanna go see this movie. But if you're still here, know this. I grew up loving the franchise as a kid. I watched the first two at a young age (young enough to have the first movie actually scare me the first time I saw it), watched The Real Ghostbusters (and Ghostbusters {the one with the two guys and the gorilla}) religiously on TV, and I always wanted to dress up as a Ghostbuster. Hell, I even watched Extreme Ghostbusters in the 90's, and they could've plagiarized that and gotten a worthy sequel.But this Ghostbusters movie is everything the trailer promised it'd be. A half-arsed rehash of everything from the first movie with far less inspiration or respect for the source material. Also too many jokes. In horror movies, you can't always focus on the scares or people will just come to expect it and the scares will fall flat. With comedies, it's the jokes. You have to try not to be funny sometimes. Given, this movie succeeds in that department, but for all the wrong reasons. This movie has so many "jokes," I spent the whole two hours asking "Can you stop? You made me laugh a few times, just...just quit while you're ahead." Yes, this movie will make you laugh a few times, but by the end of it, you're just going to be begging it to stop.As many people have stated, the CGI is bad, too. The ghosts look more cartoon-y than they did in The Real Ghostbusters. And Chris Hemsworth's character, their new secretary was just ridiculous. His character was stupid and egotistical as ****, and I'm not sure if the writers/director wrote him that way because they hate men, or just wanted him to be the fan service character. He held up pictures of himself shirtless, and they felt it was so important, they had to show 'em again in the end credits sequence. They ruined the movie's best character by making her constantly fawn over him to levels so creepy, she was getting to be scarier than the ghosts...though that's not really saying much for this movie. The whole coffee scene, though. Come on.The villain's as uninspired as everything else is in this movie. They didn't try to make him interesting or threatening. He's literally just there to fill a role. Like everybody else in this frigging' movie. This one was directed by a guy who only makes parodies, and it shows. There was actually zero respect for the source material. If this movie was developed and marketed as a parody with the title "Ghosthunters," or something, I'd be like "Great, they made a parody. At least they didn't make it an official movie in the franchise," but they did. They hired a guy who only makes parodies and put him in charge of a main title. The good news is, they're getting the original director in for the sequel. If you haven't seen this movie yet, don't waste your time or money. The sequel's guaranteed, so there's no reason to watch this movie, even if you wanted to support the series as a whole, and want to see newer, better ones. At least you can take comfort in knowing the next one will be better.And for everyone who's been too afraid to criticize this movie because of fear of allegations of sexism, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. Sometimes a bad movie's just a bad movie. Stop being cowards and just call it what it is. Just because the director and Sony Pictures has been screaming "You're just sexist!" (and sure, some internet trolls said things to that are blatantly sexist, but welcome to the internet) at everybody who's had any constructive criticism for this movie doesn't mean you should let them. They're the cowards for not being able to handle the criticism. If you can't handle criticism, don't make a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not garbage, but not good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of the original movies I was mildly excited when I heard that they were going to release a new movie. I didn't really care that it was an all-female cast, although I must say I was curious as to why but it didn't bother me. Then I saw the trailers and my excitement faded as the trailers were complete garbage. They looked like something from a Scooby-Doo movie. So even though I was not as excited to see the movie, I was curious. To be honest, I did have some apprehension but I remained open-minded, and I have to say that my fears were true. This movie was bad. It wasn't the train wreck that I thought it would be, but it was not good. With the exception of the first 15-20 minutes that felt to me like the originals, the rest of the movie was a humorless, irritating mess. The story was nothing special, pretty standard fare for this type of movie and it wasn't that bad, the ending is what killed the story for me. I have read that some people think that it is sexist the way it portrays the men in this movie, well the men in this movie are the only ones that stand out, no that is necessarily a good thing. It was the characters and the cameos are what really brought this movie down. Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig were just there, nothing good, nothing bad just occupying space. They as actresses were fine but the characters that were written for them were very forgettable. Kate McKinnon was a complete mess, she was all over the place and really stood out from the others, but not in a good way, she was too high-strung when compared to everyone else and didn't fit within that group. I heard someone say that it was like she was in a different movie, and I have to agree. Leslie Jones wasn't that bad, she made me laugh a few times, but her character was very one-sided. Chris Hemsworth's character was like a cartoon. He played someone so stupid that I couldn't believe that he was a real person, and the shtick got old really quick. The villain played by Neil Casey was perhaps the biggest disaster of them all. I rooted against him not because he was evil, but because he was a whiny, irritating nuisance. The cameos in this movie brought whatever momentum it was gaining to a screeching halt. I didn't think that one of these cameos was well written or well placed in the movie. I was as if they didn't have the confidence in the movie to stand on its own so they had to force these cameos in. In my opinion this movie seemed like a cash-grab disguised as a legitimate remake. I'm fine with the girl-power idea for the remake, but it wouldn't matter who you had in these parts this movie would still be a failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who Though This Was A Good Idea?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason I went to see this movie was that I had lost a bet with a friend. The punishment was "having to watch this bad-sounding film", but I was determined to watch it with an open mind, not letting my expectations cloud my judgment. I was completely ready to like this movie had it been surprisingly good...sadly it wasn't. Due to IMDb guidelines, I am warning that this review contains spoilers. However I recommend reading it before watching the film nonetheless, as giving away plot points might work as an attempt to save whoever reads this from seeing the movie. You're welcome.I graciously give this reboot a 4/10 rating. You can think of that as a rating for either an otherwise decent film with extremely many flaws, or a basically terrible film with some redeeming qualities. A part of me wants to give an even lower rating, but I have to admit that some aspects of the movie were quite good, if not good enough for it to be an overall pleasant cinematic experience. Much like the Ghostbusters franchise, I'll start with the good parts.Despite the characters being annoying (more on that later), the level of acting is fairly decent. One of the four main characters, Jillian Holtzmann played by Kate McKinnon, is actually quite funny and likable. Chris Hemsworth also has enjoyable moments, and Bill Murray and Sigourney Weaver's cameos are cool. It was also nice to hear the original theme song, and some of the references to the original movie were clever. That concludes the good sides to this film.The rest of it is more or less a disappointing and aggravating mess. The concept of making a feminist all-female reboot for Ghostbusters was questionable as it was, but here's the terrible part: the point of making a feminist all-female reboot is destroyed by the main characters being annoying over-the-top parodies of the female gender. This movie somehow manages to be offensive towards everyone by trying to appeal to everyone. For example I think the negative reception of the black character Patty isn't racist; what IS racist is the writers of the movie making her into the most stereotypical black character in cinematic history. I'm not saying that all characters should be politically correct and defy stereotypes, I'm just saying that a such a cliché character is unfunny and annoying to watch.But all that is only a small part of why this movie fails. As a fantasy/sci-fi film, it's very unoriginal and boring, and as a comedy, most of the humor consists of completely dumb jokes that make you groan and sigh instead of letting out the smallest laugh. There is no sign of the fresh and genius humor that the original Ghostbusters was filled with. The dialogue is horrible, while clearly trying to be clever and witty. And there are just so many individual moments that are absolutely ridiculous, from the over-cheesy "Who wants to go save New York City?" line (answered by the girls cheering "Whooooo!"), all the way to the climax where the girls defeat the final ghost by shooting him in the groin. Now as I said, some of the references to the original movie were clever. However, most of them are so on-the-nose that they force one to roll their eyes. A fine example of this is the origin scene of the Ghostbusters logo. Watching that scene, even a child who hasn't seen the film could easily guess where it's leading to several minutes before the "big and clever reveal", which the filmmakers clearly tried to make into an epic moment, whereas it turned out as laughably dumb and almost painful to watch.Now this movie gives a feeling of glory and happiness once it ends. As the credits start to roll, the viewer feels free, relieved that it's all over. Then, they're treated to a series of MANY mid-credit scenes, which a curious viewer like myself is forced to sit through after coming that far. After suffering through the credits, I now know what horror movie protagonists feel like when the monster comes back for one last scare.All in all, I strongly recommend passing this abomination of a summer blockbuster and re-watching the original movie instead. Of course this is just my opinion, and there are bound to be people who like this movie, and I am very interested in hearing their reasoning. But for me personally, this movie was so bad in so many ways, that I felt the need to write this review. Usually I'd end with a joke or reference tying up my take on the film, but this one doesn't deserve the time of coming up with something, so I'll end this in a dull and humorless fashion - very much in the spirit of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mediocre summer comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reboot of the famous 1984 movie 'Ghostbusters' stars Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, Kristen Wiig and Leslie Jones who over the course of the first act get together and form a crew called 'The Ghostbusters'. With a few special weapons and the well known Proton- Beam they have to work together to hunt down and capture ghosts. Working together is what the main characters do fairly well. Although the acting is a bit rough at times the four ghostbusters all seemed very likable and in my opinion they did have some good chemistry going on between them. The other characters in the movie are pretty dispensable however as they are mostly there for a quick joke. The ghosts they're hunting were fairly well crafted however with a cartoon-ish design while also looking fairly menacing. Accompanying the ghosts were some well placed jump scares, though at it's core 'Ghostbusters' is of course still a comedy movie. The comedic side is sadly not that good as a lot of the jokes fell flat. Occasionally there were some gags that made me audibly chuckle though often times these jokes were later on repeated multiple times without achieving the same effect.The overarching plot is decent enough and it would've allowed for a fun story to be told, though due to the poor writing what is left is a very predictable story with a downright ridiculous villain whose sole purpose is to set the necessary events in motion. Overall the 'Ghostbusters' reboot wasn't the train wreck some people though it'd be, but sadly it also wasn't the great comedy movie other people hoped it'd be.My rating: 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally saw it - not what I expected, but horrible nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was decently optimistic before watching this. My favorite YouTubers who are huge 3rd wave feminist detractors said the movie wasn't half bad and didn't seem to push any kind of agenda as was being claimed so much in the media regarding the movie's detractors' thinking (not that we can believe anything the MSM says anyway).Well, they were definitely right about one thing, there is no agenda being pushed here. Not a single minute or a single line of dialog make me feel like they were trying to push something. With that said, it's a horrible movie.My two big issues with the movie is that it is very boring and I don't consider it to be a comedy.The character progression is practically non-existent: by the end of the film you still don't care about any of the characters (with few exceptions). None of them clicked at all. You learn at the beginning that Mcarthy's character used to be best friends with the woman trying to get tenor: but these two have zero chemistry. The way they act together you get no sense that they are old friends or "frienemies", it feels like they just met and the whole script just feels awkward. And forgive me for not remembering a single character's name, that's how much this movie was able to grip me, I don't remember a single one of them (I guess Holdsman was one?)The only one that really had any personality was the intern (Thor) and his character was so over-the-top stupid that it even ruined his good acting. Example: Covering his eyes instead of his ears when loud noises happen. In what world is that considered funny? I know humor is subjective, but I just don't see how that can ever be funny. Nothing about this movie felt like a natural progression of characters.And that pretty much goes for all the humor in this film, it either feels forced into the script and out of place or it just falls flat. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was in the end scene there is about 5 minutes of decent action that pulled me back in to the movie. I thoroughly enjoyed the scene where Holdsman took out the dual pistols and kicked ass. But, once again, it was preluded by what I assume to be something that was supposed to illicit laughs, where she licks the gun, I just found it strange and out of place.The the boss happens, everyone shoots him in the junk, he dies, end of movie. And as far as Patty, she has her stereotypical urban black moments, but that was all the trailers show. In the full movie she doesn't just shout at the camera the whole time and is probably the best fleshed out character out of the four ghostbusters.Conclusion:You never get any kind of connection to the characters due to the bad script (I'm sure the actresses would have done fine together if the script was more organic and naturally progressed the story instead of everything feeling forced).None of the jokes land, either because they are out of place or they just aren't funny (obviously subjective).None of this movie is anti-men or sexist or whatever - the women don't take away anything from the movie: the horrible script does.</fullReview>

The rest of Sony's plan was to make a ton of money from toys and other merchandise. Fair enough plan, but there is a huge problem - the movie is SOOOO BAAAD, it stinks. Its a 1 out of 10 type of film, its just awful...Acting is bad, script is bad, cast is bad, cgi is bad. And the list goes on and on. So lazy of Sony, why on earth didn't they make a well made GB movie in stead of this thrash. I can only think of one reason - trying to make as much money as possible. Shame on you Sony!On a different note - 29.4% voted this garbage of a film a fair rating of 1, yet it has a score of 5.4, considering Sony is probably making some people vote favorably to save face and money, and some activists will give it a high rating no matter how bad it is - the movie rating would have been much lower if it had not been for those people...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not expect to like this film much and I was , therefore , not surprised how much I disliked it. To be honest the original Ghostbusters movie was only OK, mainly saved by Bill Murray. There is no Bill Murray here. Neither Kristen Wiig nor Melissa McCarthy is a big enough talent to compete with Murray in the comedy stakes. It merely shows a lack of imagination and creativity in the film business these days if this is the best they can come up with. Special effects were fine but could not save the movie. It is boring, unfunny and lame in the extreme. I just knew that it would be poor as I hated Bridesmaids too even though I looked forward to seeing it- I had no experience of Wiig's so-called talent and am still waiting to see some sign of it. Melissa McCarthy seems a little more likable but fart jokes just do not do it for me. Ghostbusters 2016 is beyond boring for me - I don't think I smiled once, let alone laughed. As it is supposed to be a comedy that immediately is a severe problem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SNL cast turns a beloved franchise into an overlong SNL sketch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off: THE BUZZ IS REAL - this movie is a dud.I took my 13yo son to see this on the opening night. We both had seen the trailers, hated them, and had lowered our expectations accordingly - mine was at about IMDb 5. Of course you could ask why we bothered at all to see the movie if we had doubts. Well, in short - because we love the original and were desperate to like this one too. On the positive side I must say the new Ghostbusters started off alright and the first 30 mins or so showed genuine promise: the "comedic" scenes didn't drag as bad as they seemed in the trailers (might have been trimmed after backlash) and the scary scenes were undeniably scary. However, after a kind-of- promising start the movie started to edge the "horror" out of the "horror comedy" in favor of your typical Wiig/McCarthy humour. And as the movie progressed also the jokes started to lose steam because they followed the same formula. You know: deadpan comment on event or situation - deadpan response - deadpan response (repeat) - and then cut to action. Basically the last half of the movie I was checking my watch and waiting for another gratuituos cameo, or for it all to just end.Sony, do the smart thing and instead sequel, hit reboot. It's just like with the "Hulk" - movies: do them until you get them right. The world didn't need a sequel for a "Spiderman" starring Andrew Garfield. The cast (along with director Feig) are undeniably talented, but this is just your typical case of team not in sync with the material at hand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>firstly, people just need to chill out. after reading a few of these reviews before i went to watch it, i thought i was going to watch the worst film ever made. i was led to believe that this was unfunny, a rip off, visually poor including the 3D, no chemistry between the actors, man hating etc etc etc. in my opinion, i found none of this to be true. i laughed hard in many parts of the film. i thought Chris Hemsworth was really funny. McCarthy and Wiig were great as always. I genuinely ducked a couple of times at the frame breaking 3D. they gave homage to the original with cameos popping up and a nod to characters from the first one. don't get me wrong, I'm not saying its better than the first one, but i don't think people should be comparing it, they should just enjoy this film as a stand alone piece and enjoy it as its a good film. haters gonna hate, but there's far worse things going on in the world to be getting irate over a film. get over yourselves!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lazy reboot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You would think after thirty years from the original they could do better then this. Most of the jokes fall flat. There is plenty of times spent shooting at ghosts. Rather then attempt to do something a bit more original it seems they just tried to slide by with the female cast. Other movies were mentioned including "Jaws" and "Ghost" either are far better and certainly more original.The best thing about the movie were the cameos by the previous cast. Seems like they all showed up except Rick Moranis. It got to the point it didn't matter what was happening it was will the old cast continue to drop in.The movie has a few moments but not enough to recommend seeing it on the big screen. Some of the slime scene were effective in 3D but overall the effects weren't worth the up charge. Want to see Ghostbusters who you gonna call? Go with the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you liked the original Ghostbusters, don't waste your time and money on this. There is very little plot worth talking about, the dialogues are crude, juvenile and full of catch-phrases while the acting is downright annoying. Some scenes are a bad parody of the original while most of the jokes have been written by a 12-year old, I'm sure.Also, the movie is too long. I thought the torture would never end. If only they edited out some of the lame jokes it would improve significantly.However, I must admit that the visual effects are pretty good, even if the 3D effect makes it evident the aerial shots of New York are computer graphics.Three stars for the movie (including two for the visual effects) plus an extra one for getting Ozzy in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I enjoyed it! Average movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before anything, I just want to say that I'm a teenager. This movie was just a movie. Plain and simple. It had a plot, a climax, a conclusion and everything a movie needs. Was it great? No. Was it terrible? No. If you absolutely love the original Ghostbusters movie and don't want to see it tampered with, don't see it. If you are willing to see something different and have a couple honest laughs, see it. It's entertaining and funny. In my own opinion, the movie should be looked at as if it has no connection to Ghostbusters. Look at it as a comedic movie and you'll enjoy it. It reminds me of Jurassic World as you have to watch it without thinking to get an amazing experience out of it. Leslie Jones saved this movie for me. The first 30 minutes was unfunny with one of the first jokes being a fart joke. Leslie's character Patty was this outside perspective that I could relate with. Just sitting there being confused. On the other hand, Chris Hemsworth was probably the only person who got almost no laughs out of me. He was just stupid.In conclusion, this movie is an average summer movie. The Jurassic World of the Ghostbusters franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Biggest waste of time in Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was terrible, and quite possibly the biggest waste of time I have experienced in years, if not my lifetime. The characters were flat stereotypical of the genre. I expected so much more from a movie with Melissa McCarthy. The original ghost busters from 1984 with Dan Ackroyd, Harold Ramis, and Bill Murray, was much funnier, and was a great comedy over all. The circumstances of the plot fell through and never really delivered the expected hoo-haw that came with all the hype from before the movie was released. It just fell flat on its face. The characters were not at all believable. The effects were mediocre. and the ghost busting equipment looked like poorly made children's toy versions of the originals proton packs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What reaction do you expect if someone was to take some classic work of Art, lets say, a Painting of Signing The Declaration of Independence and Repainted it with all women instead of men? Do you think it would be nearly as good as the original?? Hardly. Since women didn't sign The Declaration. The men signed. For Men. What? The Patriarchy?? Jeanne D'Ark didn't have a problem with patriarchy. She fought, she won, then she was killed, but tough luck, sh*t happens, Karl. Braveheart died too. For Independence men fought and died. Surely a few women fought and died too, but what of it? Nothing special. People die in battles.Might it have been that the wives, of those men who signed The Declaration, passionately enjoyed their Victorean Romantic life styles with five o'clock teas and promenades through the garden alleys under the shades of silk umbrellas and fashionable little hats with blue ribbons and flowers awww, instead of actually doing the fighting for Independence of their country? I dunno. Seems kinda likely though. May be they just didn't want to die. Well, thus it's logical they weren't there to sign the Declaration along with Men.So, it appears to be kind of lame to see some dykes, some 30 years later after the original Ghostbusters, deciding they are finally ready to impress us with their hysterical Ghostbusting skills as if it ain't sh*t, "we'll do it between our women's studies classes" and you better laugh if you don't want to offend these strong Independent women, who actually managed to whine and nag their own Declaration of Women's Independence OUT OF MEN in which they BLAME men for not allowing women to express their allegedly just as equal skills, and so that's why men should just back the f**k off and let women be anywhere they wanna be and do what they wanna do, just because they wanna be there and just do it. Nice move. Guess who enforces their whining and infantile "doncha feels our pains and hard lives" Declaration? Men. LOL. No sh*t, Karl, wearing those tight corsets and big ass dresses must have been a real fight and a total buzz kill. Surely deserves a Declaration. I mean what a feat of self sacrifice. Surely, these are not the only heroic deeds of the original strong women who really suffered while men unfairly died in battles, completely disregarding the impact of real thug life wimmins in this war.They just told the men in their Women's Declaration that Hey.. we feel like bitches today so we will just call all of men the oppressors, forget all the years of protection and honorable service to women by men and everything men had to do to earn their position in life. Now women are entitled to anything a man has earned. How funny. A very clever move. A man becomes a champion - thus, make or break but make a woman the same kind of champion as well. Even if that female-champion runs slower then a fifteen year old male. HA HA HA. Very very funny. Get same praise and get paid equally. How ingenious. It's like paying 30 dollars for a Big Mac while pretending as if its just as good as a T-Bone Steak. WHO?? Who is the marketing genius behind that idea? Would be a bummer if it is again that same ol'man the oppressor. He just can't let go. Now the man has to find ways to oppress himself and praise the Big Mac. And God forbid you call the Big Mac a Big Mac. By the rules it's just as good as a T-Bone Steak. Equality son. It's like magic.They should have made a comedy based on that female Declaration of Independence from common sense and decency. Yeah. Tell it to Cleopatra, Catherine the Great, and a sh*t load of other women who achieved goals without any Declarations. Their success was their declaration. Just like The Declaration of Independence of 13 states is the declaration of another battle won by men, which doesn't excuse men for getting free gifts in the future or even allows much of any gifts at all or blames anyone in the past for men's failures. It's independence of States. Not Independence of Men from actually achieving goals. Which is what women's Declaration is - a Carte Blanche for their mood swings. You feel like being a fire-fighter girl? Sure thing, just go ahead and be what you wanna be. Who cares if you can't carry a heavy person out of a burning building because you weigh 120 pounds. We'll just tell everyone that you really tried and give you a medal for getting second degree burns and saving a cat. Cats are nice too. Wonna make a comedy girl? Lets hire you a team. What? You want to make Ghostbusters? No problems, how do you want it?? Do you want it to be fluffy and cute or angry and strong? Somewhere in the middle? Consider it done. Ohhh don't worry, everyone will love it, you are a genuine talent. What? Murray? Aykroyd? Pff.. are you kidding me?? You are like at least on the same level. It's gonna be a hit for sure. Anyone who says different is just a hater. You know - haters gonna hate. But you just go past them straight to those academy awards. I mean I don't guarantee an Oscar but how would you know if you didn't try. Now-days any dyke or a clueless try-hard rebel tom-boy, apparently, is just as good as Caesar himself and on par with Aphrodite in potential. It breaks my heart to see all that female talent go to waste from all these diabolical men with a sinister plan trying to suppress all that hidden blossoming talent which must be seen no matter the costs. Resistance is futile. All life forms will be assimilated.</fullReview>

Stereotype characters, all in reverse of the original film. I'm not sure what the agenda of this movie was? Men are idiots, women rule the world? Queef jokes, and ultimately the final boss scene, they destroy him by shooting him in the crotch.

		<fullReview>I'm serious. This movie is misogynistic, not the people who hate it. Every female character is badly written but Erin is the worse offender. The way she acts around Kevin is a male power fantasy about smart women acting stupid around men. No, a woman with half the IQ of Erin would say to Kevin after 30 seconds, "Look, you're cute, but you're so stupid you're obviously the product of inbreeding. Get out." And those of you who keep claiming there's no fat jokes? Yes they are! Like the misogyny they're subtle but they ARE there. All those moments with Abby and soup? The bit about the sandwich, her picking off others' food, and low blood sugar? Abby only being able to come up with soup as a good thing in the world? Those are ALL fat jokes. Cause "Oh, well, she's fat so she should be obsessed with food." Haha, very funny. Look, I'm fat, I know a fat joke when I hear one. The only saving grace of this movie is Leslie Jones. She deserves so much better. I want to see her in a horror-action flick where she's killing vampires or Lovecraft's Elder Gods. Cause she's amazing and I love her. But even she can't save this dreck.Still miles better than the Star Trek reboots though. Or as I call them, Star Wreck.</fullReview>

Alright, let's get to the movie. The female cast is a little awkward, you get the feeling that some actors aren't really that good. They seem to miss their lines or pronouncing the (obviously bad scripted)jokes wrong. After all, this was simply a terrible movie. Terrible acting and a terrible script.

		<fullReview>* * * SPOILERS * * *30 minutes in the movie and I was tired of it already.Anyway, like other reviewers have said, the opening scene was good and promising! The eery score morphs into the old theme song, and for a moment I got into it.But then the rest of the movie happened...Character presentation upon character presentation without any actual development. McKinnon was my favorite; she plays the eccentric Holtzmann, is a little over the top but it fits her. McCarthy delivers her same old schtick, so you know what to expect. Wiig is OK I guess, she didn't really stand out in any way. And Jones's character is just annoying and loud and at times glaringly stereotypical. Her acting was questionable as well; she may be a stand up comedian, but she's no actor. Hemsworth, contrary to what a lot of people seem to think, was not the best thing in this movie for me. He was unfunnily stupid and kind of a jerk. All these characters just come across as poorly drafted caricatures.The writing is... Well, here's an example: At multiple times, the characters are stating the obvious (exposition) while talking to themselves (Erin: "Abby, you promised you wouldn't publish". Patty: "Is he going on the tracks?") only to show that same thing play out in the very next scene! Just how dumb are audiences according to the writers??The humor is just a pile of questionable low-level jokes, to say the least: the queef joke (of which everyone heard by now, I guess) fell flat, and the soiling joke that just went on and on is worse than getting teeth pulled. I can count the number of times that I chuckled during this movie on one hand. The jokes and lines that did hit home, however, are overshadowed by cringe-worthy awful ones. (Kevin hits a Chinese gong and covers his eyes to protect himself from the loud noise, "because, you know, we're pointing out here that he's really stupid." IN WHAT UNIVERSE IS THAT FUNNY??? Oh my....) A really funny moment was Abby testing out the proton pack for the first time. Needless to say, it doesn't go too well and it's done in a great way. Of course followed by more exposition by the other characters OF WHAT WE ARE SEEING ON THE SCREEN FOR OURSELVES.The special effects are certainly not bad, but the ghosts are not even remotely scary. It really is just Scooby-Doo and Casper quality.Conclusion: there's nothing convincing or engaging or memorable about this movie and not because of its female cast; this movie is horrendously written, directed and executed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An embarrassingly poor movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not very often that I approach a movie with such low expectations, but when I do I am usually pleasantly surprised. Certainly not the case here. I cannot describe how dreadful this movie is. Dreadful direction, dreadful script, dreadful acting. This movie is just bereft of humour. I did actually manage one good laugh. Hemsworth's joke about his dog which he named Mike Hat. I did like that. But that was it. In two hours, one laugh. Unfortunately, it didn't add anything to the story. In fact, the movie is full of forced gags that don't add to the story in any manner.One of the endearing factors of the original Ghostbusters was the ease of which the leads rolled off each other, interacting seamlessly. With this remake, it's as if the leads were in separate rooms whilst performing. That's how much they lacked chemistry. Of the lead performances I thought Kristen Wiig was the best of a bad bunch. She can actually act. The rest really didn't offer anything to the point that you just don't care about any of them. They just didn't work together.On a budget of $150m I find it difficult to comprehend how they could make such a shambles of this. The biggest problem lies in the writing. Such a jumbled mess. Nothing makes any sense whatsoever in the story line. Feig surely must be embarrassed by his efforts here. Co writer and director. With the four leads potentially with so much to offer, he manages to turn them all into pieces of wood. The timing of everything is just off. I honestly believe that Ed Wood could have delivered a better effort. I honestly don't know how this got a Metascore of 60. There are far superior female led comedies out there with Metascores in the 20's. Walk of Shame and Head Over Heals spring to mind. An embarrassingly poor effort and such a shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has garnered a great deal of criticism as well as a defense from those who argue it is best to wait and see what the movie is before solely judging the quality based off of theatrical trailers. That is a fair statement, let us wait and see. However, this move is poorly acted, adds nothing new to the series, and relies heavily on jokes centered around the ineptitude and idiocy of men. In short, the maligned trailers aptly depicted the film.Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy are very talented and Leslie Jones has gifts as well, but each character was annoying and Kate McKinnon headlined the group. This movie is not funny, it is not creative, and it feels like a SJW's fan fiction on a blog post.I like the original film, but I do not adore it like others and it does not offer any nostalgia. However, it was unique, creative and it had four good actors who had strong chemistry. This film does nothing new, nothing creative, and the reasons behind making this film are quite clear. Even if the film featured four men as the leads I would still say it was a bad movie, the feminist aspect just makes it more unbearable.This is not the worst film of all time, but it is abundantly clear based off of the fact that toys for this movie are already on the clearance rack and movie-goers are tweeting pictures of empty showings, that this film is not good and the public knows it. People who stereotype critics of this film as being sexist or anything derogatory for that matter is wrong. This film is poorly put together, presented and lacks the qualities that made people revere the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sit down in the cinema with my popcorn and over priced drink hoping my friend was just being over dramatic and the film was going on to be OK to good, trailers come and go and the movie begins.The opening sets a really good atmosphere even if the guides reaction is a bit OTT, that gave me a good feeling about the film suddenly expectations and excitement grew. Unfortunately over the ten minutes that followed all that excitement would go. We meet Kristen Wigs character who for life of me can't remember her characters name (which shows how unremarkable she is) a brilliant physicist who later in the film has a laughable (not in a good way) sob story about the ghost of her neighbour and therapy as a child, turns out she and Melissa McCarthys character wrote a book about ghosts and Kristen is annoyed it's on Amazon "shocking drama". Melissa McCarthys character just comes across really snobby and unlikable, Holtz is slightly more memorable but again doesn't come across very well just really annoying rather than funny and then Patty. oh dear I feel for Leslie Jones I really do she's such a talent and to be reduced to playing a stereotype is just horrible to see. And everyone else in the film is basically stupid, unlikable or OTT. Kevin is the stupidest of them all and the characters especially McCarthys character never refrain from pointing it out which comes across as quite spitefulApart from the interview scene with Kevin the humour is awful, it's joke after joke hoping some would stick and none of them do they just fall really flat The directing is awful, felt at times like I was watching a TV movie or a student project it was that amateur. The score for the film was just as bad.And finally the CGI, I am shocked that a film with the budget it had would look that bad, it's the worst CGI I have seen in a movie for some time.In summary it's not the worst movie ever but it's by far the worst movie I've seen this year, which is such a shame, hoping to see strong women reboot a franchise and instead get boring, offensively stereotypical and occasionally spiteful women.</fullReview>

It was so bad, I actually did something I very rarely do, I walked out 2/3 of the way through. The weak cameos were not worth wasting another precious minute. Save your money and walk your dog, play catch with your kids, clip your toenails...anything would be more entertaining!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rushed CGI mess with few laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did no like the idea of Ghostbusters being rebooted. Some films should just be left alone. However, before seeing the movie, I decided to pretend there was no previous Ghostbusters films, in an attempt to be unbiased.The entire movie felt like a long SNL episode, with less laughs. The film's plot is not very strong, nor are the villain's motives. The film feels very rushed, as if the director was only concerned with packing in as much as possible into the film. I did not so much as crack a smile never mind laugh during the movie. There was also zero chemistry between the characters.Do yourself a favor, wait for this movie to play on television rather than spending your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A ghost after a single preview</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not even going to see this movie. The preview alone has destroyed my joy at the hope of a new Ghost busters movie.What did I expect. Well as a long time fan of both the series and the original characters, I wanted to at least see my favorite Ghost busters hand over the torch so to speak.What do I get instead. As many other reviewers have declared with horror, a current sign of the political times diatribe of women hating men scum bags.This is just plain wrong. The original ghost busters had absolutely nothing against women, in fact if you will recall it showed Sigourney Weaver as one of the most powerful women of all time. The Ghostbusters themselves were weenies compared to Doza etc.This is pure cashing in and the complete ruining of a great franchise. I'll bet Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson, Rick Moranis and Sigourney Weaver must be throwing up convulsively right now. This is down right mean and hurtful to all the great work they did.What a pile of instant trash and a tragedy. What could have been a great new Ghostbusters movie, instead has been thrown into a travesty unfunny comedy which is to the point that the studio who created this, should instantly put 250 Million+ into bringing back the classic Ghostbusters with the respect it deserves and get the original cast and writers to write the new script just to apologize to the legions of Ghostbusters fans around the world who have made it the success it was.... until now. SIGH!!!!!SHAME ON YOU COLUMBIA PICTURES.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's just a mixed bag</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Which is why I am giving it a five. Dislikes: 1) They made the movie self-aware. The original Ghostbusters was funny because of the situations and the commentaries by Peter on them. Example: when tracking slimmer in the original. Ray suggests they should split up, Egon agrees, and Peter makes the one liner "we can do more damage that way". They pass this style back in forth all through the movie. But at the core it is just 4 working stiffs that found something they were good at. 2) It is four Peter Venkmans and Kevin. They are all immature, there is no scientist, no childlike engineer, and blue collar worker. Just four comedians that try to one up each other. They have interesting characters, but they do not stick with that. Instead they just become four comedians trying to one up each other. In the original you know Ray was the one that messed up with bring the Stay Puft, why because he is the child like, fascinated by all of this and an engineer. By the end of the new Ghostbusters, they all came off as just the same character played by four people. Each basically showing off their one shot toys and each with the same look on their face. 3) They lost the threat. This one could have had a great threat to it. But the bad guy opening the portals should not have been the main threat. He was more like a minion who would have brought about Gozer, and Gozer would have probably killed him. Then have them battle that threat. I'm not asking for Gozer and actually am glad they did not go that route yet. But the pain and suffering that this bad guy brought was just watching him in that third act. He was great up until then. But they made a comedy instead of an adventure, horror, comedy, fantasy. 4) did not really need to be a reboot. The story was different, the people are different, the weapons are different. Should have just called it part 3 or 4 depending if you count the 2009 game. 5) The characters: Patty - should have been Kylie Griffin. Manager of an Occult bookstore that would have tied the scientist to the supernatural Holtzmann - should have stayed with the crazy mad scientist engineer. When she turns comedian instead of genius, she kind of lost me. Setting the lab on fire was good and the inventing and trying things out was good. The fart jokes, the mocking the government is where she is lost on me. Abby - should have been obsessed with the science to have actually built things. Instead she comes off as an idiot. The PK-Meter never done that before. Well who built the thing, maybe they should run it. Erin - should have been the comedian, or pure straight person. Brought in by her past which was good. The lady ghost standing at the foot of her bed, should have came back to either warn them or be the main villain. To me this was a waste of a good back story. Kevin - should have been just as involved but change him to the delivery guy of the Chinese restaurant who thinks he is the secretary for the Ghostbusters. Every line and funny moment just the same, only Erin could have meet him at Abby's lab only to have the office become upstairs to that restaurant. They could still rescue him at the end (with a better Villain). His flaw is they gave him the same line as Annie Pots right after she said it perfectly. 6) testing of field equipment. Why an Alley. We came to see Ghostbusters, not a paper ghost on a pole being shot at. All of this test equipment could have been played out on actual captures instead of an alley.Likes: 1) they tried. Better than just having it sit on the shelf, and nobody else was able to get it done. And they are going to try again (you either improve or get worse). They have funny lines, equipment, and ghost. If everything was told as it being actual instead of a joke it might have worked for me. 2) They put in a ton of references to the other movie. This movie I think will be watched and viewed over and over again as just a reference spotter. How many Easter eggs, cameos, and lines can you spot? This is going to be a cult classic just for that. I may still be laughing at it for years to come. 3) Mike Hat the Dog. Just about anything that was improvised by Chris Hemsworth was just odd, quirky, and the best parts of the movie. Chris may actually get more than just muscle roles after this. 4) Almost a super slammer. The greatest invention of all time was taking the Ecto-1 and adding a massive trap to the top of it for major ghost haunting. Although the movie does not give us this, it got close to it. But there was a lot of good new equipment, not all but enough. 5) crossing over to the other side. Some of the best stories for Ghostbusters usually had the team entering into the containment unit to find something. The movie almost got this. 6) the amount of graphics and details to them. Sure you may think it was poor CGI. But there is a style to it and there are more details there then what you first see. Blu-ray will probably bring those out. 7) the actors. I think they picked good people for this movie. If the characters were more defined each of them could have played with it more within their style. 8) the possibility of a director's cut. the director said he filmed almost four hours worth of a movie. There is probably a lot that should have been left in to make more sense of things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a travesty. The movie is a waste of celluloid and they don't even use that format anymore. There are cameos from the original cast with the exception of Rick Moranis and Siguorney Weaver. Why? Hopefully, because they saw the writing on the wall and took a pass. Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig did this with such lackluster I was ashamed for them. Paul Feig, I would ask how you went from great movies like Bridesmaid and Spy to this drivel? So you had a $165 million dollar budget and they roped you into this. It isn't about sexism. It's about doing a good job and the movie fails. It doesn't have the heart in it. It goes for quick humor and fails. Pratfalls and kind of gross out humor is what is tried to sell when you see this. I recommend you take a pass and teach Paul Feig that he can do better. Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig, need to go back to a thing that works for them and not get caught in the hoopla of Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just doesn't work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided I love the originals so I'm going to give this a go. I have lost out in the past by reading reviews and avoiding movies which as it turned out later I have really enjoyed. I don't actually really know where to start here.......1, The cast just doesn't work and the script which I think is supposed to be funny just isn't. I heard about 6 kids laughing at a couple of funny parts (they were all borderline 12). That was it. I genuinely tried to enjoy this mess(sorry movie) and I literally didn't laugh at all.2, You have three scientists and a street smart (token) black woman who shouts and screams at everything to make things funny (doesn't work in fact I came out with a bad head). There is just no chemistry there. Also the four are friends in about 2 seconds, Im also not naming characters. No point. 3, The special effects were on a par with a scooby do movie and the budget looked about the same. Plus the "ghosts" just look cheap CGI and I got bored with the predictable "slime" the same ghost buster repeatedly routine. 4, They go from no money to suddenly having amazing expensive and well put together kit. 5, Chris Hemsworth plays the receptionist, and this is the major criticism. He is literally so stupid and brainless (as are all the male cast) it's beyond sexist. He is actually the saving grace because he is quite funny despite the major character flaws. Slimer makes a cameo as do the remaining original ghost busters (minus Harold Ramis R.I.P and Ric Moranis who retired). I did try guys but the film is let down by a very weak script and director. I go into any movie and try to enjoy it on its merits but this mess had me shaking my head and contemplating why I had wasted 2 hours of my life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A CGI bore fest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this with an open mind as I do with all movies, even though this one had a lot of criticism before it even came out.I really wanted to like this, but just didn't. I heard it was half decent, but I didn't find it to be at all. This really wasn't memorable at all. Throughout the entire film, I wasn't having any fun. I was just bored. The worst thing a movie can be is boring and forgettable, which is what this turned out to be. The characters were incredibly annoying and unlikable cartoonish caricatures. The jokes they told weren't funny in the slightest- I didn't laugh once for the entire 2 hours. The film also relied on the comedy to carry this movie and didn't for me, which made it even more boring.The special effects were CGI overkill, and the fact the the entire plot relied on them being believable, really hurt this film.There is a 20 second scene at the end which connects this to the original, but considering you have to wait through 10 minutes of credits first, it isn't worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spoiler-free, but it is rather spoiled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We have a lot of ground to cover, so let's address the elephant in the room first. This is not a feminist movie. I am not a misogynist for disliking it. I can explain myself simply in this: The movie is bad because of the MALE DIRECTOR not the female cast.With that out of the way, let's dive in.This movie does have some genuinely funny moments, most notably Chris Hemsworth's Murray-worthy ad-libbing and Kate McKinnon is obviously the only other person having fun on-set. Oh, look, I liked the pretty ones, I must be a real misogynist. No. I'm not. I just recognize when actors are giving it their all and not just checking off the boxes on their 'emotion' checklist for a scene. Supposedly Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig both hated working on this movie, and it shows.Now for the significant problems: The script is terrible. I mean, it's god awful. The plot is almost complete drivel, the villain is bland and cookie-cutter, the special effects are CGI cartoons (and an ACTUAL cartoon at one point, which made me literally groan out loud.) The entire movie isn't a real Ghostbusters movie, it's a spoof on Ghostbusters, and done without the heart or love that anyone who actually likes Ghostbusters would have. The jokes are a theme-less combination of slapstick, grossout humor, awkward pauses and occasional cerebral jabs. Much like the rest of this movie, which tonally, is completely all over the map. One of our first jokes is a fart joke (Or a queef joke. Good job, Paul. Gurl Power,) and yes, there is a scene where Melissa McCarthy straps on a proton pack and ends up falling on her butt. Oh, Paul Feig, master of wit, do show us the way. The story itself has major problems with tone, having two deaths come before a grand CGI finale with a giant cartoon ghost and crotch-shots with proton guns.The entire third act is a green-screen nightmare of lunacy with parts apparently specifically shoe-horned in to irritate and infuriate the fans, including at one point Slimer and a female Slimer (you can tell because it has a beehive wig and lipstick. What gender-bending insight!)Finally, the supposedly awesome Girl Power fight scene comes after an entire movie of the women being, basically, bumbling fools. It's almost blatantly manipulative, and underwhelming, very obviously trying to give us an epic scope and feel... for all of three minutes before the movie is back to dumb jokes about the mimbo secretary and cartoony special effects.But here's where pretty much the entire movie, tone, premise, marketing, concept, defenders, and SJW ranters all fall apart. See, the mayor of New York and the Department of Homeland Security know the Ghostbusters are fully qualified and capable of handling the supernatural threat, and encourage them to do so, but their efforts are swept under the rug and the mayor's office officially labels them as frauds "so as not to cause a panic."So let me get this straight... the supposedly feminist movie about four female characters features a powerful male figure condemning their efforts while, in secret, encouraging them to keep trying?And I'm the misogynist for thinking that the world, and women specifically, deserve a better movie than this? Well, I've got one thing to say to Sony, the complicit mass media, the screaming defenders of this movie, and every idiot who tells me not supporting this movie is tantamount to misogyny:Queef jokes.That's what we've been brought. If I were a woman, I'd punch Paul Feig in his smug little face and shove a proton-gun shaped tampon up his... nose.See, I can be civil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it funny yet?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie trying to ignore all the internet hate that it seemed to generate. I make up my own mind and c'mon; it has Melissa McCarthy in it so it can't be that bad, right?? Wrong. Oh so wrong. To me, it felt like there was no chemistry among the leading characters and every attempt at humor was very forced and flat. It didn't have any of the camaraderie of the original Ghostbusters at all. I did like Kate McKinnon's character, though; she seemed to be having the most fun and she made the scenes with her in them the most enjoyable to watch. Problem is that her enthusiasm just didn't permeate the rest of the cast, which is sad because there was so much potential. I kept waiting for it to be funny, but it just never really happened. (To be fair, I also didn't like Ghostbusters II for many of the same reasons. Just wasn't as good as the original) The cameos from the original GB cast were okay, with Dan Aykroyd and Annie Potts being the best in my humble opinion. Sigourney Weaver's was pretty good, too, now that I think of it. The special effects were outstanding, I will give it that much, but then again special effects are pretty easy to create nowadays. There is a teaser at the very end after all the credits are done rolling so if you go to see it, be sure to stay.</fullReview>

Not nearly as creative as the first, was looking for a refreshed and updated version. But there was ZERO chemistry between the actresses, jokes were like 'ah, yeah'. I don't know who did the casting for this movie but not a good job in the selection of the actresses. There are so many funny gals out there who would have rocked in these rolls, but they chose some nobodies and some sorta funny talent like Kristin Wiig. What about Silverstone, what about Amy Poehler...etc Instead they looked under the comedy rug and swept out the cheapest talent they could throw together. WTF! Please try this again and get it right! Maybe with the sad passing of Harold Ramis and his creative directing\writing this movie would have edged a little higher?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Full disclosure: I rated movie about a 7.5/10. But if there are going to be all these bizarrely negative votes, I am going to bump up my rating to counter some of them!All of the women were funny. Melissa McCarthy was cute and held the audience. There were some flat bits, and the film lacked a solid B- story line: there were no love interests, no sick mothers, no weird housemates, no jobs outside of ghostbusting - nada. It made the movie a little predictable.However, the special effects were great and there were some fun moments. If you have a kid aged 12-16, they would love Ghostbusters. For the adults, Leslie Jones was fab, really sassy and funny, and Kate and Kristen both had time to shine.Also, holy heck, Chris Hemsworth. I loved the way he and Paul Feig sent up that old 80s trope of the secretary so silly she can't even work the phones. It seemed to be in every second movie when I was a young kid. It was so on point and quite intelligent. NOT MISANDRY. NOT AN ATTEMPT TO PUT DOWN MEN, just good fun with a bit of a deeper message.The best scenes: when the Ghostbusters are testing the equipment in the alley; some of the banter between them all; the demon ghost at the weird day concert; and the credits. More Hemsworth. That was worth half the ticket price alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this last week. While it's not the worst comedy I've ever seen, it was very boring for me, for two reasons. I fault the writing for me not liking it, not the actors or the director (well, maybe a little on the director). First is that it seemed like every, or every other line had to be a joke. You could see them coming, predictable, and no surprises. Second, none of the characters were a "straight man" or voice of reason. Every single star had to try and make jokes. A "normal" or non-joking character makes any comedy funnier. Case in point, the original Ghostbusters. Bill Murray was the jokester, the rest of the characters were either victims of his jokes, or of the circumstances, and that made it all that much more funny to me. All 5 main characters in this movie were written like stand up comedians. I fell asleep once.</fullReview>

The equipment and vehicle were top notch. However, I was mortified by the trailer and appalled at the final product. There were 2 "feel- good" team up moments, but the following moment would completely erase the "feel-good" with a painful attempt at comedy. These women can be funny, they just....weren't.I haven't seen many people walk out of a theater, but 10% of my audience had left by the climax.

And that's it.It's racist (token black person), sexist (they only have Chris Hemsworth because of his looks) and feminist propaganda (gender- swapping roles and shooting a ghost in the genitals). It's poorly written and the effects are too "Scooby Doo" quality, and that's not a good thing. Do yourself a favour and don't see it. Go watch the original two Ghostbusters films and the Real Ghostbusters cartoons instead. Overall, it is not completely terrible, but still bad and would not be made if the gender of roles were not reversed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An embarrassment to the film industry, to acting and mankind in general</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Didn't see a lot of trailers because i don't want to be spoiled, Maybe i should have.The only remotely funny thing i found in this catastrophe of a movie is a fart joke at the beginning. First thing: this movie is sexist. Every single male (except the last cameo) is either inept at his job, a coward or completely retarded. How to kill the villain ? hit him in balls. The "funny" in the movie: well, a fart joke. That's it. The rest is embarrassing to watch, the chemistry between the actors is nonexistent, thus the lines seems monotonous and comes out forced. I felt sorry for the actors they had to do this. It's like a direct to video that went on the big screen just because of the franchise. Sharknado became good because it was so bad. This ghostbusters can't even claim that. It's just bad and can never be good.Do yourself a favor and just buy the two original movies. It's like comparing Mona Lisa with a paint of a house made by a 3yo with his own feces.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical unnecessary, soulless and banal remake with the added twist of having an agenda.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Ghostbusters from 1984 is a staple of my childhood. It was funny, it was action packed and at times even a little scary. It was the perfect combination of its parts. So naturally Sony decided we needed a reboot. I know that I am supposed to judge a move on its own merits, which by the way it would still suck the big one if I did just that, but when you consider how good the original is and how much it is ingrained in my psych, I am afraid that that just won't happen. In sum this, in my opinion, is the worst remake since the day the earth stood still.This movie lost me early on with a queef joke. I know that would probably get me labelled as a misogynist, I mean how dare I not laugh at a woman's vagina. But seriously though, its just the female version of a fart joke. Is this the standard of comedy we are going to be subjected to for the next 90 minutes? It as we all know stars an all female cast with the occasional idiot male thrown in. I have nothing against female Ghostbuters. But what was the point. The original may have had an all male cast in the main roles but that was never the point. The film never made out its female characters to be less than the men. I mean how could you see Sigourney Weaver as anything less. This new one however makes it very clear, with the framing of the male characters as being either completely stupid or villains, that it has a clear anti-male agenda. It is at times baffling mean spirited towards males as if it has some sort of axe to grind. Now I for one know that woman can be funny, clever and they can certainly kick arse. But the cast and crew of this dross tries way to hard to ram that point in that they forgot to actually make a good movie. Ghostbusters 1984 was original and clever with no agenda aside from just telling a good yarn. Ghostbusters 2016 is an unoriginal and very trite movie that will never be able to stand on its own without the aid of a bunch of PC twits going out and seeing it to support the sisterhood, all because they were fooled by a movie studio into believing that the poor reception to the trailers was a result of sexism. No! The poor reception is the result of a very poor movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This does contain a spoiler, but not enough to spoil this film any more than it does on its own.I've spent much of the last few hours trying to think of films I've seen that are as bad as this. I can only think of a few (Mr Nanny, Hellraiser Revelations, Jaws 3D, Gothic). The only two highlights of the film consisted of Dan Ackroyd's brief cameo and that the film eventually ended.Bill Murray's appearance, as paranormal 'debunker' Martin Heiss (too close to Martin Weiss!) was an utter waste of his talents. I hope he was being paid well.This film was always going to be compared to the original, and it doesn't compare at all. The cast are horrendous! I've never seen any of the four main 'actors' before, and never want to see them again. Every one of them made me cringe with their appalling performances.I'd heard a while ago that the film would cast four women as the Ghostbusters, and that would have been a great move if the casting was better.Melissa McCarthy was dreadful throughout. I didn't know her name but am informed that she was the 'awful American' that made 'Spy' unwatchable last year. Kate McKinnon (never heard of her) was difficult to understand at times and cringe-worthy most of the time. Leslie Jones (never heard of her) was annoying every time she opened her mouth. I'm surprised she was happy with this role; it was awful and generally pointless. Kristen Wiig (never head of her) was poor and unsure if her character was intelligent or not, and put in a far too weak performance for a lead role. Possibly the weakest of the four, but not by much.There must have been four better actors that could have been cast than these!Dan Ackroyd suggested these are the best in female comedy. If this is the case then female comedy is extinct, Americans are no judges of what is funny (highly likely) or Dan needs to visit the UK where women make up a large percentage of the best comic talent on TV. US sitcoms might be able to get away with such poor attempts at (child) humour but movies need to be of a far better standard.What Chris Hemsworth was doing by accepting his role I don't know. I'd have expected a lot better from him. Charles Dance appears. What on Earth is he doing in this awful film?! Who played the villain?! Don't know his name and don't want to. Easily forgettable and best kept that way.The script is terrible. There were 3 or 4 scenes of pointless gibberish which could have easily been cut and not impacted on the storyline, for what it is. The attempted humour is very noticeable as being 'American'. The 'humour' consists of saying silly things in silly voices or accents, making stupid noises, dancing around like idiots and a fart. It's pathetic at best.The original theme song, by Ray Parker Jnr, did get a very quick play early in the film. Later on a cover version, which is an assault on anyone's hearing, was played. The original soundtrack was unique and suits the film very well. Its modern equivalent would have only been improved by its total absence.The special effects seemed to be influenced more by Ghostbusters 2 than its predecessor. The early appearance of a ghost was a clear nod to the original, as well as the Marsh Mallow Man's cameo. The affects were good but don't appear to have come far from the early 1990's. Another ghosts appeared to have been of a criminal executed by electric chair. This appeared to be a reference to the Ghostbusters 2 courtroom scene.Any self-respecting Ghostbusters fan will NOT add this awful waste of space to their DVD collection. If I had gone to see the film on my own I'd have walked out well before the end. We need to hope that this film is a complete flop otherwise we'll be assaulted with a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is Sony bribing critics?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the first trailer of this awful reboot came out, I knew it would be horrible. Guess how many likes does it have. Last time I checked, it had 272K likes and 942K dislikes. I was one of those who disliked it. Paul Feig, you raped our childhood! Hollywood is running out of ideas now. I'm not against the cast being all female, but add the title Ghostbusters and our childhood has been raped. I really should have saved my money for Jason Bourne or Suicide Squad. First, the good things in the movie:None.Nothing is good about this movie. Some of the flaws:1. Humor. Literally, I wanted to throw up in the theater. The jokes are not funny at all. Not even a single laugh, chuckle, or smile came from me watching this. 2. Story. There's no story. It's all about (unfunny) jokes. More like or childhood in ruins.3. Cameos. Poor Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, and Sigourney Weaver. Their cameos were terrible. Not even their appearances can save this movie. I'm glad Harold Ramis didn't see this nor make an appearance. 4. CGI and visuals. God, aside from Fant4stic, the CGI and visuals are one of the worst I've seen in my life. It made me feel like I'm watching a Scooby-Doo and Casper movie.5. Death of the last ghost. Want to know how the last ghost died? His dick got shot. Very dumb.6. Acting. The acting is so terrible. I don't think the cast were happy to be part of this movie either.7. After end credits scene. Was this necessary?8. Ghosts. As said, in number the terrible CGI and visuals made me feel like I'm watching a Scooby-Doo and Casper movie. 9. Theme song. Poor Fall Out Boy. They wasted their talent on a terrible film. Their song for this film will make your ears bleed. Maybe they too aren't happy with a female remake of Ghostbusters.And the list goes on. This movie makes Batman and Robin look good. The Phantom Menace puts this to shame. I wasted another hour and a half of my time watching trash. Do not watch this film! Do you want to be dumb? Do you want to rape our childhood? Then watch this.1/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Ghostbusters had a few moments of humor that would do well as a DVD release or streaming movie but to sit in a theater and watch the name Ghostbusters be butchered is horrible. I saw the original in the theater and it was a thrilling experience as a kid. A better idea for cast would have been an all female team joining forces with a senior male team, like passing a mantle type plot. Overall I felt the visual effects were good but the casting and the premise of the movie is just wrong. It felt FORCED FORCED FORCED, and I am a gender equality supporter. It would have been interesting with Paul Rudd, Seth Galifianakis, or other comedic actors (no Adam Sandler types dear god no). The all woman lead was overwhelming and felt exclusive and preachy. Kate McKinnon is just ADORABLE in anything she does and I paid more attention to her than anyone else, except Leslie Jones who I think is great talent. I have to give this a one star for a movie with no depth and minimal comedic value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bad bad remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been skeptical of this film pretty much from the moment it was announced. And that the trailers/marketing, that god-awful cover of the theme song, and especially the way the cast and crew painted everybody who dared to say they were skeptical as sexist trolls, didn't do much to dissuade that. So needless to say, going in my expectations were about as low as as possible for a film. The good news is, its not AS terrible as I feared. The bad news is, its still pretty terrible. The biggest problem with Ghostbusters, is that pretty much everything about the movie feels forced. The jokes, the relationships between the four Ghostbusters, the winks and nods to the original, the characterization of the bad guy, the techno babble the big battle sequence at the end. None of it felt genuine. Pretty much everything in the film felt like 'this is a movie, and this is whats supposed to happen in this movie.' There's far too much reliance on zany/wacky humor. There's very few quotable lines. Certainly none that are as memorable as 'tell him about the Twinkie.' Or 'Dogs and cats living together.' I guess if like that style of humor(think Bridesmaids, but less crude), you might like the jokes in this film. But its not my thing. The winks and nods to the original just don't work. They're not subtle enough to be overlooked(like in say, Total Recall), and pull you out from the movie, forcing you to think about the far superior original. I'm not just talking about the cameos(which this film would be much better without), but also the way that certain scenes are almost shot-for-shot identical to scenes in the original. Its a bit of departure from a strict review, but I want to talk about the techno babble in this film. Part of what made the original film so great was that Dan Aykroyd is a true-blue believer in the paranormal, and based the story and script on actual pseudo- scientific theories. The result being that for a film about ghosts, it has a real feel of authenticity. When terms that have their origin in pseudo scientific circles are used in the film, feel like they are legitimate and being used in the proper way. In the remake though, it feels more like Paul Feig put a bunch of 'science-y' sounding words in a hat and drew them out randomly. You know how in Star Trek, the plots are always solved by a series of gibberish that sounds almost, though not quite like actual science? Yea that's pretty much what Ghostbusters sounds like too. It was annoying in Star Trek, but we put up with it for the otherwise interesting plots and characters, and this film is lacking in those departments. So there were good things about this film right? Well yes. Chris Hemsworth was pretty funny as the dopey secretary. Pretty much all of the laughs of the film came from him, and he clearly had a LOT of fun playing the bad guy when his character got possessed. In fact pretty much the entire cast really did seem to be enjoying shooting this film, although in Kate McKinnon 's her hi-jinks came across more annoying than endearing. But still its just a shame that this film wasn't better so you could enjoy it with them. TLDR: Don't see this film. I tried to warn you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this 2016 remake with the best intention of discovering its high points despite the negativity. I failed, and so did Ghostbusters. The plot is disjoint, the characters are shallow, the acting is unconvincing, the humor is forced, and the effects are mediocre. The movie feels like an SNL parody at best and a cash-grab through exploiting the Ghostbusters name and media controversies at worst. It is an insincere attempt to invigorate a beloved series that can hurt the franchise in the long run.I hoped Chris Hemsworth's Kevin would bring some genuine laughs, but his role was just one big cameo and a mockery of the movie's shortcomings. Paul Feig's Ghostbusters has no novelty, no wit, no excitement, no surprise, no cool factor and no memorable moments. One does not have to look into the stereotyping and sexism to reckon that this is a sub-par movie be it sci-fi, horror or comedy.The only redeeming value is a chance to see the old cast and, surprisingly, Melissa McCarthy and Leslie Jones not going overboard with their performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Turned a Classic into a B Movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the very beginning, everything seemed like a low budget movie. They had better design, graphics, and animation in the original 1984 version. One would think that with modern technology being what it is, this should have been able to put the 32 year old original Ghostbusters to shame. Sadly, I kept watching it until the end, in hopes of ANYTHING getting better. Even the jokes throughout the movie lacked any decent punchline to them. I worried when I originally heard they were remaking this film that they would ruin the classic, but I remained optimistic regardless of what my gut told me. I can understand that some, or all, of the original writers from 32 years ago were probably unavailable for this version. However, whoever did write this and whoever did direct this, I beg of you, PLEASE SEEK A NEW FIELD OF EMPLOYMENT!!! YOU SUCK AND YOU RUINED TIMELESS CLASSIC WITH THIS GARBAGE. As for the women roles, male or female doesn't matter. There was definitely talented and actresses chosen to play the lead roles, but unfortunately, even these 4 women (and Chris Hemsworth) seemed like they were acting in nothing more than some skit on SNL. I'm ASHAMED of Hollywood for producing such a disgraceful remake! Hope you are losing your butts big on this one!!!</fullReview>

From the get- go this movie did not sit well for me, and no, it's not because of the all-female cast. It's the fact that the trailers made the movie look bad. There was not one thing funny about the trailers, and it's sad because all four women are very funny otherwise. The movie did have some funny parts, there is no denying that. Those moments however did not feel like they belonged in this movie. Even though the original Ghostbusters and let's say a movie like Bridesmaids are both comedies, they are not the same kind of comedy, and when you try to put jokes that belong in one movie into the other it just doesn't work. Aside from those very few funny moments the rest of the movie was just boring. The only character I really liked or felt any kind of anything for was Leslie Jones's character, and I absolutely HATED Kate McKinnon's character. The cameos were unexpected, fun, and well appreciated. In the end this movie was exactly what I was expecting it to be, and I hope like hell they do not make a sequel. Some remakes just don't need to exist, and this is one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disappointing?as a fan of the original Ghostbusters I was looking forward to seeing this remake (can't stand the word reboot, it's a remake). I was a bit apprehensive when I watched the trailer as the cast is now all women including Melissa McCarthy (known for her slapstick comedy roles). However I went to watch it with an open mind hoping it would be good. Sadly for me the film just didn't work. Within just the first few minutes I found myself comparing this remake to the 1984 cult classic and wished I was watching it. The biggest let down for me were the characters, Holtzmann played by Kate McKinnon was unbelievably cringeworthy. Every time McKinnon went into one of her 'zany' rants you could feel the whole cinema breathe a sigh of relieve when she had finished. For me this remake was really trying too hard to be a comedy and really wasn't funny at all. This film should be aimed at young kids that haven't seen the original and may find some of the one liners vaguely entertaining. For any fans of the 84 classic don't bother watching this as you will leave the cinema feeling cheated and wishing you had just watched the original.</fullReview>

It was a 2 hour dick, fart, and vagina joke with ghosts. By that I mean there was literally a fart joke in the first 15 minutes and (SPOILER ALERT) they shot a giant ghost smashing the city in the dick. I think I may have enjoyed it a little bit if McCarthy and Wiig weren't in it. McCarthy played the same character she plays in EVERY MOVIE she's in. Wiig is just annoying and not funny, the other two were meh. The plot was terrible and it was obvious Papa Johns and Pringles got a cut. The worst part was the end when you find out it was just leading in to ANOTHER movie. The reason the first Ghostbusters was funny was because it was a somewhat serious movie with Bill Murray cracking jokes, this movie was literally everyone trying to be funny and none of them were. It wasn't just me, no one in the theater except a couple teen aged girls laughed, like no one. The reason I saw it wasn't as bad is because I seriously thought I'd want to leave halfway through, but I didn't get that feeling. That's the only reason. I can say I won't ever watch it again though, that's for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A psychic review of Ghostbusters 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please lie down on the couch. Place your head on the ample rest. Feel the soft touch of cool Italian leather begin where your Bermuda shorts and Polo short sleeves end. That's it. Take a slow, deep breath. Kick off your Sketchers. Exhale. Slowly.... We're almost ready to experience GB3. It will be a psychic viewing--not Remote Viewing! Don't get ahead of me! There now...that's better. We'll begin. Remember how great "Meet the Parents" and then the sequel featured Barbara Streisand? Stop jerking! Good. It's a little like shock therapy at first, but I'm just establishing a referential base line. Remember Michael Keaton as "Batman" twice, and then George Clooney showed up in the series? Your twitching will subside in a few seconds. Who played Robin in that one? Gritting your teeth doesn't help. Good. Just one more question before you experience GB3. Remember Peter Sellers in the Pink Panther series and then Steve Martin in the remake? Was that a gasp?! Perfect! Roll the credits. See them projected on the inside of your eyelids. See the blue-green glow effects? Feeling a little queasy? OK. That's normal. Do you watch and enjoy the current SNL? That's what I thought. The credits are almost finished and here's the show. When I snap my fingers you'll wake up. SNAP!!! If you realize two hours of your life is missing, then recovery from the procedure I've just performed will not end, like the movie, in a psychotic episode. If you're a 20th Century male, you've been castrated. If you're an empowered Boomer female, you're affirmed and just a little frightened. If you're of indeterminate sexuality, that's the ticket! Oh, and by the way--Donald Trump may be our next President! Nurse!!! Intubate!!! And does anyone here know how to call 9-1-1?!! Get my lawyer on the phone...I want my money back! After he deals with this mess....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was made only for feminists and had poor graphics. I can't believe it even got funded or was shot.This was the most unfunny and dull movie I've ever seen. I feel like I was ripped off and my movie ticket was free. I wish I could go back in time and prevent me from going.The effects looked like they were made with a overhead projector.The plot wasn't expanded enough to merit a sequel.Seriously who gave them money do troll real ghost busters fans?Ghost Busters 2016 is, in fact, so bad I'm waiting for ISIS to take credit for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would have given it two stars if they would have tried harder and put even a little original work into the film.Some say this film is getting low reviews because there are women in it. Seems to me with the uniforms and appearances, two or three of the actors might have been men - but who cares what bathroom they visit.I'm not sure what a reboot means in this concept. Make it like the original but without humor or cast chemistry?It was like your neighbor going to Vegas, watching a magic show and coming home to reenact it for you. Painful. Or your son's second grade class acting out La Cage aux Folles = just dreadful.Anyway, this might be palatable if you have a carload of kids to keep busy and there is a dollar matinée nearby.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No wonder they had to threaten Bill Murray with litigation to get him on board</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Full disclosure - I'm no fan of reboots in general, and can barely recall a reboot I really liked. Then again, this one is by far the worst one I've ever seen, and it makes even something like the new Nightmare on Elm Street shine in comparison.Dialogues are forced and dumbed-down and the genre has been switched up from the original's dark comedy to an all-family infantile flick. Your 5-year-old will likely enjoy it, whereas your 8-year-old will tell you that it's childish and silly.Come to think of it - the entire Hollywood comedy genre has been experiencing a slow, agonizing, death over the course of the past 20 years. Political correctness and lack of new talent are the two main perpetrators. I think this was the last nail in its coffin.RIP Hollywood comedy. You are missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Faith in Human Decency Lost</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My faith in human decency has been lost. For such a great movie franchise to be rebooted in such a horrible manner is disgusting and disrespectful to the original cast. If there was a personification of this movie it would be a large amount of fecal matter. Truly, society as a whole has sunken to a new low with this one. Somewhere on the line of making this atrocity, someone somewhere should have put a stop to this unforgivable sin against all mankind. If there is truly any justice in the world this movie will be a flop and it will be a warning to never make such an unwarranted reboot ever again. Help the souls of the men and women who helped make this movie as they will probably burn for all eternity for their transgressions against mankind. An all around awful movie and I DEMAND you do not go out and see it but if you do, bring something with you that will help gouge your eyes out after the pain they will surely endure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Spoilers: It might be fun for people into low-brow humor or little kids under 10, but no one else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And this is certainly not saying that this is "the Worst Movie Ever". Certainly not. I've seen worse production quality before and as far as certain elements in the movie are concerned, it isn't beyond mind-numbingly bad as people might think. However, that being said, a good movie is a complete picture, not a broken picture with a few good elements tossed in. I like looking at the product AS A WHOLE and stepping back a few paces and looking at it with objective eyes, I don't like what I see. Maybe I'm just not into unsubtle, low-brow, slap-stick, toilet-quality humor in films, but I feel that this particular trope has been WAY overdone by Hollywood and media in general. There are just no subtle comedies anymore, just the same old over-the-top, in-your-face crud that lost its appeal years ago. And if this had been all, if the executives at Sony just let all this hate and emotion play out without getting involved, just simply let people voice their frustration and impatience at such lack of innovative creativity, they might have gotten off the hook with this one. Unfortunately, they stoked the fires intentionally just to promote their film. Instead of relying on creativity, or developed characters or a good plot or awesome CGI effects, they simply relied on hate. This mean-spirited marketing was not in tune with the original Ghostbusters (1984) campaign when they promoted scientific curiosity in the supernatural and the natural wonder of CGI. They exploited the best, not the worst, of the audience. It is what made it a classic that was special in the hearts of all people, not just millennials. And now, 32 years later, seeing what this franchise has devolved into makes me want to completely shut out mainstream Hollywood altogether. Not to mention that Sony has a history of unethical practices (buying good reviews: http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sony-pays-for-fake-reviews/; Blackmailing celebrities: https://wikileaks.org/sony/emails/emailid/104704) in their entire production and have basically shut out all rational, educated discourse in favor of polarizing controversy and hatred. This is a company I cannot support, which is why I cannot support this film. It's more or less my disgust at Sony rather than a disgust at the less-than-stellar quality of this film that is making me give this a 1 rating, and that is me being honest. I agree to disagree, but my mind is made up and I have spoken.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The writer/director Paul Feig must pay for this abomination!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the worse movies that I have ever seen. I am not some huge Ghostbusters movie fan but this is an embarrassment to their legacy. It is not funny, the writing is horrible and the plot is boring. There is no chemistry and the acting is extremely poor. The entire movie felt like a bad Saturday Night Live skit (Yes, I am aware that most of the cast is from the show). We must find this writer/director Paul Feig and make him pay for what he has done. I am very serious about this!!Also, the editing was horrible. In the scene where Patty is showing the rest of the crew where she saw the ghost in the subway her necklace that says "Patty" is upside down and backwards for a couple of seconds of one scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Girls Just Wanna Have Some Ghostly Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What always appealed to me about the original 1984 hit was its unique sense of humor that never tries too hard. It's not quite imitated successfully with this remake of &#x200b;Ghostbusters, in fact it switches back and forth between trying too hard, not trying hard enough and hitting it just right. A majority of the humor between three of the four leads stems from intentional discomfort. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it just gets on my nerves. Overall, the humor is hit or miss, but there were moments that did genuinely make me smile. Just a word of caution though: there is one fart joke that falls flat in the first ten minutes, but just one, and it's thankfully not cringe worthy enough to hurt the rest of the film.So now let me get to the real matter at hand: the four women replacing the famous foursome.Kristen Wiig is the new Bill Murray of the team. She plays a psychology professor at Columbia University whose book about the paranormal has been published online by her co-author/ longtime friend without permission. Wiig plays her character's discomfort as calmly as possible, even while getting repeatedly puked on by ectoplasm. It's not the best role she's played, but it will pass. It's also worth noting that the conflict with the book publishing sparks the events leading to the team, yet it is never resolved or even mentioned again after the first act.She is for sure the one who stands out beside her old friend Melissa McCarthy, who plays the Dan Aykroyd of this team. She's alright when paired with Wiig, but stands for not much else besides playing off the others.Saturday Night Live performer Kate McKinnon is the Harold Ramis of the team, quiet but spunky with her gadgets. She is easily the most likable of the ladies.But then there's Leslie Jones, who plays the Ernie Hudson of the group. She's the African American subway guard who joins the team purely for comic relief and nothing more. Now, Jones certainly tries her hardest with the direction given, but she still appears overall offensive to Black women by the way she screams all her lines, as well as one piece of dialogue that states how Black women know the most about New York City. Well, that's certainly not a debatable statement at all, now is it?As much fun as the cast may seem to be having, the movie's reversal of gender roles in an attempt for social correctness is getting us absolutely nowhere. In fact, all the negative stereotypes are still very much here, just in a different way than we're expecting. Take a look at who Chris Hemsworth plays: he's cast as the eye candy that parallels the dumb-blonde secretary, with emphasis on the dumb part. He only got the job because the other ladies find him hot, and their interview with him consists purely of girly flirting. Now, Hemsworth is for sure the funniest character in the cast, but his shallowness still adds to how confused Ghostbusters is in terms of social correctness.What exactly did director Paul Feig (Bridesmaids, Spy, The Office) get right with his rehash of the classic? He still flings elements of mystery fun with the equipment testing and ghost hi-jinks in a rock concert. I can even forgive him for the awful special effects, because the feeling of cheesy hysteria still remains. But it's still difficult to recommend because of the lack of real tension behind anything that happens. It's not just because of the unresolved subplots, but because of the main villain's lack of any motivation to fill New York with ghosts. Seriously, it's never explained.Overall, Ghostbusters is not the worst thing ever, like the YouTube comments made it out to be, and it is still a satisfactory feature without the original, but I doubt any lasting satisfaction could land from this wild heap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>literally one of the most boring films I've seen in a while. The blatant feminazi agenda was pretty obvious even from the trailer, especially when you look at how men are generally portrayed in the film (like idiots). honestly I felt like I wasted a serious chunk of time watching this and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.I thought the only decent part of the film was the CGI, but really that's to be expected in a high budget sci-fi film in 2016...the attempts at humor were mildly entertaining, but never really got me laughing. Additionally, I found the plot, villain, and character development very lackluster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** This review may contain spoilers ***Chris Hemsworth made me laugh, but otherwise they made all men look stupid. The "Girl Power" failed attempt failed because men will be turned off to this movie. Many will blame men as the reason for the failure for this movie, but this movie failed to court men in any capacity which is why you are seeing all this heat around this movie. Each lead is funny in there own right, but not as a team. The chemistry is just not there and they force it which is the wrong thing to do. The ending completely ended any love I had for the franchise with the massive release of ghost. It just looked silly with all the CGI used and the ghost look like they were borrowed from a Disneyland ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an absolutely abhorrent, abysmal, distasteful piece of crap this was. Way to butcher a classic! The original has everything this movie doesn't; and this movie lacks everything the original had; wit, personality, charm, a fun concept that in that magical way some movies just ... work, worked ...When Bill Murray flirted with Weaver in the original, and behaved just within the lines of what some may see as sexism, the ludicrous attempt to "counter" from a female viewpoint in this remake was just pathetic and outright man-hating, bashful.I sincerely hope the studio loses money on this film. That small shred of respect I had left for Melissa McCarthy (loved her in Spy) and Paul Feig (again, I loved Spy), just went RIGHT out the window.Stay away from this man-hating piece of crap.</fullReview>

This was made for man-haters. If I pay to go to the movie it's not to watch 4 non- entertaining girls. Every stereotype is in each Ghostbuster. From loud black girl saying "Hell Naw" and being loud from the 80's, to a fat tub of lard that is boring, bossy, obnoxious. What is this fat girl that I'm watching? Did I just pay money to look at this thing. Someone stab my eyes out and gimmie back my 15 bucks!!!! Everyones acting was drama101 from high school. My drama class had better actors than this!!! Can you tell I really hate this movie?? This movie is on the level of Batman and Robin which killed comic book movies in the 90's</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well let's see, we have four ladies that are into paranormal investigation, either on purpose or by accident. They come off in the beginning of the film somewhat intelligent. Kristen Wiig plays a women that is trying to work her way into a tenure but things go awry when her old pall Abby starts to sell a book that is about paranormal investigation that they wrote together and things don't look so good for Kristen Wiig's character Erin Gilbert. They eventually meet up because of this book situation that Erin wants to sweep under the rug, so that she get's her tenure, and doesn't want to be embarrassed in front of her bosses. This is how we are introduced to Abby(Melissa McCarthy) and Jillian Holtzman(Kate McKinnon). After getting some information from Erin, about a haunted mansion, Abby and Jillian jump at the chance to get a spectre on camera. The trio then witness a real spectre and then decide to go into business for themselves, and we eventually meet Patty Tolan(Leslie Jones). Once their business is set up they hire a guy named Kevin(Chris Hemsworth) to work the phones. So to sum things up, this film is nothing like the original, the humour is in your face, which makes it not humorous at all, Kate McKinnon's character is a little too weak and just nutty for my tastes, she becomes highly annoying trying to play the role of a quirky mad scientist. She seems to have this goofy grin on her face most of the time. Melissa McCarthy is shouting through the whole film, and Leslie Jones, plays a very witty but just a bland stereotype of a cliché character, I'm not saying, cliché in a racial sense.(like the press makes you believe) I mean cliché as the group's sidekick type of character, the comic relieve if you will. Kevin played by Chris Hemsworth, is a below intelligence moron who no one in real life would hire, but as far as the story goes he's also a web designer, which makes no sense as to why this person is such a dullard, is the director Paul Feig saying that all web designers are complete bumbling morons? Your guess is as good as mine. Now the villain, Rowan North(Neil Casey) is a below par villain if you ask me. He is a troubled person that gets bullied, so to get back at everyone he builds a machine to unleash the spectre's of the netherworld(so to speak). Then he becomes a ghost himself by purposely electrocuting himself, then later possesses the body of Kevin(Chris Hemsworth).The Gadgets. Well they looked really terrible we also see a new version of the PKE Meter that Harold Ramis used in the 1984 film, has been reintroduced as a hand held spinning glow stick. Yes you read that right "glow stick". Which brings me to another point, the ghosts. The Spectre's in this film were something out of a cartoon, and we actually see a cartoon ghost in this film. They seem like something from Disney's Haunted Mansion. They were way too colorful, and just came off as cheap and campy. Another thing I want to mention, if you fell for the negative radical feminist views like I did, those people in my opinion were dead wrong, the film is not propaganda for radical feminism, in fact the female cast all but one, actually make women look more stupid, and unintelligent, Kristen Wiig's role was the only form of intelligence in this film. Kate McKinnon's role made her look like a retarded physicist of some sort. You will understand when and if you waste your time on this film. I just don't see how this film makes women look smart and tough at all, they run around like a bunch of bumbling idiots. Final verdict, this gets a 1 out of 10 for me. The main plot of the villain was moot, and just not worth watching, the film seemed cheap and campy in all aspects, and does not hold up to the 1984 classic. Do yourself a favour and go by a Blu-ray copy of the original, and save yourself some money by not going to the box office. I predict when this version of Ghostbusters gets released on to disc it will be in the junk bin at your local Walmart, like all the other garbage films that Hollywood is remaking these days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terrible CGI, terrible actors, terrible jokes terrible plot, and unoriginal to boot. The movie is sexist as all get out male characters are all portrayed as idiots and a lot of ghosts are killed by shooting them in the balls....The first joke is a vaginal fart joke and that pretty much sets the bar for the rest of the film. The bad guy turns into a cartoon character for crying out loud.The original Ghostbusters was a classic it had great writing chemistry and comedy. This thing has none of that its a blatant money grab film and a insult to the original movies and the audience at large.When Cameos are the best part (and they are still bad) of the movie you know its garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful..just awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ghostbusters was a huge obsession of mine as a child. I collected the toys, had the two films recorded from TV, and then bought them both on VHS and now have them on Blu Ray. Now at the age of 26, I still feel the same about them as I did then. Seeing the trailers for this one, I was not in the least bit impressed (probably like everyone else). But I thought I should go and see it to actually gain an opinion and say that I've seen it. Let me just say first off....I could not wait for the end credits to role.It had a solid story, yes but it had so many plot holes including rehashes and references from the first film. With no dark element involved like in the first two. Some of the ghosts, I have to say, looked pretty decent but they didn't have the scare factor. They just felt too playful and colourful. For the main villain, there was no investment whatsoever. When he showed up, he didn't have a threatening tone. I felt he overacted and was too cartoonish.For the cast, it was well acted and it looked like they had a blast in the production of the film, but it was ruined by the atrocious writing. With the originals, there was scientific talk backed up with dialogue that all audiences can understand. With this, the scientific dialogue was dragged out and just felt that it was unnecessary. I really do like Paul Feig as a director and I really enjoyed his other films. However, due to the writing, the direction was terrible. There were just times where I wanted to shout at the screen "No-one would do or say that". For example, during a scene involving a heavy metal concert, there was a demonic ghost, causing mayhem. What did everyone do? Stand there doing nothing. Also when one of the ghostbusters is being dragged off by the demon, people were taking selfies on their phones with it. Who would do that? and why didn't anyone run for the hills?For the comedy element, everything just felt forced and painfully awkward. Whereas in the originals, the comedy moments were off the cuff and downright hilarious, Well done to Mr Akroyd and Mr Ramis. However, the only funny moments were when the original cast made cameo appearances and insulted the new ghostbusters, either saying their fake or as Mr Akroyd put it "I ain't afraid of no ghost" (cheesy I know, but I laughed at that) That all just felt to me that they were saying "Nah, we're the real ghostbusters"So overall, this film was just awful. I never had a problem that it was an all female team. It was just everything else failed miserably. I literally left the cinema with gritted teeth.I would highly recommend not to this film at the cinema. Watch it on Netflix by all means. But I would just stick with the originals. You'll also be avoiding the abysmal new theme song by Fall out Boy and Missy Elliott. It was always Ray Parker Jr's song.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie review isn't spoiler-free because there's nothing to spoil, the movie does that to itself. To start this out, I have nothing against an all-woman cast; if women can make a great movie, more power to them. But for anybody, male or female, to participate in making this movie, needs to reevaluate their priorities in their profession. Freaks and Geeks was Paul Feig's prime. I literally fell asleep about halfway during the movie, despite it's loud dubstep theme cover and a somewhat attempt of see-through CGI. The only character that received any laughs from the audience were at Mckinnon's character; it was as if she knew she was in a terrible movie and figured she'd make the best of it along with her sellout costars. I love the original Ghostbusters and this one just left a nasty taste in my mouth that will now surface every time I try to watch its predecessor. I beg you, don't waste your money. If you take someone on a date to see this movie they will dump you faster than this movie ended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****Yar, there be spoilers ahead, turn back now. Ye have been warned****After so many people gave me the "You have to give it a try" or "you're hating it before you even see it, judge for yourself" or "you love Ghostbusters, there's no way you could stay away" speeches and because there was a storm and my power and internet had been down for about an hour, I went to go see the new Ghostbusters out of COMPLETE BOREDOM. (Heavy sigh) OK, let's do this.Where do I start? How about here?WHAT WAS SONY THINKING OF WHEN THEY READ THIS SCRIPT AND SAID "I LOVE THIS PLAN, I'M EXCITED TO BE PART OF IT, LETS DO IT!!" If THIS is the start of a new Ghostbusters franchise then we are all in big trouble.Let's start with the plot: this thing took the good parts from the first 2 movies, cut them up into pieces, threw them into the air and where ever they landed is the writers wrote them into this version. It did nothing to establish the back stories of the characters; it just throws us into the action but does not make us really feel anything for these ladies even though throughout we are supposed to feel bad that they were teased as kids. I guess you're just supposed to relate to them based on the fact that they are famous female comedians? Sure, let's go with that cause I found no reason to care for them.The only likable character was Kevin and even he got old after the first few stupid blonde jokes made his way. After that, every time he came on screen I rolled my eyes. How many times can you milk the 'there's no glass in your glasses' gag? The answer? About 50. You made Thor boring! This movie should go in the record books for that alone. The other likable character was Holtzmann (the weird chick that makes the gear) and that was because she didn't have very many lines at all and truly seemed to be having fun with her character unlike the other 3 women who were so stiff because they were trying so hard to be funny or good actors. Even the villain (who *SHOCKER* was also teased his whole life) is just a random guy doing evil things, there is no real connection to him or to any of the teasing that is done to him. People say random remarks about him, but nothing to justify the evil master plan he has hatched. The acting?oh dear lord?.the acting was terrible. Melissa McCartney and Kristen Wiig were the worst ones and THEY WERE THE STARS AND MAIN CHARACTERS! The entire script seemed to be made up right then and there on the spot. It was painful to watch. Every scene involved someone going off on a random tangent that had absolutely nothing to do with the scene they were in. It seemed they were trying so hard to make each other laugh and not enough trying to make the audience laugh. Every one of them on screen were stiff and emotionless, like they were physically trying to act. You could tell they had no idea what they were doing and were trying so hard to show everyone they could carry this huge responsibility. Guess what, you couldn't. The body possession of Abby scene was the most painful of them all; I had to close my eyes during it. It physically hurt to watch.The worst part of the entire move was the overall arc of man hating. From scene one you could tell they were walking around with a 'we're girls get over it' chip on their shoulder because of internet backlash (which wouldn't have happened if they hadn't been so vocal trying to impress everyone by mentioning how theirs was an all-female version) maybe if they worked harder on the script like they did trying to promote 'girl power' then maybe we would have a better movie. Calm down, you're the Ghostbusters, not the spice girls.I'm not kidding. EVERY MAN in this movie was a complete idiot. I'm not talking 'killer chases girl in high heels through woods and she falls' idiot, I'm talking 'Duh?I am a stupid, stupid man..Duhhh'. Kevin, can't do even the simplest things because he's stupid. The mayor can't function properly without the help of his FEMALE aide. The Homeland security guys, protecting the United States, works for the government, yet the mayors aide speaks for them because they have no clue, and on and on?.Sorry Sony, no dice. You spent so much time forcing every-ones opinions to change before the movie came out that you missed the chance to reintroduce a beloved movie to a new generation properly. I feel bad for the youth that think THIS is Ghostbusters. Let's clear this up now, it's not a lady thing. I don't care that its ladies, it could have been CG lobsters or hamsters in the roles. This added nothing to the franchise, it was just a really bad SNL sketch that went on way too long. The hate wasn't because of the women, it was because it was thrown in every-ones face constantly that it made you wonder if that was all it had going for it. Spoiler alert, it was.The worst part is at the start of the movie, Sony has already created a Ghostbusters production studio. That means no matter the outcome of this movie they have plans in motion to unleash Ghostbusters on an unsuspecting world.So you can be sure no matter how it does, the Ghostbusters WILL be back; Sony will make sure of that whether you like it or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Bust</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget everything you know about the original movie. Like the heart, the humor, the adventure and the charismatic characters.Let's get this straight: this movie is NOT funny. The best it got out of me was something Kristen Wiig said during one of the 319 homage scenes/cameos from the originals and I said "Huh" to indicate that was somewhat clever. Even my friend beside me said later he heard me say that but no actual laughter during the movie.Now, is it a terrible movie? Close, but it was refreshing they didn't do a shot-by-shot remake, so it did stand on its own. Plus, the 3-D was actually pretty darn good and I usually hate 3-D when forced to see it due to starting times. Getting the "plot" out of the way, it did somewhat follow the original's premise: three barely-making-it scientists band together to study, capture ghosts and make a living off of it. A fourth black character is thrown in to mimic the original's last piece of the group because?movie. Aside from the "humor" they did insert, and I use that term very lightly because most of the jokes were the same statements the actresses say in every one of their movies, the biggest problem I had were the characters.No one in this movie was very likable or was anyone we could get behind. They were all so bland and when they did speak, they were just reading the script. The five leads were completely forgettable or despicable. Kristen Wiig played a very toned down and humorless version of all her other acting choices. Melissa McCarthy was just Melissa McCarthy ? no change. Leslie Jones was a dreadful, walking stereotype borderlining on racism?against blacks. And those three had nothing on the final two atrocities. Chris Hemsworth played Kevin, someone so incredibly dumb, he made Fifty Shades of Grey's Anastasia Steele look brilliant. It didn't even matter he portrayed someone so inept, he was just so annoying because in a movie full of ghosts, he was the least realistic part of the film. And then there's Kate McKinnon. Well, she was amazingly awful. Awful to look at, listen to and she truly made me cringe every single time she was on screen. She wasn't funny, her goofiness was unnecessary and all of her "antics" were predictable. And speaking of predictability, the jokes and set-ups (even the concert scene) were so incredibly old, this felt like it was written in the 1990s when they began wanting to make a third Ghostbusters film. Nothing felt fresh and because of this, 90% of what they called jokes were foreseen two shots ahead and I kept lifting my hands up to indicate: well, I was waiting on that.Since they rammed cameos and force feed us nostalgia, I guess someone could want to go see this. But, better just to see it free on Netflix. It's really hard to justify the cost of the movie theatre price in order to dumb down all senses to laugh at what would probably only make a toddler crack up.***Final thoughts: The trailers looked awful, unfunny and the CGI appeared bad. And at first, I was dreading seeing this. BUT, I love to surprise myself and always hope I'm wrong once the movie proves my initial thoughts invalid. Unfortunately, the trailers hit this straight on: It's just as bad as you thought it might be.And speaking of trailers, the 6-7 movie previews we saw before this film only featured ONE "comedy" (Bridget Jones's Baby and that literal one- joke trailer hardly counted as a comedy.) I thought this was weird since we're about to see a comedy. Heck, only one other one was remotely sci- fi. Maybe that should have been a good premonition to get up and leave before the film even started.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a total travesty and has all the relevance that Ms. Pacman had to the original Pacman - the point being that it was a needless waste of time. The film is disjointed, disconnected and uninteresting. There are precious few funny moments in the film, and even the slightly amusing parts are really quite pathetic. But even more disturbing than the trite script, the random editing and the terrible plot is what the film represents for Hollywood and even the United States of America. This film is without a doubt the final nail in the coffin of the Hollywood production machine. There are no new ideas in the brain bank, just empty rehashings of plot lines that have been done to death. Moreover, the film just emphases how irrelevant the United States has become. The original movie was made in the mid-eighties when the United States was undoubtedly the global power house - economically, militarily and intellectually. Thirty two years later, and the United States is mocked and ridiculed around the globe. The country is basically economically bankrupt, ruled by sad politicians that act more like circus clowns, and the population is tearing itself apart with ethnic tension, police violence and mass shootings. I recommend watching the 1984 and 2016 Ghostbusters movies back to back so you can witness for yourself the decline in film making standards in Hollywood over a 32 year period. Thank you for reading.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could summarize this "movie" in one word, but the guidelines need ten lines so... You asked for it: Acting is stiff and casting is unimaginative. They basically took a fun classic that had soul, deflated it and pumped it full of agenda. May they all rot in hell for this. One trick pony Melissa postulating with her two zoolander looks, Kristen wigs out a blonde who wasn't there and a black head rolling "hell no" cliché all got together for a school play. Redundant cliché poor horrible lousy tripe trite ruined horrible stupid crap. I don't even want to write ten lines. The last eight or nine have been nothing but trauma of having to relive this crap.

		<fullReview>Warning: There is a conspiracy of Trump supporting fascist haters who want to keep this movie in the kitchen. Nazi's will ride on dinosaurs again and keep womenz as cattle if you don't stop them.Now there are a lot of people here who think this movie is some kind of "ballbusters" which is sexist towards men. I think you are giving this movie way to much credit. It's just to boring for that. Everything about it is just utterly forgettable. I am afraid the only thing people will remember in a few years will be the retarded discussion by gender activists of all sides.Why? Because it makes the same mistakes all reboots or sequels (which fail) make: Producing a cheap "chinese"-copy of the original with almost the same story, characters and setting. Watching the movie is like listening to a remix of a song you have already heard a million times. It's really not as satisfying as listening to a new album.So it seems that all the time and energy put into this movie was focusing on a political message and not on Ghostbusters which is really sad for the fans. I kind of understand why the fanbase is so angry and feel lucky that i never really was a big fan.I recommend to watch this movie if you are completely bored and drunk otherwise stay away.</fullReview>

This movie could have been great had it actual comedy, comedy similar to the original. The thing was just done wrong and I'm glad the theater I saw this at gave me my money back.

		<fullReview>First time rating a movie on IMDb, but IMDb user since early 2000's. I wish I could Bill and Ted myself to stop from buying a ticket to support this movie tonight. It was painful. It started out good enough with some jokes from the robotic personality guy from the Silicon Valley show, but my god! It does not work with females. Not being sexist here and I enjoyed Bridesmaids enough. It's a combo of the cast and script but it's not a "Ghostbusters" type movie. This is different in a horrible way with the same name. You could absolutely tell by Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson and Annie Potts' cameos that they knew it was bad. It's unfortunate too cause with a decent Vacation reboot last year (decent enough) this had some hope.Next time you do a cash grab movie, make it worth the viewers time. Was looking forward to this for a long time. And I liked Beverly Hills Cop 3!! PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, DON'T EVEN DOWNLOAD ILLEGALLY. YOU'LL TURN OFF WITHIN 10 MINUTES.

		<fullReview>i bit the bullet and saw the Ghostbusters remake today.... with it's good rating on RT, i figured maybe there was something i missed in the trailers - and who knows, maybe it'll surprise me and not be the train wreck i thought it was going to be, because i have been wrong about movies in the past (ie: The Fast And The Furious)... so i wanted to give it at least the fair chance of watching it before i pass final judgement...it's one of the worst movies i've ever seen. period.....the girls themselves weren't bad though - for once Melissa McCarthy wasn't annoying... Kristen Wiig was alright, until they turned her character into a blithering idiot around Chris Hemsworth... Kate McKinnon was the only one i really didn't care for - too over the top, too cartoony - had they toned her down just a little, she would've been great... but i think Leslie Jones (IMO) was the best one - she was naturally funny, and her deliveries didn't seem forced (except the whole "race/lady thang" and "the power of patty compels you" parts).. but let me jump back to Chris Hemsworth for a moment... because I saw reviews that said he was hilarious and one of the funniest parts of the movie (even the bad reviews of the movie still praised him).. and while i think he does have comedic chops that do get showcased in this movie - the character he plays is just stupid, and after about 5 minutes I couldn't take it anymore - between him and McKinnon, i really don't know which one I found more annoying..and that's the thing... the entire tone, direction, and story is what made this film just a complete farce... the first hour was "okay" - forgettable, but nothing terrible... but the last hour was just bad, and i mean BAAAAAAD - nothing made sense, some things blatantly contradicted themselves, most was left unexplained where you really really had to suspend disbelief for it to even make sense in the context of the movie itself.... just an unfunny, poorly written mess..to sum it all up in a nutshell..... this was the movie Batman &amp; Robin dressed up as Ghostbusters.... just awful.</fullReview>

This is a fundamentally uninformed review, in that I haven't seen the movie. But take it from a Stat Wars-fan who decided from the then-trailers never to watch the prequels, and so far hasn't: if you ever had any love for the original Ghostbusters: don't waste your time and money. Thank me in 20 years. The only good that can come from this is a renewed interest in the 1984 movie from a crowd unaware how extensively they have already been dumbed down by these PC/pseudo feminist/generic communisty 'made-by-committee' moviesThe 2/10 score is for the genuine effort and undoubtedly good intentions from all crewmembers. The Studios, who want 'Creative control'. Translation: cheaply leave options for endless sequels wide open...I will not be surprised if this actually does well at the box-office.</fullReview>

I watched and immediately as the first jokes rolled off the ladies tongues, something about queefs I was done. I immediately knew what I had paid 7 bucks for (matinee). Two hours of old poop, fart, and race jokes. I almost fell asleep and had to stand while I watched.

		<shortDescription>It really is as bad as the internet would have you believe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't believe the critics, who are mostly reviewing this in an effort to 'balance' the hate that they believe is solely due to its gender switching. The bulk of criticism of this film has absolutely nothing to do with that. This movie plain sucks, and sucks hard. It's just not funny. And with the people involved, it had the responsibility to be vastly better than it was. I love McKinnon, McCarthy, and especially Wiig, so it's not a matter of thinking that women can't be as funny as men. Jones is, in my opinion, one of the least funny SNL players though I don't think she's outright bad. Here though, she was embarrassing. Still, I don't totally blame her - her horrible character is mostly the writer's fault for her terrible lines and the director's fault for the awful performance. Even Wiig was so low-energy through the whole thing. None of the ladies had chemistry with each other. They just went through it, reading their lines, with very little spark. I was completely open-minded to the idea of an all-woman show, even though I thought it was totally unnecessary and felt gimmicky, but they really should not have made it a reboot or remake or whatever they want to call it. It should have been its own original story. As far as the cgi goes, I get why it looks bad. It's on purpose and is trying to be cheesy, the same way the original was. But it just comes off as cheap, not as a clever nod to the first. The biggest problem with it is it's just not funny. Aside from a few of Hemsworth's ditzy antics and one scene where the school dean comes up with a couple creative ways of flipping off Wiig and McCarthy's characters, I didn't put out more than a minor chuckle or two the entire movie. Even my wife, who was so very excited about this movie and primed to laugh at even the smallest joke, complained about how massively disappointing it was. There were so many missed opportunities and misjudgments in this that you really can't help but be angry. The end credits show a perfect example. During the film Hemsworth's character is possessed and temporarily takes control of a large group of military and other people in the street. He makes a motion and everyone in the group strikes a pose straight out of Michael Jackson's Thriller (one of the minor chuckles I spoke of). But that's it. Then during the end credits you see some of the entire sequence where Hemsworth directs the group in the full dance. All you can say is WTF were they thinking, not including at least some of that in the main film? That was actually funny. Instead, we get stuff like the millionth boring Exorcist reference with an over-the-top, unfunny shout and slap that drives out the demon. What you saw in the trailers really are the 'funniest' parts of the movie. If you hated the trailer, you will hate the movie. Do not believe the PC reviewers and critics who are saying different, just because they don't want to be accused of misogyny. This time the annoying internet fanboys who were hating on it before even seeing a single frame of it just happened to accidentally get it right.</fullReview>

Hypocrisy is an ugly thing.I'll take my films without a dose of gender politics, thanks. I'd like to be positive and say that I was pleasantly surprised by this, but I just cannot bring myself to do it. The jokes were pretty much stolen from other films, the story line was both a rip off from the first and also laden with internal contradictions. For example, do the proton beams just capture ghosts or "kill" them? The male comedy relief was a mix of stereotypes that so called progressives have been fighting against for years. Don't waste your money on this, folks. Go for a walk with the dog instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's something strange, and it don't look good Who ya gonna call? All your friends and tell them don't waste their money. Firstly, it just isn't funny. The laughs are forced and many of the scenes are straight rips-offs of the original films without any new clever twists.The 'Girl Power' angle is a cringe-inducing throwback.Ghostbusters is pushing the idea female heroes are some kind of novelty but we've had major film franchises starring women (Alien, The Terminator) since the Eighties, and critical and commercial hits like Zero Dark Thirty, Gravity and Mad Max: Fury Road. Most horror films feature women as the main protagonists, and have done so for decades.None of those were marketed as 'women's films' or attempted to shame audiences into watching them; they were advertised as thrilling, or funny, or scary, and judged according to whether they were successful on those terms.There have been women doctors, lawyers, and politicians in the West for more than a hundred years now, but hammering away at the old, Victorian inequalities as if they were still current will still get a rise out of a certain kind of flat-headed bint. Obviously not enough of them to save this film, though. Chris Hemsworth the "dumb" secretary, is the only actor I enjoyed in this film.Oh also Sony blackmailed Bill Murry into being in this film with threats of lawsuits since he was a stakeholder in the Ghostbuster franchise. Unforgivable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts great then falls apart after the first act</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would have been a smart idea to use female ghost-busters, if it brought something new to this story-verse. Unfortunately it didn't.The movie really starts out great. It completely halts a few times while they deliver the "comedy" (the guy soiling his pants and whatnot) but the first ghost in the mansion was very well done, ominous, mysterious and awe-inducing. The fact patty (the black character) is a historian of New York is great and believable, she has a lot of free time in her booth, reads non-fiction books, and it's something her character can bring to the team, that went a long way into making her a believable human being.. at least in the first act. The ghost in the subway was already less well done, basically a recall of the electrocuted brothers in GB2 (I think), but already much less believable and much more of a green screen Scooby-Doo quality.But then.. the receptionist interview scene comes up and the movie goes off the rails. It briefly revives itself when they deploy the ghost trap from the original movie, but the rest is complete nonsense. The socially awkward white bad guy was bullied (of course), works as a hotel clerk but somehow managed to build a device for ghosts to cross dimensions just by reading a book, and didn't find better employment and that's his plan to retaliate at .. everyone I guess. Okay. They just start shooting ghosts instead of capturing them, because the audience is so stupid, they won't notice the inconsistency. The wannabe doc brown deploys guns that shoots proton beams because.. reasons? I can picture an exec sending a memo about that ending with ".. brilliant!".The third act of the movie is complete, nonsensical garbage and feels VERY, VERY long, much longer than the real-time of 1hr 48 minutes that the movie runs for. Any careful editing that survived in the first two acts is now completely gone as well. Patty devolves into the angry black woman trope by that point. The acting is bad across the board. I didn't think that Chris Hemsworth's character was any better than the rest of the sorry lot, unlike most of the other reviewers. His scenes bring the movie to a complete stop, as much as the terrible cameos that Sony manage to strong-arm or pay off the original cast into doing. Melissa Mc Carthy's delivery is anger-inducing. I thought she was fantastic in The Heat but here she completely is phoning it in. Kristen Wiig is okay, except for a good many scenes where she is supposed to be awkward but ends up just cringe-worthy. McKinnon is BAD. She tries to come across as doc brown, I guess, but fails. The scene where she is success-dancing outside of the mansion, and when she is lip syncing over an 80's song, are both probably the worst two in the movie.The man-hating is strong, absolute, constant, and puzzling. Why would you badly insult half of your potential audience, especially fans of the franchise you wish to reboot, in such an unsubtle way? Do they think female characters need all men to be idiots in order to stand out and succeed? Other movies didn't pull this crap and fared so much better. Rey got help by men and she still kicked ass. Ripley teamed up with Hudson and still kicked ass. Was that really necessary? Overall, this movie is frustrating, it clearly started off in the first 20-30 minutes with all the makings of a good re-energizing of this franchise, with a smart pivot of the main characters, but impotent writing, directing, acting, made sure that we won't get sequels. I'd recommend waiting until it's out on Netflix to watch it while doing something else; definitely not worth going out to the theater for this, or wasting 2 hours of your life.Also, I don't think Sony realize this is really a black mark on their overall brand. I've liked their products since the days of the Walkman, I've owned Wega's, Vaio's, even Xperia phones.. This isn't inspiring me to get anything from them again.</fullReview>

Yelling? Check. Bitch slapping? Check. Every single stereotype about black woman? Check. Remember Winston Zeddemore from the original film? Was he a stereotypical black man at the time in the 1980s? Nope. Instead, he was an Average Joe who wanted a job and took it at Ghostbusters. Here, Leslie portrays her character in an almost-offensive manner when it comes to playing a stereotypical black woman. It's borderline inappropriate and, had she been a man, this film would've been TRASHED by critics for this portrayal of a character.</fullReview>

CREATE YOUR OWN ORIGINAL MOVIE!!!! This is exactly why this movie fails in every attempt. The whole purpose for making this movie was a political statement and a chance to bash the original movie. They kill off the original cast member? They attempt to make (bad) jokes about men (which I don't remember the first Ghostbusters movie bashing women in such a way.) Finally they kill the final (boss) by shooting it in its crotch....Not to mention ripping off just about every scene from the first movie. Not a single creative or funny thought in this movie. I have been to horribly UN-funny movies in the past and heard at least a few people laugh. Not only was my local theater half empty but NO ONE LAUGHED. As for the sexiest outcry by the cast? more than half of the theater was men!! So much for that crap theory.Please don't waste your money or your time. I would give this movie a 3 or 4 out of 10 if it weren't for the fact that feminist have taken onto IMDb giving the movie a 10 out of 10. Are you serious? A 10 OUT OF 10!?!?! The first ghost busters movie, the best in the series has a 7.8!?!? and they give this heap of crap a 10 out of 10!?!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SJW's are known for banding together on social media sites to try and push their agenda's, and that is exactly what is happening here. One "reviewer" even tried to out-SJW the others by saying this abomination was "better than the original". Give me a break! Anyway, to the review... to be honest, I don't believe it ruined the Ghostbusters franchise. I feel the second film started the decline (come on, it was really boring and cheesy) and the slew of soulless marketing after that (the cartoon, for example) ruined the franchise. The first film is rare and special. This film is merely a continuation of the decline in quality this series has suffered.Because of all the horrendous and offensive stereotypes this film contains (this has been discussed at length on many other reviews here so I won't repeat them), this film would've worked better as a parody. Think back to "Scary Movie" and its sequels: full of offensive stereotypes, but they were funny because making fun of the stereotypes and clichés was the whole point. This film falls flat on its face in all regards because it's been demanded by feminist's and SJW's that we take it seriously. Because of this, it is impossible to separate the politics from this film and as a result that's all it is: a failed socio-political statement.This kind of dreck is below the likes of Melissa McCarthy. I ADORED her on "Mike and Molly" and have enjoyed some of her film work. I thought she was funny, likable and relatable (and I catch the reruns of M&amp;M whenever I can), but this... this is like finding Monet in a landfill.My review of the film can be summed up in the following: horrible acting, zero plot, non-existent comedy (shooting a ghost in the groin to kill it. Really?), dumb stereotypes... just about what you would expect from a film whose sole premise is "gender-swapped Ghostbusters". I am grateful that I didn't pay to see this film because I couldn't deal with that on my conscience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>overwhelmingly terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd never seen the original ghost busters until after I watched this one, so you can consider this review unbiased. This was absolutely terrible. I felt like I was watching a snl skit with about as much of a budget but I later found out that this 'movie' had a budget of almost 200 million! What are they doing with the money? The "ghosts" all looked worse than any cgi I've seen since the first harry potter movie.I guess the word got around because not only was my cinema nearly empty but it turns out the film bombed hard. I decided to watch the original on DVD and I was shocked at how different these two are. I can see why all the fuss from fans of the original or people who just don't like having their money spent seeing something that turns out to be garbage like this.I can't give this more than one star. I can't see why some critics seem to be saying it's fine, it was the kind of movie you walk out of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My girlfriend wanted to see this, as she likes McCarthy. We both fell asleep somewhere around the midway mark - only to wake up shortly afterward to about another hour of pure torture. The 5 minutes or so I was asleep were easily the best part of the film.I will not give out spoilers, basic story, or any details of the cast. Suffice to say, none of that is worth either my time or your time. If you enjoy taking a roll of cash out of your pocket, then flushing it down the toilet - this is your movie - as that is what you will be doing.Hollywood has been on the downslide for a good decade or more. This certainly puts up no blockade to that momentum. Talentless people top the town, and it's been showing in the product for a long time now.Save your time, save your money. If you're looking for something more entertaining, go clip your nails - or even clean out the dust and lint from behind your refrigerator.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost definitely the worst thing I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All of my least favorite movies, A Clockwork Orange, Furious 7, Mad Max, all had some sort of entertainment value. Be that with some actual entertainment found within the confines of the film or by some friends and I getting ironic humor out of them. I went to see this with a couple of people, expecting it to be bad. We at least hoped we could make some jokes during since the theater was basically empty and we wouldn't be killing anyone's buzz. Paul Feig didn't even give us that.This could've been a good movie and despite my outspoken hatred for it, I really hoped it would be. It wasn't. Somehow it dulled Bill Murray so much when he was thrown out of a window by the only ghost they caught the whole movie, I felt nothing. Which is a first considering I absolutely love Bill Murray and after that scene in Zombieland I thought this would hurt a bit. I was wrong, they killed Bill Murray and his charisma.All of the ghosts look too detached from reality but at the same time look too realistic and out of place in a Ghostbusters movie. This really shouldn't be called Ghostbusters. I think if it just called itself something else and switched up bits of it it would've still been bad, but I don't think it'd be as controversial. They don't even really BUST any ghosts. They just kill them or something with Kate McKinnon's dumb ghost guns which fire proton beams which, as shown in this and the original, should be CATCHING the ghosts and holding them. Not slicing them in pieces.My biggest problem with this movie I would have gone forever without realizing if not for one of Leslie Jones' lines. This was in one of the trailers, Melissa McCarthy was possessed and she starts slapping her and yelling "GET OUT OF MY FRIEND, GHOST", but then it hit me, were any of them even friends? I don't recall any actual conversations between them that weren't purely technical and about ghosts. The original had scenes like where Ray and Winston (memorable characters, can't say the same for these) are talking about the end of days, where they just casually eat Chinese food and talk to one another about the business, the Twinkie scene, but this had none of that. And Leslie Jones was definitely not their friend. How was she even a Ghostbuster? She literally just walks in and says "I wanna be in the club!!" and later discloses aside from the rest that she "didn't sign up for this I thought this gon be a book club or somethin". She came to them for help with a ghost, saw Kristen Wigg almost get decapitated by a train while trying to catch one, and hung out with them for days, weeks, maybe months with apparently so little communication that she had no idea what they even did there.If you want a stupidly long and mediocre 1700 word review, go to this link http://apocalypsepromptly.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe I'm going to do this but hey, if the feminists, sjw's and lefties can give this film ten stars without actually seeing it, then in the interest of balance and impartiality, I can do the same from the opposing side of the debate. Rather than typing out a load of new rhetoric, I'll just use a few lines I've taken from already existing reviews, to sum up why this film is the biggest flop, of the century. To my fellow reviewers whose quotes I've used, thank you all. I would credit you all but that would take forever, but when you see the lines, you'll know who you were and where I took your words from. Anyway, why this vehicle for feminist man hate sucks:-Four fat ugly women with penis envy pushing a political agenda -The Vagina fart Joke sets the tone -4 quid a ticket. And I feel ripped off. That's how bad this film really was ! Even my son did t like it and he loved the originals and he's only 12 -This film was terrible, I have to admit, I wasn't expecting much and it was worse than what I thought it was going to be -An abomination, insult to the original and new cast -The levels of sexism in this film are staggering -If Bridesmaids was the Hangover, this would be the less funny version of Grown Ups - People walking out on the movie when the theater is just half full also means something. Just to clarify: It doesn't mean people leaving are sexist (especially girls), it means the movie is BAD -It's a wreckage of bad gags -BAD movie. UNNFUNNY. shameful! Awful Jokes! Awful Special Effects! Awful Director! Awful Acting! Awful Actresses! UNFUNNY Melissa! Awful -This is the worst film I've ever seen in my whole life, and I've sat through Vince Vaughn in Psycho -Apparently Melissa McCarthy's "I'm fat and obnoxious" routine is hilarious - It was such a bad movie this was the first time I witness more than half of the people just went home after watching 1st half an hour. -This was really, really terrible! -I wanted to claw my eyes out (I feel for ya, mate, every time I see MM I want to bleach my eyeballs!) -This film is as bad as people thought it would be -This movie is basically the feminist equivalent to Christian rock, or some piece of crap like God's Not Dead - I know who I'm gonna call...The cinema who made me pay for this crap for my money back -Burn it, burn it with fire!! -Probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen -This is going to haunt me for the rest of my life -Absolute garbage, stealing the title and setting of Ghostbusters does not make this Ghostbusters -This movie is a disgusting and said embodiment of modern times... -Disappointing dross that bored an entire cinema -Ghostflopper -Barely watchable, and no, I am not a Trump supporter -Doesn't justify its own existence -Worst Movie Ever!!! -Worst Franchise Reboot Ever Made *SPOILER ALERT* -A Terrible, Unfunny, Man-Hating Mess -Dead on arrivalAnd these are just a few of the quotes I took from the first few pages of the "Best Rated" section, I dread to think what the "Hated It" sections comments look like! But perhaps the biggest offence this movie makes is putting Melissa Mccarthy up front in the lead role. Which moron keeps signing her pay cheques? Being fat and obnoxious is NOT funny. It's just being fat and obnoxious. It's like Sony set out to deliberately sabotage this film when they sighed MM up to star in it right from the off. Every film she has ever been in is now languishing in the bargain bin DVD section at the local pound store! If you want to ruin a film before its even green lit, just put MM in it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i saw the first trailer i wasn't impressed. When i saw the second trailer i thought it was better than the first one but it was missing something. So , i watched it at the cinema to see if it's good or not.The original Ghostbusters was a balanced mix of comedy and fantasy/action. This one uses fantasy/action as the means to make stupid jokes and spread its misandry all over the place. I'm not against powerful female characters and for the record , i loved Furiosa in the latest Mad Max film. The plot was tight , her character was well-presented and well-developed and the movie wasn't all over the place like the new Ghostbusters movie. Seeing Slimer again after such a long time was delightful but the CGI was bad and in the end , even Slimer failed to impress me at all. If this movie had another title and presented itself as a new franchise it would be OK but you can't use the title of such a great 80s classic and demand the fans to like it only because of their common name. I was also disgusted by the way , some people tried to blame other people as sexists only because they didn't like this mess. Overall , save your money for another movie , e.g. Warcraft. It's a lot better and doesn't insult its male audience in the way this abomination does. I can't believe this has a score of 74% in rotten tomatoes. What the hell?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a fan of the original Ghostbusters movies and cartoons. I had some of the toys when I was a young boy and I like both the franchise and horror movies in general.This movie does justice to neither. It's not because they chose women instead of the 4 male lead characters. The movie just sucks on every level. The humor doesn't feel real or spontaneous but forced and predictable. The visual effects are terrible. Even the story and dialogue are bland and forgettable. I almost fell asleep watching this, which rarely ever happens to me.Now I know the original 2 movies didn't have the greatest story lines, or the best acting. But they had chemistry, they worked. They were fun and exciting. This movie just attempts to copy the things that made the original ones work but it fails to copy the spirit (pun intended) of those films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a total butchering of what I had held great hopes of seeing. The movies attempts to follow the ghostbusters story line, meanwhile adding a "modern" spin on it (ie. overweight crones whats up with that?). What the viewers want to see is a storyline that follows the old movies or at least the cartoon series without any changes, and additions. Overall, the plot is weak, the characters are not male (ie. Vinkman, Spengler), the 2D cartoon series had better special effects than the movie (and the series had NO special effects, thats how terrible it was). I created an IMDb account JUST to comment on how they butchered ghostbusters for me and I hope that Hollywood is smarter next time as to when they bring such a strong fan based series onto the big screens or they will only infuriate more of the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could not care less if it had a all male or all female cast. What I want to say is I am so sick and tired of seeing remakes of movies that were already perfectly fine to begin with. We are getting at least three or four remakes each year when it is unneeded. In fact it comes out as lazy and desperate. Ghostbusters was already fine enough. We don't need a dumb remake of it, regardless of what you do, it will be the same. We are sick of it and we want something new. If you are going to remake a movie, do the really bad movies like Battlefield Earth. I am angry. Not because of the leads, but because of the fact that Hollywood is lazy that they have no respect for our minds and what we really want in movies. A FRESH and GOOD experience. If we wanted to see Ghostbusters so badly, we would just watch the original Ghostbusters.That is my opinion on the premise of the movie. Regardless, I will still see and then grade it as a movie and not what I feel about it being a remake. As a idea, I give it a big fat 1/10, as a movie, I am guessing about a four or so.Edit: I saw the movie and am just coming back. It as awesomely awful. I was laughing along with the theater the entire time. Like belly aching laughing the whole thing. Everything about it was awful, with almost no proper representation of anybody. It was incredibly sexist to BOTH genders and racist to EVERY race in the movie. Also, I did a gender counter of everybody who had at least one line and holy lord, out of the 41 people who had at least one line, 28 were men and 13 were women. That's right, in a women power movie, over two thirds of the characters who spoke at least once were men. Not to mention that literally every single plot point was dis regarded after about five to ten minutes. It really is worth seeing for how funny and bad it is. It might even be the number one example of 'so bad it's good' of the year. As a comedy, I give it a ten (for all the wrong reasons) but as a movie, a one or maybe two is all it deserves. So yes, it is even worse than I assumed. But worth it worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had low standards, beat them. BUT that means not much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, there's been a lot of negative things that have gone on with the making of the movie - the most notable of which is the highly toxic labelling of men who detract this movie are Trump supporting, basement dwelling, spouseless, sexist man-babies - just like with James Rolfe - and the additional removal of constructive comments on the trailers of this film. Jokes on them; I'm English, I don't have a basement, and I did film courses at school and University so I know what I'm talking about.For the reasons I've listed, my hackles were up going into this movie. But, to this films credit, my expectations were beaten, as I did get a couple of good laughs. But as a whole, the movie is a mess. Here's why: Firstly, the largely improvised script takes exchanges that would work better as a one liner and stretches it until it breaks, and then keeps going i.e. the "cat out the bag" argument at the Mayor's office, or the Patrick Swayze segment. Additionally, characters do some dumb stuff. Case in point, they catch a ghost, then purposefully release the ghost who ends up killing Bill Murray's cameo (one of only two deaths in this apocalypse). The ensemble cast is poor. Individual characters are well acted; the two best BY FAR were Kate McKinnon who plays Gillian, who's the group's bonkers, quirky, hyper-active engineer, and is the most likable one of the four main women, and then there's Chris Hemsworth playing their moron receptionist, and he gets some AMAZING lines that had me belly laughing. The whole cast is poor - they don't mesh naturally, and some of them are REALLY poorly utilised; Michael K Williams of The Wire and Boardwalk Empire is in two scenes, goddamn Charles Dance is in two scenes and used even less, and the main four don't mesh at all. And that sucks, cos I think Melissa McCarthy is one of the best comedic performers around right now, and Kristen Wiig and Leslie Jones are good too. I mentioned the casting, there's one that comes off really badly. Neil Casey plays Rowan - the villain. This guy is a stand-up, who gets NO FUNNY LINES AT ALL. Seriously, why? And his performance, and character is literal Sh*t. He's awkward, uninteresting, unthreatening and completely unfunny. The character dies at the beginning of the third act, and later shifts into the bodies of Melissa McCarthy and then Chris Hemsworth, and then he becomes a lot more threatening. Why give a stand up no funny lines when you have Michael K Williams and Charles Dance who would've taken that character and done something great with it?Other issues include CGI, which was awful, especially towards the finale, one terrible Ghostbusters metal remix on the poor musical score, and dumb characters decisions. But, despite all this, McKinnon and Hemsworth made me laugh. Well done to those two. And to Paul Feig, I adored Spy and Bridesmaids, I'll view this as a one-off screw up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not the cast, it's the dull, unfunny script and the lazy recycling that's the problem...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just got back from an advance screening, and not that anyone cares what I think, but if I had one piece of advice for anyone considering whether or not to go see the new Ghostbusters film, it is that the trailers are extremely indicative of the final film. So if you thought the trailers looked good and were funny, you'll more than likely enjoy the film, so have at it. If, however, you didn't like what you saw, I'd suggest not wasting your money, because what you saw is very much what you get. There's no surprises here, folks, the trailers are the film. For better or for worse, depending on your point of view. And don't believe anyone who tries to tell you otherwise.Now personally, I was never all that invested in either side of any of the various arguments or debates that flared up during production, it was just another reboot to me. Hollywood is going to keep pumping them out, so not much point screaming into the wind about it, at least in my view. Instead I just don't bother going to see most of them, unless they actually do show some definite promise, which, sadly, is all too rare these days. And I'm sure no one needs me to point out how poor most remakes actually are, either. In fact, to be honest, I probably would have skipped this one, too, had I not gotten a free invite courtesy of a theatre manager friend of mine to see it. A free film is a free film, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't at least curious, so off I went.So what did I think? Without going into spoilers, I think it's an underwhelming paint-by-numbers mediocrity that will more than likely be largely forgotten about as soon as it is out of theatres, regardless of how much money it does or doesn't make, or what controversies were drummed up beforehand. Neither terrible enough to create too much of a post release backlash, nor good enough to do a very good job of actually providing much in the way of actual entertainment, mostly I just found it rather flat, terribly uninspired, and exceedingly dull. I didn't care about or connect with any of the characters, the story is an ill-fitting frankensteining of old and new, which often don't sit well together, and the callbacks are mostly done in such a pandering way that they actually start to become irritating distractions. To me, it wasn't quite the train wreck that many predicted (and some even hoped for), it's more like the cinematic equivalent of a flat tire, rapidly losing air, making a lot of noise, but really going nowhere fast.Will it make money? Probably. Will it deserve to, in my opinion, not really. Unfortunately it's just another half-cooked slice of Hollywood laziness. Yet another charmless, aimless, factory remake to add to the pile marked mediocrity. Those in attendance at the screening were mostly pretty muted on the way out, as well, so I don't think my view is too far out on a limb here, and I just can't see word of mouth being very positive or giving this much of a boost in the long run. It was just a bit of a non event, really. Rarely managing to be even moderately amusing, and utterly underwhelming overall. Or it was to these eyes, anyway.I'm sure many other people will have many other views, that's just mine.Oh, and just a heads up, but if you do go see the film, you might want to stick through the end credits as well, as there's an added scene at the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't like this movie due to other factors that are not that the Ghostbusters all had a gender flip, I think they could have made a good movie with all females in the lead rolls if they made it better.Instead the jokes had no punchlines and made no sense, there was some bad acting, the story was a 1984 Ghostbusters ripoff (sorry for that spoiler), the plot was bad because of the changes they made it to that made no sense. Like for example they get kicked out of that college and it doesn't show how they got an idea to do a business. Scenes that tell the story are missing apparently.There are a lot of empty seats as people refuse to go back and see the movie again. I'll give the movie 1 star because I can't give it 0 stars, but at least there wasn't enough people to have someone talking during the movie or taking their children to see it and the children scream when the ghosts show up etc. If you are a loaner who want to see a movie based on SJW and feminist propaganda then this is the movie for you. If you wanted to laugh like you did in 1984, this is not the movie for you.</fullReview>

The cast are depending on slap-stick humor, bad one liners, and gross-out moments to get a laugh. It's like watching a 2016 version of the THREE STOOGES. Except it's four of them. I would have rather they had used the cast and writers from GAME OF THRONES and made a Ghostbusters that was dramatic, serious, dark, and most of the cast gets killed than to make this un-funny version of a great movie. But the writer did give a shot. She just should have collaborated with Dan Aykroyd on the jokes. And the entire script.</fullReview>

Worse yet is fans were promised a remake that honored the original, when this movie manages to insult the original in every way imaginable. It's no accident that Sony had to enact a review embargo to save face, or else this would have made no money whatsoever. I won't get into any spoilers, but rest assured that this is a pure man-hating film through and through, and it's not even a good one. Politically correct movies that push a certain agenda can still be good (Frozen), but Ghostbusters is not an example of such a movie.Save your money and either see something else or stay at home.

		<shortDescription>So utterly disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So then, Paul Feig's Ghostbusters reboot. Firstly I have to say that I really wanted to like the film - I've adored the original for 30 years and as a child was obsessed with all things Ghostbusters. Anything that brings Ghostbusters back to popular culture can only be a good thing. However I didn't like it. The humour of the film is very flat and broad. If the idea of making someone listen to a recording of a fart is your cup of tea, then great. You'll probably like this. Chris Hemsworth's Kevin is completely unfunny and the joke wears thin very quickly. The cameos are poor, very poor, with the exception of Annie Potts, who's awesome, but blink and you'll miss her. There was no need for Slimer's cameo - his effect and design is poor too. The last 3rd of the film comes across as a live-action version of The Real Ghostbusters cartoon, albeit with different Ghostbusters. The weirdest thing about the whole film is it's tone. It's so off. The jokes bonk you over the head, there's no subtlety, no nuance. The one time the bust a ghost (the dragon - why a dragon? More Real Ghostbusters playing into the script is my thinking) it feels almost like Ghostbusters but then it falls away The mannequin scene could have been great and legitimately scary, but it's over so quickly. And the Ozzy Osbourne cameo is woeful. In the 1984 original the movie is acted with a serious tone - almost as if it's a horror, the jokes come from Akroyd/Ramis/Hudson/Murray reaction to the situation their in- this is written very flatly - there's no depth to the characters. At all. So disappointing - there's potential here, but it's all undone by a messy script, unfunny jokes and a climax that's cartoonish with no sense of jeopardy. I've been waiting 27 years for this and I'm gutted.</fullReview>

The special effects were just astonishingly terrible. I cant for the life of me understand how they ended up with special effects worse than movies like Sharknado and crud like that.The four main characters were a complete disaster, did not work at all &amp; for the life of me, I can not even remotely understand the casting choices?

		<fullReview>That Sony Pictures manipulated the public with a virtue signalling marketing campaign. The movie studios like controversy sometimes, like with the new Ghostbusters movie, it mean they can promote their movie to a group, or social movement. They deleted non-sexist, well thought out opinions. On the other hand, wildly sexist, racist, and illiterate remarks were being left untouched. This can only mean they wanted these controversial remarks to be see as the majority. By stirring this pot, Sony made it a huge media frenzy, and everyone on both sides of the controversy have fallen for it. How do I know this, because watched while they did it to my posts and and others. This can only mean they wanted these controversial remarks. Now everyone has to see the movie because they are a social justice warrior, curious what the fuss is about, or to prove they are not a misogynist. In other words?.Sony Pictures created a gender conflicted to help sell this movie, and we all fell for it. I saw the new Ghostbusters. It's not the worst movie ever made, nor even the worst movie this year. This was worthy of a Redbox rental (not my first choice either) and not a trip to the movies. The "reboot" part of the new Ghostbusters movie is the problem, not the female cast. There are a few cherished classics like Ghostbusters, Back to the Future, etc, that I feel should not mess with. Now if this was a new Ghostbusters movie, and these ladies (who I like by the way) were opening up their own franchise years later, maybe in a different city, I would like with that. I hate how people are spinning it so if you don't like the movie, then you are sexist or a hurt fanboy. I love the kick butt female "Rey" character from the new "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" movie...because she is a new kick butt female character. But I would have been upset if the say made Luke, a Lisa in a Star Wars reboot. Please make some new female characters and new female heroes, not recycled male roles. There are many awesome female actresses, some of which are in this movie, who deserve new roles they can make their own. Giving them old male roles puts them in a box, that's nearly nearly impossible to break free of.</fullReview>

Must be from some misogynist pigs who are threatened by the idea of female leads. That would be like saying the original film is a woman-hating-sexist attack against actresses everywhere. Not true. A completely ridiculous notion. This film is hilarious. From start to finish. And so much fun. I am obsessed with the original film and this one did not disappoint. You are not watching a movie that was simply remade as the same film with female actors. It took the original idea and created a new hilarious plot. Also keep in mind the original Ghostbusters fully support this movie. This is something Ramis would've been proud of. If you are not able to sit back and enjoy the hilarity in this movie, you are bitter and sad and need to lighten up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartbreaking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was originally going to give this movie a miss, but my boy had seen the trailers and was really excited to see the follow up to our favourite movie of all time. As a huge fan of the original, I have to judge it as a Ghostbusters film (which is only fair as the studio is trading off the franchise), rather than a generic Hollywood Summer Blockbuster. Well as a Ghostbusters movie it absolutely stinks. It's rotten.I've read quite a lot of official reviews that say it's better than GB2, in what universe I ask you? GB2 had serious structural flaws compared to the first, there's no doubt, but its jokes and set pieces are still some of the most iconic of the franchise. Seeing as how no one who has made this claim has in any way tried to back it up, let me compare the two right here and now. First the baddies. Vigo vs Rowan. No contest, Vigo - the Scourge of Carpathia, the Sorrow of Moldavia, conducting his evil bidding from a painting in Manhattan, wins hands-down. Rowan is a terrible baddie, he'll be forgotten a few months after the Blu-Ray release. So let's compare the good guys. GB2 relies on the magnificent chemistry between Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis and Hudson to drive it along and whatever the structural flaws, the chemistry is as strong as ever. Wiig, McCarthy, McKinnon and Jones do not share any chemistry, it's actually painful to see them on screen together. Even as individuals they fall far short of the original cast. If we take Wiig as an analogue to Murray, there's no contest; Murray gains a flawless victory. People are still quoting Venkman lines from GB2, "bummer", no one will be quoting Erin Gilbert in (nearly) 30 years time. The same is true for the rest of the cast head- to-head. To save time I'll just highlight the example of McKinnon, who I love on SNL, but couldn't bear in this movie. She's clearly the Egon character, but she phones it in, playing a generic 'kook' and going so over the top that it basically ruins half of the scenes that she's in. Again, McKinnon, like Wiig, has no funny or memorable lines such as 'lets see what happens when we take away the puppy' and her humour is weird for the sake of it, rather than the deadpan brilliance of the late Harold Ramis. Jones is simply loud and brash. The supporting characters are just regurgitated, worse versions of people from the originals, there isn't a single character in the movie who comes close to the creepy-comedy brilliance of Peter MacNichol's Janosz, one of the greatest, most iconic supporting characters in any comedy!So let's look at the structure and set pieces. If GB2 was structurally flawed, GB2016 "should be condemned", (see what I did there?) I don't want to spoiler the movie, so I'll keep to scenes and plot devices already revealed by the trailers. Firstly, the rock concert scene falls completely flat compared to the courthouse scene in GB2. The ghosts released by Rowan serve little purpose and lack the comedy mischief of the ghosts in the original, seemingly just there to give a use for the very obvious greenscreen effects that Feig uses much too liberally. Rowan's machine is a cheap cop-out and is in no way comparable to the absolutely terrifying and completely awesome river of slime flowing through the spooky abandoned subway. GB2 was all about creating some legitimate scares (Titanic docking!) and a feelgood factor which it did through some iconic set pieces. There is no feelgood factor to this new movie. It feels cheap in a nasty way and is surprisingly cynical for something that I've read is supposed to be aspirational in some way.I could go all day comparing the two but let's just say that GB2016 in no way measures up side by side to GB2. I suspect that the reason some reviewers are making that claim is to try and salvage something from this God-awful mess, so people will say 'hey, at least it's not the worst Ghostbusters movie.' It must be shilling because when you put all the elements of the two movies side-by-side, it's clear that despite its flaws, GB2 is simply better in every way than this lazy reboot. But here's the thing, my kid enjoyed it. He didn't like it as much as Ghostbusters, or even Ghostbusters 2, but he thought it was neat regardless. I think kids will like this film because it's flashy and the jokes are crude and obvious; adults who loved the subtle, dry wit of the original will probably be turned off by the listless, rehashed, gross-out humour and half-hearted performances. I have one more story to share that I think any parent might want to know before taking their child to see this film. When we came out of the cinema, my kid was in a funny mood that I've never seen him in before, half-hyped and half-pensive. I asked him if he was feeling alright and he said 'yeah', then there was this long pause and I could see him struggling with something. Eventually he turned to me and said, 'dad, when I grow up I want to be a lady'. I was pretty taken aback but I tried not to show it, instead I just said to him 'well you know you can be whatever you want to be sport; why do you want to be a lady, is it to be like the new Ghostbusters?'. And he just looked at me with eyes that seemed older than his years and said, 'no dad, it's because this film made me realise all guys are either stupid or evil, so it's better just to be a lady I guess...'My heart broke a little.</fullReview>

I learned nothing of the human condition and the action was cheesy; don't waste your time with this one. I don't want to give away any spoilers so I can't go into as much detail as I want to, but I will say the ending was probably the most obvious one I've seen to date. The cinematography wasn't as bad as some of my family members say. The people filming clearly new what they were doing and didn't put a million lense flares in the movie. The pretty good cinematography is what earned this film 1 star. The story wasn't new, and they didn't even try and revamp it besides the female characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say about this film!!I was skeptical about this film, and to a certain extend I was totally against it coming out. Had this been a third movie 10 years ago, with the original four it might have had a far different outcome.Despite my initial cynicism, I decided to give it a go with an open mind. The reality after the first 30mins began to hit me. It was as bad as if feared, I felt like this was an insult to the original franchise. Like many others maybe they should have left this alone.I'm not saying women shouldn't play the lead roles, nor this was an anti-male theme, but I can see what people are saying. Very cleverly hidden in the context of the film, you felt this was clearing throwing the strong, independent women of today into your face. The male secretary was as thick as a plank, again made you feel like he couldn't be of greater intelligence and that men were significantly inferior.The jokes you wanted to laugh at, were overall awful. Again American comedy was not the issue, as I've found this type of humour funny in the past (the American office for example). They also tried to constantly every other sentence throw in a joke, a quip or sarcastic remark, it fell flat on most occasions, and in our movies theater you could often hear sarcastic laughing or snorts of derision.It was for the majority a copy of some points in the original, maybe they should have just gone for something completely new. Again it was this type of repetition, along with the lame jokes that could make you want to walk towards the exit.... Yes I felt like leaving.To summarise for new people to the franchise, families etc may enjoy this. It's far from the worst film ever seen. That said for the hardcore fans, north of 25 years old who grew up with this film, I'd suggest you save your time and money there's no joy to be found here. The two hours it sucks away from your life could be better filled maybe having your teeth extracted by tying a rope to your car bumper and driving off.Shocking sequel, an insult to the original films!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think my review is fair and honest. In 1984 a classic movie was made called Ghostbusters. In 2016 a remake was attempted, a version for SJW (social justice warriors) . An all woman cast that fails at every turn of a devastatingly poor script page. The original movie was , original funny and new. The remake is a remake. Why bother ? Just to put these women in the roles of men. They all make more money than us so whom cares about equal opportunity. It would be better to make a movie with regular working class people, unknowns and pay them millions. This is why Hollywood is on its last legs. A money machine unable to capture the imaginations of people, so they use focus groups and big data to tell us what is funny. The Ghostbusters is not original or funny . All the money and so called stars can not save this movie from itself. I want my time back.</fullReview>

My kids will never let me hear the end of it. But more importantly, this is a fun and funny movie! Fun to see all the old- timey references to the original Ghostbusters and funny all the way thru. Wiig and McCarthy have tons of jokes of course; Jones is very funny and personable and keeps the whole crew grounded; MacKinnon is just plain funny with every move she makes. The sets and special effects are really gorgeous. We saw it in 3-D which I highly recommend. Jones' character should not be called "subway worker." She's the historian -- a New York City history expert -- and her knowledge is absolutely essential to the plot. I cannot WAIT for the sequel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hemsworth steals the show!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to the cinema with mixed feelings about this movie. I have never been a big Ghostbusters fan, but i really enjoyed the Feig/McCarthy movie Spy, and i hoped that this one would be in the same alley.In some few nuggets of comedy there are moments where you laugh good,but it is a little bit oxymoron that it is Hemsworth that actually provides these moments of comedy gold. Because it is obvious that there is a a political statement in this movies, to the jokes about how stupid men to the end battle where the bad guy gets castrated.This would not bug me so much if the comedy was quality. Unfortunately its not. McKinnon and Jones are good, talentful comedians, but this movie is not right for them. Mainly because they need some more movie-experience to get the timing and body-language that is required by a top-movie, SNL can not provide that before tackling a Blockbuster-production like Ghostbusters. Especially McKinnon suffers here, as she has trouble with finding her own identity in a role that is more than a 5 min sketch on SNL, and her body language is trying to be a Jim Carrey light, without succeeding. In scenes where she is supposed to be in the background, she does strange things that draws the attention from the dialogue of the rest of the crew.McCarthy is comfortable with Feig and they perform much of the same routine as they did in Spy, while Wiig manages to balance her role good enough. However, the big star of this movie is Hemsworth that is the pillar of comedy in this movie. His line and "dumbwitted" acting is perfect for the role.Now, the biggest problem is the lack of a good foundament for the franchise. Feig unfortunately does not dare to go his own way, and the story feel forced to appeal to everyone. Some of the dialogue is also cringe-worthy (the power of patty) and made go into fetal position on the cinema-chair.There is no clear picture of what Ghostbusters want to be, and if a sequel comes, i hope Feig dares to make his own vision clearer in the movie.So to end this review, not good, Hemsworth steals the show and makes it worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignore the haters--it's a solid, funny movie! (No spoilers, but to be safe...)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see the film just a few days before they took it off the movie theaters in my city-- and I was a little bit worried the movie might, in fact, suck as much as the haters who jumped on the hate train said it would. But to my delight, it didn't suck at all!The people in the theater laughed a lot, gasped when they saw a cameo, and seemed to love the action scenes (McKinnon has an awesome action scene). I found the rhythm of the movie to be good; not once did I get bored or felt it went too slow. Editing is solid, audio is great, story is actually very good since they are introducing new generations to the Ghostbusters world, so they take time to explain how some things work (without slowing the movie down). We learn about this world along with the characters, which is great.The characters seemed like real people, with real worries and problems and insecurities as the rest of us. I don't get the Leslie Jones hate, her character isn't as cliché as the trailers made it seem. I did find McCarthy's voice a bit annoying, though. She seems to yell a lot, even when the scene doesn't require it. The antagonist threw me a bit; the acting seemed a bit too much, too exaggerated. His motivations *are* cliché. To me, the character was lacking (too one-dimensional) and a bit disappointing. No better than the first original Ghostbusters movie (though Gozer had style).Hemsworth has good comedic chops. I was not expecting that. His character is a parody of the blonde bimbo ever so popular in many, many movies (I think it also pokes fun at millennials' attitudes towards work). So don't take it too seriously. His character is absurd, after all. But funny. The only thing that I found a bit jarring was near the end, when the antagonist takes a certain form that kinda breaks with the tone of the movie (well, to be honest, other apparitions kinda break with the traditional ghostbusters' ghosts....) They don't seem to fit well with the tone of the movie, but then I remembered the gargoyles of the original first Ghostbuster movie, as well as Gozer, and got over it.There are the typical small problems script-wise and editing-wise, but no more than usual in a movie like this one. Overall, I laughed and gasped happily with the cameos and had a really good time. I left the theater feeling very satisfied with this movie, and happy that new generations have been introduced to Ghostbusters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't want to see this film with all the negative reviews about it firstly from Youtube as hearing the film would be a reboot my expectations sank even further and further as I watched the film unfold in my eyes, the film in itself has no redeeming qualities in the terms of good acting with a decent script the film falls right flat right away as with a lot of boring pointless unfunny dialogue which the original film hooked you right from the start. this film just failed without having anything interesting in it was just based on recycled ideas from other film not just from the original classic but it felt like to be honest a Scooby Doo film with all the daftness and poor special effects.What was really awful was the incoherent plot lines if it had a plot that I could follow without feeling the needs to turn my head away in a lot of scenes it was bad to watch to say it the most cringiest about it was the fact that every male in the film was an idiot the manager at the concert screamed like a girl!!, everything in the film is a mess it's just a train wreck with everything that was in the original just trashed upon everything that fans loved about the original is mocked in this parody.I don't like the film but it could have been so much better if it was not a ripoff of the original the actresses were fine but I think badly miss cast with poorly thought out ideas, the new car Ecto 1 was a joke also the costumes it looked like a cosplay on Ghostbusters rather than a film you could take seriously.1/10</fullReview>

But it does not deserve such negative reviewsIt's entertaining, it has great dialogue and for me it was worth watching just for Kristen Wiig who I find adorable.

		<shortDescription>Ghostbusters (2016)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though I respect its position in the altar of "geek" culture, I have never been a fan of Ghostbusters (1984). I find it a likable relic of its time (the villain was an ecologist!), as well as an excellent sample-book of optical and practical special effects which, in my humble opinion, initiated the trend of "flares" and electric stelae we keep seeing nowadays. However, I think it could have been more polished as a comedy, while the action was quite insipid. However, on the other side, I liked the characters pretty much: four eccentric scientists with contrasting personalities who took their mission seriously. And now, 32 years later, the remake (or reboot, or whatever it is) Ghostbusters changed some things, but it basically kept the same pros and cons of the original movie. That means that the best thing keeps being the characters. Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy make a perfect work in their roles, and the relationship between their characters feels natural and realistic; intelligent colleagues who had similar interests during their youth, and whose friendship embittered when they undertook very different academic routes. Wiig and McCarthy express everything we need to know about their characters with few words; and I found their transformation into "ghostbusters" logical and well handled. Kate McKinnon steals the movie with her performance, while Leslie Jones displays credibility and quite an enthusiasm in her role. As for the negative elements of the movie... none of them is catastrophic; they are simply a series of details which got accumulated until cooling my enthusiasm a bit. To start with, it was hard for me to swallow the villain, mainly due to his non-existent motivation, while the whole affair with the mayor isn't more than an unnecessary distraction, even though it was pleasant to see Andy García again on the screen. But what I liked the least in Ghostbusters (2016) is the fact that it kept the same bland tone of the original film. The ghosts aren't scary, there is no suspense and the action scenes are weakly executed and full of inconsistencies, maybe under the excuse that we are watching a comedy, and therefore, the action can be funny instead of exciting; as a result, it isn't either of both. In other words, I didn't feel director Paul Feig comfortable enough with the two facets of the movie (action and comedy). Or maybe, it was my mistake to expect Ghostbusters (2016) to be a genuine "horror comedy", in which the threat would have felt real and the humor would have been useful to slow down the tension. In other words, something similar to "horror comedies" from the '80s such as Fright Night (1985), An American Werewolf in London or The Return of the Living Dead. In my opinion, that innovation would have been enough to justify this remake/reboot/rehash; but, as I said, it was unrealistic for me to expect such a big creative dare. I said they were "details", but my list of complaints sounds too severe. It's not like that; Ghostbusters (2016) kept me entertained, and that was enough to rescue the experience. In fact, I would be interested in watching a sequel in order to spend more time with its likable main characters. But I think it would need a director less afraid of the material and definitely more "geek"; my proposals would be Edgar Wright, James Gunn or Drew Goddard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's an old saying: If it's broken, don't fix it. This reboot of Ghostbusters, doesn't just break it, It smashes it with a hammer, pushes everything into the wrong pegs, and then shoves it into a garbage disposal. In my years as a movie-goer, I have never seen a worst attempt at a movie, and I have seen stinkers in my almost forty years. This "reboot" (And I use the term loosely) is Sony's attempt at Happy' Madison's "Master Of Disguise" as far as I'm concerned. It was little more than male bashing, failed attempts at comedy and the writing was...just horrendous. The special effects were something out of a damn Disney Movie, instead of the scares that the original had. Indeed, Harold Ramis must be gyro-spinning in his bleeding grave. To the actors and actress's credit, they are all very talented, but this, essentially took a rather large steaming crap on a great franchise while attempting, blatantly, to push a feminist agenda. If this is an attempt at being inclusive, It succeeded, in the form of this steaming turd of a movie. I want my near two hours back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ghostbusters? Really!? You Sure?! I Don't Think So!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did not find any humor in this film for anyone above the age of 9, unlike the original which was multifaceted with oodles of hilarity for all ages. The whole time I watched this mess I wondered if I was part of a joke or if the mastery of Ackroyd was just a lit fuse that fizzled around 1993. Really was rooting for the old guard to show up and "pass the torch" but there is none of that. The old cast is pretty much reduced to inappropriate, disrespectful cameos. Ackroyd is portrayed as a confused senior citizen driving a cab..perhaps appropriate given how confusing "his masterpiece" has become. The entire film can be summed up as the kind of SNL skits, that fall apart and beg for laughs but just never materialize, strewn together in a haphazard, incoherent attempt to reboot the Ghostbusters franchise. I never thought this title was a true successful franchise to begin with. There was a sequel in 1989 which failed to ignite the magic of the first but it was a charming effort at least. This was none of that. Just another attempt to bait and switch a popular name brand into a shoddy representation. It's a crime that this cherished title to so many has been watered down and publicized as some political football somehow related to feminism. The only feminist issue is how they exploited these actress/comedians by refusing them the A-list material most of us remember from the original Ghostbusters. That is really an injustice to them and to the fans of this brand.</fullReview>

But don't blame me, there was nothing left to see, and I bought the tickets to this movie knowing that it was going to suck... And guess what?-it sucked. Balls. Why did it suck? Because the movie has absolutely no structure whatsoever, it's sloppy, the characters are all stereotypical and I didn't laugh whatsoever. I found strange that the theater was filled with laughter at jokes that I found too dumb to even consider it as jokes. Then, there was a point where the movie became boring and annoying and I wanted to leave... To conclude my thoughts: This movie absolutely sucks and it should be skipped by you guys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun comedy and excellent reboot with fantastic cast.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I laughed out loud, as did the rest of the audience, more times than I can count. It was funny throughout and touching at parts. It paid homage to the original tastefully with cameos and walk-ons. The four leading ladies were phenomenal and had some great growth through the plot. It was great to see a reboot with a female cast full of funny badass women. Ignore the haters and mras and see this flick.A lot of the negative reviews here are clearly from naysayers who don't see the irony in their own comments. Yes this movie had a predominantly female cast. That isn't sexist. How would it possibly be sexist to cast four women if you maintain it wasn't for four men to be cast. Get real.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ghostbusters Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ghostbusters is a truly hilarious movie that completely lives up to the original, even (heresy) surpassing it. Wiig, McCarthy, McKinnon, and Jones completely sell their characters, and you can tell that they improvised many of their lines of dialogue. In addition, the special effects are wonderful, bringing an updated look at these ghosts while (intentionally) not rendering them truly scary as if in a horror movie. A strong benefit to the film's success is that it is not a carbon copy of the original film- the ghostbusting team is formed in a different way, and the threat they face is different and unique- in fact, the plot is actually better handled this time, with the ghosts actually showing up at this specific time for a reason instead of just random coincidence, and Leslie Jones is not just thrown into the plot for no reason, like Ernie Hudson. McKinnon and Hemsworth (playing a satirical counterpoint to the tokenism of many modern movies) are true standouts in the cast because their characters are so wholly original, but there are many hilarious supporting actors- Charles Dance, Steve Higgins, and Andy Garcia are great as two very different university deans ("You're only here because the last dean went to jail.") and the mayor of New York ("never compare me to the Jaws mayor. NEVER!"). There are some scenes that build a lot of tension and thrilling action scenes, but the best moments are small sequences of dialogue (which the dire trailer did not capitalize on, as in all the other Feig/Dippold projects like "Spy" and "Parks and Recreation". The cameos from the original stars are humorous as well, with Ernie Hudson and Sigourney Weaver playing brief but bizarre characters. However, no movie is perfect, and a few problems include a few dumb, broad jokes (mostly in the beginning of the film), the underuse of Cecily Strong, and the new theme song (although it is only in the film for a minute, and Ray Parker Jr. dominates both the opening and ending credits). Speaking of these credits, they are jam-packed with bonus scenes and ridiculous bloopers, and make sure you stay until the very end of the movie for an extra surprise. Overall, Ghostbusters rates a solid 9/10 for its cast, dialogue, effects, and original plot line, making sure this is not a childhood-ruining disaster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honest review from huge fan of the original (7/10 but my daughter says 9/10)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 9 when I first saw Ghostbusters in the theater. It was the first soundtrack I ever purchased, and the first tape i bought with my own money. It was the first DVD and bluray i ever purchased as well. I love the movie. It is my favorite film of all time. And honestly the reboot is as good as it really can be, and that is not terrible. This version will not become part of the cultural zeitgeist like the original. It cannot, not with all the negative press and hand- wringing. But the movie is a pleasant homage to what an entire generation holds dear. Its a love letter to an American classic. The women more than hold their own. Their are all talented actors at the top of their game. Do they have the same chemistry as the original team? No. The science is a little too hokey and forced, the plot a little too contrived. That what something I honestly enjoyed about the original, stuff just...happened. There wasn't a plot constructed to make it happen. Here, there is always something driving the story. So right off the bat, its a little different. Times are different, audiences are different. The movie industry is different. There is nothing that said any sequel would have been any better or worse than the reboot. So take what you have and judge it on its own merits. All of this is to say, I love the original. I liked the reboot. The throwbacks are warm and heart-felt. the cameos are a tad annoying, but it just reminded me of how wonderful the original is, and how delicate everyone involved tried to be in handling such a beloved property.I will admit, I was concerned when I heard the reboot would be a team of women. It just didn't feel...right. Venkman is a narcissistic womanizer for Pete's sake, how could they find a woman to play that as well as Murray?! Well, they didn't have to. And Im here to tell you you're going to be OK about it. Last year I was able to take my 7yo son and 5yo daughter to Star Wars like my father did for me when I was five. And now I've taken may son and daughter to Ghostbusters. And they both loved it. LOVED IT. When my daughter says to me she wants to be a Ghostbuster for Halloween, if I wasn't OK with the movie before, I am now. Give it a chance. These ass-hats giving it a 1 out of 10 are angry and hated it before they bought the ticket. I would imagine many haven't even seen it. If you weren't going to give it a chance, just don't see it. I have seen it. And it wasn't man hating, feminist unfunny garbage as some have called it. It was a pleasant movie, funny, well made and a great time with my kids.7 out of 10, but my daughter said it was a 10. So I gave it a 9 because it deserves a higher rating than it currently has.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected something awful from all the bad buzz, so maybe that put me in the right mood. I've always been tepid on the acting and commitment of Bill Murray in the original. That's informed my ambivalence about the film as a "classic" I thought the reboot was tighter and funnier. Especially Kate McKinnon's eccentric performance. I know I'm alone on this but the ensemble was better even if the reboot didn't break new ground. A worthy homage and a lovely "cameo" by Harold Ramis. :) I am sickened by the slagging of Leslie Jones. Fun to see Thor as a bimbo. Very funny. I'm a huge fan of Spy, and this had much of the same off beat humor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, Kate McKinnon completely steals this movie and proves what I said about her a couple of years ago when they really increased her presence in SNL - she is a comedic genius.From the few reviews I have read, I am finding that people took this movie WAY to seriously. This movie was a stage for 4 of the best female comedians out there to take us down a warped nostalgic trip. Yes, there were many similarities to the previous movie, and that's what was great about it! Enough similarities to remind me how much I loved the previous movies, and not enough to be completely predictable as to what the next scene would be. And the cameos by previous GB actors were perfectly placed. If you loved the previous movies, don't wait to go see this, most especially for one of the craziest performances by Kate McKinnon she has done.</fullReview>

But I did think to laugh at the hilarity of it. It doesn't copy the original but it does have some parallels. There are some good cameos and for someone who did see the original in the theater years ago, I think I can say that this one is OK. They did use Kate McKinnon a few times for too long, I agree with that. But you knew that was going to happen. If you take yourself too serious, then don't go. But if you like to have fun and laugh, go for it. I did go to the 3D version, but I have heard the 2D was just as good. However, I do think that some of the ghosts had to have looked better 3D.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They turned Ghostbusters from a comedy into a brainless action flick with endless product placement. The film never even tries to establish them as competent Ghostbusters. They only manage to trap one ghost in the entire film. A supposedly genius level scientist releases that one ghost, to prove a point. That ghost promptly murders paranormal skeptic played by Bill Murray, who no doubt was thrilled to be eliminated forever from this Ghostbusters reboot universe.Every male character is a negative stereotype.However the biggest stereotype is Leslie Jone's character. Leslie Jones character will be remembered as a 21st century gender-swapped Uncle Remus. Hopefully in twenty years Lady Ghostbusters (2016) will be shunned like Song of the South.It would have been more respectful to the franchise if they dug up Harold Ramis and defecated on his corpse for an hour and thirty minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a die-hard fan of the original 'Ghostbusters'. I've seen it countless times and it remains one of my all-time favourite comedies. Having said that, I find the sequel lifeless and forgettable. Superfluous, even. I am absolutely not indiscriminate.And yet I liked Paul Feig's 'Ghostbusters'.I really liked it.Yes, the trailers were lame. Whoever cut them made me want to not see the movie; they really did not do the movie justice. In fact, most (not all) of the gags that fell flat in the trailer worked in their proper context. Even some of the reheated ones.The cast was pretty good and they had an excellent dynamic. I was most pleasantly surprised by Melissa McCarthy, who isn't all shouty for once (think Ray without the naiveté), and Kate McKinnon, who plays a smart, creative, quirky and bad@$$ chick.Yes, there are plenty of small bits that I could have done without, including the gimmicky arsenal, the product placement, some of the cameos, an over-the-top, action-heavy finale (as well as Hemsworth's part in it), amongst other things.But I had a really good time. And, seriously, I would see more of Feig's 'Ghostbusters' if they made more. I would love to see where they take it from here, how the characters evolve, and how they develop the concept. Yes, I will see this one again.I'd give it a 7.75 out of 10 (not quite an 8, but certainly better than average)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew from the very beginning that I wasn't going to like this movie. I had seen the trailer and commercials and thought "Wow, there's no way in hell I'm gonna waste my money on that." But, when the movie came out, my girlfriend talked me into taking her to see it. The film had been out for about three days when I took her. I bought our tickets, and we entered the auditorium. I noticed that we were the only two people there, but I figured that since this was such a big movie, and that we were a little early, more people will probably show up. That did not happen. So there we were, sitting in the theater, by ourselves, waiting for the movie to start. Once I saw the opening logos start up, I knew that I was going to be spending the next two hours of my life in hell! The humor was poorly written, the special effects were laughable, and it payed no respect to the source material. Don't get me wrong, I love all of the main actresses of this movie! They're usually very funny and very good at delivering comedy in just about everything they do. But that just wasn't the case for this movie. I don't blame them, I blame the writers and the director. We were about half way into the movie when my girlfriend said "Why did they purposely make it so bad?" I was shocked to hear that she didn't like it either, as she had previously been very enthusiastic about it. I asked her if she'd like to leave but she told me that she wanted to see if it would get better. So we sat there for a little while longer. I heard later from a few other people that the movie was sexist against men in place. I believe that that's a bit of an over-exaggeration, but I can definitely see where they're coming from. After sitting there for another half-hour or so, she finally said "Nope! We need to get the hell outta here!" Which we did. We then returned home, and watched the real Ghostbusters. All I can say is, I pray to God that they don't make a sequel, because this was just a bad idea that needs to be buried in the past.</fullReview>

The "Freak" guy also directed, and he strove mightily to make Boston (and Australia) be NYC and breath life into his words.They both failed. This remake (it is entirely a remake of GB-1) has no energy, no wit, and cannot bring itself to do anything new at all. The actresses struggle mightily (the actors might as well have all been made of cardboard -- including the bizarrely-Australian Chris Hemsworth), but cannot escape the flaccid story and lines they have been presented with.Its just all so lazy. They expect us to giggle like children for the cameos of the originals (and so they are carefully sprinkled through the movie -- including the firestation, and the sta- puft man), and love the story because of it. Sorry, no. They expect us to be enchanted with anti-ghost hand grenades and such. Sorry, no. They expect us to love the characters because they are just like the originals. Sorry, no. They expected us to laugh when characters screamed and shouted, in simulation of emoting. Sorry, no.Nobody wanted to take a risk "with the brand", so nobody did. The movie is dedicated to Harold Ramis, who I suspect would be disgusted with the lack of originality and humor.Save your money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this last week. While it's not the worst comedy I've ever seen, it was very boring for me, for two reasons. I fault the writing for me not liking it, not the actors or the director (well, maybe a little on the director). First is that it seemed like every, or every other line had to be a joke. You could see them coming, predictable, and no surprises. Second, none of the characters were a "straight man" or voice of reason. Every single star had to try and make jokes. A "normal" or non-joking character makes any comedy funnier. Case in point, the original Ghostbusters. Bill Murray was the jokester, the rest of the characters were either victims of his jokes, or of the circumstances, and that made it all that much more funny to me. All 5 main characters in this movie were written like stand up comedians. I fell asleep once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harold Ramis is rolling in his grave</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to start? The new Ghostbusters is easily one of the worst films I have ever viewed. The film starts off on the right foot. It has a creepy setup where we are introduced to our first ghost. The way the film begins you have a false sense of security that the remake may do the original films justice. That false sense of security quickly evaporates when the Ghostbusters meet up with the Dean of Higgins Science Institute. The humor because toilet humor mixed with the really bad humor that we have seen on Saturday Night Live the last decade. With each passing minute from this point, the film becomes more painful and unbearable to watch. If you watched the original trailer for this film, you will remember the same repetitive gag that made the trailer unlikable. I first believed this was the person that cut the trailer, but sadly we see the same repetitive gag with McCarthy and Chinese delivery man, Wiig and Hemsworth, Leslie Jones and every situation she is in, etc. This is a common theme in SNL films. I have seen this with Mike Myers in his films, Adam Sandler with his etc. This becomes tiresome and frustrating for audience members. Can no comedian not just reinventing themselves after a couple years but have more than the same 5 jokes repetitively in the film? What I liked about the film. There is not much, but here it is. I loved Kate McKinnon as Holtzman. She was funny and played her role really well. She had different jokes and situations throughout the film. I also liked the cameos by some of the original cast members. Sadly Ramis passed away and Rick Moranis retired long ago after his wife died. What I hated. There is a lot here. The film was uneven. The film did not have a natural flow. I did not like McCarthy, Wiig, or Jones characters. Jones was the stereo typical African-American, McCarthy once again in a comedy played the same annoying friend that she has played since Brides Maid, and Wiig played the same serious friend or "straight woman." Chris Hemsworth, let's make him the dumb eye-candy but for women this time instead of men. If Feminist wants to call those roll sexist, then you have to the same here. You can't pick or chose when to use the term. A spade is a spade. The demon on Leslie Jones shoulders at the heavy metal concert. Since the plot of the film was someone was summoning ghosts to destroy and terrorize the world, why was there a demon involved? The ending's fight sequence left a lot to be desired. They fight their Ghostbusters symbol. It looked like a poor man's Oogie Boogie from The Nightmare Before Christmas. And yes to defeat him, they had to shoot him in the balls. For some reason, when you are a male ghost your one weakness is you can still feel a shot to the balls. Overall this is just not one of the worst remakes I have ever seen, but one of the worst films I have ever seen. No critic wants to be labeled a misogynist so they will be afraid to actually review the film with all the venom so far spewed by Hollywood. This film plain out sucks. I rather have a movie marathon of Ang Lee's The Hulk, The New Fantastic Four (2016), and Steven Seagal's straight to DVD collection then sit through this again. Uwe Boll would have done this film better justice. The film scores a 2 out of 10 which translated into a D- .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unintelligent Over-rushed mess with Great 3D *Spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just got back. First off, I tried to be subjective, but you can't help yourself but to compare it to the original. First off, yes I am a fan of the original. That's where this movie happens to go wrong. It's like watching a bad karaoke song. IT took me a bit to figure out one word that would describe this movie, and the perfect word is "Unintellegent" So I'll start off with the positive. Effects A++ This is a pure 3D movie. It was designed 3D and not just fake 3D like all other movies that claim to be 3D. This explains all the colors and goofy ghosts they created that are in the commercials. They used the Black bars on the top and bottom perfectly for that extra proton effect or ghost flying around the room. If it wasn't for the almost strip scene credits at the end (I'll explain later), the 3D ride during that was almost worth sticking around. But, That's it for the positive. soooo here we go... Humor F------ This movie is the 3 stooges. Again, I have to compare to the original. What made the original was the type of intelligent humor they used. For Example. Ghostbuster 1984 Ray "You'll never regret this Ray." Peter "My Parents left me that house, i was born there." Ray "You're not going to lose the house, everyone has 3 mortgages these days." Peter "But at 19 percent interest? You didn't even bargain with the guy." Ghostbuster 2016 This one was a bunch of cliché one liners that wasn't even funny! Example "Is it a black thang....." from the commercial &lt; this is the entire movies humor. Story: D- I liked that they tried/attempted to create a bit of a different story, but it failed. Once again comparing to the original. The time-lapse in the 1984 movie felt like the Ghostbusters had been around for Months with Montages they created in the first and second movie showing off all their successes and how they became loved by the city. The 2016 version somehow feels like everything happened within a week or less. Somehow within this week they got together, created a business and saved the city. The villain was a super smart goofy guy who got picked on in school and he wanted payback so he sets up little ghost charge around certain parts of the city which are ghostly tectonic plates. Yes, that's the story. That's just plain dumb. The Ghosts C+ In 1984, when I watched the librarian scene for the first time, I couldn't sleep for a week. Now I laugh at it, but it was convincing then. There was a build up to it (referring to the walkthrough of the library) that climaxed to the "OMFG" moment when you see the ghost. 2016 - Perhaps the use of CGI did it, It all looked like cheesy Halloween ghosts you see around the neighborhood. Overall - 4/10 Again, it has the unfortunate circumstance of being compared to the original. I like the cameos from all the originals minus Miranis and the late Harold Ramis, but you can tell they were just there to support the franchise. In the end Murray gets the final laugh with his ever-wanted Death scene in Ghostbusters. If the original didn't exist, maybe a 5/10 would have better, but I have to compare it. I wasn't impressed with Chris Hemsworth as other reviewers has mentioned. I did chuckle a few times, but I did the same watching 3 Stooges. Disappointed isn't the right word. How can Rotten Tomatos have this thing up so high is beyond me. To address The "attack on Men" piece. Like every other review says, it does insult men in general. Maybe it's payback for all the females in every Michael Bay movie. It doesn't really bother me, but it's more than obvious. It's a movie truly designed for the ladies, (or for some of those few guys), especially with the "Magic Mike XXL" credits that "Thor" does at the end. I mean really?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the announcement of a new Ghostbusters movie was made, fans had back-lashed and trolled on the internet and social media on how this was going to be bad, then things just got worse when the trailer arrived (it went on to become the 12th disliked video on YouTube) further dragging the reboot to be a successful one. But having finally watched it from my own eyes with my mind set off the reality of working life, I will honestly admit and truthfully confess that this reboot was actually better and not as horrible as people made it out to be.The comedic performances of the leading cast were good, with Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, Chris Hemsworth and Kristen Wiig being the standouts on performance and comic delivery. The cameos and nods to the original film were present, but interesting enough that this reboot can stand as its own movie as there is no past mention of the characters involved in the original. The cameos from Murray, Aykroyd, Weaver and Hudson are all enjoyableThe direction of Paul Feig was great as usual, having already established his style of comedic storytelling with wedding comedy 'Bridesmaids', female buddy cop flick 'The Heat' and the surprisingly entertaining and hilarious take on the spy genre 'Spy' but the humour this time is often subtle and never relied heavily on gross toilet humour which is a good thing for me but depending on how you like your comedy films you may want better or more.Overall, the film will get more of a bashing and trash talk out of than praise but I am giving it a positive review for it as I was entertained throughout and I think this will be an underrated or even ignored film for the generation. Just hope it's not a box office bomb in the coming weeks, and I wouldn't mind seeing it again or even get a sequel maybe.3.5/5 - NickWe both grew up watching Ghostbusters 1 and 2. They were both entertaining and charming in so many ways. It captured this amazing comedy/Horror that made it a world wide success. Sadly, for me, and for millions of other people in this world this movie didn't do anybody any favors.When the trailer was released it became the most hated and disliked trailer ever in youtube history, and that's saying a lot! While I definitely would not say I hated this movie, it definitely didn't work for me. It had its moments of charm and humor, and eve scariness, but the cast and the situations they put themselves in just seemed lazy and you could almost every time when they were in front of a green screen. The magic wasn't there. Even the final showdown (while entertaining) wasn't long enough. It had nothing to do with them being female...it has to do with the fact that it wasn't the original cast. Even if you had different male leads it still would've been hated. The original cast just captured the magic.All in all, it wasn't a horrible movie, there are many references and the film makers giving tribute to the old ones, but I simply didn't like it. It didn't work for me. Hemsworth also was really bad in this one. 4/10. 1.5/5 stars. Jay</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember original Ghostbusters. It make me feel happy when walking out of Cinema corridor years ago. That was one reason I went to look this new so called incarnation. I don't expect too much, yet some local critics sure it is entertaining. What a payed liars. When movie have run first 30 minutes, I start to wonder what movie those critics look at. 13 years ago I started to value stars in IMDb and there accumulated 1,169 marks so far. I have been life before internet, yet this turkey for movie beat all when racing category of bad taste and production money wrongly spend. It does not earn to call it self as movie. It is statement of some agenda though. Bad one.Main issues: - Not funny. I don't say all Ghostbusters should always be funny but this obviously try very hard to look funny all time. They constantly fail. Given you clearly have same original script to use for, how on earth? How this can be turned so bad as way down to depressive? - It is only racist, overly feminism extremity. Political statement at most. It make you feel sick. - They have missed whole point of Ghostbusters idea. Busted anyone? Even movie logo have ghost busted.To those who praise turkey. Ten points? Sharing the agenda is no reason to rise mediocrity at most among masterpieces.</fullReview>

This movie as bloated down with way to much pointless comedy that couldn't make a sad person smile. Also take a clue from making a remake or reboot a movie Hollywood if your gonna make it more for this generation for people to watch make it more believable to the true style and facts of what the movie was. Like I told my gf id rather watch the wuzzles over n over then ever watch this crap movie or own it to my collection of movies I own.

		<fullReview>This movie was so tasteless, filled with man hating and race card innuendos that it irrevocably hurt the movie. The story was strained, forced, and the writing was so poor it seemed like a 90 something odd minute skit on SNL. It was a parody of the original and had no magic, no feeling, and no passion that captivated audiences with the first two films. All in all it injured the spirit and fun of the first two original Ghostbusters. The direction of this film was filled with careless mishap. The industry ought to be ashamed of itself. At least call it a parody like it really is; a poorly thought out parody of a great franchise. Another useless Hollywood special effects movie that will be forgotten. I hope to forget that this abomination of a film ever existed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's be clear: the reason this movie sucks has ZERO to do with gender and everything to do with terrible writing and direction. The whole thing falls incredibly flat and tinny thanks to a never ending parade of tired tropes, recycled visual gags poorly executed, and insipid self-nods. Worst of all, there is no saving grace here, nothing to redeem this horrid pile of D List shlock. The only thing even remotely entertaining about this film is watching all of the neckbeards cry about casting while trying to claim sexism. Awww, your representation was reduced to vapid eye candy?

		<fullReview>This is my first review. I'm not a massive fan of first two parts. So I was not crazy about upcoming reboot. It happens that I was on early screening. And I must say that as for a reboot this movie was so sexiest....so feminist with plenty cameos with sloppy jokes. I will come with some small spoilers just to give some best example including part of ending. ----Spoiler----Why does it happen to be that all guys in this movie are idiots?Mayor, delivery guy, Hemsworth was funny but they make him play idiot. The only guy who was smart it was a villain!Even in a final fight, thy shot that bad guy in his nuts!It's like this movie is promoting Girl Power and feminism. Also cameos..it is not just with actors but things from previous movies for example words like "I ain't afraid of no ghosts" was said by Dan Aykroyd cameo.----Spoiler----Instead of some cheap jokes this movie should have some adult sense of humor. More connection between girls because it was missing. First two parts I was watching 20years ago and I still remember them but this movie will be forgettable. Overall as for me, movie is only worth to watch on TV screen with kids on Sunday morning after Scooby Doo....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie really draws a line in the sand between those that want to see authentic organic movies and those that feel movies ought to adhere to some politically correct agenda. I read some reviews on this site of people who fully admitted to not watching the movie yet gave it ten stars because to them this is a vote for PC and feminism. I'll be honest the movie stunk and I wish I hadn't wasted my time or money but I was one of those folks who felt the need to give it a chance for the sake of fairness. It stunk for many reasons which most of the other reviewers have aptly pointed out. My problem with this movie, which gets to the heart of the whole authentic vs PC problem, is that they wrote the characters to be the female equivalent of the original male characters and it just does not work. You can't force a square to be a circle anymore than you can force a female actresses to behave as if she was a male actor. In an ideal world they would write an original script that brings out the creative talents of the four actresses in this movie because they are actually very talented in their own ways however when it comes to attempting to behave like some bad ass dude they aren't able to pull that off. I would love to see more empowering female led action movies but done in a unique way that doesn't simply rip off all of the traits that male actors have in action movies. There is nothing wrong with portraying realistic female action heroes that acknowledges their biological femininity and play off those strengths.This would be far more refreshing from Hollywood and would require the script doctors to actually earn their pay but I am not holding my breath given the current state of focusing solely on reboots, remakes and endless sequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The obvious issue with this movie is that it is an unnecessary reboot of a classic which has been a beloved part of our lives for 32 years. If the original source material does not stand up to the test of time, remake it if you have to...but Ghostbusters 1984 still hits the mark.GB16 admittedly was not as bad as the trailers implied, I fully expected to give it 1 star, but it is bad.The good points: - the music: the good news is that that terrible Fall Out Boy/Missy Elliott concoction makes only a brief appearance, I was pleasantly surprised by the use of the original song - the cameos: we all wanted to see the original cast return in their previous roles of course, but the cameos were done well I thought (except for Bill Murray's, his seemed very strained) watch out for the bust of Harold Ramis, a nice gesture but I think the homage to Harold in the Lego Firestation HQ is far more poignant - the Firestation HQ cameo: it was great seeing it on the big screen again although I never want to see the pole used in the manner suggested by McCarthy! - the supporting cast: Hemsworth and Garcia in particular were quite solid Hemsworth had some good lines and the times I did utter a laugh were down to the supporting castSo basically most things I thought were good about the film had to do with the original and appealed to my sense of nostalgiaThe bad points: - bad script: 95% of the jokes were not funny, the story line was poor, the main bad guy was lame with no real explanation as to why he did what he was doing or how he knew how to create inter- dimensional portals - the main cast: why the original movie stands up to the test of time is mainly due to the characters who feel real. The main cast in this were caricatures, overt stereotypes with no real likable qualities - the weapon testing scenes: slapstick comedy at its worst! - the constant referrals to their sex and race - unnecessary, we can see you're women so we don't need reminding by referrals to your breasts and 'cracks' - the toilet humour: I'm childish enough to laugh at a fart still but when you rely on this type of humour in a summer blockbuster and in a reboot of a movie so revered as GB84 you're doing yourself no favours: to then take it a step further and make a fan*y fart joke, the tone of the movie is just shot to pieces - the CGI: the ghosts looked as bad as they did in the trailer...the original 1984 effects were way betterThe tone of the movie felt similar to The Watch (but not as good, and that wasn't brilliant, although I liked it!) It's a film most will watch out of curiosity like I did, it exists now and that can't be changed it could have been a bit worse but it could have been a whole lot better in the right hands</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are few, if any, redeeming qualities about this movie.The comedy is sub-par and relies heavily on toilet humor. The first recognizable joke in this movie is based off of two of the scientists (yes, they're supposed to be scientists) queefing into an EVP recorder and tricking Kristen Wiig into listening to it. I couldn't make this up if I tried.The only character I genuinely laughed at was Chris Hemsworth, who played the dim secretary hired by the Ghostbusters. Even then, all of the scripted dialogue he had was uncomfortably stiff and awkward, trying too hard to be funny. The few lines and things he clearly ad- libbed actually made me giggle, like putting his finger through the frame of his glasses to scratch his eye, revealing he didn't actually have any lenses.The story is generally messy and unappealing. Wiig, McCarthy and McKinnon all play scientists who team up to study the paranormal phenomena plaguing New York City. They travel to different locations and fight ghosts, slowly upgrading their tech, but plot points fall into their laps conveniently when needed and turn me off as a viewer. The big reveal of the twist occurs because the main villain was stupid enough to write down his plans and illustrate them in a copy he had of Wiig's character's book. Few of the characters were likable or even made sense. Jones' character joins the team because ??? reasons. She's good at navigating the city or something because she reads a lot of nonfiction and works in the subway. Her characters yells a lot. McCarthy and Wiig phone in their performances, and a lot of their laughs come from them being sprayed with vomit or being thrown around by an out-of-control proton pack. McKinnon's character has no personality beyond the stereotypical "wacky scientist!1!" and she seems like a cardboard cutout rather than a real character that we should feel emotion for. There is one brief scene at the end of the movie that tries to hint at the social awkwardness of her cinematographic predecessor (Egon played by the late Harold Ramis, R.I.P.), but there is no hinting at this up until this point in the film. She seems to be a zany, kooky weirdo until she gives a stunted, awkward toast at the end of the film that is supposed to...what? Imply awkwardness? Reveal a deep emotional core of a formerly strange and bizarre character? Show a sudden deeply felt friendship? I have no idea. It felt completely out of place in the movie.The actresses didn't mesh or work well with each other at all. Every scene felt awkward and yelly or like everyone was imitating everyone else's style of comedy, leaving a bland mush of a movie in its place.Overall, just a mediocre movie. And not fun-mediocre, like The Room or Twilight, where you can at least laugh at it enough to enjoy the badness. This movie is like watching paint dry for two hours and then if you didn't like it it calls you a sexist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is overall a really, really fun movie. I had seen enough promotional stuff and enthusiasm from other people to be really excited beforehand and even with high expectations I was still blown away by almost every aspect of it. It's extremely funny and full of lots of different kinds of humour - sitting in the theatre hearing little kids and seniors and everyone in between laughing at the same jokes as well as different ones was really nice. I found the pacing really engaging, effectively getting the audience invested in the plot and the characters and making the build up irresistible. The special effects were really vivid and just right for the tone of the movie. The characters are amazing, multifaceted and compelling, and very relatable. The movie was unexpectedly nuanced and sincere for a summer action comedy and (even without having seen anything else in the franchise) the whole thing was absolutely fantastic .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an uninspired reinvention of the original story with a vital and relevant gender-swapping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The rebooted GHOSTBUSTERS is a reinvention out of the original story written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, with a vital and relevant gender-swapping. And each member of the foursome posse has passed the appraisal as genuine comedienne thanks to their Saturday Night Live stint, not to mention Melissa McCarthy is presently THE most bankable US comedienne in the movie business, which has been kick-started by director Paul Feig's BRIDESMAIDS (2011).In the remake, Erin Gilbert (Wiig), a tenured-to-be physics professor at Columbia University rekindles her passion for paranormal activities when she has to confront her school-day bestie Abby Yates (McCarthy), now a maverick researcher, for publishing the book which they wrote together about the existence of that particular subject matter years ago, behind her back. They meet a real ghost in a haunted house which thrusts them to form a "Ghostbuster" team to catch ghosts, with the participation of the technophile Jillian Holtzman (McKinnon) and the street-smart subway worker Patty Tolan (Jones, not a latecomer like Ernie Hudson in the original, she is a loudmouth and her presence is ubiquitous), who offers them a hearse-revamped automobile, plus a dimwit eye-candy Kevin (Hemsworth, who is amazingly good in his goofy and flippant dash) as their inept secretary, whom, Erin has a crush on (and who doesn't? Maybe only Holtzman, but unfortunately the lesbian undercurrent never catches on).Pristine-looking in present-day New York, the reboot seems rather expensive, and its visual grandeur rightfully gives enough credits to the Special Effects advancement between the whopping thirty-some gap, with highlights like a green reptile ghost which is a mixture of dragon and Baphomet, running amok in a heavy metal concert, and the ultimate boss, a gigantic glowering form of Ghostbusters' trademark logo based on an unthinkable concept that a human being can be changed into an amorphous ghost simply by electrocution, that is what Rowan North (Casey), a withdrawn sociopath, manages to pull off after successfully building a portal to a ghost world.The dutiful cameos (Murray, Aykroyd, Hudson, Weaver, Potts and even the son of the late Harold Ramis) from the original franchise are less than surprising, the real deal here is McKinnon's Dr. Holtzmann, a unique incarnation of both flamboyance and geekiness, she is in effect the life force behind their enterprise, which makes Wiig and McCarthy look rather amateurish in this peculiar line of business, although it does seem to be pretty easy for her to constantly ply the team with updated ghost-capturing weaponry.Labelled as a faithful remake, this fantasy-comedy crowdpleaser doesn't deserve all the backlash, especially those sexist and racist ones, the problem seems to be - Paul Feig and his female- enpowering team ruefully pick a safe route to retread the old path, instead of going off the beaten track, at least for the sake of its comedic fodder, like he did in SPY (2015) last year with McCarthy, especially we are all fully aware what a superlative one-liner and deadpan impersonator Wiig is, alas, the entire project eventually settles for an unambitious aim which has been aptly executed, but, if they hope to reboot a new franchise, the first step is a middling one, and according to the financial turnover, a sequel is a long shot at this point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything It Should Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has received an overwhelming amount of negative attention, but it's unjustified. I'm going to skip over the tirade on misogyny and just talk about the movie.It's amazing.I loved the original Ghostbusters film and mostly loved its sequel. Somewhere in my closet there's a photo album with a picture of me in the single digits wearing my proton pack, complete with the bright yellow foam noodle masquerading as a charged particle stream. But I'm going to ask you, for a moment, to really think about those original two films. They are not untouchable cinematic masterpieces beyond the grasp of our mortal minds. They are goofy, paranormal comedies with SNL veterans and some seriously bad claymation dog demons. Things you may have forgotten: there is a suggestive ghost blowjob scene, a reference to physical intimacy with ectoplasm, and a flying ghost nanny with Peter MacNicol's face. But you overlooked that because 1) you were probably a kid when you first saw them, and 2) Bill Murray can make almost anything funny (except Garfield). I strongly encourage you to re-watch the originals before seeing the reboot. It will give you the right mindset and frame of reference for evaluating and enjoying this 2016 romp.The new Ghostbusters is everything the originals were and more. The cast includes more SNL veterans, the script offers up the same style of questionable humor, and there are plenty of winks and nods for old fans. The special effects looks great, not because I genuinely think that's what paranormal activity looks like, but because they are well coordinated with their live-action shots and the ghosts are the perfect mix of ethereal and silly. The plot is the same as before: a group of rogue scientists and paranormal enthusiasts team up to save New York from a supernatural threat. Kate McKinnon shines as Hotlzmann, flamboyant (and literally flaming) engineer extraordinaire. As a kid, Bill Murray was my comedy hero and I looked up to him like a second dad. In the contemporary film, Kate's character represents someone I can identify with myself. She's hilarious, she's science, and she's perfect. McKinnon is definitely the break out star in this film.Something else you might recall from the original Ghostbusters movies is that they are, for lack of a better phrase, socially problematic. The depiction (and often times lack of depiction) of Winston and some of the portrayals of women are not awesome. They are actually pretty horrible. The new film is not perfect, but it comes a long way. Obviously, there is the contentious issue of gender swapping the team. Why this is so heartily upsetting for people, I can't really say. These women nail it. As a young researcher in STEM myself, I can say the humor and struggle of academia and research science in the movie is pitch perfect. Chris Hemsworth presenting as a dumb blonde trope is not exactly amazing social commentary, but his character is genuinely funny and a delight to watch. (Pro tip: Stay for the credits to see him dance like an unabashed fool for the music video scene.) Leslie Jones' character Patty has earned some ire in the media. After watching the trailer, I was worried about this, but upon seeing the film I feel slightly better. Jones, like the rest of the players, creates a larger than life character who is a blast to watch. She's accessible and hilarious. From the trailer, the audience gets the impression she's a stereotypical "street smart" POC, but Patty is not just a sad remix on the abuse of Winston. She's a municipal historian, self-selects to join the ghostbusting team based on her own experiences, has equal screen time with her peers, and is never characterized as unintelligent or useless. Representation for POC could and should be better, but Patty Tolan is not as much of a systematically racist nightmare as clickbait headlines would have you believe.If you're a fan of Feig, McCarthy, and/or Wiig, then this movie definitely satisfies. Fart jokes, projectile vomiting, uncomfortable dancing, and wild action sequences abound. It's beautiful. McCarthy plays it (mostly) cool for a change with her character Abby. Less screaming and fighting than usual (The Heat, Spy, etc.), Abby is a die-hard but unconventional scientist who just wants a reasonable ratio of wontons to broth and to prove the existence of ghosts to the world. Erin Gilbert, played by Wiig, is the awkward and adorkable feuding colleague. With her shoulder roll and tiny bow tie, Wiig makes an excellent, nervous complement to McCarthy's straight man.To sum up, Ghostbusters 2016 is a great movie, in the same way that its predecessors were. It's goofy fun, crude humor, physical comedy, and a touch (or perhaps a heaping slap) of nostalgia. Go watch this movie and relive your childhood. If you have kids?take your daughters, take your sons?let them experience that same spine tingling, infectious magic that we all felt when we first heard the phrase, "Who you gonna call?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Inevitably remake movies are compared to the original, and that's fair. When a remake comes along I ask myself does it warrant a remake, I'm still unsure if Ghostbusters needed one. On paper a Ghostbusters remake makes sense but I don't feel it would and could work given the popularity of the beloved original, and the reaction the remake has gotten seems to clarify my point, however...the film isn't the train wreck it's made out to be.Comedy films are peculiar, I personally don't 'laugh out loud' during most of them, sometimes a chuckle but rarely anything. It comes down to your humour at the end of they day. I didn't laugh in this, not because it wasn't funny, there's lot of obvious improve among the actors who are trying to be humorous and it's just harmless. But like I said, when you remake a film it has to answer to its predecessor and when you hold the two up against each other, the remake doesn't do it justice. The four leads, although with their chemistry among each other, come across like they are really trying to make you laugh and in those moments the characters disappear and out come the comedians looking for laughs.I genuinely think the idea of an all female Ghostbusters is a good idea, it just wasn't executed well. There is a genuine attempt to make intriguing characters but it's very forced and unnatural. The four girls together like i said have a natural chemistry and it is a positive. I understood the craze behind Mccarthy in Bridesmaids but lost sight of the phenomenon that seemed to follow, but I believed the performance in this, it was zany and geeky and served it's purpose. Wiig I personally find funny and she was good in this, nothing standout, just OK. I can understand the criticism around the character of Leslie Jones but it wasn't offensive or demeaning in anyway that i found, a lot of her humour didn't land, she seemed to be the go to witty one liner and that was the extent of the character. Kate McKinnon was the standout of the four, it was a fun performance and Chris Hemsworth was surprisingly a good comedic actor. The Cameos from the original cast were a nice touch, was nice to see them in that universe. Bill Murray's cameo will most probably annoy people. Annie Potts was the best one, captured all the magic that made her great in the original.The CGI and ghosts themselves a very carnival and aren't entirely memorable. The end action sequence is actually fun to look at and watch I'll admit. The gadgets were cool, totally bought all the "Ghostbuster science" behind them. There is a few instances where there is a tongue in cheek reference to the 'controversy' surrounding the film and it was more annoying then cute and a "Scene" involving a man's weak spot which was not funny and seemed to have some nasty agenda behind it, maybe I'm reading to much into it but it comes across very deliberate. The plot just kind of happens and goes along, it's nice and quick and doesn't require much thought, so it doesn't hurt. The villain?? I mean... I guess it was a villain.. hang on.. Villain noun 1. (in a film, novel, or play) a character whose evil actions or motives are important to the plot. Hmmmmmmmmm...... yeah there was a Villain. It made no sense. Why the villain did what they did and why...I don't know....maybe ghosts...it was weak.All in all, it's not good but it's not bad, it's somewhere in the middle. Disposable and quick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This new vision follows the broad strokes of the original fairly closely. Three scientists are struggling at their respective establishments of higher education due to a lack of faith in them from their superiors (or a lack of knowledge of their existence). Given the opportunity to hunt ghosts, two of the scientists drag their reluctant accomplice along (converting her) and they start up the Ghostbusters to tackle to sudden resurgence of ghostly activity around New York City.Of course there are a number of changes. The most obvious of which is the complete gender- swap. The four male ghostbusters of the original are now female, and the receptionist is now male. Furthermore, Kevin is thick as s**t and completely naive to everything. The specifics are also changed a lot, for example the big bad is a depressed recluse who wants to take over the city with an army of undead.Like many in the recent wave of nostalgia movies, Ghostbusters does all it can to re-ignite that nostalgia and reference the original movies as much as possible. Most obvious is in the various cameos of the original cast. Bill Murray plays Martin Heiss, a ghost debunker, Dan Aykroyd plays a know-it-all taxi driver, Ernie Hudson plays Patty's uncle, Sigourney Weaver makes a brief appearance as Holtzman's mentor, and even Annie Potts appears as a hotel desk clerk. Slimer also makes an appearance, as well as the marshmallow man, and some lines are lifted from the original and re-used (Aykroyd drives off yelling "I ain't afraid of no ghosts").The jokes this time around are of a much more modern nature, obviously. They range from toilet humour and gross-outs to hilarious little character moments. Hemsworth is a particular stand- out in this regard as he plays the dimwitted Kevin completely straight-faced, without exemplifying the character's stupidity too much, but Leslie Jones is also particularly enjoyable on the comedy side of things as well. In fact my favourite moment was when she's walking around backstage at the metal concert talking to herself, she peers into a room full of mannequins and simply says "Well that's a room full of nightmares" and briskly walks off. There's also a couple of self-aware nods to it's franchise and the controversy it's caused as well. I wouldn't call Ghostbusters a hilarious movie, but I won't deny that I chuckled a few times. I think my mum was nearly in tears of laughter at one moment though (yes, I take my mum to the cinema, so what?), and there was a woman in the front row who seemed to be having a whale of a time cackling almost every five minutes.The visual effects are generally very good. While the effects are deliberately made rather cartoony, they can be quite scary. The first encounter with a ghost is actually really spooky and, being so early and not knowing how ghosts would be treated this time around, I found myself watching it through my peripherals just in case something jumped out. Despite their cartoony nature (each one is in a glowing blue aura that makes them obvious and stick out), they can be quite disturbing as well. For example one prominent ghost is a death row inmate who was electrocuted, so he's complete with electrocution headgear and a somewhat fried appearance. There's also a surprising amount of detail as well, particularly in regards to the final ghost they have to defeat, which is an oversized, evil-looking version of the Ghostbusters logo, but he's designed with a clothy texture that looks rough and creased.Acting is pretty good across the board. It won't win any awards, and being a comedy there isn't exactly a whole load of opportunities for the actors to dig their teeth into, but there wasn't really any bad performances either. Kristen Wiig plays her typecast as the geeky middle-aged woman as Erin Gilbert, while Melissa McCarthy takes on a much more subdued role to what she usually plays. Leslie Jones plays the more typical McCarthy character, but being a black woman, it just comes off as a little stereotypical. Kate McKinnon may be considered the weak link of the core four characters as she never particularly appears to be in the moment. I get that Holtzman is meant to be a little mentally unhinged, but McKinnon didn't really bring that idea across and instead just looks like an actress reading her lines. Chris Hemsworth shows his comedic muscles brilliantly, but I've already mentioned his smart approach to the dimwitted character. And of course all the cameos are great.In all, I can't say that I didn't enjoy Ghostbusters. It had it's funny moments, it rekindled nostalgia really well, and it's visual effects are certainly well done. As for the gender-swap twist, I didn't really notice it. Ghostbusters was never defined by the fact it's four leads were male, and so the uproar over them all being female this time around I find completely dumbfounding. It really doesn't matter, at all, not in the slightest. It has no impact on the story at all (apart from a single queef joke). With this slant, it could be argued that the feminist angle is strong, and I guess in a way it is, as almost all the men are either evil or stupid, but short of making the ghostbusters team a bit more equal in it's make-up, or just making it comprised entirely of women, I'm not sure how that could be avoided. In all I give the new Ghostbusters and enjoyable, but not groundbreaking 7/10. Just like I said with Dawn of Justice, screw the haters, go see it and judge for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very entertaining, allow yourself to laugh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very excited about this movie, then I saw the trailer and worried and became less and less excited with every new piece of video because I thought it was going to be awful. I watched it today with my husband who is a BIG fan of the old movies (he insisted), I am not a fan of the old movies, I watched them and they were OK to me, but definitely not a fan. RESULT: we both loved it. It was very entertaining and of course it is not unpredictable, it is not super clever, it didn't change the way I see life from now on, and of course it had lots to do with the old movies (the old cast was there even) but I really don't understand the bad reviews of it, we had a great time, we laughed a lot, we enjoyed ourselves and I'd recommend it to friends and family. It is a simple movie that will make you laugh, that's it, the main team is build by 4 awkward women and a really handsome equally dumb man with a lot of charisma, the 5 characters are very likable, there are ghosts in it, a simple plot, there you go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never - probably! - in the history of cinema has such a concerted campaign been undertaken by so many people who have obviously not seen the film to discredit a movie. Well, I may be wrong about that, there may be a historical precedent that I am unaware of, but I'm sure you get what I mean. Now, quite why so many would have you believe this movie stinks, I really can't say. It doesn't matter anyway, because this movie very definitely doesn't stink.Is it as good as the 1984 original? No, and nothing could ever be that good again. Is it as good as 1989's follow up? Possibly. It may even be better, that was a largely soulless affair. What you can say about Ghostbusters 2016 is that it has heart. A lot of heart. And it's funny. Very funny. All of the principals are great, with Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy excellent and kudos in particular to Kate McKinnon who, being a Brit living in Tokyo, I had never seen on SNL. Chris Hemsworth was also entertaining, playing very much against type.I am aware that the movie mafia is suspicious of any good reviews being posted for this movie. Well, screw them all. Use your own brains and not theirs. See this movie, you won't be sorry that you did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not new on the board but I never feel the need to write a review. This time I do. This movie doesn't deserve that hate it gets since the announcement of the female casting. I have a movie subscription so I went to this movie for free, assuming the absolute worst since the trailer didn't look appealing. The movie has maybe a miscast here and there and some humour felt extremely forced. But it isn't a movie you should take as serious as some do. It was a fun watch and I enjoyed it more than Ice Age 5 and the Purge that I also saw that day.The movie has an hilarious credits scene and also end credits. Worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About the group itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The dynamics between characters in this film is non-existent. Looking back at the original cast, each member of the team had an expressed purpose. Peter (Murray) was the colder member of the group, with Raymond (Aykroyd) being the one with a degree of misguided enthusiasm. These two are made to be counterparts, and between them, there can be some chemistry. Egon (Ramis) does something different as well. He's the smartest of the group, but he's not very capable. He needs the others as much as they need him, because if not, he can't really operate outside of his work. Winston (Hudson) is there to be the most sane out of all of them. Essentially, he's the every-man who needs to be there to ensure the group stays sane. So when you get them all together, hey, you have chemistry and characters. It's almost like you've got a movie or something.This film doesn't have any of that. It doesn't have any of anything. So now we have to match up who's who in this new cast. Well, Patty (Jones) is Winston. I guess Jillian (McKinnon) is Egon? And Peter and Raymond? I don't know, I think they scrapped them. For what, though? Well, for Erin (Wiig) and Abby (McCarthy). Oh, so what's their chemistry? Well, they wrote a book. And? There's no real friction or anything. No real contrast. Abby likes to eat, I guess, and Erin's...there. Okay, so why not just have the Peter and Raymond roles? It was perfectly fine, it didn't need to be replaced with people who are always on the same level. They really innovated the Egon role by making her irrelevant. She invents stuff and she's wacky. Great. What's her character? What are her goals? Does she offer anything to the team besides inventing stuff and sub-par comic relief? I guess not. Oh wait, but Egon knows all the technical stuff. But in this film, everyone in the team (except Patty) already knows all the technical stuff, leading to conversations of techno-babble that aren't funny or useful to anything. It wouldn't be out of character for Erin or Abby to be inventors. It'd probably give them more of a point to the story. So, Jillian doesn't need to be here. This could have been fixed by giving her a character. I think she was only slightly afraid of anything once in one shot in the subway. That's it. Oh, and you know what makes great comedy? Nothing bad ever happening to someone ever.Patty isn't really anything like Winston. Sure, she's the most character-ed character in this film, but she's not like Winston. Winston was level headed, the most charismatic, and was what kept the team ultimately grounded. Patty doesn't do that. Well, that's fine, as long as Patty does something better. What did she do for the team? I dunno. She showed them that ghost in the subway. Nobody in the group does anything for the group.I won't spoil anything, but there are points where the group isn't doing too well, and instead of showing a group dynamic and having chemistry, Abby says two lines about not giving up or whatever, and they just go on. That's not fun or interesting. It's lazy. That's about the best example I can think of. There could be potential with these characters, but I guess someone decided that all they needed was two lines. So what is this movie (in terms of characters)? Is it an improvement on the original? Well, they failed in that department. Is it a remake? I guess not, seeing as they changed so much. Oh, so it's a modification. Yeah, they modified the dynamics to be disjointed. I can't think of any jokes that worked as a team effort. All the jokes were just reliant on whoever was speaking at that time, and they were usually one liners. Just go watch the original. Or any movie that has a better script than this. It's not the death of cinema or anything, but it's still pretty bad.P.S. I feel so sorry for Chris Hemsworth in this.</fullReview>

The idea of four female ghost busters is okay by me, BUT... the movie still needed some male characters beyond the Chris Hemsworth who portrayed an annoying twit. Kate McKinnon was the happy surprise. Kristen Wiig was weak and does Leslie Jones know how to deliver lines without always SHOUTING?! (illustrating that a skit comedian does not an actor make). Amazing ghosts and some cool action. BUT... I've never seen a movie try so hard and put so much effort into setting up the next movie. Ghostbusters made me laugh; made me jump, made me look at my watch and didn't make me excited for the next installment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Use The Trailers And Judge For Yourself Instead Of Reading Reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why do I say this? Simple. Read the "Positive" reviews posted on this site and see how they attack "Haters" or "Trolls" in their review instead of focusing on the movie itself. IMDb isn't the only site doing this, since other...more professional reviewers are doing the same thing.Now read the "Negative" reviews posted on this site. Even though I told you to use the official movie trailers to judge the film, did you notice how they are giving you plenty of information as to WHY the movie is bad. There are even a few professional reviews that explain why they are rating the movie so low.If the movie trailers are not enough to have you say "Yes" or "No" for watching this film, then I suggest reading/watching a review from a reviewer that you trust. One that isn't afraid of SJW's or for being labeled incorrectly just because they won't drink the Kool-Aid. My personal suggestion for a video review would be from "Angry Joe" who reviews movies and video games on YouTube. If you would like to watch a female give their opinion, I would suggest watching "Comic Book Girl 19" (also on YouTube) or "Aggressive Comics" (again, on YouTube) give their opinions on this movie.My personal vote for this movie is a 1/10. From seeing the trailers, to watching the Director and some of the Cast attack people for having a difference of opinion, to watching a Producer force a narrative into the movie that was not needed, to ending with watching one James Rolfe being attacked simply because he said "I'm not watching this movie." The amount of anger/hate towards anyone who isn't siding with this movie turned me away from it completely. DO NOT listen to those who say "You can't judge a movie unless you've seen it" since that argument won't work. Why do movie trailers exist then if they are right? Thank you to anyone who read this and to those of you who voted it down, you are proving how much you are against those with a difference of opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the movie and I think about it as of a remake of the popular sequel. It was funny, it was different and it was fresh. I saw the movie relatively late - not at the first day, but there were a lot of people in a cinema auditorium, who laughed out loud the whole movie. I don't know what should else happen to characterize the comedy as a good and successful one. The story was new and very vibrant. What I liked the most about it that I didn't get the sense of it being too long, which happens a lot for some other movies. I think it deserves to be seen and to be continued as a sequel to its own style. I didn't see any men-hating stuff in it and I like the idea women to be empowered with such movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bad reboot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seams like every movie needs to have a reboot these days I just wonder why. Especially if the result is as bad as this film.Story: It's the old story retold. This isn't a bad thing, it's just un-original. Visuals: I found the visuals to be very good, especially in 3DCharacters: There is a gender switch for all characters. This isn't a problem per se. But they should have left it at that. Instead, they introduced the "comedy" factor, which basically transforms all characters into stupid cliché zombies. And I'm not only talking about the main characters. Every one was dumb as soup! Not only were the texts *not* funny at all (I had to laugh twice the whole movie), the frequency of the "jokes" is just to dense and made me think of the characters as brainless amoebas. Even the "Dumb and Dumber" guys look like smart people in comparison. In addition, they serve every cliché you can think of (eg. they hire the most stupid guy just for the looks). The adversary was embarrassing and pathetic, his actions illogical and inconsistent.So to sum everything up: This is a bad movie, not worth watching, not worth buying, not even worth downloading. The only good thing about this movie are the visuals. I think I would have given the film 5 stars if it were a silent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, but a needless faux-reboot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's tough to be disappointed with something when you don't have high expectations. Overall, I found the film to be fun escapism and feel that if it existed in its own right (no previous GB) then it would actually be half decent. The cast do a sterling job of their roles, and with more character development they could be really endearing. We can't forget that there wasn't much in the way of character development in the first GB, especially for Winston...However, it's impossible to escape the shadow of the 1984 movie,and as such the apple has fallen very far from the tree. The humour is dumbed down, overt and appeals to the lowest common denominator. They may as well have put explanatory subtitles on screen for the amount of time they spent flogging the dead horse with some of the jokes.Not that I'm a prude, I enjoy a lot of childish humour, but the success of the 1984's comedy was that it was subtle, delivered in deadpan and required a bit of thinking. That has been lost in this version.Yes, times have changed, comedy has changed and audiences have changed. I get that. But it consistently feels disrespectful to the source material, from which it is extremely derivative (not just the concept).I'm still scratching my head as to why they felt the need to "reboot" it at all, and which part of it was actually a reboot? It couldn't make its mind up whether it was a reboot or a homage or a continuation of the original series. Yes you can't get rid of the concept and the tools that are synonymous with the film, but at least think of a different origin story, fundamental plot and distance it entirely from the original? The film feels like a tour through a Ghostbusters museum, revisiting key locations, cameos by ghostly characters and original cast (which in the case of the male actors just felt really, really sad). It was almost like they were ticking off a checklist of references to make so that it could still be "accepted". I was especially disappointed by the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man cameo - it missed the point entirely of that character's involvement in the original.I thought there were some interesting concepts in this film, and I'd have preferred to see more development of them. For instance, some of the ghosts being introduced in the third act, the back story to Wiig's character and why she believed in ghosts could've been a really interesting thread to pull on. I'd also liked to have understood more about the villain's motivation, his back story and actually what he intended to achieve (frankly that wasn't especially clear).The third act felt too much like a "girl power" statement rather than a believable scenario in which people are fighting the paranormal and genuinely afraid. Whilst I liked McKinnon's character for the most part, she felt like a caricature by the third act (licking her pistols was just too far).The original was never about "boy power", quite the opposite. There was always a feeling throughout the film that they were constantly second-guessing themselves and out of their depth, and their final villain was genuinely a force to be reckoned with because there was some development long before it appeared on screen. For that reason I feel like it lost focus.I don't want to be totally negative about the film. I realise that, like GB2, they wanted to make it more child-friendly to appeal to a broader audience. For that reason, it will never have the scathing subtleties of the first.There were some good moments. I did especially enjoy Chris Hemsworth's character, probably because we're so used to seeing him in strong leadership roles, and you could tell he was having a ball. The CGI was effective in most places and some of the ghosts were actually menacing, although the extent of their menace seems restricted to vomiting slime over everyone. Despite largely reverting to loud sassy black lady stereotype, Leslie Jones was still endearing. Kristen Wiig was just Kristen Wiig but thankfully, McCarthy wasn't playing the tomboy Pam Bouvier-from-Archer character she normally plays.If they do a sequel, which they seemed to gear up for at the end, it would be nice to see more character development in both the living and the dead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very pleasant surprise (some mild, but labeled, spoilers herein)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Full disclosure: I was an uncredited extra in the concert scene, but I'll have to watch it on freeze-frame to see if I actually show up, so while being an extra was fun it gives me no personal investment in how the movie does. OK, with that out of the way...I loved this Ghostbusters so much more than I expected to. I didn't expect it to be horrible, certainly not the blight on everyone's childhood that certain people declared it would be, but I also didn't expect it to be more than alright, because reboots are rarely more than alright. I was very pleasantly surprised.Things I loved about it include (but are not limited to)...1) The cast. The main four have amazing chemistry, plus great improv skills that really show in their performances. To me the off-the-cuff style of a lot of the dialogue made the characters come across more like, well, characters interacting and playing off of one another naturally (as naturally as over-the-top characters like Holtzmann should, anyway) than like actors doing a script. Also, you can see "THIS IS SO MUCH MORE FUN THAN PLAYING THOR" going off in neon lights in Chris Hemsworth's head every time he does anything, which is delightful. 2) The characters. I get why the first time people saw Holtzmann's hair they became concerned that they were looking at an Egon carbon copy, but nothing could be further from the truth. Each character was distinct (from one another, and from their counterparts in the original), well performed, and brought her own motivations to the team, and her own qualities to the movie. 3) A surprising amount of deadpan humor. I think to really get the most out of this movie you have to appreciate a certain kind of very British-feeling humor that doesn't hang a sign on every joke, which to me just makes them funnier. In retrospect, the opening scene does a brilliant job of setting that tone for the rest of the movie in this regard (if you want to avoid a minor spoiler for that scene, skip to the next paragraph). Imagine a tour guide leading people through a creepy house. He tells the people, sounding dead serious, that this was once one of the most luxurious homes in New York, with such luxuries as a face bidet and anti-Irish security fence, and that it was in this room right here, that wealthy visitor P.T. Barnum first had the idea to enslave elephants. If you didn't crack a smile at that, hopefully there's still plenty of fun, silly movie for you, but I did, and continued smiling at little collisions of serious delivery and slightly absurd content throughout the movie. There were other things I loved (like some of the cameos), and things I thought were OK (like some of the cameos), and things that left me a bit cold but were ultimately shrug- worthy (like some of the cameos), but this wouldn't be a fair review if I didn't also talk about some of the things I really wish were different, so... 1) It didn't need to be a reboot. They had all of the original cast there for cameos! Would it have been so hard to have a backstory where the now-old (and in one case, heartbreakingly dead) originals passed the torch off to the next generation, or to a new franchise in another city (which then gets conveniently cut off by ghostpacalypse), etc. I think the original deserves a successor more than it does a redo, and this could have been a worthy successor.2) Patty was... hrmmm... this gets complicated. A lot of people, many of them white folks like myself, have complained that the one black main character, well, "acts too black", to which Leslie Jones has shot back something to the effect of "F you, I *am* black; don't tell me it's offensive for me to be like myself", which makes sense, and yet... and yet. Yeah, gotta say, although I appreciate that they took the effort to make her a legit encyclopedic NYC history nerd instead of just being generically "streetwise" (aka Dances with Minorities), the character, and Jones' portrayal, still read as uncomfortably stereotypical to me. That said, "the power of Patty compels you!" remains one of my favorite bits. 3) Too many lampshades. Yeah, OK, so not all of the jokes, let alone all of the cultural subtext, was as subtle as the deadpan humor I talked about before. (minor spoiler coming next) They defeat a male antagonist ghost by literally shooting him in the crotch (which apparently hurts even in genital-free hulking astral form). Now, if I was this movie, given all the crap and vitriol that got thrown at it just for existing before the Internet had seen so much as a picture, frankly I might want to (metaphorically) shoot something in the balls, too. But still, both comedically and in terms of "ok, but seriously it has no genitals at all..." it was pretty dumb IMO, and it's not the only joke that seemed uncharacteristically immature (c.f. a fart joke early on that was way less funny to me than the movie seemed to think it should have been), and some of the references to the original were a bit (sometimes more than a bit) too "eh? eeeh? see what we did there??".There are other things I could complain about, like the extent of Holtzmann's technical wunderkinding, and a few physics head-scratchers that stretch credibility even by Ghostbuster standards, but on the whole I thought this was a really great movie; the kind I wouldn't mind seeing again, which is pretty rare for me. Forget the haters, I hope history bears this one out as something worthy of a place on the shelf right next to the original Ghostbusters (possibly cleverly obscuring Ghostbusters II).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I really haven't loved a movie this much in a long time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before all else, this movie is funny and it is fun. From the very first lines, every theater I've been in has been laughing along with it from the beginning. I've seen the film with seven different groups of people now (yes, obviously, I liked it a lot and wanted to support it) and every single group has laughed a lot and had a good time. Seriously, isn't that the entire point of an action comedy? The film is visually appealing and creatively engaging and every time I see it, I see something new, and every time, it still makes me laugh. Are there some stupid lines? Yes. Are there some logic gaps? Yes. Are there a couple of times where I'm like, "Wow, who really decided to include that?" Yes. But is there some hilarious and awesome stuff happening? Absolutely.Full disclosure: I'm a feminine 35-year-old lesbian, and Kate McKinnon's brilliant performance as Jillian Holtzmann has no doubt contributed to my endless enjoyment of this movie, but there is so much more to love in addition to that. This is a movie featuring four smart, funny female characters who are good at what they do and are pursuing something they're passionate about. These are women with PhDs, women who are scientists, women who start their own business. They aren't scared of ghosts (except maybe Patty) -- they're fascinated by them! The main relationships involved in the film are their developing friendships with each other, which don't revolve around bonding over - or worse yet, fighting over - men. This film features women who kick ass without showing cleavage or wearing leather, rubber, or spandex -- and you would think, as a lesbian, that I'd be all about those things, but honestly, watching a woman in a vinyl bathing suit trying to kick ass in 4-inch heels is really not my style. How about women actually wearing some real clothes and shoes? I can get behind that. (Not to mention that Holtzmann defies all logic to show how attractive jumpsuits and safety goggles can really be.)Dismiss me if you like, but I have seen it over and over: women have LOVED seeing themselves portrayed this way in this movie -- as people who could either teach physics or build high-tech machinery if they wanted to (and the men I have seen it with have enjoyed it as well, because you know what? Smart, passionate women are awesome). Additionally, queer women of all stripes have been SO excited to see Holtzmann, an unabashedly weird, quirky, queer woman whose sexuality is never explicitly mentioned and is not an issue in the film -- which is just as it should be, since this is how queer people operate in the world all the time. There is really nothing bad about a whole new generation of Ghostbusters fans, boys and girls, being able to see that women can exist in all of these ways, and can be whatever they want.In conclusion, I first went to see this movie with some friends expecting to see something lighthearted and fun, which is exactly what I got. The more I thought about and talked about this film, though, the more I got out of it, and the more I appreciated it. This movie is not a sequel or continuation of the original, and it doesn't have to be. It's its whole own thing. It's an alternate universe where the people who evolved into the Ghostbusters just happened to be female. It has fantastic cameos by many members from the cast of the original, and many subtle nods to the original as well. Go in looking to laugh and have a good time, and you will.</fullReview>

In particular Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones are good. The horrid, horrid pacing and editing of this film fall on the director, not the performers. Batman v Superman was a theatrical cut that left you begging to see the director's cut. Ghostbusters 2016 is a director's cut that leaves you begging for a theatrical cut to come out. All told, wait for the DVD. And if part 2 happens, maybe see if one of our four new Ghostbusters can't hit where Paul Feig badly missed.</fullReview>

These ghost busters just want to be believed and taken seriously as scientists....and save the world too. Refreshing that in a chick movie, they weren't all competing for a guy, or having makeovers, those seem to be the standard tropes in chick movies these days. Went home and watched the original afterwards, was surprised by the sexism of most of the humor, i had forgotten that part of it.

We laughed continuously through the second half of the movie. I loved the tributes to the original throughout. Kate McKinnon should star in an action movie and Chris Hemsworth another comedy. It was a fun, action packed, goofy, scary, entertaining movie; much like the original. Don't let all the negativity scare you away. Go with an open mind and enjoy the ride. We did and are going to see it again. We'll probably buy it on DVD when it comes out. I would definitely recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't blame FEMINISM, blame BAD PRODUCTIONS.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will be honest. I was not the least prejudiced when I went to see this movie. I loved the original ghost-busters as a kid and when I learned of a female lead remake, I was excited. It seemed like a cool idea. And if executed right, it could have been a great movie. Unfortunately, watching the movie left me disappointed, to say the least. I love Melissa McCarhty. She has made laugh my guts out in previous movies like spy, Tammy, etc. and I always liked her as a person as well. However, in this movie, even her talent in comedy is not enough to save the poor script, the flat, awkward jokes and the unacceptable stereotypes. There were a lot of people bashing this movie for the all-female cast and calling out feminism, and I COMPLETELY DETESTED all these comments. Like I previously said, I loved the female cast idea and I am a woman and a feminist myself. The studio and the cast went a long way to speak against these haters' comments against feminism, but in the end, they have come up with a dozen more racist, sexist clichés themselves. 1. a 4 female leads cast, and -oh, look at that- the three scientists are all white, and the black girl is a laborer from the ghetto....WTF????? STEREOTYPING, RIGHT THERE! 2. don't even get me started on the male depictions in these things. Why is it NOT OK and sexist to put a stupid, useless, blond, female secretary in a movie, whose only job is to be an eye candy, but if you put Hemsworth it's OK, cuz' he's a guy! SEXISM, can refer to both women AND men you know. NOT COOL AT ALL! Don't even get me started on the CGI in this thing. I felt like stepping in "space jam". It was 1996 people. It's been literally 20 years. All in all, this movie was mediocre, and that's putting it kindly. Not because of the female cast, but because of all the other BAD things that made it...lame. There's nothing wrong with feminism in the film industry. I mean, there is a talk of a female James Bond and I am psyched!You wanna blame someone? BLAME BAD PRODUCTIONS, NOT FEMINISM. I give it a 4, because I actually liked the cast and was excited to see some old ghost-busters' stuff on screen, but I wouldn't recommend it for cinema viewing. Waste of money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can you say about Ghostbusters 2016 that hasn't already been said? A unique portrait of four original funny characters, taking comedy to a whole new, undiscovered, level. The great director Paul Feig shows no lack in directing skills with this masterful palme d'or deserving motion picture. Ghostbusters 2016 gives you an original insight into a world of fantasy and adventure, few films have done before. A comedy that puts Charlie Chaplin, Woody Allen and Mel Brooks to shame. The fresh new take on the old forgotten original is not only unique in its style and humor, but also the way it gives every single character time to develop a persona. The chemistry between the leading characters is something to admire, a study in creative screen writing. Feig shows once and for all how raw talent and original ideas are essential in the making of a masterpiece. Roger Ebert's thumbs are no longer six feet under.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Honest Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was an amazing adaption of what was a classic film. The switching of gender roles didn't ruin the film in anyway, it provided funny and smart role models to young girls. It follows almost the exact same story line as the original and there are many subtle references that are subtle enough so that people who haven't watched the originals will still understand and not miss out. It was a hilarious adaption from the original movie and it was honestly incredible. People who are opposed to this movie are generally people who are relatively sexist and ones who are annoyed about the dumb male secretary are now experiencing how girls feel when the usually sexualised receptionist is what they are shown. It provides bad-ass role models and it shows that you don't have to be a guy in order to be awesome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While it has been 27 years since ghostbusters 2 which I know didn't leave a great impression with many fans myself included but I will admit that I enjoyed this reboot a lot. While many were probably hoping for an continuation for what should have been a third film but j think this is just fine even though fans had their doubts about the ghostbusters being played by the ladies. While it does have many elements that made the original film a. Classic such as the theme song, the echo one car, and plenty of ghosts including slimer and stay puff marshmallow. The film also has cameo appearances from original cast members Bill Murray, Dan akyroyd, sigourney weaver, Annie Potts, and Ernie Hudson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely not as bad as some people are saying. I found that the movie had an overall pretty good 'entertaining' element, it knew it was going to be silly and played well into that. I felt that the animation used on the ghosts was perfect, it was stylized to look realistic yet cartoonish, fitting well with the humour and overall feel of the film. There were more little nods towards the original movie than I thought there were going to be, this was greatly loved, they ranged throughout the whole film and were not just lumped together. All the characters were played wonderfully by the actors, particularly Kate McKinnon and Neil Casey, they gave their all and it really worked for their strange characters. The pacing of the movie was very good, it certainly didn't feel like I sat there for two hours, boredom never once took hold. I appreciated the struggle the main characters went through to assert themselves where as in the original movie the Ghostbusters where accepted quickly and without much hassle. The remake made good use of artistic interpretation, sticking to a similar plot as the original but not copying it word for word or scene by scene. Overall I found the movie quite enjoyable and would gladly watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is everything that a Ghostbusters reboot should be. It is funny and action packed. If you are looking for a great and funny family movie go and see this. If you are a feminist, you will love this movie. It has a wonderful and hilarious all female cast that will keep you laughing until the end. For you ladies out there, Chris Hemsworth plays a funny character in the movie. There are also cameos from some of the original cast like Bill Murray and Dan Akkroyd. Also, some of the ghosts from the original movie like Slimer and Puff the Marshmallow Man. They even use the same guns and the old logo. This is a wonderful movie because it hits the nostalgia that you want but also adds new things in. Overall, if you were a fan of the original movie, this reboot will not disappoint you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My date picked this movie. She decided we needed to leave mid way. She loved the old classic Ghost busters and it was totally awful! Nothing more needs to be said. We Watch all the old classic Sci fi flix, including all the new releases. A plus note on this awful movie, is 1. We were able to talk about it at length (Laughing more like it). 2. We went home and watched the original Aliens "Director's cut". She has never seen the scene where the auto Turrets plow through the aliens and start running out of ammo. 3. The movie ended when we left the theater. Its so bad I logged on IMDb which I don't think I have in 10 or more years?? Also I believe the industry or at least the commercials were lying to everyone. They must be forcing their ideas on man kind. I don't take to those types of lies kindly. I will watch the Superman vs. Batman next and a few other sci fi flix. I wouldn't even rent this via Amazon prime or whatever you use.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're looking for Casablanca, then keep looking. If you want to laugh and you're looking for a fun movie with talented comedians, this is it!I honestly never write reviews, outside of what was required for my prestigious film degree, however I felt I had to because the backlash this film has received makes me question whether others are actually seeing the same movie I saw. I'm old enough to have grown up with the original, and while I love that film, it is also not without its flaws (think about the constant day/night shift while the Ghostbusters are heading to battle Zuul - this is just basic filmmaking! Is it day? Is it night? It's maddening.). There are very few perfect films in the world, and the original Ghostbusters is not one of them. So why are people putting it on this untouchable pedestal?Ghostbusters (2016) is a well executed comedy starring four incredibly talented comedians and a very funny Hemsworth (he's in a category all his own). There's literally nothing to hate about this film unless you hate good, funny things. The story is entertaining, the FX are great, and the chemistry is hilarious.And if I saw this as a kid (as I did with the original) then I would totally want to be just like Holtzmann! A smart, funny, quirky, ambitious scientist who doesn't care what anybody thinks. Hoping for a sequel!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely fell in love with this movie!!! I can not get over how cool and awesome the characters were. The Ghostbusters are all smart, funny and as complex as you get in a comedy. That's right, it's a comedy, a fun, lighthearted, sometimes cheesy much like the original. I was entertained the entire time, I didn't find any of the moments slow and I loved all the cameos! I loved the Abby/Erin relationship- it speaks true to the friendships I have. Even when you've fallen out and having spoken in a while, once you get back together it's like nothing has changed. I was glad they had that comrade throughout. McCarthy and Wiig have great chemistry and it shows! I loved Leslie Jones as Patty, she was so sweet and funny. I think she balanced the cast very well and kept me laughing the entire movie. My favorite character had to be Holtzmann, hands down. She was so funny, so smart, and I loved her style. All of the weapons were so cool! It honestly made me wish I was more mechanically inclined so I could make props of those weapons. I've always been a huge fan of McKinnon on SNL but she shinned in this movie more than she gets to on SNL. I legit wish I could be Holtzmann, or at least work on being a person who let's their freak flag fly and doesn't care what anyone thinks. I already bought tickets to see it again this weekend and I'm on the lookout for more merch. I can't wait for more!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie expecting nothing - like I do with most movies. However, after seeing this remake, it is safe to say this was a fun movie! I never enjoyed the original Ghostbusters - wasn't my cup of tea, but this one was quite enjoyable. It was funny, had a great cast of women who work well together and know how to be funny, and also, Chris Hemsworth was a great addition to the cast. I would see it again and encourage others to do so! Many bad reviews seems to come from certain types - men, especially white men, which is fine. Their entitlement is nothing new. Don't let that freak you out. Go see this awesome remake and enjoy a funny movie! You'll love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as I thought it would be (and probably not as bad as you feared)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In case you haven't heard, the 2016 remake of Ghostbusters' trailer received the most 'thumbs down' dislikes on Youtube when it was first released. This produced cries of 'misogyny' from some quarters, as the previously all-male cast has now been replaced with all women. I suppose when you read this you should know that, I too, am a male. I too 'disliked' the trailer. And I too am old enough to be only six years old when I saw the original in cinemas all that time ago.I didn't dislike the trailer because of the women. A new Ghostbusters film has been in the works for so long that I've heard all sorts of ideas mentioned with what to do with continuing the franchise. The popular thought was that it would be a sequel where the old boys hand over the torch to a new ghost-busting generation. That was what I hoped. What I got was a remake.Yes, the trailer was awful. First of all it misled the viewers into thinking it WAS a sequel, only to reveal that it was a remake that looked almost shot-for-shot. I actually stopped watching the trailer simply because it bored me. There weren't enough jokes and the whole thing just looked pointless. I wasn't going to watch the film, but ended up taking my eleven year old daughter. From the moment the film started I was desperate to justify my 'thumbs down' ? I hated the special effects, I hated the characters, I hated the fact that ? yes ? the story was basically a photocopied version of the 1985 script. Then I started smiling.I use the word 'smile' over 'laugh.' Laugh may be a little too generous. There aren't that many huge belly laughs to be had, but definitely smiling was participated in. It's actually not that bad. The script is a copy, but there are just about enough nice jokes to justify its existence. Yes, I'd have preferred a sequel, but this could have been a lot worse. There is plenty of chemistry between the new cast to enjoy it. I know that not only did people cry 'sexism' regarding the treatment of the female leads, but some then went on to add 'racism' to the mix when the three white women are all intellectual scientists when the old black lead is merely a subway worker. Personally, I enjoyed all their performances ? even Chris 'Thor' Hemsworth was fun (sporting a weird British-Thor hybrid accent) and the surviving old cast members may even show their faces.If you loved the original Ghostbusters, you still will. It's original and perfectly-made. However, if you haven't seen it ? as many of today's youth probably won't ? then they will probably justify this film's existence. If you love the original then you also probably own it. Unless you're taken to see this version I suggest you stick with what you know. However, if you do find yourself being taken to see the 2016 version, don't go in to it filled with hate and resentment. Like I say, it's not that bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>loved it! the cast was great, melissa &amp; kristen were funny as always. even though i'm not too familiar w leslie and kate, i certainly wish i was after seeing this. it was really, really refreshing to see women portrayed on screen as characters who were relatable, and who were free to be their own characters instead of having men define them, which is unfortunately a snag in most mainstream films. a criticism i've seen is that its portrayal of men is 'offensive' which, in my onion, is completely false. most of the men are portrayed as somewhat unfavorable, but what critics of this film don't understand is that women are almost always portrayed offensively in films. our culture is just too numbed by misogyny for it to be seen as anything but normal. hopefully ghostbusters will help with changing the way women are portrayed on screen.also, the shot of holtzmann licking her gun is more meaningful and iconic that anything men have contributed to cinema ever. ?\_(&#x30c4;)_/?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't believe the buzz... just turn your brains off and relax,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Admittedly, as 80's or 90's child, after watching the trailer and following the social buzz around it, you could instantly hate this as another franchise which was sacrificed for creating a modern rip-off that even breaks with original (male) cast and characters.For some reason, I still gave it a chance, maybe because there's not too much must-see movies around in summer months and I thought it could be funny if I just see it as a standalone- movie not having to care with all that Ghostbusters legacy.And surprisingly, it did a pretty, pretty good job in entertaining me, nothing more, nothing less...The female cast in general did a pretty good job in playing their quite diverse characters, their performances ranging from okay-ish to insanely funny - I really fell with in love with Kate McKinnon and her playing the bats**t crazy Jillian Holtzmann.Despite of what you've heard or read before, its clearly not a feminist version of the original - way too many stereotype jokes pulled off, some even trying too hard ("That stuff went everywhere..."). In general, Ghostbusters goes for every potential joke, goof and stereotype, but most of the time, it just scores. Maybe too much, but not for me... sometime I appreciate a high pace of stupidity and can deal with a simple plot and several inconsistencies. I really had to laugh quite hard and absolutely think it was worth the money - I'd watch it anytime again, at least on Free-TV.Regardless of the character overhaul, it still picks up most of the traditional elements of the original movie in terms of equipment, locations and even ghost characters, maybe it even tries too hard with lots of references and many original cast appearances. Could be an excuse for the female cast thing, though....Some also complained about the cheap CGI but I think they were clearly above average, in ghost detail animations as well as on New York City total shots when hell finally breaks loose.To sum it up: Get rid of expectations, anger about the remake and any feminist prejudice and just enjoy a 'good clean fun' summer blockbuster - there's still more love and detail in it than in the new Die Hard movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Great, Not Terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Look, I get it. This movie is no where near as funny or original as it's predecessor. I get why people don't like it. Jokes fell flat on more than one occasion, sometimes the editing and dialogue didn't make sense or flow correctly, and, let's face it, this movie was doomed from the start. Despite its flaws, and they are abundant, I'm not sure it deserves all the hate. Perhaps it is because of my low expectations going into the movie, or maybe I was just in a good mood upon viewing, but I wasn't always disappointed. I actually felt myself laughing a few times, and otherwise I typically chuckled at most of the jokes. I'm not a fan of Melissa McCarthy, but when her primary objective is not to provide constant comic relief, she can be refreshing. Kristen Wiig's character didn't always hold up for me, her motives and backstory often times feeling contrived. However, Wiig's performance was decent. Leslie Jones's character had a habit of slipping into what some would call a stereotype, but overall, she seemed to be unique enough, especially with her somewhat quirky knowledge of the city. And Kate McKinnon. Kate McKinnon saved a lot of this movie for me. She certainly did not get enough dialogue and some of her jokes felt forced, but her overall character, a zany inventor with a sarcastic and bit of a flirty attitude, really livened up some scenes. Sometimes, her mere facial expressions made a joke funny that wouldn't have been so funny otherwise. The movie was also graced with the presence of Chris Hemsworth, portraying a dimwitted yet apparently endearing secretary. He had his funny moments, though his chemistry with the team was lacking. As for the plot, it was simple, with predictable twists and turns, and some interesting parallels. It was different from the original, but not necessarily good, and it can be difficult to tell a difference from time to time. The antagonist felt random, and in hindsight, his motives are kind of unclear. But the effects had their moments of flashy and colorful splendor, especially when it came to the action sequences. However, they did get gimmicky from time to time. Finally, I will try to delicately address the elephant in the room. Originally, I was apprehensive of the movie because of its casting, because I felt it was, perhaps, forcing a statement. I was so convinced it was going to be terrible that I refused to watch the trailer, which, at the time, was completely bombing on YouTube. But then I began reading some of the reviews and, while it's certainly not award- worthy material, people were enjoying it. Because, really, when you don't take it too seriously, it's an enjoyable movie. When you review the decisions of casting and wonder, just consider that there's nothing wrong with having female Ghostbusters. They're not replacing the old ones, they're not even trying. The characters are new, sometimes offering parallels to the originals, yet still holding their own. And, as much as I love the original Ghostbusters, it wasn't a deep film with deep characters or a deep plot that wouldn't be difficult to mirror. Not that this is an excuse by any means, but when you look back on the original, you wonder how much of its reputation is held up by hype. The effects have their moments of originality, but they also have their less-than-realistic green screen moments. Regardless, the first Ghosbusters was original in its mere concept and some could even consider it a staple of cinema. Is its revamp held to the same standard? Yes. Does it meet that standard? No, but maybe that's because its a standard nearly impossible to meet. The original was so good because of it came out at the perfect time. Don't get me wrong, the original is still funnier and better written than its revamp, but when you hold the new Ghostbusters on its own, it's not a terrible movie. It has likable characters, some funny moments, decent performances and good effects. That's why it's just a good movie. Not great, not terrible, but good. So if you go into viewing already hating the movie, you're probably going to hate it leaving the theatre, but if you go into it with an open mind and trying not to really compare every instance to the original, you may find yourself somewhat pleased, or, dare I say, actually enjoying the film. Oh, and by the way, it has some "eh" cameos and a sort of cringe- worthy dace sequence that was, thankfully, banished to the end credits, so beware.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First: I'm a Man. I'm 27. And I absolutely loved this movie.I might as well say it. All the hate the movie is receiving is either because of gender politics (poor men hurting) or by some overly serious nerd who thinks the originals are immaculate (although I'm not sure if those are separate things anymore). I mean, look at the IMDb data...it's very telling when you check the demographics.The movie is great. It's funny, refreshing and A GRATE HOMAGE to the original Ghostbusters. Characters are relatable. Kate McKinnon as Holtzmann is perhaps one of the coolest, funniest, empowering representations of 2016: crazy, female super engineer with awkward social skills and mad fighting moves? YES PLEASE!! People saying the movie is sexist are probably the same kind people that believe that there is such thing as reverse racism. They are mad because the movie just reproduces, through INTELLIGENT SATIRE, the same conspicuous objectification women have suffered for decades. Lets be honest: the all female cast kicking some balls is what bothers you. You're not missing Bill Murray's flat awkward jokes from the 1984 version. You're mad because this movie is about you, your mysoginy disguised in a ghost metaphor, and 4 kick-ass woman geniuses with lasers busting you in the balls.The only reason I'm giving this movie 8/10 is because 1: Soundtrack is pretty lame. The new song is very very bad. 2: the cinematography and effects are somewhat conservative. Nothing really exciting there.Also (SPOILERS ALERT) The sandwich scene at the end is one of the greatest comedy gags ever. Brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just an unfunny comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see the movie on it's last days and yet there still was a lot of people in the theater. I completely ignored all the negative things I've heard about this movie and just went to see it open-minded (I did however give classic Ghostbusters a re-watch just to refresh my childhood memories). For me, the movie felt just like a generic unfunny comedy. Even though there was a lot of exact same scenes and pretty much all cameos they could've had, it's still hard to compare these two, cause the original was a completely different movie. The new installment had it's dialogue completely replaced by jokes and the characters were just stereotypes. I don't get it why they wanted to have this many jokes (most of which were not funny for me). Even kids in the theater rarely had any laughs. Ukraininan voice-over, however, was hilarious is it's own way, many jokes were adapted so people would still get them and even then, I caught myself laughing only 2 times in the movie (a reference to Hemsworth character looking like a Scandinavian god and the dean who took like 30 seconds only to give them the finger). There's barely any script or a coherent story, most of the time stuff just happened by itself and the characters react to it by making lots of jokes (sort of like it was in the original, but still not as good). CGI was OK and even creative sometimes, new Ghostbusters gadgets were cool and the action was also good (since there were no action in the original tbh). Cameos felt unnecessary, especially Ernie Hudson's one (yet he looks amazing in his 70s). The main villain and the ghosts are kind of just there to be there (they don't even do much to people). I feel rather confused, since it could've just been a generic standalone comedy, there was absolutely no reason to make a Ghostbusters movie out of it. Even so, they could've tried to make this a completely original movie, but for some reason, they didn't. It's tied to the original pretty strong. Overall: a story that did not impress. Good rental to watch after a long day at work at best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ghostbusters will likely go down as one of the most controversial films for absolutely ridiculous reasons. But by no means is this a film that doesn't deserve critique. With laughs built around nostalgia though it swears to have no real connection to the original film, Ghostbusters is merely a passable comedy.Amidst all of the unnecessary hate for the marketing campaign and particularly the choice to have female protagonists, I've been one to sit back and watch. I've never understood the need to dislike a film before its release, no matter the subject matter. With that said, the problems have absolutely nothing to do with its talented 4 lead females. In fact, I quite enjoyed the chemistry between Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, and Leslie Jones.Wiig has been one of my favorite comedic actresses for some time now and McCarthy is very good when her character is toned down to a realistic level and she isn't doing to the same shtick in every film. Combine them with decent SNL up and comers and you have a likable team of Ghostbusters. Where the film falters is the story built around them. I've had a good time watching Paul Feig's films in the past, but none of them have impressed me quite the way I had hoped.Feig seems to prefer silly over a witty approach to his characters. Though I liked the performances of all 4 Ghostbusters, McKinnon and Jones feel much more like caricatures than people who would actually live in New York City. Even Chris Hemsworth, who I enjoyed every second he was on screen, was way more over the top than I would have preferred.This approach did produce many funny moments with laugh out loud gags, it can't carry you through an entire 110 minute runtime. It's almost like an SNL skit could and would have been the better option here. But even as I'm saying this, I know that there is potential here for a great comedy. The foundation of this franchise is set for future installments, I just want to see a slightly more serious film with gags here and there mixed in.Overall, it's far from a bad film, but its near spoof aesthetic ruined a lot of the enjoyment that I could have had. A nicely structured set up became convoluted and unfortunately a bore when the film crippled its way to the third act. We shall see where this franchise can go from here.+4 talented leads have great chemistry+Some great gags-Weak third act-Caricatures5.8/10</fullReview>

I do feel a lot of people went into the cinema wanting to hate this. It's a different story, it obviously resembles the original, but it has a new, fresh take on it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genuinely Funny and Enjoyable to the Point that Some Men Apparently Can't Handle It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie this past weekend and thoroughly enjoyed it. When I came onto IMDb however I had no intention of writing a review of it. I simply wanted to check a minor detail about the film's production. That's when I saw the numerous unjust reviews left totally trashing the film and deliberately trying to make it sound much worse than it actually is. I will tell you right now that all of those reviews giving it one star are meant to purposefully bring down the film's rating and make it look bad, and they're all written by whiny entitled men who can't face the fact that an all-female reboot actually managed to be genuinely entertaining. I'm not kidding when I say that this movie managed to get me audibly laughing by the very first scene, before any of the main characters had even shown up. And the laughter didn't stop there but continued throughout the entire film, with each of the four leading ladies landing their fair share of jokes. So all those reviews saying this movie isn't funny are lying to you because those people can't admit that women can make jokes too. Now in regards to all those complaining that the special effects were too embarrassing to watch, I just want to point out that the special effects of the original Ghostbusters were nothing to write home about. But nothing about the quality of special effects in either movie really takes away from their ability to entertain. So if you can sit through the original 80s Slimer scene with no complaints than you shouldn't have anything bad to say about the effects in this movie.Next, complaints that it doesn't do justice to the original are just more lies spread by fans who can't put on their big boy pants and accept that a reboot actually had some merit. This movie has enough nods to the original to keep fans happy, but also has it's own original story . All of the cameos from the original cast were great, and I'm not gonna lie, I felt a certain wave of excited nostalgia whenever the original theme song was played during a scene.Lastly to all those people complaining that the movie is "sexist" and whining over how the only major male character is reduced to a dim-witted piece of eye candy, I would just like to say that in almost every other major blockbuster movie the roles are reversed. Other movies contain a slew of interesting and adept male characters while only throwing out one or two sub-par female characters who are then forced to pander to the male gaze. When almost every other movie puts men at the center, you'd think it wouldn't be that big of a deal to switch the roles just once. I personally found it wildly refreshing to see an action comedy starring four very different and very capable ladies. All in all I found this movie funny and refreshing. I highly recommend it and encourage you to ignore all of those looking to down-vote it just because they can't admit that four women managed to make a movie that holds its own in comparison to the original classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The reboot of the Ghostbusters has generated a lot of resentment from the die-hard fans of the two original Ghostbusters films. I also loved the originals, but I also acknowledge that we are talking about two pretty juvenile films that depict the adventures of a group of ghost-hunters. With the reboot everybody's acting like the basis of their religion was offended. What's the big deal? The new ghostbusters is a decent piece of popular entertainment. Characters are likable and fun, jokes made me and the rest of the viewers laugh and the effects are as good as in any other modern piece of cinema. In the end the new film will most likely generate new audiences for the classic Ghostbusters -films, so lighten up and let all flowers grow!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into the movie prepared to not like it because I had heard some bad reviews (these reviews didn't actually have anything to say about the movie but that it was bad). I've got to say that I smiled throughout the entire movie and I don't think there was a person in the theater who wasn't thoroughly enjoying themselves. I saw the movie with 4 other people and we all loved it so much. It's the only movie within my memory that I've wanted to see in theaters more than once.I really appreciated that the female characters were strong and smart and even though they'd had disagreements they weren't petty about them. They acted like real people. And they were funny without being really offensive, which some people find hard for some reason? I think this movie has good role models for young girls and boys; there are 3 women scientists and a history nerd who aren't "sexed up" for the male gaze. They are belittled and ridiculed for their beliefs but they overcome that to do the right thing, not to prove themselves to anyone. And they're really cool while doing it, too.The special effects feels real but not too real in a good way. I guess to say that they're not painful to watch (as an animation student I get very upset over bad effects) but there is a cheesiness to them that is endearing. I think this movie is something that anyone can enjoy as long as they don't mind women being treated like human beings instead of sexy prizes (which is a joke that they play off of using a Hot Dumb Male character, but in the end he's treated like a person and is no one's "prize").</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked it! It is not a deep complex comedy. It's more juvenile humour and if you don't like that then you Should absolutely stay Clear! The tempo of the film was fine (not great) but i liked the characters and the acting was good (but Kristen wiig seriously makes me cringe sometimes...) And overall it was very entertaining! I laughed so much I cried at some points in it. It has a lot of similarities to the old ghostbuster film (some ghosts are the same and whatnot) but they have made enough changes that it doesn't feel like I'm just watching the same film but with different actors. I saw a review saying that the film only relied on cameos but the cameos was very minor and was more of the stan lee kind so I do not see that as a problem. I think if you go in to watch this film with low expectations, it will blow your mind.</fullReview>

I can't wait to see ghostbusters back at my front door for Halloween like i used to. For real though, come on people, grow up and be able to appreciate when something great comes along. Its only gonna happen a few times! Stop being so butt hurt over some hilarious women revitalizing the movie. If im being honest, it's a much needed addition.

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original movie, but according to my father, who is a fan of the original movies, loved this new film. Also he liked the cameos (who I didn't really understand because I haven't seen the original).I'm not a movie fan so I usually go to the movies once and that's it... so I think this is the first time I've seen the same movie in the theatre five times already. This may not be so special to movie fans... but it is for me!!I just loved this movie so much. I like animations and computer graphics, so I liked how the ghosts were made of that... sure, some people might think they look cheap, but hey, it's a comedy, not Paranormal Activity.Everyone in the theatre was laughing out loud, and I was glad I went to see it on the busy time of the day so I can enjoy laughing out loud with others.I try not to spoil so much... but I just want to say that the characters are awesome. Friendship is a big part of this film. Please, just give it a try once, and if you don't like it that's OK... but I just loved it, and if there's anyone who's planning not to watch it, PLEASE WATCH IT!!! It's a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, I saw an Eight O'Clock showing in SF, and all I can say is that if you're a die-hard fanboy of the first Ghostbuster's movie, WHICH I SAW ON OPENING DAY, and you think that recasting the film was a bad idea (read that as a shot to your male ego or female hating female ego), then this is NOT, I repeat IS NOT, the movie for you.On the other hand, if you're a little more open minded, understand that the first film way back in the 80s wasn't all that funny to begin with, regardless of how superficially entertaining it was to you, THEN might want to take a chance on this filmThe real theme among users on the BBS and user reviews is that this film is somehow a "man hating" (referred to as "Misandry") affair.I saw no such thing. There is one supporting character who plays the "pretty but dumb" secretary, but that's a little "turn-around is fair play". The women actually like him. I guess the reviewers and other posters missed that.How unfortunate, and in this way disturbing.Someone says they "contradict established continuity". Huh? Illogical since this is a remake. By definition the continuity within the film IS ITS OWN. I guess the fanboys missed that. Oh dear.Someone claimed racism regarding the black woman. Admittedly she's pretty stereotypical, and stereotypes are parodied in media because they exist. But that doesn't make it racist. In fact she was probably the funnest character in the film.Someone else claimed they ripped off "an original classic" ... well, DUH! It's a REMAKE.And the negative comments keep coming. And, to be brutally honest, all of them stem from the absolute hatred of the women on the screen; from both sexes no less.So, with all that, what do I think of the film? I thought it was great.I didn't like the first one and its sequel all that much, and thought it was more ego than actual comedy. And, in fact, my very right leaning church going friend made that observation himself. An observation I agreed with after having been puzzled so long as to why I didn't like the film like a lot of OTHER males I knew.Original Ghostbusters was about the male ego. Bill Murry has gotten cast in roles that either skid near or veer into a kind of misogyny. Meetballs, Stripes, Ghostbusters ... you name it. That's not to say that that's who he is, but he set the tone for the first Ghostbuster's film.And this new one he plays the roll of the man he accused in the first film as ... how does one put it in a G-Rated context ... "lacking masculinity" (which got a great laugh from some of the audience). If he played the role of one of the bad guys that was in the first film, WHO WAS ALSO A MALE, then how is that man-hating?The film revisits effects, and is a little more clever in explaining the genesis of the characters camaraderie and other details, and, UNLIKE the first Ghostbuster's movie, this one was actually scary at times.And that's the things about the first Ghostbusters movie. For a film about ghosts you'd think there would be some kind of fright or horror aspect to it. But instead we got a bunch of matted in puppets via process shots that looked absolutely NOTHING like ghost of classic scary movies. In contrast, this Ghostbusters remake actually has a few scary scenes in it that'll make your heart skip a beat, but will also leave you smiling because of it.Here's another dirty little secret about this movie, and that is girls like to see men make fools of themselves to earn the affection of those same women. So what some men may see as man- hating, it's more or less a kind of endearment towards men, because men put up with it (mostly, and only if there's romance involved) knowing the payoff at the end.I think a lot of people missed that.The effects were superior in this film, the jokes were funnier, the acting was actually on par (if a bit energetic, and somewhat overstated in areas) compared to the first Ghostbusters, and the story was about the same in terms of tone.If I did have a nitpick with this film, then it's that the plot was a little too simple, and the villain just way too wooden. He was some shut in troll who was into the paranormal and all that it entails. And I did take a little exception at the Star Trek fan jab, because no fan of Trek would go near pseudo science, much less occultism, much less dress the part of one and indulge in the other. So yeah, that did get my hackles up, and I'm sure for a lot of other Trekkers and Trekkies who caught that comment.The villain was one-dimensional, and his scheme also a little one-dimensional. I think that's the worst you can fault the story. The film might have been better served had there been some more history, more of a plot that had been vetted by more than one bad guy thrown in there, but the film works as is.I just really can't imagine why there is so much vitriol over what is ostensibly a modern fantasy film.I'm guessing it's because the naysayers know it's a better movie, and just simply don't want to acknowledge that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NOTE: SEXISM NOT INCLUDEDLet's start where the tension is. If you're going to do a remake, why not mix it up a bit? Why stick to the exact same formula when you could make a few tweaks to differentiate it? The complaints of "man- hating" are ridiculous - the fact is the main four are very well suited to their roles. McCarthy and Wiig bring the (much needed) humanisation and character depth, with Jones and McKinnon adding the goofy pantomime comedy. They fit the parts properly, not as a gimmick but as genuinely likable characters, and their relationship as a foursome works brilliantly.As a comedy, I expected a little more though. I'm a fan of Feig's previous work (Bridesmaids, The Heat, Spy), but this one didn't quite have the same comic spark. There are still a fair few funny moments, a lot of which come from Hemsworth's hilariously deadpan moronic secretary (his interview scene had four or five laughs alone!). There are other smirk-inducing moments, like the inclusion of certain people in the narrative, but the movie's strength is the action.The CGI is great - the ghosts look cartoony but also pretty menacing, and the multitude of weapons they use look amazing! The first half an hour or so feel a little empty, but once they get busting, it's a hell of a ride! By the time the movie reaches its climax, it's so over- the-top and outrageous (Shapiro's score adding to it), I couldn't help but smile as skyscrapers are torn apart!All this comes from solid writing. There are some self-reflective moments (YouTube comments...) and wacky science mumbo-jumbo, but the thing that makes it work is that it's light. Feig makes movies that are fun above everything else, and I for one was happy to enjoy a new, but familiar, spin on a classic. The original is better though.4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With a slow pace, hit and miss jokes and a copy of the original story, this new Ghostbusters is something strange in the neighborhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Sony got the idea to reboot Ghostbusters, I can't think of another movie that got so much controversy and backlash online. The comment sections of YouTube and countless forums were just full of people proclaiming "Your ruining our childhoods" or "CASH GRAB, CASH GRAB!". Even before the first trailer (the same video that is the most disliked video in YouTube history) hit the scene, it was clear that people had already made their opinions that the movie would be bad even without seeing what was in it. On the other side were hard supporters that would play the trump card that if you didn't like the new movie, then you're automatically sexist. It seems that while Captain America: Civil War was in theaters, the Internet was in the middle of it's own Civil War over Ghostbusters. I'll say immediately that while I was not on the hate train, I was feeling uneasy about a reboot. Looking back at the original (which I've already reviewed), Not only is the 1984 film great, but it's one of the greatest movies of all time. Considering its combination of genius writing and smart adlibbing, the odds of lightning striking twice for a reboot is a billion to one odds. Let's see if Ghostbusters at least came close.Dr. Erin Gilbert (played by Kristen Wiig) is a Colombia teacher who teaches physics. As she is preparing for tenure, she discovers an old book she's written about the existence of the paranormal is for sale online. She confronts her coauthor, Dr. Abby Yates (played by Melissa McCarthy) who is still studying ghosts along with a crazy inventor Dr. Jillian Holtzmann (played by Kate McKinnon). The three agree to examine a recent haunting at an old mansion, where they encounter a ghost. They fail in capturing it, but that excites them enough to go out on their own when they all lose their teaching jobs. Their next assignment is from a MTA subway worker Patty Tolan (played by Leslie Jones). They test out a proton pack and get a recording, but they are dismissed as being a hoax. When Patty joins, the group continues to develop their equipment until they are called to a local heavy metal concert where they show up in full gear and suits. They capture the ghost and receive mass attention. Once their secretary Kevin Beckman (played by Chris Hemsworth) gets possessed, he activates a machine that allows thousands of ghosts to invade New York, leaving it up to the Ghostbusters. Now that this reboot is out, I can say that the movie is defiantly not the disaster that many people thought this would be. However, it's also not a good movie. I can only describe the experience as a total "meh". Much of it has to do with the fact that while the Ghostbusters themselves are fine, the movie Ghostbusters just isn't good. It's clear that director Paul Feig did his best to hire some funny women, and they are. The chemistry between these ladies really shows (with the exception of Kate McKinnon who is hit or miss).The story of these underdogs rising to the occasion is too close to the original. Though it's not telling the same story, it's structures very similar, so if you've seen the original, your likely to already know what's going to happen (even if you haven't, it's underdog story feels very bland).The effects of the ghosts are also hit and miss as while some like Slimer and some balloon creatures look neat, the rest still look too obviously CGI. Finally as a comedy, that too is?hit and miss, but it's not the proper humor for a Ghostbusters movie. The original was very quick and witty, while a lot here can go on too long and are even too low brow. A good example is a Patrick Swayze joke (it references Ghost) that at first was funny, but they go one another minute and again to describe the joke. This is where you needed an editor. Speaking of which, while not a long movie, this does feel surprisingly slow-paced up until the ending, so I could imagine several kids feeling board. I'll give this four Slimers out of ten. Paul Feig may have understood how to get the right look of a Ghostbusters movie that combines laughs with scares, he does not have the right pace nor enough of an original story to separate it from the original. On it's own, its meh, but even lower when compared to the 1984 classic. I can't really blame this movie as no matter who was in the suits, it's just never going to match the genius of Peter, Ray, Egon, and Winston. So who am I gonna call? The original movie even though this Ghostbusters tried hard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are probably thousands of words to describe the mess that is this movie but I will use the word awful. And I don't just mean the plot, story, graphics, special effects, comedy, acting, but even the popcorn was awful. You people should be ashamed of yourselves. I mean, do you watch these films before you release them? Let me start with the actors - I couldn't tell if they were in a comedy or a drama most times and a crazy smiling black woman does not exactly turn a bad movie into a good one. Next, the special effects just seemed to be at the level of the earlier version, there was nothing special about them. I am trying to remember a moment when the movie was funny and I am struggling. In regards the popcorn, I just think it was the lack of a good movie going experience that put a bad taste in my mouth. But, I will say that this is the first time I used the popcorn analogy so take that for what it is worth. This movie is awful and you will walk away feeling like you just wasted 2 hours of your day and you will have wished you had spent it instead cleaning the gutters of your home.

		<shortDescription>Development hell combined with propaganda.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ghostbusters III spent a quarter century in development hell. Over time the project eventually saw its way into the hands of people who by their own statements make "feminist propaganda" (Feig and Dippold, the director and lead writer notably) so that they could exploit the name to get attention for a propaganda piece.This started downwards spiral. People would be turned off by the names and their ultimate goal, which forced the team behind the film to more heavily focus it towards a specific audience ("political correctness"/social justice types). While the various problems in this approach could (and have) been gone on at length (such as the massive racism row around Leslie Jones and her character being "too black" and "not black enough"), basically it was a death sentence for the film.A good example of how this failed is the ending where 4 fat middle aged women go on about how the antagonist of the film shouldn't hurt their boy toy because he is hot and probably has a big dick, then hundreds of soldiers get crushed to death, and then they geld the logo of the original films to "defeat" it.Because that is funny, right? And all of that is exactly the same kind of atmosphere the original had, right? :?</fullReview>

But the general public has not judging by ratings here and audience ratings on rotten tomatoes. This is a slow and unfunny film. It's not about whether women can be as funny as men. It's about whether this film is funny at all. The women in the film are talented and funny. The problem is no one considered giving them a script as a basis of humor. And the result is a disaster. Forty minutes into the film I had laughed at one funny line. Remakes are always tough. But this remake had all the humor surgically removed before the premiere. Stay away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was really pretty bad. There's just no other way to put it.I will say, though, that when I saw it in the theater, everybody else seemed to like it. And not just a little bit. They were cracking up.But, then, the people in the theater where I saw it cheered at stupid things like Dan Aykroyd's cameo, where he said "I ain't afraid of no ghosts!".I mean, how do you respond to that? Some people are really easily impressed. There are lots of dumb people in the world, and it's nice that there are things out there for them to enjoy. So, in a way, I kind of feel bad for picking on this movie. But screw it. I grew up with Ghostbusters. I still have it basically memorized from watching it so much when I was a kid. I even have the "edited for television" version I taped off of TV, where they replaced the swear words with other bits of dialog memorized. So criticize I shall!Some of the jokes were funny, I guess. Most of them really weren't. A lot of them just went on and on, long past the point at which they were funny. Like the whole "cat out of the bag" discussion.You know that thing in movies people do sometimes? Where they plan to do something in unison, but they screw it up, and then look confused and point at each other and say "Oh, were you...?" "No, I guess we...?" "So now we're gonna...?" for a few seconds? They did that at least THREE TIMES in the movie.Do you think that's funny? Do you think it's funny to see it three times in one movie? If so, Ghostbusters 2016 is the movie for you.I see professional reviewers who say that this captures the spirit of the original Ghostbusters. This is a lie. A flat-out, bald- faced lie. I don't know if Sony Pictures paid them to say that, or they were just too jazzed up about the whole "grrl power" thing or what, but it's a lie.Here's the problem. The original Ghostbusters wasn't really a comedy. Sure, there were funny parts in it, but it was really just an action fantasy movie. There are whole stretches of the film where nobody says anything that's even intended to be funny.This was just a cartoon show. It was more cartoonish than the actual Ghostbusters cartoon.Couple of examples. Chris Helmsworth, the secretary. He's dumb. You know how you know he's dumb? Because every second he spends on camera is a reminder that he's dumb.But I don't mean dumb the way that, say, a dumb person is dumb. Oh no. This guy is dumber than that.At one point, he hears a loud noise, and covers up his eyes. That's how dumb his character is supposed to be. Babies know that you hear with your ears, but not this character! That's how dumb he is!At one point, he tries to reach into an aquarium to try to get at a phone that's in there. Hand hits glass. He tries again. Hand hits glass again. He tries again.Another time, he shows a picture of him "listening to a saxophone", by which, he means holding a saxophone up to his ear, with nobody playing it. So, he learned how his ears work, but not saxophones.Why does this matter? Because NONE of this movie seemed real. I just didn't CARE if the apocalypse happened, because this didn't bear any resemblance to the real world. I didn't feel like there was anything at stake.The original Ghostbusters movie was about a supernatural event that happened to realistic characters, and they responded in realistic ways. They were eccentric, but still recognizable as human. The exception would be Lewis, but if there's just one guy acting like that, you can believe that he's just sort of odd.By contrast, in this movie, someone has to explain to the mayor of New York City that a woman didn't really get sawed in half during a magic show.Do you see the difference?Oh, and there's a really dumb scene at a heavy metal concert, with a fake band that isn't very good, and a crowd of people behaving in a way no crowd of people have ever acted!And then Ozzy Osbourne comes out and breaks the fourth wall! Someone, somewhere must have found that funny! I can't imagine who, but then, who am I? Just someone who spent money on this thing.So, in conclusion. You might like this. You might not. I have to admit, I went into it thinking it looked pretty bad. I TRY not to be negative, though, and I TRY to give things a chance, but... I don't know. I don't see how I could ever have liked this movie. I don't know who could. A lot of people seem to, though. So maybe I'm just getting cranky in my old age. Maybe everyone else is just stupid. It's hard to say.That blonde woman was really annoying too. There was a scene of her dancing around to that song "Rhythm Of The Night" setting things on fire with a couple of gas torches. Not for any reason, mind you. Just to show the audience that she's "wacky". She spends the entire movie being "wacky". The kind of "wacky" that gets old really fast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ghostbusters movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So... i don't wanna start with saying that this movie is really bad. this is pretty much just like scary movie with a pretty silly change of genders. can even be considered offensive. Anyway the problem with this trying to be the scary movie of ghostbusters is that ghostbusters has some good comedy too. So some people actually think that this trash from 2016 is trying to be like Ghostbusters. This movie should not be named ghostbusters tho because its just cheap slapstick with some actually not so bad jokes but those can pretty much bought in Hollywood and just added in. Anyway this movie can be enjoyd if you are into scary movie and this weird gilmore-we-are-totally-crazy-girrrls humor but seriously do not expect this to be like ghostbuster AT ALL.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***spoiler alert***Very disappointing at best. The movie pays tribute to every major Ghostbusters event. Lines from both movies, scenes from the video game, and even slimer driving the NEW ecto 1 (from the Real GB cartoon pilot). The GB team is awkward their tools are called weird names and not really explained on how there used. The CGI ghosts are too much and too many. It's not funny either. Bill Murray's character is extremely weird and not necessary. The mayor is a joke. And most of all Ghostbusters is a NYC movie ! Masking Boston as NYC is a mistake. I like that the subway is involved because the subway is a big part of NYC but any New Yorker or commuter can obviously tell it's not NYC. They are made up NYC subway stations using the Boston T.Walter Peck called the originals frauds. He was 32 years too early. This movie is the real fraud..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing and lazy remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know who this movie is aimed at, but it's not fans of the original.From the opening where the title is displayed in a plain text without the Ghostbusters logo and the classic theme is cut extremely short, the production values feel half hearted.This feels more like a low brow, slapstick comedy with unbelievable characters that would look more at home in an Airplane movie than the Ghostbusters franchise. Where the original felt like a serious film with comedy driven by the character of the Ghostbusters and the cool, wisecracking way they dealt with the threat, this feels like a random set of jokes have been thrown together which don't advance the narrative. Whereas the original was loved by adults and children alike, I feel much of this humour misses the mark for adults and from the response of other movie goers at the screening I attended it appears they had the same reaction.I would have given this a 3, but for the tack Sony marketing has taken by repeatedly accusing anyone who criticised the material aired in the trailers.1/10, shame I couldn't make it a 0.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a great movie overall. I was kind of sort of looking forward to this film, since I am a fan of the franchise, but was not completely sold from the trailers. 10 minutes into the film and I knew it was going to be incredible. The stand outs for me where Kate McKinnon and Chris Hemsworth. They were both ridiculous over the top characters but worked incredibly well in this new ghostbusters universe. The gadgets Kate's character makes in the film are incredibly cool. And the way she explains them in a very technical manner, is incredibly refreshing.The movie is not necessarily, since it had to set up a bunch of new characters, but it was the best it could of been. Two thumbs up!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Earlier today I survived 18 years of confusion and stress to celebrate this special day, my 18th birthday. The day of surprise and maturity that every teenager looks forward to. As I go on throughout this day I decide to use my new privilege to purchase a lottery ticket. My expectations were low but I am full of hope and confidence. I put in dollar after dollar to get a lottery ticket and slowly scratch off the numbers until I find a barren wasteland of unmatched numbers. I sit there with disappointment as I wasted $5 on false hope. But this feeling doesn't compare at all to the agony I was about to experience as I watch the new Ghostbusters. The story involves 4 smart but quirky women with mutual interest in science and the paranormal. Also starring the dumb but hunky receptionist Chris Hemsworth to show how gender stereotypes play into our modern culture and cinema. But much like a sex ed class, their point couldn't get across without uncomfortable humor and many awkward silences. The lead characters make up for this by being loud and dominant rather than expressing genuine humor or having insightful dialogue.It was also ironic how the movie showed how women can look at men for their attractiveness and disregard their intellect and personality.Although this was meant to be a feminist movie, it was very ironic that the entire movie was based another film but poorly done. This movie was about as beneficial to the feminist movement as communism was to Russia. Sure there were good intentions, but the end result was a disaster. Executed so poorly that it puts a middle school Willy Wonka play to shame. After finishing this movie, the disappointment I experiences scratching my lottery ticket turned into relief. Relief that although I lost $5 to a scratch ticket with low expectations, it is nothing compared to the $8 I wasted on Ghostbusters. A disappointment so bad that it makes Jaden Smith seem like an idol.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If i have to see this movie again i will commit suicide</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, this is the worst movie i have ever seen, and i have seen a lot of really bad movies. So lets start with the music: The "new" Theme is so horrible, the producer should be banned from being an "artist". The characters are written so bad it hurts, i couldn't care less about any single one of them, in fact i hate all the main-actors now. The dialogues are just not funny, not even once. The story is basic and uninteresting, also not even close to the original one. It hurts so much that actors who are actually quiet good imo wasted their time being in this movie and i also hate them a little bit for it. Then to address the "sexist" topic... honestly it is sad how critics were possibly afraid to destroy this movie because they didn't want to be called sexist. But whatever i heard they paid enough of them for good ratings and even created a lot of bots to give the movie good reviews. This movie is a modern tragedy i hope ill never have to see it again, i would rather commit suicide than to watch this disgrace again. I feel sorry for everyone who spent money to see it. In fact i consider suing the studio for pain compensation. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't watch this movie, don't spend money on it, just give it a bad rating and don't waste more time on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to create an account to review this movie. It's a horrible movie. I didn't expect a Dumb&amp;Dumber style, at all for this kind of movie. Especially when you consider how many dozen millions of dollars were put into it's making. It's bad on many point.Plot: A bunch of girls assemble to fight a dude that makes ghosts materialize in real world thanks to the knowledge inside a book 2 these girls wrote a while back.The characters are all clichés: -The funny fat lady, incapable of anything by herself. She takes nothing seriously and does too many idiotic things (that proton pack testing?), say too much useless jokes that are not even smart jokes. I can't even remember them. She's very annoying. -The "good girl" scientist, unsure of everything. So empty that there is nothing to say. -The "Black street-smart girl" cliché... Why??????? I mean, they could have brought a black girl into the crew without keeping her at that kind of lame-ass cliché. I'm angry about this one. -The "steampunk" girl cliché. Over-confident and so on. The less annoying character IMO but she over-did it anyway. -and the "low IQ good looking guy" secretary with a plot use. I can't begin to think to a justification to that almost full retard character but more useless jokes ?On themselves these characters are bad clichés already. But you have to consider it as a re-shake of the old characters. Which makes it worse the longer you think about it. The way the team assembles is also really really bad. For one, it'd never had assembled if the "villain" had not existed. This movies suffers from too much quantumic-mumbo-jumbo-unnecessary explanations that don't serve any purpose in the story. Probably for selling toys on Christmas. Very very bad characters. Not one of them seems "real" enough to dive into the movie. Too much dull jokes. I mean, really, too much. More than 1 joke a minute. I could even say that almost 90% of dialogues are bad jokes. Too cartoonish CGIs. Very very bad plot.This movie is a succession of flat jokes sprinkled with bad CGIs that no "plot" or acting could make interesting. It's just a fact. If there had not been so much jokes and useless explanations on things that don't matter maybe the story would have been better. They tried to remake 2 GB in one, but without the substance... And more. I don't see any reason why any person older than 12 would enjoy that crap. GB 2016 is not at all the same kind of genre than original GB and that's probably what grinds it all.I'd rather watch Dragon Ball Evolution again than watch GB 2016 one more time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly movie written for 10-year old girls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Twin grandchildren had to see this. Their friend and her 12 year old brother came too. They laughed themselves silly over it. I laughed a few times, too, but not like they did. I wish the maker had left out the unnecessary adult material so that it could have been PG instead of PG13. At least then it would be suited to the audience who appreciated it. I would not have taken the girls to see it, but their mother was OK and went, too. She also laughed a lot.So, who likes this movie? Ten year old girls, 12 year old boys, and mothers of those kids. For me, I would rather not have spent my money on it. Mildly entertaining but worth only seeing on Netflix or Amazon Prime. Unnecessarily anti-male, but that didn't bother me as much as some other people here. It just wasn't much of a story. I wonder how much they paid for the original Ghostbusters cameos, especially the 15 seconds of Sigourney Weaver.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just did not entertain us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not often I take the time to make reviews. As normally I don't listen to reviews, I like to watch movies for myself and form my own opinions.For me I have one simple rule did the movie entertain me for the time I was in watching it. Very simple, I am not like a lot of people go in looking for faults in movies or plot holes. I love a lot of movies many people would consider not very good films. When I go watch a flick I just want it to keep me entertained and forget about real life for a few hours, that's it..This movie did not entertain us at all the only part of the movie we enjoyed was Chris Hemsworth and I am not even a very big fan of his at all. The jokes Paul Feig and the cast had in this movie were just not funny. This is coming from someone who actually likes most of Adam Sandler's stuff as well. I also quite honestly found the movie pretty boring as well it just did not keep me interested in the slightest. I believe there has only been one movie I can remember that I walked out of in my life and this came close to being number 2.In fact after we watched this we went out to eat dinner, then went back to the theatre and watched Star Trek Beyond that we had planned to see today. The reason being was to wash that Ghostbusters movie out of our minds. Star Trek was fantastic, if your trying to decide for something to see this weekend watch Star Trek. I really think anyone giving this movie a 10 must be getting paid to review it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a great reboot, classic fans will not enjoy this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ghostbusters 2016 is a reboot of the classic franchise from the 80's. It re-imagines the Ghostbusters team as a all female cast. For this review, I will be discussing the film itself and not the drama and controversy surround it.The movie opens up with hard hitting jokes such as anti-Irish fences, enslaving elephants and a fart joke about a EVP involving a female "queef". You can expect other such quality jokes about a man pooping his pants, a **** joke in the disguise of one of the main characters being slimed, a coward of a man screaming like a eight year old girl and much more.There is a moment of blatant advertising for Pringles potato chips. They don't even attempt to hide it and are unapologetic about it. It's bad enough they expect people to pay money to see this film, but then they cram advertising down their throat.The complaint that the film portrays all men as jerks, creeps or idiots is doesn't appear to be a valid complaint. If anyone can recall the older movies in the franchise, the Ghostbusters have always had problems with authority and in almost all cases, it has always been men. With that being said, the male secretary for the reboot is beyond stupid, this character is so dumb they should be considered mentally retarded, it's to the point that it is literally offensive that anyone would consider this character funny.I assume the animated behavior and antics of the characters are intended to be funny, but failed on almost every level to as so much illicit a smirk from me. The funniest moment is when a person literally flips them off and tells them to "suck it" for a extend period. The character Patty just seems to be like a hodgepodge of black stereotypes in her mannerism and the way she speaks.The remade theme son of the Ghostbusters is absolutely terrible, they took a classic theme and turned it into a hip-hop, rap stylized song and it fails on several levels.The movie blatantly ignores source material, steaming ahead and forging it's own path. Perhaps if this movie was intended to be more of a spiritual successor instead of a direct reboot, it wouldn't be so heavily criticized, but the fact is, this movie was never intended for the fans of the classic franchise. None of the jokes or dialog match the thoughts and feelings of the original movie.This is a great example of meritocracy at it's best, dragging the since long dead corpse of the Ghostbuster's name through the mud and making a complete mockery of something many people have held near and dear.People who have never watched the originals may enjoy the film, but the reality is, Ghostbusters 2016 will in no way please the actual fans who have supported the Ghostbusters franchise for nearly three decades.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ghostbusters ruined my childhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>But no, seriously. I saw this opening night and had a great time with it. The movie drops references to show love for the originals, with one showing up within the first, like, ten minutes. At the same time, though, this movie is thematically and tonally different. At first, I wasn't sure I liked that, but after thinking about it I've decided I actually really liked that about the movie. The fact is, if Feig had tried to ape Ramis' style, I think it would have come off feeling like a Chinese knock-off. Honestly, it has the director's personal style, and it shines for it.Nothing will ever replace the original for me, but I wouldn't let that stop myself from trying to experience this movie for what it is. Try to release your preconceptions and see how you ultimately feel about it for yourself. You may find that it's a fun movie with surprising turns and familiar feelings. You may find yourself laughing at things you wouldn't have thought to laugh at in the movie. You might just find yourself enjoying it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll be honest to say that this is not the best reboot that could have been done. However, it has its moments. All of the original, living, Ghostbusters make cameo appearances as well as Annie Potts (Janine) and Sigourney Weaver (Dana Barrett). At the end of the day, the plot is not that much different from the others. How else can you? A person/thing decides to try and take over New York City using ghosts. Also, the ghosts are much different looking in this reboot, much more cartoo- nish. I think the movie plot could have been a lot better with the Original Ghostbusters passing the reigns down to a female crew. With at the end of the movie, them helping the new female Ghostbusters defeat the villain. Could it have been better, most certainly. Could it have been a lot worse, DEFINITELY.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll start this (soon very positive) review by saying that I was very disappointed by the beginning of this movie. I'd rather forget the first 15-20 minutes or so, because for me the real movie started after that, when the whole gang was working together. At the start, I thoroughly disliked the humour and the rhythm of the story. It's like that part never went further than the first draft.But then it really starts, and what a good movie! The story is solid, with a clear plot (not always the case with big movies these days) and no time for boredom. Humour is well present throughout and feels natural. The cast is excellent.Much has already been said about the all-women cast. Even if this wasn't the reason for which I went to see it, I really enjoyed watching a movie that had intelligent and brave women as its main characters, who didn't need help from men (without constantly proclaiming it), and never showed more flesh than was necessary, even wearing the completely unsexy Ghostbusters jumpsuits. All four stars were given the opportunity to shine and show their acting and comedy talents. I wasn't familiar with any of these four actresses before, and it was a more than nice discovery for me.Other roles were also well cast, and I must mention the little gem that was comic-relief and eye-candy Chris Hemsworth as Kevin the receptionist. He was perfect in this, and I enjoyed the fact that his presence as the only male of the team was never overwhelming in regards to his female co-stars, but that he still had his place in the story.If only I hadn't disliked the beginning so much, I would have given a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first noticed this film a while ago when the trailer was shown on Youtube. Currently over 900k dislikes. The dislikes and the comments meant something, and the actual trailer itself was bad. It was a warning, what was soon to come.The film itself tries to cash in all of the humor and ideas from the first, But this film feels like it tried too hard to climb up to the 1984 originals level.Some of the jokes are actually clever, some being crude or movie references. The characters itself are mostly flat, Kristen Wiig is just like her role in bridesmaids, and i find her role similar to Sandra Bullocks role in The Heat, (Another Paul Feig movie) Where Sandra is very formal with her job, Melissa forces her to roll up her sleeves and do dirty work though she is not used to it. In the end she becomes very experienced and Kristen/Sandra form a really strong bond. This works the same way with this film.Its the pure fact that its an average Paul Feig with tiny Ghostbusters aspects and they call it "Ghostbusters" annoys me. I would personally enjoy this film more if it had more "connections" to the first except reducing the other characters to cameos. Though the cameos are creative, which is nice. Another thing that grinds my gears is the modernized theme song. If they were to keep it how it was, that would be excellent, however they make it sound like every song on the radio these days. But there's ALSO an orchestral remix which is awesome, so why didn't they just settle with that? Did they need BOTH?Overall, I would recommend watching this movie as a rental. A rental like "Oh that movie wasn't too bad" And move along with your life the next day.PROS:-Good Cameos -Some Funny moments -Paul's most visually striking film to date -Ghost-Catching Devices are unique and awesomeCONS:-Original Characters are reduced to Cameo's -Movie tries too hard -Bland Characters -Horrible Villain</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a bad movie. (This should tell you all)I would not suggest to pay for cinema tickets. If you really want to see it, rent it or whatever. Find a cheaper solution, to chip away from the disappointment you will feel after watching it.Pros: - The "Suck it" joke from the university made me LoL - Kate McKinnon made a very interesting character, but i am inclined to think that she seemed that way because all the other characters where so plain/non interestingContra: - Man hating trash jokes ( mind-boggling idiotic male secretary, a young man shits his pants when he saw a ghost but the women are not fazed at all, the evil character is a male that was bullied in life, the new device that she created "nutcracker", shooting a ghost in the "d**k" etc.. ) - the characters seemed to not have a thing in common. Even the two friends (Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig) had no "friends" feeling to them. Very plastic feeling to the characters. - Somehow they had money to build stuff that would need Elon Musks fortune to fund. It was built by a person with 0 backstory in this. AND there is no evolution in the tech. She just improves tech from one day to another like some sort of prodigy that can build cast iron accessories/materials out of her behind from one day to another. - It feels like a cheap parody of Ghostbusters.As i said, if you do not want to give money on something that does not deserve it, please don't go to the cinema to see it. Choose cheaper solutions or don't even try. The movie "Keanu" has better rating and seemed better than this.... . Just sayin' .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My 4 cents</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>saw it twice, first on opening day due to a political theory I have about America's ability to accept Women in roles of power.( passiveconsumer. blogspot.com) I was very happy with the comedy and chemistry of it but was less than enthused about the effects. Went back to see it in 3D on the advice of a friend and was much happier with the effects, as well as the jokes I missed the first time. Will watch it again and look forward to the blooper reel.Originally my only requirement for this movie was that it be better than my memory of Ghostbusters 2, which I have always harbored a grudge against. &amp; it was. But then I watched #2 again and you know, pretty good! Such great chemistry between Murray &amp; Weaver ( was she really Ripley?!) and the geekspeak and writing for Dan and Harold was executed like surgery.then, I was finally able to find a copy of 1, (thanks Christine!) and frankly, my surprise at how much I liked #2 was equaled by my surprise at how much I was blushing during #1. #1 is not a kid friendly movie! Even though I watched it a million times growing up, and it has a pg rating, #1 is much more adult than any of its counterparts. Did a ghost just go Lovelace on Dan!? Did the gatekeeper and the keymaster just wake up from a one night stand?! That's how Zul returns!?! Wow.After watching them all again, the newest might actually be my favorite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, I don't write many reviews - this may be the first I've ever posted on IMDb - which may say something.I'll say this to start - I'm a white male in his late 30's who saw and adored the first Ghostbusters on original release.I was skeptical about this reboot. I can't call it a remake because the plot, while similar, was different and enjoyably so. I really had a fun time with this movie.Maybe it is because I am the type of person who can watch a movie at face value and not place an over-emphatic amount of weight on "social commentary" in a movie or see hidden meaning behind casting choices, but I prefer to think of the reason for my enjoyment being that the movie, as a whole, is enjoyable.The cast consists of four very funny women who, while more backstory or chemistry could have been built between them, work well together and it's honestly refreshing to see Chris Hemsworth in a comedic role instead of just a muscle-bound action hero. A very enjoyable change of pace for him.I wonder about the people who say the CGI was bad because I think they must all be from another plane of existence where Pokemon run about the world in reality or something. The CGI was more than acceptable and while maybe not groundbreaking, was certainly not poor.Following there may be some spoilers, but if so they are gentle, and I don't think it'll ruin anything, however if you prefer to walk into it blind, then maybe stop reading now.Cameo appearances in the movie were all very good. I enjoyed seeing every one of them, though I did wonder where Rick Moranis was. Even the Stay-Puft cameo is done well and with a lot of hilarity, in my opinion.The final action sequence is just that - action. They stepped out of the comedy role long enough to put in a bit of real "busting" and it worked at that point of the movie.Yes, I know as well that the "crotch shot" on the "big baddie" was maybe cheap humor, but I found it funny - not emasculating - as I did the all-female-lead cast.Despite what others have said in their reviews, the four women aren't pinned as frauds but in fact recognized for their work, albeit secretly.I don't know what other reviewers have against this movie. As I said, I was at first reserved, but only because when you are rebooting a classic franchise, you must be careful. The reboot works and works well.I recently heard somewhere that for some reason, people think when something is rebooted, it "damages" the original product or ruins it. I don't know where this culture came from either, but I will say this about Ghostbusters 2016 to round out this review. It isn't a perfect movie, but it is entertaining, funny, well-acted, and worth seeing on a big screen - not necessarily 3D, but just the big screen.I hope you see it and enjoy it for what it is and stop trying to make it what it isn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My entire family enjoyed this, my teenage boys loved it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very hesitant to go to the theater to see this based on all the bad reviews. I grew up with Ghostbusters and the original movies hold a special place in my heart and always will. I love Egon, always. I base a lot of my decisions on user reviews and it's always been close to my own opinions. This is the first movie I can remember going to see with incredibly low expectations and really being shocked. I loved the movie, laughed through the entire movie. I have seen so many movies that people put political correctness and all kinds of stuff into opinions. Tons of movies with men in the lead get torn apart for insensitivity or too many penis jokes or having dumb women around. I enjoy those movies and don't take that stuff too seriously. Let guys be guys, leave them alone. They are having fun have fun with them. I feel the same here, the girls are being girls, have fun with them and don't be so serious. This movie didn't replace our beloved characters, thank God. It gave us new ones to love right along with the old ones. The movie was very respectful to the original in many ways. It didn't try to be a remake, it rebooted the movie for a new generation. I think it did it very well considering how loved the franchise is by so many people. I thought the story was easy to follow and stayed true to its roots. The humor flowed through the entire movie and the trailers didn't do the movie justice. It was funnier then I would have expected. I even enjoyed the CGI, it was done with a fun cartoony way that added to the lighthearted vibe the movie was trying to project. My boys and husband giggled through the entire movie, busted out laughing at times. We went to be entertained and we were. We are not easily offended types and we don't look at movies to represent reality. If you are tired of being spoon fed by Internet trolls telling you what you should and should not enjoy, give this movie a try, have fun with it. It's Ghostbusters on the big screen again! Thank you Paul Feig and your cast and crew for giving us a new Ghostbusters movie, I for one have been waiting for years to see it. I wasn't disappointed and I want to support you so I get to see more. This movie had a lot of pressure on it and you made me reminisce and laugh, and that's pretty darn cool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally get to see this movie. I read a lot of reviews here, and other places and, just like some, I have no idea why people are dissing this movie so much. I grew up on Ghostbusters and the comedy genius that was the 80s in general. I think a lot of people feel like that you cannot redo a classic. Well, that is wrong. Besides, this is not a remake, this is a reboot. And as far as I can see, it's a decent reboot at that. The acting was completely fine, although I did wish that Kate McKinnon had made a less quirky approach to the character, and I felt that perhaps Kevin was slightly overdone. That said, I think many miss the obvious jab at stereotyping in general. Many have commented that Patty (Leslie Jones) is a stereotyped African-American character with her street smarts. Personally, I think, yes, you are right (if you don't know Leslie Jones from other performances), but she was not really in any disadvantage because of it as a character. If you haves seen Leslie Jones in Saturday Night Live, then you know that her characterization is always loud and aggressive. That's her style, and she brought her style to the character. Besides, you could say, that Erin was also stereotyped as an academic with her slightly repressed personality and librarian outfit. When it comes to the characters of Erin (Kristen Wiig) and Abby (Melissa McCarthy), I think they were pretty mellow, which brought balance into the team as a whole. Returning to the jab at stereotyping. Kevin's character was made just for that. The 80s were full of blond bimbos, and I think remaking that as a male character was right on the money. It is blunt sarcasm. The same thing reflects on the four women vs the four men team. I mean we could rightly ask, why there were four men in the original casting of the Ghostbusters? Perhaps there was no back thought for that at all back then, but none the less, it is, inadvertently a reflection of the chauvinism that we should have left behind in the beginning of the 90s. The CGI was perfectly fine, even though I thought the action choreography could have used some work, and personally I had no love for the "Final Ghost" (Not going to say more because SPOILERS!). But well, I did watch it for the comedy and the story, not the CGI.Finally, I think the Paul Feigh - Melissa McCarthy duo has done what they always have since Bridesmaids, comedy for this decades humor, and in that sense, they did not disappoint. After all, this is exactly what Ivan Reitman did in the 80s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not sure if this spoils anything, so be warned just in case.....Well, I took my adult son with autism to see this. Usually Joe belly laughs at the slightest physical humor - not a peep out of him this time. I did appreciate some of the humor, in particular that of Wiig and McCarthy. McKinnon, I get it that her character was supposed to be an abrasive brilliant geek - she was just a bit too abrasive and came off as annoying more often than not. Jones was actually funnier than the other three leads - maybe she was given better material? Anyway, what made the movie for this older mom was seeing Hemsworth ham it up as the doofus beefcake. He seemed to be having a lot of fun with that role (nice break from being Thor, eh?) Some of the ghosts effects were cool. My son was actually afraid at some points, as most of the ghosts were honestly scary rather than funny-scary.I am glad we went on $5 Tuesday as I'd have been ticked off if I had paid more to see this. I do know my son will want the DVD eventually, so they will make some more money off us. But not running out to buy him a t-shirt or action figure.Edited to add something that is still bugging me - (SPOILER!!!) towards the end of the film, as the Bad Guy turns into a ghost and starts to grow larger - the heroes just stand there and watch him. After blasting ghosts right and left they seem to forget what they are capable of and don't shoot!!!! They run. Sure, there is one blast done that burns the now huge ghost villain's shoulder - but do the Ghostbusters continue to blast him and take him down? No - they run some more and meanwhile he is chasing them and bashing into buildings, too, before they finally use their blasters to take him down. Now, I get it. Blasting the villain at the get-go would have been logical, but then we wouldn't have the Big Final Showdown. But sure makes the 'Busters look stupid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a fan of the original (so, yes - I'm one of those) but as much as I loved the original, I have to admit that it's inferior to this reboot in so many ways. I've seen the reboot in theatres twice now (once in 3D and once not), and I can honestly say that it's an amazing film, and an important one - not just for kids (both boys and girls) but for women like me who grew up just wishing she could create amazing toys and tools to hunt ghosts with like Ray and Egon (I had the biggest crush on him) in a wicked (and functional) jumpsuit (distinctly different from the usual catsuit female heroines get stuck wearing). Middle-aged guys who watched the original as children and adolescents - you already got your film - don't begrudge us ours. The story is strong, the actors have palpable, organic chemistry, the characters are relatable, and the movie looks great overall. It's a fun film (like all of Feig's films), and I'm already looking forward to watching it a third time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know if my review will really contain any spoilers, but just in case. :) I am bummed that so many people are so negative about this movie. Did they really even watch it? It's not meant to change the world. It's just fun. I've seen it twice now and I enjoyed it very much. I laughed out loud throughout the movie, both times I watched it. I love Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Whigg in anything. I especially enjoyed Kate McKinnon's wacky scientist. And Leslie Jones is very funny as well. I also really liked Chris Hemsworth going for it as the ditsy pretty boy - AND he can dance. I have always liked the original and have seen it many times. I didn't go into this one looking to compare or criticize and it didn't disappoint. I hope that the speculation that they won't be able to make the sequel is wrong. I would love to see these ladies take on Zool. Give it a chance. Sometimes movies are just meant to entertain, and this is one of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very much enjoyed this rehashed story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Ghostbusters exists in NYC as its own first Ghostbusters group, which you can glean from the trailer. Which makes it a modern rehashing of the old story in a 2016 kind of way. The acting was great, the colors and the camera style were beautiful, and I found it funny and charming. (Especially Holtzmann!) The cameos were incredibly clunky, but if you think of them as in a universe where the past characters existed but they themselves took different life directions- it's a lot more interested after the fact. I will say that the extremely action-y action shots were also a little odd feeling, because the vapor state of the ghosts led to some conflict in the timing and the delivering of blows- but it came together as a whole piece that I found delightful. Without taking away from the old Ghostbusters- this one finds its own place and nestles right into its own skin and makes itself at home. I would tweak just a few minor creative choices, but ultimately, having this cast and style did no disservice to the film, but made an entirely new story I can appreciate and enjoy for another 30 years like I did the last ones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved the original. Second time around, same but different.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1984, I was the last of my group of friends to see Ghostbusters. Against a backdrop of critical comments, I found it to be probably my favourite movie experience ever. The new Ghostbusters movie was heralded by many as a reboot of the same story-line, I find that hard to agree with as the basic story-line (don't think this is a spoiler) ie catching ghosts is the same, the manner in which the story builds up to that is not. A darker scarier film, but to counteract that more 'laugh out loud' moments. Hilarious performances especially 'Abby', 'Holtzmann' super tech. Kristen Wiig as 'Erin' a straight to Abby's zany passion, not sure her character fully worked for me. That and the fact it was a rebooted concept prevents me awarding any higher. However they have achieved a new story-line in 'old wrapping'. PS Stay to the very end of the titles, it is worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before we start I'd just like to say, that this review is based on my opinion and anyone that has something negative to say that, I suggest you do one. Anyway, I loved this film. The comedy had me laughing till I was crying, the characters are all easy lovable, It perfectly honored the original and I cannot wait for more. It has to be said my particular favorite Ghostbuster is Patty, what can I say there just wasn't a point during this film when Patty was on screen that I wasn't laughing ridiculous loudly. The villain of the story is strangely familiar, a young man who has been mistreated by the world and now has the power to do something about that. Who wouldn't be like that? Honestly? But as I said the main focus of the film is just how well the four Ghostbusters turned out. Oh and their brilliantly funny receptionist played by Chris Hemsworth. But yes Ghostbusters is a nostalgic joy to watch as well as a new delight to any non misogynistic person that views it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Pretty Awesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going in to this movie, I was rather skeptical of how good it would be. Not because of the leads being played by women mind, I think that being controversial is rather sad in 2016, but more due to the inherent nature of reboots and remakes, as well as speculations about overt racism gained from the trailers. At best I expected it to be an inoffensive modern-style "quirky but not exactly funny" type comedy movie, instead it turned out almost as good as the originals to me.The film have a similar plot structure to the first film as expected. A team of scientists who dabbles in the paranormal get sent to investigate a alleged haunting in a local public building, and when they find undeniable proof of the haunt after being attacked by a ghost they decide to start a ghost busting service. During the course of the movie, they pick up another member of their team, do various jobs and slowly uncover a bigger picture to explain why there is a sudden increase in ghostly activity around.The new cast of Ghostbusters were in of themselves a pleasant surprise. I am not familiar with the previous work of Leslie Jones, Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy and Kate McKinnon, but they all do a great performance that punctuates most of the jokes nicely, and their on-screen chemistry helps tie the movie together and make it give the same feeling of teamwork and friendship that the originals did. Also thankfully, instead of just trying to emulate the personalities of the original team they were smart enough to make all of them new interesting characters in their own right, while still making sure they don't stray too far from the old team's dynamic.The movie also have a colorful gallery of amusing side characters, which helps keep the comedic pace of the film up while allowing the protagonists to partake in character building and drama at the same time. Of particular note is their dimwitted secretary, who's cartoon-ish stupidity is rather unbelievable from a story telling perspective, but as far as using him as a device for funny gags and jokes he is pure gold. If there is one character who could have maybe used a bit more depth though it would be the main villain, as his motivation seemed rather shallow, though I can see why they wanted to keep it straight forward as to not slog down the pace with needless exposition.The jokes themselves start off rather worrisome, utilizing toilet humor and goofy shenanigans that seems really out of place (and aren't very funny to boot), but after encountering their first haunting the humor thankfully starts to mature. Throughout the film a lot of creativity is put into setting up fun ideas for comedy that for the most part pays off, such as having a haunted Metal concert, playing with expectations regarding comparisons to the old films, and showing the Busters' ghost fighting equipment get gradually more ridiculous the more time they have to tinker with it.However, while I do consider this majorly a comedy film, it does action very well too. The ghosts themselves and the proton pack special effects look gorgeous in CGI, and the fact that it looks "fake" really doesn't bother me in this case as it makes perfect sense that ghosts wouldn't look "realistic" when they are spectral manifestations of dead people or whatnot. The action set pieces have a lot of great eye-catching moments too, especially in the final act where the movie completely lets loose with every over the top idea it can muster, and the end result is something I haven't said about a film in a long time: it's a fun ride.Yes, the movie have some issues I want to point out. The plot itself, while solid as a framework for great entertainment, doesn't have the same depth as the first film. While Leslie Jones' character have a much bigger role here than Ernie Hudson had and is given just as much love as the other Busters she is still somewhat stereotyped at times. There is some rather awkward and cringe-worthy dance scenes here and there, which seem to only exist due to the studio thinking women can't appreciate a film unless it has something stereotypicaly "girly" in it or something. Though for the most part, I feel these flaws are easily ignored just because of how much joy this film managed to bring me. As a deeply cynical and jaded person who is tired of the modern times depressing mood, this film came in like a breath of fresh air with it's genuine 80's sensibilities, and is a much needed shot of adrenaline to the dying body of mainstream comedy movies.In the end, all I can say is that it's worth a try. You might be pleasantly surprised if you have the right mindset going in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My theory is that the Producers known that they've messed up this movie which is why they are heavily promoting the movie well ahead of time so we got all of our negative response out the window and our expectations are much lower and able to digest the overall product given the amount of budget and talent invested in this movie. Although the movie was able to stand on it's own but one can say that it lacks originality. The plot is poorly written as everything falls into place very conveniently. Abby decides to publish her &amp; Erin's book on ghost 9 years after on the exact time when ghost starts to appear? This makes it very convenient for Erin to meet Abby. But this isn't the main issue; I felt the editing staff made a huge error during the near-ending scene where Erin uses her army knife to pierce through the marshmallow man balloon because their dialogue was awkward after: "welcome back" which made me think that they've cut a scene where Erin left the group because she felt they are being displayed poorly by the secret services.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yep, I just came home from the movies and watched the new Ghostbusters movie. And it was awesome! It was fun, it had the "science", it had the right char combination, the story was smooth, it did have the right amount of action and even a few jump scares. Oh, and it was just gorgeous to see in 3D! So I gotta take back my initial train of thought, that this movie couldn't be any good. Because I also am a big fan of the original movies, it's feel and of course the characters, but this one was a good Ghostbusters installment, plain and simple. And people who are boycotting it because of it not being what it was 30 years ago, they are just missing out on a great movie experience.I gotta admit, there was an unadmissable amount of Fempride/Menhating propaganda in it and that is def smth that can be criticised. I won't go into detail because that'd take too long. My other personal dislike was McCarthy, as always, and the poor quality and amount of jokes. But although that is something one can't dismiss, this movie is still well worth the watch and an enjoyable experience. ^o^And I'd rather have a good action comedy in the Ghostbuster-verse with a new cast that isn't 60-70 years old, than nothing at all. Would a "third" GB movie with old cast be great? Sure, it could. But if the old gang doesn't wanna do a full feature length film in their golden years, who can blame'em?I hope that there'll be a sequel before another 30 years go by and I hope that people can appreciate this film and not be small minded about this. That's my five cents. And now, I'm gonna watch the old movies once again! :D "Bustin' makes me feel goood&#x301c;" &#x1f3b5;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this movie. I really did. And I did like it more that I thought I would. But sadly it wasn't enough. To be clear, I went with negative expectations. I didn't like the trailers one bit.The ghosts I didn't like and the humor wasn't working for me either, so what was left? The story? Everybody knew the story was going to be something similar to the original. The thing is, the trailers have the worst jokes of the movie. Literally the worst ones. The nickelodeon-type green vomit... the classic "make fun of the badass hero line cliché"... the black woman being all "Hell no!" and ghetto about everything. That being said, I laughed out loud several times during the movie. And, as big of a fan of the original as I am, let's be honest, you don't laugh out loud very much on those. Is not that kind of humor. Is more of a "Have a smile on your face the whole time" kind of humor. This one has great jokes, great writing, and very good performances by all the main cast. Although Leslie Jones is still a little too "Hell no!" for my taste. But is balanced by the surprisingly hilarious Chris Hemsworth. The actual ghostbusting wasn't that good. Except for that McKinnon bit, which was as good as everything McKinnon did throughout the movie. So, in my opinion, you have not so good ghostbusting stuff filled with good jokes and funny performances. A movie with this dialogues and cast would have been great if only they would change the whole Ghostbusters thing.No matter what people say, this movie definitely isn't a less than three stars movie. That's just fan hate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers ahead . . .First off, the movie is not as bad as the trailers. 1/3 of the way into the movie, I was so pleasantly surprised. The introduction and backstory into the initial ghost is scary for a comedic film. The ghost itself is far too neon and detracts from the ominous atmosphere created. All of the ghosts are too neon I suppose in an effort to attract kids, and the effects are worse than the original movie because of it.The humor in the movie is extraordinarily low brow. There are some good moments, but this is so far below the comedic standards set by these four comediennes. This is Michael Bay level humor. I do come away from the movie liking all 4 actresses as the Ghostbusters and believe they can make an amazing Ghostbusters movie if given a decent script.Chris Hemsworth's character is by far the worst in the movie. I am also a fan of his, but they made him far too stupid and unfunny. Think Patrick from Spongebob Squarepants. They made his character so bad that I don't believe they can bring him back for a sequel. How many times can they make the "he is so hot" joke? Apparently a lot.The comedy writing was just so inadequate. The Chinese food delivery boy was probably the funniest character in the movie. The movie screeches to a halt when they get to the mayor's office. The "cat in a bag" joke has potential to be known as one of the worst jokes in mainstream movie history.The plot started out fine but fizzled once I realized there was not more to it. How are you going to have the pale Hotel worker (he was good in the film) be the main bad guy?! I thought he was going to be the henchman unleashing some cool Babylonian deity or something. And they showed the main ghost in the trailers?! How are going to spoil everything? Truly, in retrospect, the trailers did such a massive disservice to the film.I also did not care for how rapidly they were coming out with new Ghostbusters gear. It took me out of the movie and made me think about how they want to introduce as many potential toys as possible for a cash grab.The incorporation of a female Slimer was also cringe worthy for any fan of the series. How unoriginal can you be? They truly need someone with greater imagination to write the next movie. You are inventing ghosts. You can create anything you want and this is what you do? The cameos from the original cast were fun and well done. Obviously, this movie would have been better as a sequel than an entire reboot.On the whole, it is an average movie. The trailers were done so poorly and revealed too much. I have hope, though, for a new movie with these four women as the Ghostbusters because their characters are great. They just need a new director, new writers, and ghosts that look decent.</fullReview>

Kate Mckinnon's performance stands out but all four women are wonderful. The advertising for this film did not do it justice, in any respect (damnit, Sony.) I was completely blown away and have a new respect for Paul Feig. Despite the hoards of whining trolls trying to rain on its parade, we got a movie that balances the tone of the original with the comedy of a new decade, all without alienating a new audience. I'm looking forward to a new era of female led action. I for one, am pumped for the sequel. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sadly i feel like i must first address the elephant in the room. This movie has been heavily slandered before it was even made due to the inclusion of an all female main cast. This is by far one of the dumbest things to hate about a movie i have ever heard, but whats even worse is that its part of this at all. It should not matter what the gender of the characters are (TO ANYONE,including some of the advocates), what matters most is the content of the film and the context in which it is presented. That being said my only real worry was that the shift from the original would could possibly lead the filmmakers to change the overall dynamic of the movie. To that end i am relieved to say that they did not. While standing very well as its own movie it managed to stay very true to the feel of the original. The strong bond of shared purpose resonated just as strongly with the new cast as much as it did the old. Aside from the main cast the comedy was very well written, although it did stumble (sometimes hard) in a few places. Sometimes the tone slipped into being a little too cartoonish and probably wont sit well with some of the more grown up viewers. When all is said and done my best advice to people is to go into this movie with all bias left at the door and i believe they will be surprised with what they find.P.S. To all of you woman hating men out there, JUST STOP TALKING! You're giving the rest of us a bad name!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw it opening night and really enjoyed myself! It was funny and a little spooky and fast-paced. I was already a fan of Melissa McCarthy, but now I'm a fan of Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones too! Kate McKinnon's character was probably the most fun to watch: super sassy and a little flirty and smart. I actually like this better than the original Ghostbusters for a few reasons: less sexist, better effects, and starring women and written with women in mind. Although my husband who saw the film with me enjoyed it too and thought it on par with the old film (that he is a huge fan of)! I wish the (rather sexist) troll hordes hadn't been so successful in scaring people away from the film; the theater was rather empty when I went opening night : (</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't believe all the hate! I enjoyed movie tremendously!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this in 2D last night with a half full theater showing. Several of the jokes and interactions had me laughing in hysterics, and I heard quite a bit of laughter from surrounding movie crowd. This felt very different then the original Ghostbuster movies ( which I admittedly haven't seen in years.) But I felt like it paid homage to the original while creating its own movie that can stand by itself. Other than the actress who played Patty, I thought the chemistry and humor between the other 3 leading ladies was excellent. Being a fan of Paul Feig's comedy already, I especially loved seeing actors from some of his other work pop up... Namely Other Space. I understand that not everybody is going to like everything... And that many are "purists" who dislike sequels or reboots that stray too far from the source material... But for me, this was a delightfully fun movie that I did not regret spending money on to see in the theater. To call it terrible or the worst garbage ever just feels melodramatic to me. I was entertained throughout the entire movie And would tune in if ever there were a sequel with this cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't get the hate. This was one fun movie! I laughed out loud many times at the lines, the cast was fabulous and a fun ride ridding NYC of those pesky Ghosts. It was different enough from the original, yet had the same fun feel. Loved the cameos from the original cast too. Its a movie about Ghostsbusting, not a Shakespearean tragedy.I went with my family, we all laughed...I do think the first half of the movie was the best. Its a silly movie and we had fun. I checked my preconceived notions at the ticket window and went in hoping for the best, and it was better than I expected.Sure the original movie is a classic and can't be beat, but I teared up as the credits rolled and the movie was dedicated to Harold Ramis...he would be proud I think. Its a fun ride, so just enjoy it for what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ghostbusters reboot was exactly the kind of lighthearted fun I want in a summer flick. I really enjoyed it and have seen a number of posts on Facebook from friends both male and female who saw it and really liked it, too. There were so many laugh out loud funny moments. The "meta" moments were really fun, too, such as the nods to the original Ghostbusters and some of the jabs taken at, shall we say, the haters. I want to watch the original again so I can re-watch the reboot and see what I might have missed the first time around. I also particularly enjoyed Kate McKinnon and her deadpan deliveries. The closing credits were also a lot of fun. Make sure you stick around for the added scene that comes after the credits!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly pleasant reboot of the popular 80s franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the success of the 1984 hit 'Ghostbusters' and its sequel, a third installment was a must. However, the third entry spent years and years in development hell and has the years passed, fans everywhere grew skeptical that they would ever see Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis battling against paranormal entities again. Unfortunately, Murray and Aykroyd both declined on reprising their roles and Harold Ramis passed in 2014. By this time, the franchise was just about dead. That is until Paul Feig stepped in as director casting an all-new cast of Melissa McCarthy, Kristin Wiig, Kate McKinnon, and Leslie Jones in what was no longer a second sequel but a reboot to the franchise. Upon release of the first trailer, the marketing of this film was met with overwhelmingly negative reception by the public, mainly criticizing the female casting of the main protagonists. But does this mark a valid reason for this film's hate? Definitely not. Following a paranormal invasion inside an ancient mansion, this film stars Kristin Wiig as Erin Gilbert, a Columbia University physics professor who's become a laughing stock by her colleagues when they discover her old book online about her paranormal encounters. Upon investigating an old mansion with her old friends Abby Yates (played by Melissa McCarthy) and Jillian Holtzmann (played by Kate McKinnon), the trio discovers a ghost which leads to them creating their team known as "Ghostbusters". Adding subway station worker Patty Tolan (played by Leslie Jones) to the team, this women are pitted in an off-the-rails battle against the paranormal that threaten to destroy the city of Manhattan.Like most reboots and remakes, this movie had only small chance of living up to the standards of the 1984 original and an even slimmer chance of surpassing the original. This doesn't mean however, that the film can't be fun and please fans everywhere. While the absence of Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, and Harold Ramis and their comedic charm may feel like a burden to the film, the new cast surprisingly manages to make up for this. Though their efforts on bringing in laughs are hit-and-miss at times, there is a fair amount of laughter and appeal to be experienced. Kristin Wiig who's working with director Paul Feig for the second time after the hit comedy 'Bridesmaids', delivers a few funny moments is fine in her role but as great as Melissa McCarthy who obliges the most humorous moment throughout the film. Leslie Jones is also occasionally funny here, though most of her jokes do not quite land. Kate McKinnon is not bad, but isn't given a whole lot to work with here other than babbling about scientific material. Playing the absent-minded team's secretary is Chris Hemsworth who occasionally offers some fine comic relief, even the portrayal of his character gets a bit silly. The film's best scenes lie during the action sequences featuring the ghost entities are fun, if a little over-the-top to watch. The ghost are brought to life in gleaming CGI that give the paranormal freaks a decent look, though can be frightening for the youngsters.Ghostbusters is a surprisingly pleasant and successful attempt on rebooting the popular 80s franchise. While the humor can get a bit silly and dumbfounded in some places, the movie is fun to watch and delivers some hilarious goods the midst of its flaws. This is not film worth skipping in response to the negative reception by the public for the female- dominated cast as this film does not promote sexism as many viewers unfairly claims it does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why so much misogynistic hate ???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why has there been so much misogynistic hate lately, and for this movie in particular? I saw how the trailers for this movie were brutally slammed and, like I do most of the time, decided to form my own opinion after seeing the movie. I went with my father and my wife this past weekend and found it quite enjoyable. All three of us were laughing wholeheartedly throughout most of the movie. I enjoyed the fact that it wasn't a straight redo of the original 1984 classic and tend to think of it as an alternate universe version of the Ghostbusters. Loved the cameo appearances by almost all of the major characters from the original. Found most of the movie to be quite humorous. About the only thing that I didn't enjoy was just how idiotic they decided to make Chris Hemsworth's character Kevin. So far, I have to say that Holtzmann has got to be my favorite character - there's just something about her over-the- top insane genius mad scientist that I love.Is it as good as the original? In my humble opinion - no but pretty close. A good part of the humor of this movie relies on callbacks to the original movie itself and without the original, it would fall a little flat. A remake like this needs to pander a little to the fans of the original. Does that make it a bad movie? No, it doesn't.Long story short - don't listen to the hate. Go see this movie and form your own opinions. I did so and found it quite enjoyable and amusing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally, I loved the movie. Female characters were hard to come by in action movies, and usually take a role resembling the role of Kevin, the receptionist- a dumb blond that exists as eye-candy- and it was refreshing to see four female comedians as the protagonists in the movie. While I would love an original movie like this, the reboot was still awesome.One of the biggest complaints I see is that this movie is 'sexist', mostly posted by men, which is honestly laughable. As someone who has studied systems of oppression and societal power dynamics, hearing men call a movie sexist towards them because there were few male characters is just funny. While I'm a feminist, I'm not a radical feminist, as the naysayers are saying most people who support the film are.When I went to see Ghostbusters, almost every seat was filled, and about half the audience clapped when it was over. Despite claims of poorly executed humor, most of the audience at my showing clearly enjoyed it and the theater was filled with laughter.As a woman, watching four strong, intelligent women being the heroes of the movie was so refreshing. While I do love action and superhero movies, I've been longing for one with female leads and Ghostbusters finally gave that to me and others who've been hoping for the same.</fullReview>

The others all did a likewise good job each one created a quirky and likable character. I definitely recommend this movie as fun light entertainment and a bit of a nostalgia fest, do stay through the credits too if you want to see some more cute Chris Hemsworth.

		<fullReview>I just watched this and enjoyed it for what it's worth. Don't believe the crappy - worst-ever - reviews that have been posted here. Even if it were bad, a 1 is completely out of line. I challenge those who have posted such low reviews to explain the difference between a movie with a 1/10 vs 4/10. Good luck!If you want to criticize a movie, go and watch Evolution which also has suspicious ties to what could have been (apparently) Ghostbusters 3 but was rewritten with an all new cast, and the ghosts were turned into aliens. I recall it was truly a terrible movie and even it has 6/10 on IMDb.In any case, if you're a fan of anyone involved in this movie or Ghostbusters in general, you have some laughs.Just sit back, relax, and enjoy the show. Don't take it so seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me preface this review by stating, that I have IBS. For anyone that doesn't know what IBS is, it stands for irritable bowel syndrome. It is a very serious syndrome that causes the bowels to be, lets just say, extra busy.The new Ghostbusters did nothing but cause my IBS to go into full effect. Full of, in my opinion and fact, accomplished actors, this was a film that took its actors and demolished their acting with a gross misuse of visual effects. There is a grand epidemic today of using visual effects way beyond the means of the film, putting special effects in the dust, in the worst way possible. In my opinion, the older ghost busters was only so lovable because it let the quirky acting shine, along with a good use of special effects.Needless to say, because of my IBS(irritable bowel syndrome) and my malcontent with this movie, I will not be wearing my favorite slacks, anymore.-Henry</fullReview>

There was only a couple things in the movie that could possibly make you chuckle and all of those parts are in thetrailers but that is really about it. Also they only busted one ghost until the very end. But I do have to say the production and special-effects are amazing in this movie and I like the small changes to the jumpsuits, but the special-effects is the only reason I didn't give it a one star rating. I should have trusted my first response to the trailer and stayed far away from this movie, destroyed the ghost busters entirely! If you loved the older films just re watch them. But If you want to waist 2 hours of your life on this go ahead but take mine and this movies 5.4 review as a warning.</fullReview>

Oh yeah, every single negative review you have read is 100% accurate.But you can boil it all down to one simple word... BORING! Of all of the actresses/actors, I think Kate McKinnon would have to be the closest to "entertaining" but that still didn't make the performance any good. This has got to be one of the biggest pieces of garbage I have ever seen, and this is a list that includes Home Alone, George of the Jungle, Scooby-Doo and Catwoman. I am going to break with all the others and say definitely watch it. Don't freakin' pay for it, but watch it.

		<fullReview>Where do I start?The main cast's acting was poor. The effects were okay, but the art style was an eye sore. Was not funny, I only ever grinned at Chris Hemsworth (who was the only relatively funny thing about the movie). And don't get me started on the Fall out Boy version of the original theme.The movie fails at both a Ghostbusters movie and a comedy, lacking any original ideas and appearing very similar to the original movie in terms of the events that take place Some examples:One of the main characters (Bill Murray/Kristen Wiig) loses their job They go to an old building (library/mansion) to find a ghost, which jump scares them. They catch a ghost in a public place (hotel/concert), which causes them to gain a lot of attention and people start to take them seriously A black, non-scientist character (Ernie Hudson/Leslie Jones) joins them They get in trouble with the government and as soon as the ghosts start attacking, they are freed and then they save New York.The only reason I give a 2 is for both Chris Hemsworth and Charles Dance, although he only appeared briefly, he is a great actor and should have had a much larger role. The original cast's cameos were decent enough, although they were probably done just to make more fans interested in the movie.The best course of action would be to forget this movie exists, move on and pray that a sequel is not made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I disliked the notion of a Ghostbusters reboot first hand. Even BEFORE Paul Feig was chosen as a director. I disliked that he was chosen, since right out of the bat, he said he was disregarding the original movie and the characters and making it his own thing. (and gender-bending because "reasons".)Then began the Gender politics crap.So, the movie. It had ALL the signs of a massive train-wreck, but somehow the movie managed to step up above massive train-wreck. It's watchable, but not good. -Forced Humor. Didn't laugh at all with this "Comedy" The closest thing to a laugh were a few chuckles on a few Kevin scenes. It felt like a bad parody than Ghostbusters. -Forced References to the far more better Ghostbusters movie. they kinda derailed the movie. -2D Characters: The Straightwoman, the Fat One, the Obnoxiously loud Black One, the "quirky" one. There was no real chemistry between them.-forced "Feminist Propaganda" felt out of place. The infamous Patty Scene, the jab at the Youtube comments, Shooting a male ghost in the groin. Men being evil or idiots. (Rewatch the movie and picture the cast as male. It'll be extremely sexist!)In the hands of a much more competent writer and director, (and maybe a better cast by removing Jones and McCarthy) we could have gotten a far more better movie. (That would have still gotten hate because reboot) What we got was a mess trying to serve too many masters (GB fans, "feminists", etc.) and not pleasing anyone. Shame that the new " GB Cinematic Universe" is based on this mediocre reboot.</fullReview>

It had a great opening and an interesting plot, but did have a lull in the second half. There was a part of the movie that didn't make sense until I saw the end credits sequence, so editing did chop some detail. There was a lot of brightly colored CGI, but that is to be expected. I wished there was more one on one ghost discovery. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would watch it again. I truly hope there is a sequel!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are little spoilers throughout this review -- YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.When the "controversy" is all said and done, the movie is not bad as bad as the naysayers would want you to believe (ONE star? Are you kidding?! C'mon! It's not THAT bad!). It was a bit sluggish at parts and not all jokes hit bullseye... BUT it was enjoyable enough of the time. I didn't mind the CGI because that was never the main focus to begin with(as far as GB movies go). This movie FEELS like a GBs movie. Main Cons:-The pacing could've been better, like I said. Felt like some scenes were left out just for time.-Not much development from the main two leads (Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig's characters more specifically). Could've had more scenes for those characters to reconnect.-Mistreatment of characters: I will KIND'A agree that most of the male characters (minor or otherwise) are presented as jerks or are idiots... or both (this is a 22-year-old woman pointing this out; mind you). -The marketing and backlash handling was bad... And that's what ruins the movie for most other people. The first trailers come out and BOOM people hated it. And then starts the uproar of tumblr feminists overreacting (as usual) to the hate. Which gets the cast and crew involved in the drama and did NOT make the situation, in any way, better...Main Pros: -The characters were different but good enough on their own. Holtz, Patty, and Kevin steal the show. Holtz is a quirky scientist who has a bizarre sense of humor and the main inventor of the GB's tech. Patty is our new Winston but even more helpful. She knows New York City inside and out and knows the history of it as well, which was a really good move character and story wise. She was also very funny. Kevin is a dumb but lovable new receptionist of the GB's HQ. And is only there to look pretty and get kidnapped (i.e by possession). Which would be negative for most people, but I just find it hilarious. -The story is its own(and should be judged as such). This is a reboot but not a word-for-word one. And it tries to have its own story. There is no sense of any character wanting to become a GB for money or fame(the closest thing would be recognized as NOT being crazy), just a straightforward pursuit for knowledge. And in doing so, a mystery unravels. An evil plot to engulf the city with ghosts is revealed. Characters are reunited and some are introduced. I like the ending. When all the characters are on the roof seeing the city's appreciation for saving them. I hope that in the sequel, it won't come down to "Oh! We caused a lot of damage to the city in first one so now we're hated again"(which really made no sense in the original 2nd film, to be honest).My finishing thoughts: I liked it. It was an OK movie. Just that. There are problems sure, but those mostly stem from before the movie was released. I ask you please, DO NOT buy into the social media drama surrounding the movie. See it for yourself and make your OWN judgments about the movie. Thanks for reading. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ghostbusters (2016) Director: Paul Feig Writers: Katie Dippold, Paul Fig Star: Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, Chris HemsworthDidn't really want to go and see this film as loved the original and thought this reboot would be a disaster, but there was nothing else showing on our usual Thursday night cinema trip so decided to risk it, it was better than I thought it would be quite funny in places and watchable. The story sets up with Paranormal Enthusiasts Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) and Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy) joining forces to fight a ghost invasion of Mantattan. And that's about it for plot really! Chris Hemsworth is hired as the receptionist and plays a very thick, dumb blond, hired solely for his looks as Kristen Wiig drools over him, funny in places but a bit OTT, appreciated by the females in the audience. Melissa McCarthy plays herself as usual but less over the top than usual, more likable. Kate McKinnon plays the Kooky Nuclear engineer member of the team, funny occasionally but a bit wearing after a while. Cameos by original cast disappointing, Bill Murray looks about 100 years old. Verdict: I've Seen a lot of bad reviews for this film but providing you leave your brain behind I thought it was generally quite funny and enjoyed it, don't know why everyone slates the CGI I thought it was good. Five Chappers out of Ten.</fullReview>

The back-story of how they became friends was nice, but there wasn't anything else.Abby was using the same joke over and over again about a take-away food. Melissa can be funny, in some parts, but I just saw the same characters she plays in Bridesmaids, Tammy and Spy.Erin is trying way too hard to be funny. That's all I can say, she's too boring.Holtzmann was the best character of the film, she's cool, awesome and bad-ass.Paddy is just an African-American racist stereotype, always shouting and getting mad. Kevin is worst part of the film. Too unrealistically stupid. Chris Hemsworth is a great actor, but his acting was appalling.Most of the male characters are either dumb or jerks. The main villain is boring, and also a cliché.Ecto?1 and the Proton-Packs are probably the best part of the film. I love the weapons so much.The cameos was just a shoe-horned in there.It isn't an awful movie, but it was bit too tame. I think they should've done more risks in this movie.

Don't hate on the film before you have seen it because you don't like the cast. Yes it is different from the original, it's thirty-two years on.

		<fullReview>Dr. Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) doesn't believe in the existence of paranormal anymore, even though she wrote a guide to it in the past with her ex-colleague Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy). Yet, when she witnesses a full fledged stage 4 apparition her beliefs are changed once more and with the help of Yates, Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon) and Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones), founds a team to fight ghosts who are rampaging through the city.Paul Feig is a comedy master. He is the mind behind "Freaks and Geeks", "Bridesmaids" and "Spy" which makes him an instant check out for me. The way he weaves comedy through character is something not many directors in his camp have achieved to his effect, so of course when you go out to check his new film there are always high expectations no matter what. "Ghostbusters", whilst far from being any kind of disaster, has a good sense of humor that does not quite translate into the flow of endless laughter it thinks it is, nor the kind of which we are used to with Feig.I am going to say right up front that I am no kind of big "Ghostbuster" (1984) enthusiast. I saw the film once, liked it and for me it ended there. All I wanted from this new iteration was a good film with laughs, I couldn't care less of anything surrounding that. Fortunately, that is exactly where the film is good. It just another comedy film and that is what its trying to be. Whereas it may fall apart in its plot and third act, the cast is killer and the laughs which are present are really good.For me the couple that made the film was Chirs Hemsowrth and Kate McKinnon. No sh*t they just had to be on screen for my attention to be sparked and for me to start laughing. That is definitely due to the fact that they both have two amazing, scene stealing characters to work with. They made me laugh so hard because they were written so brilliantly. This is really Feig's tact for comedy coming alive in the best way. There gags were hilarious, they just had to say a word or make a move and it made sense to laugh for me, that is really remarkable.Not that their costars aren't doing a good job too, they actually all have their moments, yet being written slightly thinner they didn't emerge or stay with me as much as the best two. And that is where a lot of the film fell apart for me. It simply resulted way too forgettable. The third act had no impact on me, I wasn't feeling anything, it just came to be this by the numbers resolution that had no character to it. What up to that point was a quite entertaining comedy with only little flaws, became a huge on screen mess of which I can hardly remember anything.This was certainly for Feig a very, very hard task and it turned out to be a bad day at the office, and for a movie like this to come out of that is saying something about him: he doesn't deliver what we might expect, but sparks of his brilliance still manage to make it through a produce what is a more than decent comedy effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as a lot of people make it out to be - but nothing more than that!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I think that a lot of the negative reviews here are very biased against this movie. Sure, it's a reboot that didn't live up to the original but I can't think of a single one that did. My friend dragged me into the cinema to see this film and I tried to be as unprejudiced as possible. I don't normally watch these kinds of movies with comedy actresses like Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig because they're all kind of bland and filled with the same jokes over and over again. Same with this film. If you go in there expecting nothing more than a mediocre comedy then you certainly won't be disappointed, however, if you're expecting something nearly as good as the originals then I suggest that you just re-watch those because you'll probably have a better time! I think that a lot of the 1/10 reviews on here come from all the stuff that people were saying before this movie even came out which caused people to form an opinion before even seeing it. In conclusion, I feel like this is one of those films that you'll watch on an airplane while only paying half attention to it and maybe get a few chuckles out of it. I definitely regret spending money on a cinema ticket to see this though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, but overdone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When my 6 yr old daughter saw the trailer, she instantly wanted to see the movie. It's nice what they did, make an all girl cast. I didn't go into this movie as a naysayer or hater. Kristen was stiff. Melissa McCarthy plays the same character in every movie. She over acts, and it gets old and made some of the parts of the movie stale and boring. And not surprisingly it had some inappropriate gestures and words I didn't appreciate for my 6 year old. That's my fault. Considering who's all in it. The standout stars to me, were Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones. Their comedy was natural, organic, and they didn't overdo it. It was refreshing to see Hemsworth as a dimwit, but he was annoying as heck lol. It was still a fun film, but not a huge hit. Stay tuned to the very end of the credits!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Objective Review of "Ghostbusters"- Highly flawed but VERY fun and enjoyable thanks to a wonderful cast. Undeserving of its venomous pre-release hatred.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's an interesting experience writing a review while knowing ahead of time that within a day of posting, it's probably going to be trashed and down-voted into oblivion by people who not only won't bother to read it, but likely haven't even bothered to see the film that it's discussing because everyone had already made up their minds about whether they'd like it or not before it was even released.But such things are unfortunately to be expected when trying to give a fair, objective and unbiased analysis of what has shockingly become the most controversial film of the year. Something that frankly, I couldn't have imagined happening when the film was initially first announced just a few short years ago. Who'd have though that such a beloved franchise as "Ghostbusters"- one that has brought legions of fans together for decades- would then cause the world of the internet to tear itself apart in a flurried frenzy of hatred and dismissal from so many people before a single page had even been written?But beyond the hyperbole and debate... beyond the savage attacks and desperate defense... beyond the spewing venom and the attempts at vindication... there's the bottom line question: Is the film any good?... ... ...yeah. It's pretty good. Not great or anything, but pretty good.Now, before you sharpen your pitchforks, hear me out! It's not a perfect film by any means, and it has a lot of problems. But is it really that hard to accept that perhaps people judged this film a wee-bit too harshly before its release?Years after Dr.'s Erin Gilbert and Abby Yates write a failure of a book trying to prove the existence of ghosts and supernatural activity, they re-unite and join the eccentric Dr. Holtzman in a ghost-hunt as part of a deal with one-another. After a video of their investigation goes viral, they are laughed out of their academic positions, but resolve to continue their research. Joining with New York Subway worker Patty Tolan, they form a paranormal-investigation company and are able to develop the technology to successfully capture and contain malevolent spirits. Now known as the "Ghostbusters", the group finds some measure of success despite many considering them nothing but frauds. At the same time, deranged social-misfit Rowan North attempts to use his own personally- developed technology to summon forth a supernatural apocalypse in order to get revenge for a lifetime of being bullied and ignored, and the Ghostbusters must go an an adventure to stop him at all costs.First thing's first, the film does have a handful of problems that hold it back, and I'd like to address those up-front. The film's first half feels a bit problematic, containing just a few too many hit-and-miss jokes and meandering a bit too much while trying to establish the story and characters. And the pacing on the whole is very wonky throughout. And this is a problem I think is reflective of many recent Sony releases- you can tell that a number of key- scenes have been left on the cutting-room floor for timing and pacing reasons. Same thing happened with their first "Amazing Spider-Man", and it can be a bit distracting. There's also a bit too much... slime for my taste, but thankfully that's reigned in quite a bit in the film's second half.But I'd be lying if I said those problems aren't easily trumped by the absolutely wonderful cast and very good visual direction courtesy Paul Feig.You see, when it comes to comedy, there's something very important that can make-or-break a film. And that's how charming its characters are and how good the cast's chemistry is. And my god, these characters are charming as hell and the cast have an absolutely wonderful chemistry. All four of our leads form a great, competent team. Kristen Wiig grounds everything perfectly as our lead, Melissa McCarthy is hilarious and serves as the beating heart of everything, Leslie Jones surprises with much more complexity than the trailers might have lead viewers to believe and Kate McKinnon is a revelation as the quirky but lovable weirdo that is Dr. Holtzman.Even when the plotting feels basic and the humor falls flat on occasion, they are able to keep the you fully invested, and you can't help but root for them to overcome the odds and save the day. Great cast.And Paul Feig's visual direction is top-notch. Very reminiscent of original director Ivan Reitman's first film, with enough confidence in his actors run wild, while also giving the movie just enough of a visual identity to be stylish without being distracting from the proceedings. Very good job.The music is also a lot of fun (save for that Fall Out Boy cover which we thankfully really only hear a little bit), the cinematography is gorgeous, the effects are quirky and have an old- fashioned "Haunted Mansion" vibe, the production design is top-notch. And even the 3D wasn't too bad or distracting. (They did the right thing and really only used it to add depth and occasionally make the proton-beams look like they're leaping off the screen.)Look, this film is going to continue to be hated and dismissed, no matter what. Which is a shame because it really doesn't deserve it. It's solid fun and while it never quite manages to measure up to the classic original (I'd rank it on-par with "Ghostbusters II", which I found similarly enjoyable but flawed), it still is a great time at the movies for audiences who are willing to give it a chance.I give "Ghostbusters" 2016 a solid 7 out of 10. And before you come looking for me for daring to give it a decent review, just know... I'll be changing my name and moving countries before any of you can find me. (Just kidding.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wait until it comes out on DVD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first review - sorry, a bit poorly written:A little background about me: I'm a woman, I have a daughter, and I went to see this movie on "principle". I like the idea of my daughter having strong women to look up to on screen, and I wanted to support this. I very rarely go to movie theaters, unless it's something that I feel MUST be seen in theaters (i.e. Star Wars).All that said, the movie was okay. Probably will not watch it again, but I didn't hate it. It had some laughs (less than I was expecting, maybe some jokes flew over my head). My 7 year old, who was terrified at some scenes and wanted to walk out at one point - eventually got used to it and actually enjoyed the climax, ending - which in her words , were "even scarier". I had high hopes because of Wiig/McCarthy - and I did find that McCarthy was much more tolerable in this film compared to previous. (I like her, but sometimes she can be a bit over the top). That said, the movie was a bit "meh" in the comedy department for me.I can't even remember the characters names, I realized afterward, which is odd. My daughter and I both enjoyed "the one with the goggles" - she was pretty funny.I did not enjoy what they did with the dumb receptionist. That was over-the-top. I think they would have made more of a point with making him competent and doing his job, but I realize they would have lost some cheap jokes that way (which I didn't find very funny). They were also pushing the, these women are super smart scientists, while throwing around huge non-nonsensical words, but it felt a bit manufactured to me. My daughter did leave the theatre saying she wanted to be a scientist like the one with the goggles, which is a win, but she was already interested in science so I can't attribute all of that to the movie.So - I wasn't totally thrilled that I forked over a small fortune to see this in 3D (I was expecting better), but my daughter enjoyed it so all is not lost.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly, I don't get where all the hate for this movie comes from. Is it because they touched your beloved franchise? Just get over it, this isn't the same movie. This movie was full of Easter eggs which is pretty amusing when you're familiar with the original franchise, but it's also fun to watch when you have no clue what you're getting into. Of course you shouldn't be expecting a movie with a lot of depth or complex story lines, this is a comedy! Sure, I wouldn't have mind if it was a little scarier like the originals but i think that's the point of this movie. They made it for everyone to enjoy. I wasn't sure what to expect of the all female cast either, but they really did a great job. So if you're looking for a fun movie and you're not really a film critic, i'm pretty sure you will enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lots and lots of laughs. My brother and I both have been fans of the films and loved this reboot. We still use quotes from the film and crack up every time. It was full of nostalgia for the fans but with new twists that give it a fresh take. Sure some jokes fell flat but nothing that ruins the fun. Seeing it in 3D was awesome, but the poor souls in the theater probably jumped due to my shrieks. I even yelled, "Stop it!" Lol. #ImTotallyAfraidOfGhosts I'm not quite sure where all the hate is coming from for this film. Most of the reviews from users on here that I've read claim it somehow is a "man-hating" film, which is not the case at all. It has female leads and I guess that threatens quite a lot of people. My brother is not a "chick-flick" guy in the least and is not in any way a feminist. For him to thoroughly enjoy this film too says a lot.</fullReview>

An American comedy that not only has a stellar cast of SNL alumnae but attached is Paul Feig who understands the potential of women on screen. No love interest except a reversal of sexy secretary these intelligent women bust ghosts using awesome weapons hearkening back to the original. There is slime, ghosts and laughs. It makes for an enjoyable night and although some have unfairly criticised the movie and canon of female friendly films encroaching on a male dominated area of film they can jog on. Hopefully a broader range of films will be made to be a mirror to the rich tapestry of diverse Audience. Viva la revolution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film wasn't made for the entitled male audience; for the ones who think they deserve everything simply because they are assigned as male from birth. This movie isn't made for the men who claim they love women, yet get upset when they want to recreate a movie so that they can enjoy it and see themselves as heroes. This movie is for the people who want to see themselves in a nice light; where they can see that girls can do STEM, make stupid jokes, and even though they may be underdogs people will appreciate them someday. It stayed true to the original films, the ghosts looked like the ones from the previous, so I don't know why people are complaining there. (Yes I do). It had great cameos, and great actresses as well! I love this movie and am buying it as soon as it goes out on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pandering to MEEEEEE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>so I think every movie is pandering to someone, and that someone is usually straight white dudes. If women like it, it is because they can identify with something they see on the screen - a character, a feeling, a scenario - and the same is probably true for other minorities who are not routinely cast in anything but crowd scenes, bit parts or supporting roles.This movie contained four (FOUR!!) women (three of them over 40! NOT smooth, untried infants) working as a team to find and stop ghosts. The city government had women in it (and it seemed like they were the real power). The first responders; cops, fire, ambulance workers, all had women in their ranks. The most visible males were the worst kind of dudes; the pretty but appallingly dumb, the one who thinks the world owes him love, kisses and power, and a handful of other stereotypes that women everywhere have encountered.The women were capable. Not one was required to teach any dude how to save the world, instead they shared their knowledge, pooled their resources, and saved the world themselves. And then agreed to keep it on the down low and let dudes take the credit for it. which sucked - they should have gotten a parade out of that, but yeah, that happens too.I thought it was hilarious that the arch villain was clearly a Mens Rights, Pick-up Artist, reddit reading, cellar dwelling dude, and that seems to be the demographic that are slamming this movie the hardest.The whole movie made me laugh out loud. It made my kids laugh out loud. It made my husband amused. It was not really aiming at him.I've been encouraging my friends to see it, because they are either squarely in this movie's demographic, or are enlightened enough that watching women save the world will not be intimidating for them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Second Favorite Ghostbusters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watch the original Ghostbusters on a somewhat monthly basis. It, along with the original Die Hard, is my favorite movie. I put that aside coming into this movie.This movie is fun. SPOILERSCharacters: The main two, Melissa and Kristin, are fine with what they have. Their story really dominates the movie and I don't feel enough was done with it to warrant that end movie save that we got. I get why Kristin jumped in, but it was missing the umph that I think they wanted. The movie focused more on the group than it did the two of them. It worked for the overall movie, but the emotional beat they went to at the end fell flat for me since more time wasn't dedicated to these two. Kristin, though, plays a great straight woman to Melissa's almost over the top character. I enjoyed both in this movie. The standout for me was Leslie. She owned her role as an everyday person. She proved that book smarts aren't all that is necessary to survive. Her portrayal of Patty was great but I feel that she really didn't have a big moment like the other three characters did. She started to have one towards the end, but then she got smacked down and it was over. Kate was the character that had me going and turned me off almost simultaneously. I loved her character and how zany it was but Kate constantly looking into the camera took me out of the movie. It reminded me of SNL when she waits for the laugh. That said, she has one of the best action scenes in the movie when she pulls out her dual pistol proton guns. I absolutely loved everything about that scene. From then on (granted it was maybe 15 minutes) she could do no wrong. People are mad that the original cast didn't come back in their original roles. This wasn't an issue for me. This movie wasn't about being the original. (More on that later) The roles that each actor/actress had were great and fit with what the movie was.The Call-BacksFor the most part, the call-backs worked for me. We got a bust of Harold Ramis. Bill Murray is a skeptic of all things paranormal (and was probably the best of the cameos). Dan Aykroyd was a cab driver who drops the line "I ain't afraid of no ghosts". Ernie Hudson was Leslie's uncle. Annie Potts was a great hotel manager (probably my second favorite cameo). The Ozzie cameo felt out of place and completely unnecessary. The Slimer ghost was a reference to John Belushi which fell flat for me in this movie. Having Slimer joyriding around with his woman Slimer and a band of ghosts just didn't do it for me. It was there for the same reason that "cross the streams" was there in the original: they needed a way to win. My problem is that "cross the streams" will always be classic while "shoot for the silver canisters" is easily forgotten. The first ghost is a call-back to the librarian from the first movie and I absolutely loved it. More later. I loved the cameo that StayPuft had. Haters gonna hate, but that cameo was well done. I really don't want to ruin it. That said, the defeat of StayPuft was disappointing just from a "how did she get there so fast" point of view. Finally, there were small nods in the dialogue to the first two movies. These were blink and you would miss it moments, but they made the movie a bit more enjoyable for me.GhostsFor the most part, the ghosts were well done. I was worried since the trailers made the ghosts out to be something from Disney. The ghosts weren't entirely frightening, but they were well done. The first ghost, the woman in the house, was probably my favorite. She was a call back to the librarian from Ghostbusters and it worked. She was spooky and she was vicious. As I said, Slimer didn't do much for me. He wasn't the only one, though. The second major ghost was a dragon thing. It started off well enough with a mannequin following Leslie around, but the dragon ghost just didn't do anything for me. All of the non-human-esque ghosts were a let down in this movie. It made the movie feel more like the cartoon than a live action movie. The final ghost (the one who was misconstrued for the StayPuft and also the one who people complain gets shot in the junk) was a bit too over the top for me. The big bad is the ghost from the Ghostbusters' logo. It's an interesting idea, but I felt that this ghost and the whole finale were just too big for what the rest of the movie was. Yes, this ghost gets shot in the junk with proton blasts. No, it does not ruin the movie.StoryThe story was a bit too light for me. There are two main stories: 1. Melissa and Kristin's strained relationship and 2. The person trying to open the rift between our world and the next world. The idea for the antagonist is good, but it is not played out well at all. With all of the ghostbusting, both stories seem to take a back seat. I never really felt animosity between Melissa and Kristin and I never really felt scared that anything bad was actually going to happen. Everything else in this movie would be an 8 from me, but the story kind of dragged it down. The story had its funny beats, though. I won't ruin any of the jokes here but I will say that the trailers didn't show anything that this movie actually has. It is not as good as the first, but it is so far beyond anything the second could offer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie isn't really a 10, but somehow we have to average things out to bring it up to a 7 where it belongs. It strikes me that there aren't that many movies being made like this these days: a weird mash up of the '80s and today. The cheesy special effects give it a childish feel, right alongside queef jokes and some legit stunt choreography, all of which really worked for me. This team of protagonists are by turns goofy, brilliant, tender, and kickass... because people aren't one-dimensional and our heroes shouldn't be either. The editing did feel a bit clumsy to me at times; it seemed as if a lot of content had been cut and I'd love to see an extended version! I'm sure this cast of comedians was riffing the hell out of that script and that sounds like a great time to me. And yes, I want to see better representation of complex female characters in entertainment. This will make the world better and will continue to cause some strife along the way. So don't mind the haters, leave 'em in the dust. Solid laughs, solid characters, solid nods to the classic. Forget all the bs and enjoy yourself.</fullReview>

Patty's work in the train station might be boring, but she's still cheerful about it. Erin is ambitious, but she loves her friendship and she does things to prove people that she can do things much better. Jillian is crazy (and hot). While Abby is strongwilled woman. They're such amazing characters with their quirks and flaws. They're the kind of women for little girls to look up to.Chris Hemsworth as eyecandy though. That, is how women usually treated in movies.

The original movie was a masterpiece compared to this feeble attempt at a remake. All the special effects were unspectacular, acting was mediocre and even the villain was hard to believe. I was looking forward to watching the talented cast in this movie but their talents were wasted throughout the entire movie and Melissa McCarthy even had a hard time pronouncing all the scientific buzz words. Classic movies like these should be left alone in their original form. After watching this terrible film, I am now undecided om whether to watch the next Bourne and Star Trek movies.</fullReview>

In my personal ranking of Paul Feig comedies I'd probably order it The Heat &lt; Ghostbusters &lt; Bridesmaids &lt; Spy. Was this, as other reviewers have likened it to, a man-hating monstrosity? No. Far from it. Do I think this movie would have been improved if it cast, I don't know, Chris Pratt, Anthony Mackie, Paul Rudd, and Miles Teller? Maybe... but certainly not definitely.I'm glad this version of Ghostbusters exists and Sony had the guts to risk rebooting such an (apparently) cherished property with women. I find it really really sad how many men have taken to trying to tank this movie's IMDb rating / wider perception out of spite and I sincerely hope the smear campaign doesn't prevent other studios from making more "daring" casting choices in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an average to marginally above average movie. Melissa McCarthy is hit or miss for me, but she does well here. Kristen Wiig is always good, McKinnon and Jones both shine and Chris Hemsworth delivers as well. Everyone makes the best of the given material, which is not always great. The banter is good, but the characters can be one-note. Hemsworth is dumb, we get it. He has a few really funny lines, but "dumb" is his entire character. Jones has the same one-note problem. McKinnon was my favorite, she brought a sort of Bill Murray quality of not taking the plot seriously. Overall I LOVE that they had an all female cast for a summer action-comedy and I think they got the right actresses for it. However, the overall plot left something to be desired. I would have liked them to explore the main villain a bit more. I get that the joke is that he's a whiny, entitled guy but it would have liked to see him really overreact to rejection. They also don't really bust a lot of ghosts in this movie. They catch maybe one before the climax. So like I said, the acting and line-to-line dialogue was good but the overall writing doesn't really stick. It's entertaining. Don't listen to the original Ghostbusters fanboys who dedicated their time to destroying this movies IMDb rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very funny movie with funny people but not as classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First lets get one thing out of the way. When I first heard they were rebooting Ghostbusters I was disappointed, One we weren't getting a third Ghostbusters movie though many can say the video game that came out in 2009 was the actual sequel, and with the passing of Harold Ramis shortly after all hopes for a third sequel were gone. Then of course there was news swirling round that there was reboot incoming there were so many rumours like Jack Black being named as one of the people who'd star and more. Finally we got confirmation that it would be an all Girl cast of Ghotstbusters, the internet freaked out.Now fast forward we've seen trailers and clips and much more and yet people still seem mad, and looking through the IMDb section as of release of this movie people seem to be calling it sexist, awful, horrible, giving it 1/10 with no validity at least in my opinion. Lets get one thing straight this is not the Ghostbusters we knew and grew up with as much as we'd love it to be, and yes it all an all female cast.... which makes me ask those who claimed as being sexist, exactly how so? We live in an age now that women should be respected and looked at as equal not inferior, and in an age where we fight for equality I ask those who have called this movie sexist exactly how?The movie itself has some very funny moments, for one the 3D is top notch and I am usually not one to enjoy 3D movies, the cast is also funny Kristen Wiig is hilarious as always and Melissa McCarthy stands out as usual either you really love or dislike her. The plot is very straight forward and borrows elements from both the original movie while paying homage to them in certain ways and yes the cast of the original movie do show up to do some cameos but it feels a little empty.... In my opinion one of the ways they should've integrated the movie was continuing the work of the original Ghostbusters, but how they've done this one is pretty much summed up it's a complete reboot the 1984 version and 1991 version do not exist in this universe but hey anything can happen in the future right?Above all we've given fair chances to many other reboots that were worse, going by the movie you either went in hating it before it started or you were willing to give it a chance. The trailers and clips didn't wow me, or make me laugh but the movie itself was done well enough to make me entertained and enjoy some fun and nostalgia, is it the classic movie we all remember and hold dear and grew up with? No. But is it fun and entertaining? I certainly enjoyed myself and hope we see more and maybe just maybe get a crossover with the original team. Here's hoping. Ghostbusters is fun and well worth a check.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie with a sorta open mind: I acted (as Walter Peck, while I also gave my voice to Slimer and Gozer) in the Italian musical version of the original movie, which I'm certainly fond of, but let's be honest: a moviegoer has to experience the movie as it is. And sadly this movie ain't no fun. It isn't scary, nor entertaining. The jokes all fell flat, the CGI is cartoonish, I saw no real chemistry in the GB team, and the (mostly ad-libbed) screenplay sounds clunky and dully expository. Is it the worst movie I've ever seen? Not at all, as most people would tell you: but they will also add - and so will I - that's not good either. It isn't even better than the feeble GB2: that one has real characters, at least (Yanosz, for instance, looks like a complex and cogent Bad Guy compared to this flick's villain: and that's saying a lot!), and a sort of an amused vibe among the main characters. All things that this movie has not. I'm not telling you to avoid it like the plague: but I rather suggest you not to waste your summer money on this weak attempt to cash in on nostalgia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is extremely good fun. It has its tongue firmly in its cheek as it makes reference to the schlock from the first film. There are some fun cameos from Bill Murray etc. and Chris Hemsworth hamming it up over the closing credits is a hoot. Far from "spoiling my childhood", this remake brought back fond memories of the original. You'd have to have to be very insecure to think that this remake is going to ruin your enjoyment of the original. That said, maybe this modern version *will* make people recall the flaws in the original (of which there were many) and think more poorly of that - which would of course mean that they should rate this new version more highly. Anyway, haters gonna hate :) Go see it, if only because the internet trolls don't want you to, but also because you will really enjoy yourself.</fullReview>

I liked it more than Ghostbusters 2 and that is saying a lot because I love that move too. I loved that they dedicated it to Harold Ramis and loved the hint at the next possible movie!!! I loved that almost the whole original cast made cameos. R.I.P. Harold Ramis. The Ghosts were amazing!!It was well worth spending money to see it in theaters. I would love to see it again!! I was a little apprehensive about the reboot but I think they did an amazing job!! The actors were amazing together and they had great chemistry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's just not good or funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I ignored the hate from the beginning when the reboot was announced because I was a big Ghostbusters fan, although I could not avoid admitting the trailers were bad. All of them said the movie wasn't going to be good and that it was nothing more than a cash grad, but I was going to see the movie either way.Unfortunately, it seems they were right. The movie suffers from a terrible script, bad characters, plot holes, bad pacing and editing.There were some things I enjoyed. The first 15 minutes were pretty good along with the first ghost in the mansion which gave that eerie and ominous feeling. Many of the action scenes were also great as well along with them bring back the original theme song.You have your two doctors/scientist that are best friends Erin Gilbert(Kristen Wiig) and Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthey), the Engineer/inventor Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon), and the Historian Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones). You have their receptionist Kevin (Chris Hemsworth). Rowan played by Neil Casey is the main villain. While the 4 ghostbusters have some form of chemistry together, most of the character are just bland or terrible.I have no problem with Kristen's character, but she just doesn't stand out. I actually like Kate's over the top, eccentric, and full odd quirks. However, Melissa's character isn't much better than some of her other movies like The Heat, Spy, etc. (and I find those movies OK). Just obnoxious and loud. Leslie's character was basically type cast just for her; she was pretty good at first until the later half where she turned into what she is know for being the loud and sassy black woman negative stereotype which was not fun to watch. Although there were about 2 actually funny lines. Hemsworth's character had a few funny lines as well, but his was just there for eye candy and was so unbelievably stupid that I just don't see how he can function in real life. Rowan was just a flawed villain and his motivation just doesn't sense or there's more to it, but not in the final cut of the movie. He's bullied and now he wants revenge? He builds a portal, electrocutes himself to become a powerful ghost and then opens the portal to flood the city with them.My biggest problem with the movie is the humor or rather how bad it is and lack of it. Most of the jokes are not funny and come out as forced and delivered badly. The in your face toilet humor and slapstick humor (the queef joke, getting vomited on sexual jokes) falls flat most of the time and some of them like the lip syncing to an 80s song or the huge dance scene by the cops are just flat out unnecessary. There were a lot of references to the original Ghostbusters that also came out as forced. I will say that Cecily Strong's character (Jennifer) did a few funny scenes.The plot and editing have some serious problemsThe last fight looked terrible and was obviously in front of a green screen.They were capturing ghost at first, then all of a sudden they just decide to kill them? Why?Rowan's motivation stated earlier didn't make sense, but he was going to kill himself and comeback as a powerful ghost with powers that others didn't display? How does that work out? And why didn't he just freeze the Ghostbusters?They ride in the Ecto 1 and then come out in jumpsuits? Also the Ecto 1 jumps from a Hearse from one scene to one with the nuclear reactor. The final act of the movie just seemed rushed as well and was just terrible.Also the cameos were OK although even though Ernie Hudson at the end of the movie, while Sigourney Weaver in the credits, while Bill Murray gets killed off during his cameo (must of been for the fact they he declined and Sony threatened action against him, or maybe for refusing to do Ghostbusters 3 in the first place). Annie Potts returns as a Desk Clerk (sound familiar?) Also Slimer enjoys a joyride in the Ecto 1, while Dan Aykroyd was just a Taxi Driver who was the best out of all because of his scientific knowledge of ghost.I'll give it a 3 because of a few decent cameos, a few good jokes, and a few decent songs on the soundtrack. You're better off watching it when it comes on Netflix or Redbox, perhaps the Extended edition since the original cut of the movie was over 4 hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was just lots of fun. It was hilarious throughout. I would highly recommend to anyone who enjoyed the original. There were so many great jokes and visual effects. The ghosts were cool looking and the plot line was engaging. There were a few parts that made you jump a bit and many more that made you laugh out loud. I particularly enjoyed the ones that referenced all the trolls. The actresses clearly loved making this movie and there were so many great throw backs/references to the original that made it really pop. This movie was obviously made out of a great love for the original. Looking forward to seeing it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed Spy.. I also loved The Heat and Bridesmaids. So I am not another one of those men who hates leading women or can't think they are funny.I paid extra to watch it in 3D and the Dbox (the seat that moves with the action). It still wasn't enough to save the movie. I am not a hater. I obviously paid my hard earned money in order to be entertained. Chris Hemsworth saved the movie. I just find it ironic that it took a man, who is not even a comedian to get all the laughs in the movie. But the 4 leading women did not get any laughs from the audience. The effects were top notch and I enjoyed the action sequences and my rumbling D-box and 3D gimmicks made up for the bad movie that it was. If I watched it in 2D, there would be no saving it. Kristen Wiig was genuinely good in this movie and brought some heart and emotion to the character. She was doing her best to do a good job, but the rest of the actresses seemed to be trying so hard to be funny and quirky and it just came off as lame and ultra cringe. The biggest offender of this was Kate McKinnon - she was trying WAY too hard to be funny and quirky. It seemed so forced.Nothing about the movie felt epic or larger than life. Nobody in the theater laughed at any of the ladies trying to be funny, but they laughed at Chris Hemsworth's character, who was genuinely funny. My biggest gripe; Every man in this movie is portrayed in this movie as incompetent, a creep, or dumb. There is not a single male character in here that a young boy can look up to. Yet another disturbing trend on today's culture where people feel a need to make men look bad in order to elevate women. You know its possible to show strong, independent women without having to put men down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here we have yet another case of critical dissonance where the film is well received by critics by loathed by fans of the series. I remember how "Ghostbusters" kept showing up in numerous lists of people's Top 10 favorite comedies of all time. Heck, Top 5 favorite comedies of all time might be more common. I admit that I consider the original film to be great, but it's not among my favorite. I really don't think it's on the same level as "Airplane!" or "Monty Python And The Holy Grail". Yes, everybody is going to hate me for this. I still really like it!This film really does try to show off the magic of the original. It still does work hard to be good in its own right. Everyone went crazy over the idea of an all female cast in Ghostbusters. You know what? These women are funny. It's really better than the trailer would let you on. The worst thing about the film is probably the pacing. It should have shown them becoming famous like the original did. The funniest bit is probably when Bill Murray appears. Thanks for dedicating this to Harold Reamis! The action scenes are great too. The effects really are better than they look at first.In some ways, this actually improved over the original. I was a bit disappointed the famous Stay Puft Marshmallow Man was barely in it. This gives us a better climax. Yes, the original is definitely better with more amusing characters and originality. The original has even gone on to become the most referenced comedy in history! Yes, I checked! Everyone will probably hate this review, but I'm used to people despising my film reviews. This is just my opinion. I may in fact be too forgiving on movies in general as I constantly defend guilty pleasures like the Star Wars prequels or "Space Jam" or "Adventures Of Sonic The Hedgehog" or the Pokemon movies. I'm not tempting people to mock me. I'm just voicing my opinion which you probably disagree with. I'm with the critics on this one. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It wasn't bad, but it could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like all the actresses picked for this film but the chemistry was off. The plot left little room for the characters to display any depth to their relationship. I would have liked to see a tighter knit group with more history.Instead of a reboot, I would have picked up 20 years later with the ladies being the daughters of the original cast. Having grown up and taken over only to discover a lack of paranormal activity. They still have had enough experience to have improved the technology and add new ghost fighting gadgets, but the lack of business and a dubious competitor has left them irrelevant. Said competitor is a huge McGhostbusters chain with branches in every city. Turns out they are bad somehow and now you got yourself a lot of plot to work with and plenty of opportunity for fun.That said, it was somewhat fun and worth the price of admission but unfortunately very forgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ghostbusters: "That Is A Deadly High Five..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: 4.7, Poor Movie* I don't think you could ever hate the original Ghostbusters (7.5), its a funny and entertaining 80's classic that defined a generation. And I would like to point out that I think director Paul Feig's movies such as the hilarious Bridesmaids (7.0) is indeed a good comedy flick, but by comparing the original and his previous movies, this is busting with bad acting, poor comedy and terrible CGI.* Characters: Im gonna make this quick, Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig are hilarious actors and comedians and they deliver none of it in this movie. Im not gonna lie, I did laugh, at the stupidity and fart jokes... Kate McKinnon's character was another stupid one, however she does deliver the action the movie was in need of. And as for Leslie Jones, I am disgusted by the public's behaviour towards her. OK the movies bad but theirs no need to put hate and threats on her? OK she wasn't funny but hey neither are your insults!Kevin: Chris Hemsworth is the charm of Hollywood and I must admit, that his actions and roles are so stupid, I will admit I was always laughing. He's talented and definitely the highlight of the movie.Rowan North: I was hoping for a bit of story with the villain, but it was pure dumb...The Old Gang!: I loved seeing everyone from the original comeback in for a cameo, (R.I.P Harold Ramis) however I thought they were the original team that inspired the girls, oh well...* Plot &amp; Design: Ghostbusters has a predictable and unoriginal plot, that tries so hard to deliver entertainment. The ghost themselves have terrible visuals and sound awful weird? I thought I was watching Godzilla for a second? The music on the other hand is rather catchy.* Im more angry at the public who voted either a 1 or a 10 because I believe we all know that 'most' of those votes are not proper opinions. IMDb is a great voting systems and these people are abusing it. First Batman V Superman, Dawn Of Justice (6.7), then Warcraft (6.7) and now this. I know people have their opinions, but this year has been an all out thearte war. I feel like its the feminist against the sexist and neither of them are looking at the movie as a whole. Is it a bad movie? Yes, but its not the worst movie? Im glad they gave the girls a shot, and hopefully they can redeem themselves. PS: My stupid friend Corey Chandler believes that Ghostbusters was funnier than Deadpool! What The $@#%!Please check out my lists and ratings at riyork2! I hope this review was a valuable source for you Ghostbusters!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missed Opportunities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lets put all Controversies aside first. This Movie is nothing more than a mediocre Popcorn Movie you watch once, maybe twice and never again. It's not a classic, its not really great but it certainly isn't as bad as people want you to believe. The Movie starts strong. The first 10 Minutes you almost have this feeling that you are watching an actual great Movie... The mood is just right until the first fart joke! Then everything goes slightly downhill. The first 30-60 Minutes are still okay. If the Movie would have at least continued at this level it could almost have been a good movie. but sadly this is when things go real bad. Then it becomes this standard Hollywood Superhero Movie with a bad Storyline and an even more bad ending. The Most jokes you feel like... well yeah nice... you might smile a little but never laugh out loud!I I only really laughed for the first time in the post credits scenes! Thats kinda strange i think. Or at least a little late.Something that totally brought this Movie down was the Charakter of Chris Hemsworth. No one can be that stupid! Too bad they didn't write him a better Character because even though his Role sucked he played it very well. Could have been a good Character but this here... Come on! NO!Another bad thing were the Cameos. Too many and too bad. They should have left them out. Didn't they noticed that they don't work? And the Way they are put into the Movie feels Forced. Like "In your Face". The should have handled it differently...Fixing those Problems and giving the Movie a better Villain and Finale could have made this movie into a great one. Too bad they screwed it up.Lots of jokes also felt forced into the story like... A running Gag of Abby getting Chinese from the same Restaurant and always complaining about the Food... If the Food was really so bad why would someone who is right in his mind ever buy the same bad Food from the same Restaurant? You would choose another one that is better! Of course they needed a running Gag here and a Resolution in the End for that Chinese Food but its just feels so forced just to fit the "Success Formula" of Hollywood. Apart from the Bad Things you really feel that they had a lot of fun doing it and they really wanted to make a great Movie but they failed badly which is very sad.I rate this Movie with a close 6/10. a lower rating wouldn't be fair since although it has its shortcomings the movie isn't as bad a everyone wants to make you think.Remake the Remake or Sequel? I don't think we really need to Reboot the Reboot because it might not have been a great Movie you could still fix it somehow in a Sequel. Get better Writers and do a better Story. Leave out the Bad Jokes and improve Chris Hemsworths Character and maybe the next sequel could be the Ghostbusters Movie people are waiting for. Also you could still link the new Ghostbusters to the old ones. Movies change things like that all the time so they could find out there were Ghosts here 30 years ago, the original Ghostbusters fought them off and then they got out of business because of no ghosts for 20 years. Everyone forgot they existed and they are remembering again because of what happened in the first Movie. So after all there is still hope in a way to fix some Problems and make a great Sequel that fixes all Problems of the first Movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie made me laugh and scared me at the right moments... I loved it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first "Ghostbusters" movies amazed entire audiences, by being both scary and funny at the same time. This movie was able to do just the same. It was also full of references to the previous movies, and surprisingly, I didn't find this tedious at all.I was quite skeptic about it at first, because of all the reviews here on IMDb. Also, it's a remake.I do understand why some people hated it so much: the main characters were all female; practically all men portrayed were quite dumb; ? First of all, the main characters in the previous movies were all male, and they certainly didn't need to make all the main characters women, in this recent film, but it was nonetheless fun to see a female ghost-buster. As to the "dumb" men, that was uncalled for. This is probably the reason why I won't give this movie a higher rating.I don't believe Chris Hemsworth was the best choice to play Kevin. Every time he appeared on screen there was something off about him. I'm not saying he isn't a great actor, but this role just wasn't right for him. He seemed uncomfortable and his actions looked contrived.The villain's motives/ motivations for the "destruction of the world" didn't seem solid enough.Still, apart from these mistakes (there were a few more that I didn't state here), I found myself absorbed by the story, leaving the cinema with a big enthusiastic smile on my face. I certainly don't regret seeing it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining movie, but not a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slight chance of minor spoilers. The spoilers won't give away the movie.This movie was very entertaining. The cast was excellent, Kate McKinnon and Chris Hemsworth were probably the better of the cast even though they all were great. I recommend everyone to see it, not because it is good (which it isn't), but because it is entertaining, something you can turn your brain off, eat some popcorn, have a large Mello Yellow, some Mike n Ike's, and just have fun. Kind of like Adam Sandler movies now-a-days. The movie itself isn't very good, there are parts where you are thinking it is getting better, but after that part, it just falls back into the mediocre movie it is.The film, directed by Paul Fiege (I probably spelled his name wrong, sorry) who directed better films such as Bridesmaids, The Heat, and Spy, has Erin (Wiig) who finds out the book she and Abbey (Mcarthy) wrote years back was actually published, and because she works at a high-end physics university, she cannot actually believe in ghosts basically. She goes to Abbe's office where she and her partner Jillian (McKinnon) are working, Erin asks Abbey to take the book off the market because the book can affect her job, which was because somebody said there was a ghost in a house that is a tourist attraction. They all go, even Erin because Abby promised to take the book of the market if she does. When they encounter a ghost (which throws up on Erin) we see them celebrating, but, Erin's boss finds the video Abby posted and she gets fired, but Erin and Abbery and Jillian form the Ghostbusters, and also gain two other employees. One named Patty (Jones) who helps them get around New York with her Uncle's car. The other named Kevin (Hemsworth) who answer's the phones when people call. They fight ghosts the rest of the movie and then the finale happens then it ends. It is unoriginal how they did it. The best part of the film are the cameos, and there are several. Bill Murray makes a cameo and is seen on the news saying the ghosts the Ghostbusters caught were fake and the second time he shows up, he is with the Ghostbusters talking with them after they caught the greenish dragon from the trailers at an Ozzy Osbournes concert (which he cameos, and, as a rock/metal guy, made me happy), the next came is introduced with a, "What do you want!" and is Annie Potts, who is working at a hotel where Slimer is, which is a cool scene for fans of the original. The next cameo is Patty's uncle, played by Earnie Hudson, and the last cameo is Jillian helper, and it is none-other than Sigourney Weaver. The only people that didn't cameo were Dan Aykroyd and Ivan Reitman. Once again, this is a very entertaining movie, but not a very good one. The cameos and the cast are the best parts of the film and all the fan-service will make you smile. It isn't a horrible movie, just not a good movie, but I still think it is worth checking out. There is entertainment value and fan- service to keep all people of all ages entertained.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had read a number of reviews before going to see the movie, so it's fair to say my expectations where pretty low going in. I didn't let that put me off, as I was a kid at the time of the originals and loved them both, so I almost felt compelled to watch the latest release.I'm afraid to say that it wasn't a patch on the originals, even Ghostbusters 2 is far superior. The effects are very good, which is not really much of a positive as it is what we come to expect from a blockbuster movie. That said, their is nothing particularly eye popping about the effects.The script was pretty similar to the original as well, which may have been expected, but there is very little to set it apart from previous movies. The one thing that does set it apart, is that there are several comedy scenes that are hear a pin drop terrible. It's hard to watch at times as they are embarrassingly unfunny.The female cast had been a point of controversy for many die hard Ghostbusters fans and there were a few jabs at it within the movie. The cast are a mix of good, average and terrible. The good being Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy and Chris Hemsworth, the average being Patty Nolan and the completely terrible Kate McKinnon. The chemistry between Wiig and McCarthy is very good, it works and the best comedy moments in the movie involve those two. Nolan does a good job but is not always given the best lines to work with. McKinnon is just outright annoying and over the top. She plays an eccentric, off the wall technical expert, but comes off over the top, unlikable and for completely unfunny. It would be fair to say that her character ruined the movie for me. Then their is Hemsworth, the Ghostbusters secretary and for me was the best character in the movie by far, the only male member of the Ghostbusters company. This may well be one big smug 'I told you so' for all those who bemoaned the female cast.All in all it was an average movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a huge fan of old Ghostbusters movies and after reading all the bad reviews i went to the cinema with low expectations. Maybe that was the right thing to do in order to enjoy a film that after all did not premiered as a life changing movie project but as an entertaining way to spend your time! And this is exactly what it achieves! It's a humorous movie with a really good cast! All four women are pretty decent actresses! Although I'm a condemned Melissa McCarthy's fan I was surprised to witness a comedian talent explosion from Kate McKinnon's and Leslie Jones' side! Chris Hemsworth once again proved to be a very good choice for a comedy role! What i suggest you is to give it a chance. And if you don't like the movie i bet it will be much enjoyable to listen to the incredible Ghostbusters soundtrack one more time while you are driven by your nostalgia!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Surprise No One Will Admit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the rest of the globe I was shocked at the atrocity of the new Ghostbusters trailer! I believed that it would stain the original two films with an irremovable mark. The following trailers for it were not much of improvements and I was sure that I'd not even watch the film, certain that it would be garbage. But my curiosity got the better of me, and I realized that it's called Ghostbusters, that special thing from my childhood, so I watched it... The surprise of how great it really was, proved to me, that you should never judge a film by its trailer. For everyone who felt the same way, it may be hard to admit the truth, as you'll most likely be criticized by those idiots who reviewed the trailer instead of the actual movie. Ghostbusters 3, yes, for me it IS canon, is an excellent, funny, well written and enjoyable comedy which captures the feel of the originals just as well as the Force Awakens. The comedy here is absolutely hilarious and many will say that they were chuckling throughout the entire film. It is better than Ghostbusters 2 by a long shot, which may sound ludicrous to some, but it is also funnier too. The nods and Easter eggs to the originals are very pleasant to spot, and seeing the original Ghostbusters back in the film, which they are, make it all the more better! It makes me so glad that its finally a trilogy now. Ghostbusters deserved a trilogy. The female cast are truly wonderful, funny and refreshing here and Chris Hemsworth as the Aussie secretary has some golden moments of humor. Kirsten Wig is probably the funniest new Ghostbuster, as she takes the same kind of role as Bill Murray, who was the fan favorite. Kate McKinnin is the crazy Egon Spengler type scientist who is clearly having fun in the role. Melissa McCarthy was good as always, not the funniest but funny enough at times. Leslie Jones was probably the least funniest in terms of jokes, but when she was funny, lets just say she was funny... Not trying to be racist or anything... Rarely did the jokes in the new movie drop badly or make you cringe a little. When the original theme thunders in at the start, you know you're in for a good time. Back is all the smart and sarcastic humor we love from the originals. The way it also tributes and pay homage the original film proves its respect to the franchise. It's understandable why Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson, Dan Akroyd and Harold Ramis (R.I.P) all returned for the third film, they knew the cast was funny, the script was solid and that it was... GHOSTBUSTERS 3. Forget the trailers which were probably edited by some hack, and don't be blinded by them. Give it one chance, return home and you'll understand the surprise I had. I feel so good, being able to call it the third, because it is, what we all remember and love about Ghostbusters, while also adding something new and different that we can learn to appreciate... I'ts good in my books!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was a true gem - Following the old spirit but with a new touch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I walked in with close to no expectations, and enjoyed the whole movie. It reminded me a lot of the old Scooby Doo movies with computer animation and real actors, in a positive way. Jumpscares, animation beautifully done for the subject, and gorgeous 3D. A real cinema blast, like Ghostbusters should be.Bill Murray appearing was also a fun way to reference to the old team. I couldn't quite understand why he didn't believe the paranormal events though?It objectified Kevin (the secretary) like you would then with a woman in that role, and not over-played it. My nine-year old brother whispered to me "It's always the handsome people being the dumbest" and it was such a gorgeous little come. The women didn't feel like they were women just because they needed to be politically correct. It wasn't mentioned like that ? they were just talented scientists, combining physics with the paranormal. They made fart-jokes, just like the guys in these sorts of movies would do and it wasn't with a sarcastic undertone. I hate that it feels important to mention this, but one of the actors is a bit bigger than the usual "ideal" for these movies, and one is a long black lady. It's basically NEVER made fun about, NO mention of it except one mention about a crowd being "sexist or racist". Normalising the reality is so good. The bullied antagonist was also a beautiful little gem, and he was such a sexist character which made him even more hateful and you understood that his comment wasn't okay at all. Not the best movie in the world, but a really good family-one. Scary sometimes for the younger peeps though, and I recommend watching it in 3D.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It wasn't terrible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes - it's another reboot/sequel. Perhaps the worst part of the movie was it's hype. It's not great. It might be borderline good. But anyone trying to give this a 10/10 has as much to sell you as someone giving it a 1/10.But, while it's impossible not to make comparisons to the originals (unless of course you actually haven't seen them) this movie does stand on its own. Mind you, it doesn't fly as high as the Star Trek reboot, but it's still oceans better than Finding Dory.There are some things Ghostbusters (2016) does right: Cameos and when the original theme song come on. Seriously, when it's Ray Parker's "Ghostbusters" playing in the background - those are the great parts of the movie. And most of the original cast add a lot without taking away the willful suspension of disbelief. And there are a few good one lines and jokes that made the entire audience laugh.But then, there are the things it does wrong: much like watching Jimmy Fallon, there were lots of jokes that were almost funny - but the deliver/timing made for a quiet crowd for the majority of the film. Much of that has to do with several of the cast members not creating memorable characters. Perhaps if there wasn't a comparison to legendary SNL iconic characters there might be less to compete with. They knew how high the bar was, and perhaps they recognized that despite a bloated budget of special effects, they should have spent more money on better writers and editors (A long, boring, 20 minutes more than the originals) even saying "Well, that wasn't terrible." at the end.They aren't wrong. But by no means was it that great either.If you're a fan of the originals - you may still be disappointed, but it's at least worth watching, even if for nothing more than the cameos - and the Easter egg teaser at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Want a straight review without sexist, mom's-basement-dwelling douchebags cluttering things up? Here you go.It's always risky to remake a beloved classic. I get that. I hate that they even touched "The Grinch" for instance. But this remake works.The cast was great. They all did the comedy from four different angles. The little jokes peppering the dialogue didn't try too hard, as a remake (or any movie these days) often does. No cheap gags for disconnected, thrown-in jokes or cultural references (unless you count the cameos by several actors from the original - that's my only spoiler by the way).As for kids, it doesn't push the PG-13 rating very far. A few naughty words and a little scary stuff for younger kids is all there is. It was almost PG - in fact, I bet they threw in a few words to get the PG-13 rating just so teens wouldn't reject it as too soft.Overall, a coherent, steady comedy/summer fun movie with laughs from character situations and not cheap gags. Like the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ghosts have never been this awkward</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caved in due to my gf wanting to see this. Saw the original in the cinema eons ego and loved it even though scared to bits for a considerable span of years afterwards. I wasn't prepared to be so underwhelmed by this reboot. A promising start faded in to jokes that were embarrassing to watch (cat in the bag dragged out for an embarrassing long time. So did the joke explaining equipment with made-up words. Funny the first time. Not the quassilioneth). It seemed very high-strung as EVERY dialogue had to end in some sort of punch-line. Classic mistake. If everyone is a comedian no-one usually is. It makes every character very flat and sammy. The story was very incoherent in places. All of a sudden the mayor is involved even though only the 4 main-characters have been present at all sightings and not really told anyone? The ghosts themselves are disappointing too and a mixed bag. You get the sense that this movie has a split personality not knowing whether to appeal to adults or children. The overall product is what you get when you merge the original with all the subsequent spin offs like cartoons and such. As such faithful to the overall franchise thus making it an average mess trying to appeal to all. A real shame. The last straw was the dance-scene at the credits. Every movie I've ever seen that had to revert to this kind of happy exit payoff for the audience has been an inferior product. It's very often a telltale of an inferior director when he needs this kind of mechanic. Not recommended and indeed the worst product of the franchise so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reviewing this as a film and nothing more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of the original Ghostbusters. I'm not a Ghost-head or anything but I have always been a fan and grew up with them. I think all the hate on this film just for being a remake/reboot and just for having a female cast is ridiculous. The utter hatred for a film just for being what it is...is really sad. I was prepared to see this and judge it on it's own merits. The film has good points and bad. It doesn't really have anything spectacular and it doesn't live up to the original for a few reasons. The original Ghostbusters perfectly fit the comedy stylings of Bill Murray and Dan Akroyd especially. That cast just hit perfectly. Paul Feig attempts to do that again but squeezing the proper comedy of the four leads into the film and it struggles sometimes. One thing I will say is that they really did try and in fact I think they tried too hard. The ending of the film moves at breakneck speed and has so much going on that you almost lose track of things. The original film felt like the comedians lost themselves in their roles. Stanz, Venkman, Spengler and Zedemore were characters you loved. In this film you had McCarthy, Whiig, McKinnon and Jones are those women just doing the comedy they do best and it is lacklustre. That's not to say it deserves all the silly hate and it does pay a ton of homage to the original including cameos from all of the original main cast minus Moranis and the late great Harold Ramis.I've heard a few differing opinions on Kate McKinnon so I'll start with her. Some say this is a breakout role for her and some say she is overused and ridiculous. I'll go somewhere up the middle. I never cared for her much on Saturday Night Live but this is a good move for her. Her character is wild and crazy and fun and I could actually watch more of her. She actually has the most depth as far as the actress losing herself in the role. Kristen Wiig really struggles as the lead in this film. She's almost too bland and I feel like her comedy doesn't work here. She sticks out and this just wasn't her best role by any means. Melissa McCarthy is what her fans will expect. She does a decent job but usually she is best when she's being outrageous and this is pretty safe for her. Her and Wiig have terrible chemistry and they're supposed to have the best. I thought for sure Leslie Jones would be the blight on this cast. I assumed they would overuse her and she'd be in your face and obnoxious and she was not! Actually she was pretty good and had some funny moments though I heard some reviewers say she was "hilarious"...no one in this film was THAT funny. The four of them together were....eh...so so. This is where it falls flat because the original cast were absolutely amazing together. All three surviving Ghostbusters show up in cameos that are actually really good as well as Sigorney Weaver as well. Ed Begley Jr., Karan Soni, and Neil Casey round out the rest of the cast and they're good. Soni is actually quite funny in a very small role and could have easily been the "Rick Moranis" of the film if they had let him. Casey is some sort of villain to the movie but that angle never really works either. Chris Hemsworth might be the best part of this movie as the dumb as nails secretary Kevin. He gets some hilariously awful lines and has better character arc than half the cast and this was a nice change for him.The best thing that Paul Feig did with Ghostbusters is that it still feels like the Ghostbusters. It has the same style, it has the Ecto-1, Slimer, ghosts, proton packs, sound effects, fans should actually be happy that this absolutely feels like it's in the same universe. The problem is not that they remade it or changed the cast to females...who cares about that! The problem is the cast and the characters (except for Kate McKinnon) are literally average at best, feel empty and awkward and their chemistry together is practically nil. This just doesn't work for this type of picture. So it's fun and outrageous with some good scenes and familiar territory but doesn't touch the original and on it's own is average and forgettable quite honestly. All that hoopla and disgusting behaviour from a fan base for a film that was averagely made anyways and did nothing to blight the memory of the original. At least now we have a Ghostbusters slightly worse than Ghostbusters 2 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good solid comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought it was a solid comedy. It doesn't replace the original Ghostbusters, but as a movie on its own, it's pretty good. On the good side: a great cast, a good script, and a lot of fun material. The interplay of the whole ensemble was good, and there were a lot of great gadgets and jokes. There were some missed opportunities. I loved Melissa McCarthy in The Heat and Spy, but here she isn't quite as awesome. It feels like the writers expected her to be awesome just by her presence, instead of writing a cool character for her to play. Still, she was solid, and the rest of the cast shined.It did get a little CGI heavy at points for my tastes, but that's true for just about every big movie these days. At least the ghosts were pretty inventive and eerie looking. The kids I went with had a great time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a woman who cares more about learning than romance, I found the characters in this movie more relatable than the vast majority of characters in other movies. This film proves that women don't need to be bland feminine caricatures who moan to their friends about how they can't get a date or damsels who need to be rescued in order to be great characters. I don't understand why there is so much hate about this movie (other than the guys who are upset that women are taking up the mantle). There is no talk about clothes (other than the jumpsuits), and there is no freak-out about how a main character needs to make herself over for a guy, or anger that a friend dated a guy someone likes, or anything like that. It's just four friends kicking ghost butt. Finally, characters who I could see myself in!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ghostbusters (I'm Not Afraid)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this film just the other day and I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised. When I heard Ghostbusters was being remade I was upset, I couldn't understand why anyone thought that was a good idea, but after the first trailer something impressed me. The ghosts. The ghosts looked amazing and I was very impressed with the visual effects in the film. I don't think I've seen prettier colors in a film since The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (thanks Sony). So I decided after a few trailers to see the film.Like I said above the visuals were stunning, while the actual film itself was hit-or-miss. I think the main issue for me was the humor. I don't particularly like it when women use rude, crude, and inappropriate humor, I just think it makes them look trashy and I have a much higher view of women in general (I feel this way about men too but I have too often seen men actually act this way in real life and thus I have higher hopes for women). That being said, there were times where I thought they were hilarious and other times I just had to put my head in my hand wondering what I was doing in the theater.The plot overall is straightforward and works very well for a Ghostbusters origin story. I love origin stories, some of my favorite TV shows include them (such as Smallville, Arrow, Gotham, Daredevil, etc.), and I was pleased with how well the story flowed here in this film.The cameos from the original Ghostbusters (minus the late Harold Ramis) were enjoyable and the Ecto-1 being a hearse was hysterical. The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man was also a nice surprise as was Slimer.Rowan worked as a villain just fine, though it wasn't until he turned into a ghost that I was sold on his evil plan, I thought that ended up working out great, especially when he turned into an evil version of their logo. This being said, the fight scenes were great and there was a great blend of physical action with the cgi ghosts.Although the new Ghostbusters may not be as classic as the original, I will admit that it may actually be more enjoyable than Ghostbusters II, though that it still up for debate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never watched Ghostbusters (1984) as a child, and so I went into Ghostbusters (2016) having never seen the original. However, the day after I saw the new one, I watched the original; the day after that, I went and re-watched the new one. Even on the first viewing, this was a very good movie, which is why I went and saw it a second time, and am planning on going again. Now, I will admit, I don't particularly like Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy -- I've seen them in other things, and simply not found them funny. However, in Ghostbusters, they really changed my opinion of them. The chemistry between them, and with Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon, is sharp, witty, and had me laughing out loud many times. Jillian Holtzmann and Patty Tolan (portrayed by Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones respectively, two actresses I had not heard of until this film) were, in my opinion, the best characters in this film, offering the most laugh-out-loud lines and, frankly, being the most interesting. Everyone's acting was superb, including Chris Hemsworth, whose character was ridiculous and cartoonish without ever overstepping the line into annoyance. The only character who I would say was lacking was the villain -- he was intimidating, and offered some extremely good content, but he felt a bit empty. Audience were never really given a backstory, and his motives were very vague. Other than that, he was very well executed. SPOILERS AHEAD.There was even more for me to notice on my second viewing, after I had watched the original 1984 movie, crucially all of the callbacks to the original. The firehouse, for example, or Ecto-1, or the subtle nod to Aykroyd's "Listen, can you smell that?" line in the original. And, of course, Slimer. These things are all included without ever feeling shoehorned or forced, and offer a nice bit of homage to the source material. The fact that almost every original character makes a cameo in the new movie was also very refreshing. (Harold Ramis, of course, did not appear in the movie, although there was a reference to him in the form of a statue, something audiences can only appreciate having seen the original. Rick Moranis, too, makes no appearance.) Rather than reprising their 1980s roles, they took on new characters, and despite having very little screen time, delivered their lines with the same top notch acting quality as in the original. It also never once felt like the movie was simply using the original's popularity to make people like the new one more -- it simply felt like they were acknowledging the source material in an interactive and fun way. This also adds a level of enjoyment to the movie which cannot be appreciated by people who have not seen the original -- it's fun to look out for easter eggs, references, and cameos, and can be turned into a game of sorts. Then we come to the plot. The origin story of the Ghostbusters, and how they come together, is very much similar to the original. Additionally, the way they defeat the enemy at the end of the movie is practically the same. However, despite those things, the rest of the plot is very different and very original, very differently paced, and overall its own entity. The idea that this movie is somehow a remake of the original has some grounding, but is ultimately wrong; it is simply a reboot which takes a lot of inspiration from the original, but adds a new and interesting spin to it.This movie will not appeal to everyone, as is noticeable simply by scrolling through the reviews section. The target audience of this movie is very different to that of the 1984 version. However, those who like it are likely to love it, and the scathing critical response it has been met with is largely unfair. I was very happy to pay full price to see it twice, and will be very happy to pay full price to see it at least twice more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had me and my friends struggling for air at one point we were laughing so hard. The only acknowledgments I choose to make on the negative feedback that this film has unfairly received is that I recommend going into the cinema and pushing aside all the thoughts that may have been put into your head by over the top, ridiculous criticism and just go in and let yourself enjoy a fun comedy movie about ghosts getting busted.I, personally, think the negative fuss that has been made over this film could be toned down by about 99.9%. It's a light hearted movie. About people. Catching ghosts. I think there are far bigger things to get so upset about.I'm also not going to pretend due to the negative feedback on this that it wasn't so refreshing to see un-sexualised, female heroine's up there being hilarious and getting big action sequences and all that. It was awesome. It gave me a real nice feeling inside, and I know that many others experienced the same feeling. It's an awesome thing to see.In conclusion - I loved the movie. I've seen it twice already. Had a smile on my face the whole way through. It's nice not being influenced by other people's negative opinions, isn't it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Reboot!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Misogynists may not be the only ones that abhor the Sony/Columbia Pictures remake of director Ivan Reitman's vintage comedy "Ghostbusters" (1984) starring Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson, and Sigourney Weaver. Some moviegoers hate remakes whether the films are good or bad, but 32 years have intervened since "Ghostbusters" came out and made a mint. "Bridesmaids" director Paul Feig, who has rebooted "Ghostbusters," with Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, and Leslie Jones as the eponymous protagonists, hasn't tampered with the formula that made the original so popular as much as he has retooled it for contemporary tastes. Aside from Bill Murray's shtick, the original "Ghostbusters" qualified as amusing, superficial hokum, but I cannot say my attitude toward its sophomoric slapstick has altered drastically over the years. I've always felt that Murray's other movies, such as "Stripes," "Groundhog Day," and "Where the Buffalo Roan," were infinitely better. Meantime, the originality of Reitman's farce notwithstanding, Feig and his female cast have given the material a lively spontaneity , and the superior CGI special effects don't overshadow their shenanigans as much as it did the 1980s cast. Surviving original cast members make cameos, but they play completely different characters with no relation to anybody in the remake. Slimer and the Stay Puff Marshmallow Man reappear. Feig's "Ghostbusters" doesn't resuscitate plot lines or call back characters from the two earlier films, but approaches the material afresh as if nothing had occurred in the paranormal realm. Actually, this estrogen-engineered remake handles some of the proton-packing elements better than the original. Although the typically hilarious Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy are uncharacteristically reserved, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones, and Chris Hemsworth take up the slack with spirit. "Saturday Night Live" alum Kate McKinnon will make you forget Dan Aykroyd, and Leslie Jones is a hoot and a holler in Ernie Hudson's role. Chris Hemsworth replaces Annie Potts, who played the original "Ghostbusters" receptionist, and Hemsworth steals many scenes as a clueless clown. While it clocks in approximately eleven minutes longer than the PG-rated "Ghostbusters," the PG-13 rated remake remains largely similar. The biggest difference lies in the human adversary that the gals tangle with and the enlarged role that the New York City mayor exerts in this mischievous nonsense.The tomfoolery unfolds when a vengeful female ghost breaks out of a locked basement in the historic Aldridge Mansion in Manhattan and creates all sorts of havoc. Columbia University physics professor Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig of "Bridesmaids") is poised to achieve tenure when the desperate Aldridge Mansion caretaker calls upon her for her paranormal expertise. She is horrified when he shows her the book that she co-wr0te years ago entitled "Ghosts from Our Past: Both Figuratively and Literally." Erin realizes that this tome will discredit her in the eyes of her prestigious Columbia colleagues. Erin confronts her former colleague, Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy), who conducts paranormal research at another university, about their book. Earlier, Erin convinced Abby to suppress their work, but Abby hopes that selling it on Amazon will yield another source of revenue to fund her own research. Unfortunately, not only does Columbia sack Erin, but Abby also loses her job. Abby's technical wizard of an assistant, Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon), serves as the equivalent of James Bond's gadget designer Q; Jillian has concocted an exotic arsenal of paranormal weaponry. Along the way, a fourth person joins their team, MTA employee Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones of "Trainwreck"), who has had a close encounter with supernatural specter in a subway tunnel. Patty emerges as the most aggressive of the quartet when it comes to defying phantoms. Apart from aiding Erin, Abby, and Jillian with her unique knowledge of historic New York City, Patty is also able to acquire a hearse that they refit as their primary means of transportation, appropriately christened "Ecto-1." Next, these intrepid dames set-up their headquarters--Department of the Metaphysical Examination?in office space above a Chinese restaurant and promptly find themselves in brisk demand. At a punk rock concert, they prove their expertise when they capture a gigantic, gremlin-like apparition and trap it in a compact metal container. Eventually, our heroines figure out that all the ghost sightings are not random occurrences. Instead, they are the work of an insane occultist, Mercado Hotel janitor Rowan North (Neil Casey of "Adult Beginners"), who is preparing to unlock that dreadful dimension between the living and the dead so that dead souls galore can migrate into our world. Rowan has manufactured several devices and concealed them throughout the city like land mines to summon these spectacular spooks. Meantime, when our heroic quartet isn't contending with the dastardly Rowan, they have to deal with fatuous New York City Mayor Bradley (Andy Garcia of "Ocean's Thirteen") who insists that they stand down and let Homeland Security handle the chaos. Ultimately, our heroines confront Rowan at his motel where they find his massive ghost machine. Rowan fries himself on his apparatus, and Bradley congratulates our heroines for finishing off this fiend. Unfortunately, this is part of Rowan's master plan. Now, he is able to operate out of a larger arena that was not available to him as a physical flesh and blood entity. Indeed, this giddy "Ghostbusters" remake is even more ambitious than its predecessor. During the last half-hour, our heroines take on a supernatural Macey's Day parade of ghouls. At one point, Slimer reappears with a Mrs. Slimer! Mind you, our heroines are properly equipped to deal with these demons. This new foursome boasts all kinds of ultra-cool armaments with which to dispatch these evil apparitions. Just like the original "Ghostbusters," the "Ghostbusters" remake never takes itself seriously, but the cast maintains a straight face. Indeed, had Sony/Columbia Picture made this the third entry in the original franchise, it would have been a blast. Nevertheless, by rebooting the franchise with gals rather than guys, director Paul Feig has given "Ghostbusters" a new lease of life that it might otherwise have lacked.</fullReview>

It isn't director Paul Feig's masterpiece, but it ain't half bad either. Definitely better than was feared by sexist old fanboys who couldn't bear the thought of a female-centered reboot of their cherished 1984 movie.The standout performance comes from Saturday Night Live cast member Kate McKinnon as loony gadget gal Jillian Holtzmann. McKinnon has always been great on SNL, and she's terrific here too.My companion and I laughed many times, and when the credits were over we both said we enjoyed Ghostbusters. Thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious! Definitely a new favourite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original. I wasn't interested in Ghostbusters until I started hearing all the good things about this remake. Then I heard all the whining about this remake. That made me even more interested and determined to see this movie. And once I started to hear how most of the female audience loved this film, I had high expectations. Funny thing about high expectations - sometimes you're disappointed, sometimes you're not. I was definitely not disappointed - I love this movie so freaking much.No matter what people are saying, this movie is hilarious. The only reason I didn't laugh out loud in the theatre was that, well, I'm Finnish and didn't want to bother anyone else. Dippold and Feig are extremely talented at writing comedy.The cast is incredible. I love Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon. They are all incredibly comedians, and if you weren't convinced of their skills, this movie will convince you. My favourite thing about the leading ladies is that while they all are very beautiful women, they aren't necessarily considered attractive by the typical Hollywood heroine standards. The most attractive character might be Jillian Holtzmann, and while she's incredible cute (come one, we all have a crush on her) she's still very tomboyish. And I definitely love Chris Hemsworth as the man-bimbo eye-candy receptionist. 'Ghostbusters' uses the themes of horror and science fiction extremely well. Of course few of the jump-scares are annoying, but since it isn't exactly a scary film, it's easy to just get over them. The only very slight annoyance is how the threat of the ghosts doesn't seem too serious. There's not a one second when the audience thinks that everything is going to go to hell. But hey, it's a comedy. I don't think the original movies are any different.In short, Ghostbusters is extremely hilarious and entertaining film. I'm definitely putting it on the list of my favourites.</fullReview>

No it's not sexist for one movie in every five years to highlight strong women and heroines that aren't sexually objectified. Yes it was hilarious that their secretary was a male. Most movies are just the opposite. So those of you hating on this movie without listing out any notable issues other than you can't stand that it doesn't cater to your arcane misogynistic values you really should get a grip and evolve a bit. I loved the fact that they brought back some of the ghosts from the original GB and feel it's a total classic. I greatly appreciate women in strong roles and I certainly don't have to be a feminist to not appreciate woman bashing sexists!! This was a refreshing change from the stereotypical male dominated hero movies! It's humorous and entertaining and Melissa McCarthy was great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>lol seriously?? this movie is great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is very well made and very funny!!!!!! Don't believe any of the haters who post reviews without valid criticism. Yeah, OK, the CGI wasn't the greatest and some of the jokes were kind of cringy but everyone finds different things funny so even if you don't like a joke, someone else did. I went in extremely skeptical and was truly surprised at how much I loved it. Honestly, its such a great story, well made film, and an excellent tribute to the original. Maybe a remake wasn't totally necessary, but really whats the harm? Remaking this movie didn't destroy all copies of the original! It still exists and its still great! And this movie is great too! I don't think you can even call yourself a Ghostbusters fan if you just mindlessly hate this movie because its new/female.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely amazing - nothing for misogynists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a great movie! I was really worried about it when I read all the reviews (though it was rather eye-opening when you look at the gender-setup of the votes). Aaaanyway... I wish I would have had this stuff when I was a young girl. Those ladies kicked ass! It was funny, easy, well-made, sexy but not in the lascivious way that needed shirts to fall off or being soaked, intelligent (I am a scientist... trust me) and, on top of all of that a great movie for girls seeing that they can be something else than just pretty arm candy. The only thing I was not happy with - why do all the white girls have Phd's and the only black character is a train conductor? I mean, come on! If you went all the way making an all-girl Ghostbuster team you could have ripped down another wall by making the black girl a scientist and someone else the blue-collar worker. Still, 10 out of 10 just so I can kick some guys in their nether regions for voting so badly. Because girls rule. Booyah!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i went in thinking I might be disappointed because young people were saying bad things. And now I think they don't have a clear sense of GENRE when it comes to movies. I think they thought it was going to be a funny take on the vampire franchise they seem to love so much these days. Which to me are the most boring mind numbing movies I 've ever had the displeasure of watching. But back to Ghostbusters. It was campy it was funny it was all it was supposed to be. And it made sense because if anyone who knows anything about the paranormal, spirituality, and the metaphysical knows women have the monopoly on all that. While the first was great made with great comedic artists, this one made sense. And the team of actors had great timing together. The young people who didn't like it have been poisoned by all all the new shows about the un-dead. They are boring, and the only thing scary about them is the thought that being dead is that depressing. When all is said and done simply put, kids today don't know comedy when they see it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw it tonight with my 10 and 8 year old sons. All of us found it hilarious and looked forward to this reboot. Just for full disclosure I have been a ghostbusters fan since I waited for three hours to see the first one in theatres opening night. We have probably watched the originals (even the second one) hundreds of times. The new one is very true to the spirit of the originals. All the performances don't feel forced as if to say "hey, we're Lady Ghostbusters!" (they're just 4 funny human beings), and Chris Hemsworth steals the show single-handedly (who knew Thor had a comedic side?). If you plan on leaving your inner hater that hasn't seen it yet at home and just want to see a good popcorn flick this weekend, this is absolutely it. Belly-laughed many times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliant Blast of Summer Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this reboot of the Ghostbusters franchise we are treated to some amazing and fun spectacles, a lot of laughs and big scale action. I usually avoid 3D as it's often poorly done, but I heard this one had good 3D so I saw it in 3D and both the 3D and special effects are very well done. Even if you know that a ghost is a CGI creation it still looks fantastic! The main characters in this film are a nice assortment of personalities and avoid going too far with any stereo types. For instance the character of Patty works for the subway but she is very well versed in city history and civil infrastructure and is presented as an intellectual equal to the rest of the team, who have advanced degrees. All the main team contributes some information, skill, or pluck and you get to enjoy the sense of a team really forming as the weirdness slowly builds. The film really presents the heroes as "everybodies" who just step up and do what is right, who make the choice to be good people instead of being hateful and whiny.There aren't really any twists - we can see what's going on with the main story from the get go - but the pacing remains solid. Earlier in the film there's lots of good chuckles and as the action ramps up it takes over from pure comedy. There are a few places the story is a little thin and a couple where it seems to skip something - I suspect that they cut a few scenes that weren't completely essential to keep the fast pace going and it unfortunately showed. At least one cut scene gets shown during the end credits though and it fills in the missing details in an amazing way.I think overall it works really well both as a standalone movie and as a setup for a series. My strongest recommendation - see it in a theater in 3D.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A ghost invasion, well with Erin, Patty, Abby and Jillian it's not the same as the guys!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I for one am one of the biggest "Ghostbusters" fans around I've probably seen the 1984 hit classic about 100 times it just gets better it's funny and it doesn't seem like it ages. And true I know that ladies and movies with all female cast have came a long way still this 2016 edition doesn't seem the same as the lady busters just don't strike a chord as well and by the way I'm not sexist or anything this film just falls well short of the 1984 original. Still I give a half thumbs up as this film was funny with one liners and it tried a little bit of parody, and I still think that Kristen Wiig, Leslie Jones, Mrs. McCarthy and Kate McKinnon are fine and very funny actresses still this effort seemed restrained as the monsters don't compare to the original as the use of FX and 3D doesn't sharpen it up none. And too the chemistry of the 1984 original was unmatched as even the cameos from Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd, and Ernie Hudson fall well short of providing quality. Simply this was one remake that just didn't work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't really understand all the overly negative reviews that have been popping up on here and across the internet.Was this a cinematic masterpiece, telling a new story in a unique way? Definitely not. Was it an amusing (almost) two hours with actors who have pretty good chemistry and a couple kick-butt moments? Totally.In a market that's been pretty saturated by remakes and reboots, this is definitely not the worst of them. If you're looking for something fun and to escape from the summer heat, catch this in theaters. If you're looking for something new and groundbreaking, go check out a film festival or wait until December when most of the "serious" movies are released.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The hate angers me. This is actually a superb piece of entertainment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin with, this film has been slandered from the day it was announced because 40 year old men behind their keyboards couldn't handle the fact they've brought Ghostbusters back without the original cast. One, Bill Murray refused to make a third movie. So this was a second resort, and by God, it worked. Leslie Jones plays the best character by far in this movie, she may not be a scientist, but that's what gives her the best part in the movie. The other character that I strangely enjoyed was Chris Hemsworth, his character was actually quite strong even with such a stereotypical range of jokes. The story line is strong, it's never got a dull moment with interesting plot points and a nice range of jokes. Normally, comedies don't fill me with tension with these sort of pictures, but this did towards the end, where the movie hit its strong point. The story is traditional with a modern take on a classic (probably why people are annoyed without seeing it, and need to grow up a little). I think the relationship between the characters is very nice, it isn't too much and it isn't too little, which makes it very enjoyable. McCarthy and Wiig have a love hate relationship that's funny, but yet creates some heartfelt moments that make you smile. It is fun!Every movie has its flaws, in this one, there are a few jokes that aren't needed and there are some rather cheesy moments that seem a little off. But I enjoyed it, it started off nicely with few jokes to ease us in and then brings it all out of the bag. Sometimes it's a little over the top, but that's what makes it interesting. Also, this is coming from a man. Yes, a man who has enjoyed this movie. The movie does have its references to the original. But this is more of a spin off, and a spin off tends to be less successful and aimed at different audiences, in which this is. All these people complaining it's sexist to men and racist, need to grow up, move along and go cry in a corner where they can't be heard when they haven't seen it. It's reviews are good on Rotten Tomatoes because those reviewers went in with an open mind. Thank you for reading this and enjoy the film. It may not be perfect, but it's pretty great to watch. If you do go see it, go in with an open mind, have some respect and enjoy yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ghostbusters is light summer comedy, nothing else. Original is classic, but this won't be one. It is just a watchable light summer movie. Movies biggest problem is, that it is too similar to original movie. It is more remake than it's own movie. Too bad, because with new digital effects and with better script this could be much better movie. Maybe movie makers have been thinking how to maximize profit and trust more copying the original movie than try to make something new. Best part of the movie is Ghostbusters secretary (Chris Hemsworth) who looks good, but seems to be just a beefcake. Movie is best to watch in 3D when it's CGI looks best. Movie has many references to original movie and that is where it succeed the most.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall a good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this with my wife. I normally do not go to a lot of movies at the theater. However, growing up with GB and GB2, I really wanted to see this version of it.I thoroughly enjoyed the little Easter eggs throughout and the cameos from the original cast were a great addition. My favorite installment to this day is still GB but I will say, GB2016 rates on par with GB2 for me. I enjoyed the comedy, the action, and music.I will say, without getting too specific, that there were a few parts I did not enjoy. Some of the very cartoonish CGI for one(you know which part I am talking about), the incredibly ditsy (more so than Janine by far)Hemsworth and I truly did not enjoyed the design of slimmer or his "girl ghost". Slimette? ^.^ Both GB2 and GB2016 had their slow moments. For me, GB2 is very slow going up until the courtroom scene, then it really takes off and grabs attention. I always look forward to the Scoleri Brothers! GB2016's slow moments happen towards the middle but I think over all keeps a good pace. I am very glad the movie was kept under two hours and the pace of the movie, for the most part, made it feel less.Overall, my wife and I were satisfied with the movie, I had a good time with my wife and we both had some good honest laughs. I rate this movie an 8 out of 10 as I would do the same for GB2.As a side note: My review tries to come simply, from my straight forward and honest viewing of it, without a predetermined bias.Thanks for reading my first review!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fluffy remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gender-switch remakes are as old as Neil Simon's play "The female odd couple" (1985), the playwright's own rendition of his own earlier work "The odd couple" (1965) with a cast switched from male to female. Having a team of female ghostbusters is, to most people, more gimmick than real substance. While not shot-by-shot as in Gus Van Sant's remake of "Psycho" (1998), "Ghostbusters" (2016) follows closely the original three decades ago. The small but perceptible difference is that it has less of Gothic horror (not that there was very much of it in the original) and more of fluffy summer hilarity. It seems to want to say "women can be funnier than men". Yes and no. It's just a question of different kinds of "funny". Instead of Bill Murray's deadpan funny, we have Kate McKinnon's letting her hair down.Yes, of the four protagonists, the two that are better known on the silver screen, Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy, seem happy to let McKinnon shine. Leslie Jones completes the quartet as the odd woman out, grass-root wisdom in the midst of three high-brow scientists. Enough summer flick laughs are generated along the way if the audience is the not-too-hard-to-please type.The real eyebrow raiser is Chris Hemsworth turning in a side-splitting performance of a heartthrob grade idol playing a male bimbo, so to speak. This is not something entirely groundbreaking though. If you have seen Brad Pitt in "Burn after reading" (2008), you know what I mean. The real draw for this movie, in my view, is Hemsworth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neither the spectacle that it should've been nor the disaster that it could've been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Ghostbusters was pure joy because it had the guts to explore 4 unfit men's lives trying to trap ghosts in a metallic box and achieved great popularity amongst all kinds of viewers due to the sheer joy that it was filled with. This much maligned remake may not be as great as the original and a debate against the second one will be long, it has a few great moments, thanks to the noticeable chemistry shared by the leads, it's relevance to the modern world, great gags and Chris Hemsworth who proves his comic worth throughout the film. It does have its issues as well including negligible sense of conflict, the worst villain of the summer and Leslie Jones' needlessly sassy and annoying performance along with the feeling that it's basically a rip-off of the original.The issues first because I have to get them out of my system urgently. Firstly, the villain pretty much sucks and no one even remembers that he is in the movie until he captures one of the employees at the Ghostbusters. Leslie Jones starts out somewhat interestingly but by the mid- point, she gets more sassy woman with issues and less of the memorable Winston from the original which is disheartening because it gives more reason for nay-sayers to hate the film. The finale may be a visual treat and keeps us entertained on a stylish scale, it is not very satisfactory on an emotional level because we know that they are returning for a sequel or two and the villain is pretty much every MCU villain of all-time as the writers try too hard too make him relatable and sympathetic. Now, to the good stuff.The jokes were supposed to be good and they were mostly good if not completely memorable and probably relied a little too much on the slapstick talents of the actors despite having tid-bits of interesting social commentary that are funny and quiet noticeable too. Kirsten Wiig and Melissa McCarthy may have chemistry and superb comic talents, Chris Hemsworth and Kate McKinnon steal the movie with the former appearing as an overwhelmingly dumb character and the latter being weirdly entertaining and exciting throughout. The visuals are rich and much upto several other blockbusters of similar scales but it seems too much for a movie whose USP is that it is a comedy set amongst ghosts. The action reinvents a lot of stuff and the technology used in the climax certainly makes the team a really bad-ass one despite taking a little from here and there. So, it succeeds as a female-driven comedy and even as a large-scale blockbuster which may not be a complete home run but is a rare kind of summer movie that is pure joy and not needlessly dark and gritty.The cameos, lastly, are a mixed bag as Bill Murray's debunker role is very disappointing despite irony being on it's side. Dan Aykroyd comes out of nowhere and his cameo is quite rushed. Ernie Hudson appears too but it isn't anywhere remarkable and for some, even noticeable which provides some disappointment. Harold Ramis is given his due credit here and there if close attention is paid whereas Sigourney Weaver returns for a while and knocks out-of-the-park but only for a few seconds. Wish Rick Moranis made a temporary return as well.Overall, the new Ghostbusters is a bundle of joy despite low amounts of tension and conflict which is covered with funny gags and great efforts from the leads. Thankfully, the nay-sayers where horribly wrong and misguided as the venture is neither the series' darkest hours nor is it the brightest. Nevertheless, I am excited for a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tale of One Half</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give the first half of Ghost(ball)busters a "6 Point 3", and want to, charitably end it there. As far as feminism goes anyone is entitled to laugh and sympathize with in-context gags, provided they don't attack basic core values. The movie, Ghost(ball)busters worked for me very nicely, even entertainingly, right up to the half-way point when Melissa, (played by Abby Yates) unwisely accepted the scripted direction to gratuitously break the new-wave musician's guitar on stage. I like Punk. Punk is Lefty Music, as are most of the performing Arts. Other Art-forms such as Rap have been known to openly expound misogyny, but it seems the movie studio and cast pussy-footed on that opportunity, despite its feminist writ. Is that because Punk is predominantly White music or did they feel that breaking, for example a Rap Artist's guitar, (whose music it could be argued would have exasperated a ghost even more) would have incurred wrath from some quarter? Ghost(ball)busters, rightfully deserved a thumbs-up until the Punk desecration scene, after this taking a decided turn for the worse. The reason, apart from the moral sell-out was purely due to the movie running out of steam. It is sad to reflect this remake had previously ticked all the right boxes, and, very importantly made the viewer eager to see more. The second half, to put it bluntly was a descending airplane. The plot that substituted those punch-drunk, stupid, zany guys of the first production for capable, all-too-clever-yet-downtrodden women, did evoke empathy. Girls, it seems have a problem with looking too dumb. Perhaps they do not feel sufficiently empowered? Even the awkward-misandry-driven part of Kevin, the useless, handsome, much maligned, English-accented, male secretary did little to pique, probably because many have also worked alongside somebody like "him". The second half of Ghost-ball-busters was, however a lamentable bore, trying to recapture, at times too literally the props, shots. tension and fantastically phased melodrama of the original Ghostbusters. Who cares about completely corny scripts, riotous bad acting, miscasting, soupy special effects - you name it? Despite the whopping 144 million-buck-price-tag the 2016 version of Ghostbusters was almost doomed to come a poor second. Even I, as artistic adviser could have straightened out many of these gaffs that could so easily have been averted. I hope, nonetheless the investors get back half their money, tax write-offs not included. People need to be bold with new ideas for new, upcoming productions. This particular movie was way, way too expensive and did so without achieving what the first, low-budget one did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Girls V Ghosts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ghostbusters (2016) is a reboot of the classic 80s franchise, this time around taking place in today's world and with a new all-star cast of female comedians as the renewed ghost busting team. A mystery man is using artifacts to enhance paranormal activity across New York City, and it is up to this team of scientists and an NY subway worker to capture and/or destroy these ghosts and bring peace back to the city. Things however start escalating too quickly as the world debates the team's legitimacy as well as the discovery of the evil man's true plans.It's rather sad that the drama before the movie was released was more entertaining that the movie itself, but that doesn't really matter if we are reviewing this movie by its own merits. Ultimately this movie was actually quiet entertaining. I chuckled along the entire thing though mainly thanks to its cartoonesque nature mixed with some risqué jokes here and there. I admit I also spoiled myself a lot of the movie because I was not actually all that interested in seeing it and I still managed to find some enjoyment to it. The actresses were charming enough to be likable and there were some scenes here and there that were legit cool and had me pumped to see what would come next. Also despite the weird marketing mishaps this movie had, this movie has absolutely no feminist propaganda in it whatsoever. There are some self aware jabs at the gender controversy here and there, but ultimately the movie makes sure this is just a "Ghostbusters 2016" film and not just a "female Ghostbusters". Which to be honest was a big relief for me.Actually what you do notice more in this movie is the excessive product and brand placement, which seems to be the norm in all Sony films. I hate the feeling that a movie is just one big overproduced commercial. They actually have a very visible Pringles can when they encounter their first ghost. PRINGLES. Like... seriously.I had several other issues with this movie. As I said it looks more like a live-action cartoon than anything. There are several things that were rather cringey actually. For starters while I am fine with the Ghostbusters looking like rookies while things were happening around them, because that's exactly what they are when the movie starts, it mainly seems like the actresses were just standing there most of the time and just pretending to react to their surroundings. The acting wasn't very convincing at times when it came to the actual ghostbusting. Also it is strange how they went from having nothing to suddenly having a bunch of weapons all ready for ghostbusting. There was no feeling of progression, they just happened to have a ready arsenal and a modified car out of nowhere. The plot was pretty tame and the main villain had very little argument to do what he was doing. Why was he mad again at everyone?The scientific mumbo jumbo the ladies came up with came off as ridiculous rather than credible, all the characters that were not the 4 main ladies had a very one-sided personality. It was like you are either the really stupid but hot guy, or the really bitchy hypocritical secretary, and so on. Every supporting character was very cartoonish in nature and that just made things much less legit for me. How can we promote female empowerment when all you are doing is making everyone else stupid? Also, the final scene was just a load of non-scene crap that I won't even bother to describe.There's also been a lot of talk about the cameos. I didn't mind the cameos in this movie that much but they definitely seemed rather forced, and it really doesn't mean anything to anyone not familiar with the original movies.Overall Ghostbusters 2016 is a fun popcorn flick that isn't really superior in anything, but with all its flaws it still manages to be moderately fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pretty tough to stand up to one of the funniest movies of all time, eh? I guess if you are much younger than me this sort of stands on its own, but if you're 50+ you have a comedic titan to mess with. I really really liked Wiig in Walter Mitty, she's okay here but doesn't quite shine the same. So they had two choices, to make this a sequel to the original or just start it out fresh as if the original didn't happen. They chose option 2, the problem is they didn't have the comedic genius of the original authors Ackroyd and Ramis behind the wheel. What made the original Ghost Busters so good was the COMEDY, it was above all else a laugh riot. They seemed to lose track of that here, or the writing just wasn't up to it, because there are a lot of forced jokes but few really good ones. I didn't get the (unbelievable) Hemsworth character, did they do that to make the team look stupid or what was the point? The CGI was good for this sort of thing but if the writing isn't there it won't stand up. And it didn't. Not as bad as the last Minions movie but not too far removed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film tells the story of two women who were fascinated by the paranormal since their childhood. They become scientists, and together with two other women, they set out to prove the existence of ghosts by catching them.Every time the familiar music of the original "Ghostbusters" appear in the film, I find myself happily tapping to it. Yes it's a great trip down the memory lane, reminiscing the fun I had watching "Ghostbusters" when I was a child. This time round, the film is still fun and entertaining as ever. It tells a story of people striving towards their goal despite being laughed at and cast out by the society. They become unlikely but true heroes. And it's fun to see a dumb blonde guy for a change, and he's really funny especially the moment when he complains that he can't answer the phone because of the location of the phone! I even enjoyed the credits as you can see Chris Hemsworth dancing, and there are two credit scenes that you should not miss out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was by no means life changing but it landed some solid laughs. The main cast worked well together and the references to the original sprinkled through out the movie were great! Kate Mckinnon (as Jillian Holtzman) and Chris Hemsworth (as Kevin) were definite fan favorites but everyone was well cast. The plot was definitely not perfect; it would not be difficult to find holes. However, the movie never dragged and was fairly enjoyable from start to finish. The story was cheesy, fun, and altogether not a bad way to spend a couple of hours.The trailers to the movie did not do it justice and unfortunately many of the reviews on this site (several of which were written without the reviewer having seen the movie) do not either. Some jokes fell a little flat but the audience in my showing of the movie certainly seemed to be enjoying it. To everyone that feels as if the movie is sexist because the female actors held the majority (if not all) of the good roles: this movie was not made for you. If you are interested in seeing a male centered movie in which the female characters are all either sexy love interests or cold calculating shrews then you should spend your money on almost any other movie.</fullReview>

Well, first of all, you shouldn't meddle with a classic, and secondly why opt for an all female cast? And while the special effects and CGI in "Ghostbusters" were quite spectacular and visually a treat to look at, then that is about all that carried the movie. Yup, the special effects team were carrying the movie.As for the story, well, if you have seen any of the old classic "Ghostbusters" movies, then you have already essentially already seen the 2016 rendering. It was generic and quite unimpressive in terms of new ideas and creativity.I had hopes that Melissa McCarthy would be the selling point for me for this movie, but sadly that didn't come true. She wasn't really in her usual gear for this movie, and it just seemed that the rest of the cast were holding her back. I can't really claim to say that there were anything memorable in this 2016 version, aside from the special effects - as the ghosts actually looked pretty darned awesome. Well, perhaps Chris Hemsworth manages to strike a few laughs here and there with his offbeat character.It was a nice treat, though, to see most of the cast from the original "Ghostbusters" movie make very brief cameo appearances throughout the movie. Was it something that helped lift up the movie? Hardly so. It was just a nod of courtesy to the viewers who has stuck with the franchise since the first movie.My opinion of the 2016 version of "Ghostbusters" is that it is a visually impressive movie, and a movie that will have some appeal to a brand new audience who never had the chance to watch the original movies. But for us who grew up with the classics, then this 2016 version seems more like a slap to the face with a dead, cold fish.A very unnecessary re-make, and clearly one that put a beloved franchise through the money-making machine of re-makes that Hollywood sadly has turned into.All in all, "Ghostbusters" at the hand of director Paul Feig scores a very mediocre five out of ten stars from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Have you watched Ghostbusters?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like Ghostbusters I bet you'd love to see how many more ghosts are in this one. Due to the fact that this isn't 80s and this movie has good budget and good special effects we had more comedic moments, more action scenes, and more ghosts given to us that the original two could never offer. This new movie does give the original and it's sequel respectful nods.This movie gives us the chance to learn about the Ghostbusters world while moving the plot along with moments of actions, scenes explaining clearly what is going on with the story, as well as some good scenes showing the new and fresh dynamic of the new 5 person team working at Ghostbusters HQ. We get some new scenes about the development of the Ghostbusters that didn't exist in the original. To say more would be spoiling some interesting comedic scenes that happen. I will say practice makes perfect.By far the funniest characters to me personally were Jillian Holtzmann,Kevin, and Patty. You may disagree. Kevin is subverts a character trope in the very best ways and Chris Hemsworth looks like he was having a fun delivering many of the most memorable jokes with his characters charming logic and way of thinking. Jillian's performance as the intelligent quirky scientist engineer made me excited for whatever unexpected thing she might do in each scene. Patty was a relatable character that acted as any average person thrown in the world of hunting and capturing ghosts would while making it more amusing.This movie was sold out in the theatre it was playing in for the night with people of all ages and gender in attendance. The loud laughing responses from audience made me question what is with people disliking this movie without giving it a shot. I will admit that some jokes didn't make me laugh but the original Ghostbusters films didn't (except Gozer and her voice). This is movies best comedy was situational and ghost related except the parts that were purely Kevin. I give this movie as 7.5/10 I watched the originals and I have to admit the new Ghostbusters got more laughs and smiles from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What year is it?" "It's 2040. Our president is a plant!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1984, the original Ghostbusters anchored one of its best gags on the punchline "This man has no dick." It's the kind of joke the 2016 remake doesn't dare make (though you can tell Melissa McCarthy is just bursting to), for fear of the internet combusting in a maelstrom of irrational frothing at the mouth. But for all the vitriol it has attracted, whether for being Not Another Remake, or its all-female leads, it's easy to forget that Paul Feig's Ghostbusters is actually a very simple film. It's not an iconoclastic diatribe, or callous cash grab (no more than any other Hollywood fare, anyway). There's nothing strange in this neighbourhood. But, if you're in search of a breezy, dopey, and laugh-riddled night at the movies? You know you who're gonna call. Feig is enormously reverent to the original 1984 Ghostbusters, sprinkling in winks, homages, and buckets of slime throughout. In fact, it's almost excessive how much he leans on affectionate nostalgia here (one cameo in particular overstays his welcome beyond what we, or he, clearly want), as his remake is substantive enough to stand on its own. If nothing else, Feig mirrors the original's deft balance between sharp and silly, cheesy and snappy, to an admirable (and thoroughly entertaining) extent here. The plot, naturally, is an extraneous MacGuffin of a lonely, disenfranchised nerd seeking to bring about the apocalypse as revenge for his righteously indignant isolation (ahh, so that's why it's hit a nerve for so many online trolls), but the adventure that ensues is tremendous, punchline-laden fun, motivation be damned. It helps that Feig isn't afraid to go genuinely spooky at times - ghosts should, after all, be at least a lil' bit scary - and it only feeds into the fun. He's aided by some surprising solid special effects, which hold up even during a CGI-bloated 'kitchen sink' climax, which skirts *just* clear of the threshold of overstimulating summer blockbuster spectacle (there's at least two action sequences - most notably Kate McKinnon's big trailer moment - which are so flat-out awesome, they more than compensate for any looming CGI-overload). It's even paradoxically refreshing to see a film having so much fun with its 3D, as its daft "let's puke on the audience!" aesthetics work weirdly well with its vibe of cheesy nostalgia. There are, of course, legitimate complaints to be made, most of which echo from Feig's previous work. Like Bridesmaids, The Heat, and Spy, Ghostbusters is indulgently overlong and somewhat clumsily edited, toes the line of grinding the same gags into the ground (some of the more scatological ones of which flop entirely), and incorporates bursts of sentiment or character development into the broad comedy awkwardly, making otherwise crackling sequences uncomfortably laggy at times. The crass product placement moments meant to play as witty largely don't (though "salty parabolas" is an exquisite one-liner, context notwithstanding), and I definitely could have done without the deluge of Ray Parker Jr. dubstep remixes, too. Still, props are deserved for the film acknowledging its obnoxious shroud of irrational patriarchal hatred with only a wry, meta aside condemning YouTube comments. Instead, as with most of Feig's filmic output, the film's most groundbreaking gender politics lie in the film quietly doing its business rather than stressing them. There are no bombastic girl power statements here: just a cast of four women with uniquely drawn characters (or at least comedic archetypes) who love their jobs and aren't entangled in superfluous love subplots. And the punchline? None of this undercuts how hugely funny they are. Bam. Mic drop. Kristen Wiig trots out her trademark neurotic motormouth schtick to endearing effect once more, but it'd be growing dangerously stale and forgettable without such flamboyant circumstances to react to (her bug-eyed "GHOSTS ARE REAL" histrionics remind how funny she can be when taking risks, though). Melissa McCarthy is more thankless as the Dan Ackroyd straight man, but although the plot labours to give her things to do (ghostly possession, etc.), her refined acidic chirpiness by itself is already a winner. But it's in the film's new SNL recruits where the real magic happens. Kate McKinnon's deranged gadgetmaster Holtzmann is such an outrageously, unpredictably funny live wire, she might steal the entire summer along with the show here, while Leslie Jones may be stuck with a politically dubious working class stereotype, but she owns it with her ferocious energy and barrage of unexpectedly funny one-liners. Chris Hemsworth's cheery doofus secretary Kevin is funnier than he has any right to be, as Hemsworth showcases an unprecedented affinity for making the most one-note gags unreasonably hilarious. Finally, keep your eyes peeled for the delightfully intimidating Charles Dance as Wiig's crusty dean and Andy "Never compare me to the mayor from Jaws!" Garcia, while cameos from Deadpool's Karan Soni and The Office's Zach Woods bag many of the film's best gags - which is high praise indeed. Ghostbusters is not perfect, and comparisons to the iconicity of the original are a moot point. It is, however, an energetically goofy, tremendously fun romp, fuelled by a team of talented comedians who are just fun to hang out with, let alone watch trap ghosts. And that's all we really need from it. Those aforementioned scathing internet condemnations? Busting 'em makes me feel good. -7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Kirsten, I'm Sorry" Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit it; I was one of the haters. Don't get me wrong. I didn't post sexist comments on YouTube because a) I'm not a sexist and b) I have a life. But I was one of the people who looked at the trailer and thought, "Wow. There's a dud."In my defence, it was a lifeless, laugh-free trailer.A delightful surprise then, to find that Ghostbusters 2016 is actually really good fun. It's not absolutely hilarious but then again (whisper it) neither was the original - and I saw that at a packed cinema in 1984, and remember it well. It was always a film as much about the effects and the adventure as about the comedy.What both films have in common is that they are fun adventure tales with wacky gizmos, special effects and charming leads. I've always loved Melissa McCarthy - surprisingly (and generously) she seems to have the more laid-back role here, ceding the comedy ground to Wiig, Jones and McKinnon. I've never really "got" Wiig before, but she's quite charming here, Leslie Jones is very funny but for me it was Kate McKinnon who stole the show - acting like a young (and slightly psycho) Eileen Brennan, she really is terrific and steals every scene she's in.Liam Hemsworth has fun as the dumb secretary (although truth be told, he's a bit too self-conscious for comedy) and it was good to see the originals turn up in cameos. The plot and effects are perfectly adequate and keep things ticking over. And I really enjoyed Andy Garcia, turning in a Alex Baldwin-esque performance as the mayor.So, New Ghostbusters, I'm sorry. Your trailer really did suck, but this film is good fun and a worthy remake. I'm a hater no more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. It was funny, and a great homage to the original. I think the only downfall was that the comedic chops of Kristin Wiig and Melissa McCarthy weren't put to good use. They can be funny! Let them be funny! I think they definitely knew there would be a lot of people mad about the gender swap, so they played it a bit too safe. But Kate McKinnon is awesome and made me laugh out loud several times. Chris Hemsworth played the dumb blonde really well (a role typically reserved for women, imagine that?!). All the people complaining about it "ruining their childhoods" - how many Spidermans have their been? How many Batmans? Get over it. This was a fun reboot and it was awesome to see women in charge for a change, without them being just a hot chick or a love interest.I hope there's a sequel so they can branch out a bit more and really make the crybabies weep that their complete gaslighting of this movie didn't work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four intelligent women decides to prove that ghosts exists.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I didn't expect too much from the movie since I heard so much bad reviews from (mostly) men.However, I really loved the movie. Although it does in fact play out in a similar way as the earlier Ghostbusters, I think it really stands out and makes an impression. And, Star Wars XII copied the first movies, but for some reason that wasn't such a big problem? To be honest, I think most of the bad reviews are based on the fact that there are mostly women in the movie and most of the male characters are pretty dumb. Say whatever you want, but sexism in male movie-goers is REAL.It was refreshing to see a movie with four cool women who played well, had a funny script, and had nerdy/smart characters to play. And also the fact that love (or, relationships with men) wasn't the main focus.I laughed through the entire movie, it was funny from start to finish. I could relate to the characters and personally I loved how they referred to the previous movies.If you haven't seen the movie - I recommend you to go watch it. But I would like to encourage you, if you do dislike it, to really - truly - think about why you hate it. Because it's a reboot? Or because it's a reboot with women? I would have loved to have these kinds of characters and movies to look up to when I was younger. Children need this movie, I needed this movie. I needed Ghostbusters with women and I needed it told as if they the women were just as smart and strong as any man before them.Say and think whatever you want, but Hollywood is changing. And if you're going to hate it, hate it because the script sucked or because the acting was bad. Don't hate it because it's women playing. In order to be fair, you must know from which paradigm you're watching the movie. Or all movies actually.</fullReview>

Ghostbusters is an excellent movie and I don't believe that a tenth of the "reviewers" have even seen it.The writing is superb, the acting is perfect, quirky, and certainly some of the best comedic takes I have witnessed from any gender. They pay homage to the original in touching and appropriate ways, while being a new story and fresh vision. The soundtrack is eclectic, but also managed to be a blend of eras and styles without being dated. I loved the cameos and references, which were available to those who could appreciate them, but not necessary to comprehension of the plot.</fullReview>

Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones, and Melissa McCarthy were a dream team of Ghostbusters! I loved the all female vibe and thought they were even better together than the all male cast of the original. You really should watch for yourself and form your own opinion. It had very good reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, so I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did.

I think when you really have an open-mind you go into a movie with a fresh pallet ready to soak in cinematic awesomeness. Ghostbusters delivered on all levels and the relationship you see them build is so wonderful. I am a big fan of films with leading women and these four have such great energy. I think some reviewers are just douche guys and are mad that there are women. Really great story line and I wish there would be a second. It was action packed and the humor was spot on. So nice to see seniors Kristen and Melissa with Kate and Leslie. Can't describe how awesome the chemistry is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Badass, needs better editing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The new Ghostbusters movie is different, bad-ass, and hysterical. The script needed more editing, and Melissa McCarthy plays another two dimensional character, but the backstory behind Kristin Wiig's character and everything Kate McKinnon does make up for it. The comedy is a bit drawn out, as that is the existing dynamic between the four comedians(so those who love their work on SNL will find it familiar and have no issue), but still funny. Plus, everything that Leslie Jones says is perfection.If you are looking for a clone of Ghostbusters with women, you won't find it. If you are looking for a fun and empowering movie featuring fight scenes with ghosts involving proton whips and one liners, this is it. Dialogue- 7/10 for excessive conversations and bursts of bad writing Fighting- 10/10 for proton whip Humor- 9/10 because I hate fart jokes Length- 8/10 for the irrelevance of Wiig's entire tenure plot line Legacy- 10/10 for being a different film from the old Ghostbusters series, and for having perfect cameos of the old cast. Overall- 9/10 I think the sequel will be better- I almost feel as though much of the writing for this film was stunted by writers afraid of the Ghostbusters mob coming after them, but their decision to change things up while still being true to what Ghostbusters original is about gives them a good foundation. Since my major issue was with the writing and editing (something they can fix by firing whoever was responsible for the entire scene with the mayor) I have high hopes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A ghostly experience you'll want to have!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Monday just gone I had my second viewing of Ghostbusters and my first in 3D. I can confidently say I didn't expect much from the movie after all the negative press and was treated to a very enjoyable experience. Furthermore it has been a while since there has been a genuinely satisfying comedy at the cinema and Ghostbusters has claimed that success.I will not go into detail on any spoilers that do not appear in the trailers as I feel many of the humorous moments are successful due to the context of the scenes. What I will say is when I saw the theatrical trailer, I thought it had revealed too much but in hindsight I retract that thought. The scene where the demon style ghost stands on Patty Tolan's (Leslie Jones) shoulders and a couple of people take a selfie with them, the events that lead to that situation are much more humorous but are not included in the trailer, which I think is good for the movie as it does not rely on 2-3mins of clips to be entertaining as a whole.While not all the jokes and moments of wackiness worked for me, there isn't any major negative talking points I have on the movie. Kirsten Wig, Melissa McCarty, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones all prove they have been well cast and Leslie in particular might just be the funniest with her being the normal, down to earth member of the team.Final thoughts: Ghostbusters has the potential to be this year's movie of the summer and I'm looking forward to having a third viewing; something I haven't done since the newest Star Wars was showing at the cinema. The girls are great in their roles and a splash of Hemsworth and a dab of some special cameos makes this film a highly memorable experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's more or less the same plot as the first Ghostbusters (in the same way that The Force Awakens is more or less the same plot as A New Hope), and it's just as enjoyable. And, the Ghostbusters themselves are four women who are intelligent, funny, brave, loyal, determined, and completely kick-ass while remaining fully clothed and avoiding cat-fights. The cameos were mildly distracting but very welcome, and it was great to see supernatural entities having cameos, as well as the human characters. This film didn't just pass the Bechdel test; it smashed it into dust.A film like this was well overdue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Remake Not To Be Taken Too Seriously</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I have a confession to make. I only saw the original 1984 film a couple of days before I saw this remake of Ghostbusters. This means I may not have has as much of an attachment to the original as other people who grew up with it did. Having said that, seeing the trailer prior to seeing the movie definitely piqued my interest. Supernatural beings, Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy and with Paul Feig at the helm, I knew this movie was going to be right up my alley.This is one very rare instance of when a remake of a movie actually brings something new to the table. With visual effects that make the ghosts look creepier than ever, teamed with an all-girl team of butt- kicking 'busters and a very handsome (but not-so-bright) secretary in the form of Chris Hemsworth, you can't help but enjoy this movie. It has the right amount of laughs, right amount of action and the right amount of cameos (no spoilers here, you'll have to see it for yourself).After the success of this one, I won't be surprised if a sequel has already been greenlit. This is a movie that lends itself to both older and younger generations alike. Fans of the original will appreciate the various nods and references that they can relate to and the younger audience can experience the joys the older fans felt over 30 years ago.motherofpopcorn.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most honest review here. (Non-Spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, let me start off by saying this movie was great. Not amazing or unbelievably awesome, but great. I'll tell you why: This film right off the bat takes elements from the original, in a very clever way. They didn't just copy and paste scenes from the original, but rather took the original scenes and produced them to be more enjoyable to a modern audience. Thats what I enjoyed about this film. A lot of the people here are giving it terrible reviews because they just don't like remakes or the think its "sexist". Trust me, its not. This Ghostbusters has amazing visuals and comedy that will make you laugh or giggle. The cameo appearances were perfect, not gonna lie. The soundtrack is pretty damn great and the orchestral remixes of the original theme were just beautiful. However, some moments can be dull and the comedy will seldom fall flat. Other than that, this movie should get an honest rating of 7.5/10. It deserves more than the shoddy rating of 4.8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fanboys be damned: open your mind and this remake will leave you in good spirits!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People flooding the social media with hatred for a movie before even a script has been written is nothing new. But when they start writing bad reviews for a movie they admittedly haven't seen (because they're convinced it will suck anyway), you know that there's something strange in the neighborhood. Yes people, this is, as often, a clear case of 'hating on principle'. The many one-star reviews (162 at last count) are the main cause of the current 5.3 rating. But as I have observed over and over, that is rarely the whole story. So I did a check, and for a movie that is supposed to be so bad that you don't even need to see it to know it, I currently counted 519 good reviews against 288 bad. There you have it: 2/3 of the people who took the time to comment were positive. And you can add mine to it.Let me say first that I have seen all of Paul Feig's theatrical movies, and I really think he has surpassed Judd Apatow when it comes to laughs. Together with the fabulous Melissa McCarthy and Kirsten Wiig, he has broken that old misconception that women can't be funny. I laughed so hard at 'Spy' that when I heard Feig and McCarthy were going to do a Ghostbusters remake, my thought was that if someone could pull it off, it would be them. Of course I love the old classic version, and did not think it was in immediate need of being redone; that said, the 1984 version was also made by a director/comedian team at the top of their game, so who says that a new team couldn't bring a fresh, new and modern perspective to it? And I have to say: they pulled it off. Just like the reboots of Evil Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Star Trek, this isn't a lazy retread of the original with merely some updated special effects, but a new origin story with familiar elements. Feig and screenwriter Katie Dippold must have felt the close scrutiny they were under, so they purposely tried to avoid getting too close to the original, both in terms of plotting and classic scenes. It's funny to see how they keep steering towards familiar elements, and then make an unexpected turn. And where they could not avoid it, they get a nice joke or tongue-in-cheek reference out of it (just check the cameos of the original cast, and the post-credit scene!). Some sequels/reboots get overly smug with all their winks to the original (or "hommages" as they call it), but here, it never becomes annoyingly conspicuous.That said, the original once won us over by its daring combination of an original premise, special effects and good humor. The reboot lacks a new premise, so it has to score on other areas. And it is there where the criticism comes is. Paul Feig usually creates a self-invented universe where he can unleash all sorts of appropriate jokes, but here he borrows from a previously established world, and that freshness is hard to copy. These confinements somewhat limit his inspiration for comedy, with the result that there are noticeably fewer laughs this time around, despite several very good ones (often the self-referential ones). Kirsten Wiig seems to be quite intimidated by the daunting task of filling Bill Murray's shoes in the beginning, and Melissa McCarthy, funny as always, isn't in her best shape. But maybe they held back to give the other two leads some time to shine. Leslie Jones is very funny as the assertive Patty, who has her street smarts to compensate for her lack of science, but Kate McKinnon as 'Holtz' is the unsung heroine in the movie for me. With her cool-headed attitude and general not-entirely-stable demeanor, she could be the female Zach Galifianakis. And it is refreshing to see tough guy Chris 'Thor' Hemsworth as the dumb blond/love interest for a change, even though this has led to some ridiculous accusations of man-hatred among reviewers. A strange criticism for a movie that intentionally tries to reverse the typical gender roles. Well, I think we men have the right to play the sort of negative stereotype that women were sentenced to for ages! As can be expected, the special effects look top-notch. The makers have taken the opportunity to expand the inventory of the Ghostbusters with some really cool gadgets, giving the female leads the opportunity to show what they are worth. The ghosts all look quite convincing, and especially the climax, traditionally the most spectacular sequence in a Ghostbuster movie, is impressive, and even has a pretty original adversary. But at the heart of the movie is still the chemistry between these four characters, which isn't changed by the fact that they are women now. If people give this movie only one star and they can clearly motivate why, I say "bless 'em". But hating this movie on the basis that it shouldn't exist is not something I shall be participating in. Whether you regard it as remake, reboot or sacrilege, I thoroughly enjoyed it for what it is: not as good as the 1984 version, but a bit better than Ghostbusters II. Or to use a phrase a friend of mine often coins: it is far better than it has the right to be.</fullReview>

Almost as good as the original but way better than Ghostbusters 2.Light Spoilers: SPOILER WARNING!!!!!!!My kids loved that Slimer had a girlfriend, my son thinks this one is better than the original, while my daughter likes Ghostbusters 2 the best because she loves babies. This is a great movie for kids, I had to cover the kids eyes when we watched the original on DVD because of the scene with the ghost undoing Ray's pants. Ghostbusters 2 is also kid friendly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Listen, I get that people feel the need to be protective of a beloved movie and defend it with their life. Heres the thing, the old Ghostbusters movie still exists. Its still just as good. You're defending something that has no reason to be defended. Both movies stand on their own and are meant for different generations. I, having grown up with a father who found it necessary for me to experience classic movies, honestly love this Ghostbusters more enjoyable than the original. I wish I had this movie as a kid. This movie is so important to have for the current generation. For those who have a proton pack shoved up their butt, back off a movie you don't need to defend and movie you don't need to ruin. Reasons why this movie is important to this generation is women in science! The science field is lacking in women who are interested in it. Most girls at a young age like science and math class, but once they get to that age where they realize that society wants to see them a certain way their interests shift. This movie will help in showing young girls its cool and awesome to love science. Also over throwing the stereotype that men are the main heroes. Though their are movies where women are heroes, most are sexualized. Ghostbusters breaks how we should see women heroes in movies. Strong a determined on the goal at hand, not always following what people want them to be or do. And they address that many times in the movie. Overall I can easily say this is now one of my favorite movies and I plan on seeing it many time as I can to help it be successful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand the negative reviews. It's become a meme to criticise it completely unfairly.I really enjoyed this movie. There were some excellent gags, physical humour, the characters all interacted very well together. I love the original Ghostbusters (and enjoyed its sequel a bit) and while this falls short of the original, it is a very entertaining and fun movie. Easily better than Ghostbusters2.You can tell the writers and Director really loved the original movies and wanted to pay respect to them, use some of the original ideas but with new twists. The cross-movie tie-ins were a joy to see.Go see the movie for yourself. It's a great tribute to the original and great remake.I'm looking forward to watching it again when it's released on blu- ray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun homage to the original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the original "Ghostbusters" and was afraid this might be a bad remake of it, but instead it really felt like a homage to the original. Even Bill Murray gave his stamp of approval with an ironic cameo as a paranormal-debunking scientist. The idea of making 4 women the new ghostbusters was great since a team of 4 men IMO could never replace the greatness of the original cast of Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd, and company. While the writing could be improved the movie doesn't fail to deliver on laughs and the close relationship of the diverse female cast also shone through. "Ghostbusters" also offers man-eye candy and girl crushes galore in the form of a very buff rhythmically capable Chris Hemsworth and a quirky and cute Kate McKinnon as the socially awkward engineer of the bunch.The subtle subtext of the film (that you might not pick up on unless you're a woman) is that the projects and endeavors that are spearheaded by women often get less funding, less attention, and less support. However, the movie says, you shouldn't give up--you can still make it if you try. So, in many ways "Ghostbusters" is another great underdog-triumphs-in- spite-of-major-obstacles kind of story that anyone who has ever been the underdog can relate to.Another great thing about the cast is that each woman is quirky and unique in her own way. And none of them were 20 year-old sex objects with silicone implanted everywhere in their body. I loved seeing real women being real women and I hope to see them on the big screen again soon. They definitely have my $20 for IMAX 3D!The film isn't without its flaws (awkward script) but I approached it as an entertaining story that, as a woman, gave a bit of a boost to my confidence which can flag at times. I find that most of the people bashing this film are socially backwards, sexist, middle-aged men who probably want nothing more than for Trump to become president. (Don't worry about them--they are a loud, vocal, but only small part of the entire human population.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My daughter and I went to the theater twice to see it, which I've never done for any other movie in all my 46 years. This movie is funny, unique in its own way,and yet it GREATLY HONORED the actors and producers of the first Ghostbusters movie. WELL DONE!! The soundtrack is outstanding too! Those who watch this movie with negativity from the start and try to compare it with the first Ghostbusters, will truly miss out on a great movie and the fun to be had from it! BTW,this is a positive review that is REAL from a not so young person. I definitely recommend watching this movie! The people in the theater both times we went seemed to laugh a lot and really enjoyed this movie too. Therefore,those of you negative-type people, please just don't go to the theater at all! The movie is worth seeing!! Can't wait till we get the DVD of it!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake is a fun filled movie, and exactly what I would expect from a Ghostbusters movie. Ghostbusters was a good childhood memory for me, and reading all this negativity towards the movie was a bit disheartening.Yes, the story was not original, yes there are a lot of stereotype character, yes the joke on Kevin "the stupid blond male secretary" was a bit too much, but it's all part of the fun. I like the way they portray the ghost, I spent most of the movie grinning, and love Kate McKinnon's character (her finale action was pretty cool). It's pretty much what I would expect from a Ghostbusters movie - one big cheesy plate of Ghost hunting action movie. Yes please!!So go and give this movie a chance, don't give in to the Nay-sayers who gave this movie a 1/10. I'm giving this 7/10 because it is what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering how many naysayers there were about this film long, LONG before it came to theaters, I'm not surprised the movie has less than a five star rating on IMDb at the moment. I wonder how many of those reviewers actually went to see the movie?I just saw it today, and I went in with a lot of fear. Because I know that any women-lead movie that is not marketed 100% as a chick-flick is going to have to work (just like real life) twice as hard to be considered nearly as good. Add in the fact that the original Ghostbusters is such a classic, there was going to be a lot of built-in antagonism. Sad but true.So I went in hoping not to see too many cringe-worthy slapstick jokes, and thankfully there were only a handful. There was certainly some physical comedy, but not the really painful kind for the most part. I *was* surprised by some of the just genuine, funny cleverness. The movie even has a bit of self awareness, indirectly referencing some of the online furor over a female-driven Ghostbusters movie. I'm not familiar with Kate McKinnon, but I found her and Chris Hemsworth's comedic acting quite engaging and I think they both brought quite a lot to the table. Was this movie 100% comedy gold? Nah, not really. Was it still worth seeing? Absolutely. Was it *anywhere* near as bad as outraged Ghostbusters fans will be saying it is? Not hardly. My final word: Give it a chance. You might be surprised!</fullReview>

Immediately. I'm seeing it again later this week.The original Ghostbusters is 36 years old, and ripe for a reboot. (I saw it when it came out, and while it was decent, I never felt the need to see it again, or own it.)So, ignore all the suspiciously early reviews (it opened on the 15th).

		<fullReview>As a huge fan of the original I was skeptical about this movie. The trailers didn't impress me but I figured I would go see it and expected to walk out disappointed. I'm very happy to report that I was pleasantly entertained through the whole movie. There was a powerful chemistry with the cast that really made it fun to watch and my husband and I laughed through the whole thing. Kevin (Chris Hemsworth) was hilarious. He added another funny and refreshing component to the movie with his aloof and air-headed innocence. It was a nice "spin" on gender reversal that actually worked for the film. It didn't feel forced. Through the entire film not once did I feel myself comparing to the originals, because the script felt new. I walked out of the film feeling really good and pumped about it and was almost embarrassed how I could of missed this gem of a summer flick due to all the negative hype. One thing, we did not see it in 3D as I don't think anything but animation films are worth the extra cost. It saved us a little bit of money and the images were fine in 2D. Again overall an excellent film that is recommended for old and new fans alike. Didn't think it was appropriate for very small children though (some jump-scare moments and lots of violence).</fullReview>

The acting was on point and the graphics were awesome! I loved to see women as a heroic character. I felt very proud to be a woman after watching this movie. I felt like this is how a man feels after watching a super hero movie or something.I didn't see any anti-male thingy in it, I really think that those who are nagging about are just butt hurt sexists who can only accept a man to be the super hero. I mean, how many times were a woman portrayed as the dumb one in movies? I'm sorry but Kevin (the male character) did great and this was totally not sexist or anti-male. I mean, there are a lot of hot guys who are a bit dumb, am i right? Although the trailer is a bit less than the movie, I would really recommend this movie. You won't regret it!

		<shortDescription>Awesome and hilarious. The backlash is non-sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie surprised me. I was expecting something half decent at best, and yet found myself laughing so hard that there were tears. I was cautious because of negative reviews but that terrible trailer did not do it justice. It was witty, fun, scary, caught me off guard sometimes (I died at the "scratch the eye" scene with Hemsworth), and a nice little political note is that the script and outfits were not "gendered", could have been for any actor. That's rare for an all-female cast movie.The first half of the movie was great with the second half slowing a bit. Like all recent reboots, the plot was a bit of a mirror of the old movie towards the end. The effects and ghosts were super well done, lots of chills down the spine. I give it an 8/10, but 10/10 to offset the online hate by those who haven't even seen it. Good movie for all audiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Light comedy with breakout Hemsworth role</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film isn't awful, it's just a mediocre light comedy reboot of what was a male-dominated franchise refashioned as a wannabe female-dominated one. The ending credits definitely set things up for a potential sequel. Hemsworth steals the show from the ladies and is hilarious in what is for him a breakout role. To the film powers that be: please do Hemsworth and film goers a favor and cast him in more comedies. He has the acting chops to be a great success in them. This is a another miss for the great Melissa McCarthy. Let's hope she has more success finding vehicles worthy of her talents in the future. The rest of the leading ladies were 'meh.' Kristen Wiig continues to disappoint, despite being attractive, quirkily funny, and with so much potential. The lady has limited range and depth and yet again, doesn't deliver.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately this has become because of political correctness and its backlash almost impossible to rate objectively. In the 2016 North American wish to either redo every successful film ever made and present every conceivable variant in the process, for what could be deemed the lack of any possible originality of ideas, I still tried to enter this with an open mind, and see this as if the two films from the 80's (which I enjoyed very much the one time I saw each of them) had never existed. I should state I saw this in 3D (which I hardly ever do), with my lady and our respective sons.I felt that it was quite funny and that the special effects were excellent. Next to 'Avatar', the use of 3D was the best I have ever seen. It's a popcorn flick well-worth seeing. Though I haven't seen any other movies by Feig or starring McCarthy, it made me want to go back and give them a shot at some time in the near future. There was something for everyone--both my lady and I enjoyed it very much--and the boys, three and thirteen years-old respectively, loved it as well. Give it a shot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This "Ghostbuster" film was not what I expected, maybe my hopes were too high! That being said, it was Leslie Jones performance that made me laugh. I could not wait to see her moments on screen. Both Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig lacked feeling in their bickering encounters, they were boring. I did especially like seeing the original Ghostbusters in their cameos, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Annie Potts, Ernie Hudson, and Sigourney Weaver. I would have liked to have seen Rick Moranis in a cameo. I did like the brief cameo by Ozzy. So much potential not for filled!

I do feel like it would have done better as a movie standing on its own. It didn't need the Ghostbusters name. All of the main cast were brilliant in their roles. The other characters, not as much. The Mayor's female assistant felt forced, and almost slimy (which possibly may have been what they were going for.) I find myself hoping that they do a sequel where they come up with additional technology and explore the interpersonal relationships more.

		<fullReview>Just watched it with a friend earlier this morning, watched the 3D version. I want to see it because I was a fan of the 1984 version. I think what I was expecting were humor, entertainment and a decent story. What I got was good effects, humor, still fairly entertaining, the story is alright. Reboots of a cult classic is always hard, the cameos of the original cast was a nice touch. At times the jokes are slightly awkward and the whole male secretary aspect wasn't as funny as it must of been intended. However overall I still enjoyed it. Good pace, comparing to the 1984 version, I still liked that better but this is not as hard to watch as some of reviews here suggested. Overall, decent movie, still recommendable to others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie had potential, but fell short as predicted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie started out pretty good. I was enjoying it until about the second half of the movie. Kristen Wiig definitely had the best role out of the four Ghostbusters, and usually she's hit or miss for me. I enjoyed most of her time on SNL, but to me she comes no where near Amy Poehler or Tina Fey. Kate McKinnon's character was too over the top for me, and I love McKinnon. I think she is very talented. Never been much of a fan of McCarthy, but she was OK in this movie because she was toned down a bit. Leslie Jones I don't see anything special in her at all. So much of this cast has a past with SNL, and that's exactly what this movie felt like. An over the top big production SNL skit that started well, but ended terribly. The writing to me was the worst part. There was no real creativity, and I feel Feig was trying to capture too much improv which didn't work because it didn't move the story along. This was a challenge that should have been invested with more creativity instead of throwing money at it. I enjoyed parts of this film and would have rated it higher, but the ending ruined it for me. I am a true champion when it comes to women in comedy. I love seeing funny women on screen, but when a movie becomes a political agenda, it takes the fun out of it. You could tell they were focusing on pleasing feminists and trying to bash men, instead of a good story, which is disappointing because I did see potential in this movie. I have an open mind when it comes to comedy, and I try to sit back and enjoy a film as much as possible without being too critical, but I felt the need to express my opinion. I was actually going in to this movie thinking it was going to be worse than it was so, the low expectations actually made it more enjoyable surprisingly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good and bad, what could have made it better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I went in with low expectations based on all of the negative criticism I've heard and the awful trailer. So, on the bright side, it is better than the trailer made it out to be. In fact, most of the stuff in the trailer were my least favorite parts about the movie, such as when the black ghostbuster girl falls in the crowd and makes a racial joke.I am not the kind of person that cares a lot about special effects or any of that stuff. I like movies for the story and the characters. So having said that, where does that leave this movie? Well, I liked most of the characters. In many ways they mimic the 4 personalities present in the original ghostbusters movie. But the one character that just absolutely ruined it for me was "Kevin." The best way i can describe him is that he is the "Jar Jar Binks" of this movie. He is so absolutely stupid that it makes the character unbelievable. He would need an IQ of about 10 to say some of the things he says, in which case he would not be able to use a computer, or a car, motorcycle, etc. It's one thing to make a character stupid, but this just goes too far. Even if it were a blonde girl with the blonde jokes, it still went too far. Because nobody is that stupid. I hated every scene that he was in.Other than that, I liked the plot of the movie and the character development from the beginning to the end. In fact, I think the plot was more interesting than Ghostbusters II with the painting that came to life. I also did not care for most of the music, especially the modernized version of the theme song.I gave this movie a 6. If they had taken Kevin out of the movie, I might have given it an 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In spite of all the moaning butthurt fanboys who are panning this movie because "OMG GIRLS EWWW" To me this movie was much greater than the old one: which depended on Vinkman (Bill Murray) character being a skirt chasing sleezball. Now he would be listed as a stalker and probably have several sexual misconduct suits on file. That always made me highly uncomfortable in the old movie and it really distracted from the plot. This movie.... It really was mostly all action. The iffy part was the use of the "pretty but dumb as a bag of bricks" receptionist was a bit groan worthy. It was great to see some of the original cast in their cameo spots. The CGI... was okay but probably not award winning but in no way distracts from the fun of this movie. As I saw the original when it came out and being an adult at the time, it always seemed slow passed and the sleeze factor always set me off. With this cast it was refreshingly funny. No sexual factor (at least not to the extent of the first) I loved this movie so much I can hardly wait for the DVD release so I can watch it any time. Poo on all you poopooing this movie.

If you want something light and fun, you should go see it.Some of the criticisms I've seen in other reviews don't hold up. Some say it just ripped off the original. Um, didja SEE The Force Awakens? Did you give that one star too?Some of my fellow dudes say Chris Hemsworth's character is insulting to men. It didn't insult me, but hey, I'm pretty good at answering a phone. Maybe you have some telecommunications insecurities?Some say the CG was bad. I never noticed it once. Are you just looking for parts of the movie you haven't complained about yet?So a bunch of people rated this movie one star. You, my friends, never paid full price to see Richard Moll in The Dungeon Master. If someone doesn't like this movie because it's action fluff without much gravity, I would get that, but it's not competing with the worst movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, and Good--But Not as Good as the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally caught the "Ghostbusters" reboot before it left theaters, and I thought it was a good, solid film--but just not quite as good as the original two films.On the plus side, this movie brings back most of the fun elements of the original two movies. There are scenes that at times flirt with being scary all while keeping a comedic vibe overall. The banter between the all female leading cast is witty and keeps up with the original cast. And, the original cast themselves make a few cameos--although one should note that this is a complete reboot and not a continuation of the original series. The cast of the original films play entirely different roles in this movie, and it's as though the first two films never even happened, so there's absolutely no reason to have to watch the first two films before seeing this one.That having been said, there are a few drawbacks to the film. One is that the banter between the all female leads does at time become a bit lewd in a way that the original films never were--I found that to be troubling since part of the fun of Ghostbusters has always been its appeal to children. Sure, the first two movies had their fair share of swear words, but having watched them both recently, they didn't have the same tendency for lewd humor that this movie has.Aside from that, the film is good but not great. It pays homage to the original well without being a complete rip off of its source material--but it nevertheless falls short of being on par with the originals.Having said that, though, I'd be a complete liar if I didn't note that Kristen Wiig is my new celebrity crush. :-)7/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fan of the original growing up. Surprised to learn initially that it was going to be an all female cast and not a sequel. Thought the trailers were OK but anticipated the special effects were going to be decent. Just came home finished watching it. I know there are a ton of bad user reviews, but I'm sorry, I loved it, I thought it was a great summer blockbuster movie. I thought the script/story was excellent, I thought most of the jokes were very funny. It wasn't just me it was the whole theater and that's how I know that was the honest genuine reaction. The special effects were even more amazing than I thought it would be, especially the ghosts and weaponry, wow. I love the ending of the story as well I thought that was a cool ending. I love the cast and especially Wiig and McKinnon who were very funny. Wiig plays a brilliant straight man to McKinnon and McCarthy's wackiness.As a boy growing up I loved the franchise, the movies, the cartoons the toys. I've watched many times the original with my kids. But I'm really proud to have brought them to see this one, especially for my little girl. She got to watch a sci-fi action comedy with a female cast, a very positive impression it will have for her to see strong female characters in this kind of genre as the heroes. If you haven't seen it, go see it, it's worth it. I would've given it a 9 but I'm going to give it a 10 in order to help average out the complete unfairness of internet trolls to rate this film a 1.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thoroughly enjoyed this film, it's fast, funny and has some great action. The new Ghostbusters worked so well together on screen and Chris Hemsworth will forever set the benchmark for Himbos! The cameos were fun to spot as well, with all the original cast shining in their brief roles. The writing was tight and some of the gags were so subtle but funnier for it, especially Kate McKinnon. Her lines and delivery were worth the price of admission alone, especially the scenes where they interview Chris Hemsworth's character.A worthy successor to the original Ghostbusters and much better than Ghostbusters 2. Is it better than the first, it's bit like saying is great steak dinner better than a great fish meal, no, they're both great but different.Will definitely be seeing it again and I'm looking forward to all the new cos players that this movie will undoubtedly spawn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I actually REALLY liked this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course I was aware of the "sexism" narrative built around this movie. And yes, I was motivated to watch it in order to support the movie because it received so much hate. I was aware that it's possible that the sexism narrative was blown out of proportions to hide the fact that perhaps this was a poor movie.I rented out the original before going to watch the reboot because I wanted to support the original too. And because I didn't really remember it. The original was a lot of fun, but from a 2016 perspective, there was a TON of things that made me cringe. I could elaborate, but I'm not reviewing the original here.And finally when I went to watch the reboot, well, I was surprised to find that I enjoyed the heck out of it. I was completely engaged the entire way through. I loved the characters, I loved their backstories, I loved the interactions between them. I'm not a huge action person, and maybe that's why I liked the action and thought the characters looked really cool. At first I had been in the camp of why would you need to shove the fact that it's an all female cast in your face all the time. But watching the movie, I realized that it did mean a great deal to me to watch women be so cool, whether in the action scenes or in their knowledge of science, engineering or history.I get that many people think that this was mediocre, but, honestly, there are a lot of people out there, and I suspect these would be women who like action or fantasy or sci-fi or similar genres who would really enjoy the heck out of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not see how this movie was feminist. I also don't see how someone can claim stereotype on another race when we all can be loud and obnoxious. I saw the trailers. I knew what to expect. This movie wasn't the best. It wasn't Laugh Out Loud Funny or a Must See. These words on the trailers are always used for every comedy ever released. We all should be used to that by now. So the Ghostbusters are women. Big deal. The way everyone acted. claiming feminist propaganda - that was stretching it. Everything was flipped for this movie and everyone lost their minds. Chris Hemsworth played the dumb secretary guy and that wasn't okay for others who had seen the film. Why? How many times have we witnessed women play a pretty but dumb secretary and no one even thought twice? But a man does it and that's a man hating thing? I thought the movie was okay. It wasn't the greatest. All the funniest scenes were shown in the trailer (I wish they would stop doing this for all films) so there weren't many laughs outside of that. It won't receive any awards or anything like that. Yes, some big things were changed such as Slimer and his girlfriend? The original ghost made an appearance but only for the sake of doing so... it trips and squishes the girls. These were all just cameos. I won't own this movie. All in all, it was okay.And that was that.</fullReview>

Put your big boy's panties on and let the girls take a few well deserved shots at the guys.

		<fullReview>The 4 female leads were fairly good especially Kate McKinnon. Some people expected them all to be individual female clones of the male ghostbusters but they weren't, they were their own individual characters. Chris Hemsworth comes across as a pleasant surprise in the secretary role. It's hard to look at the film as its own entity without comparing it to what came before as the overall plot is similar and it does add many references. It is at least respectful to the source material and doesn't attempt to lampoon the former films. It definitely had its laughs but the humour seemed more forced.Now the big elephant in the room was how were gender roles addressed? You can easily tell the target audience was females (both adults and children) which I didn't have a problem with. I half expected it to be extremely feminist and demeaning towards men with a bunch of misogynistic male characters acting demeaning to women but they didn't do that. There's antagonistic male and female characters so they didn't make gender much of an issue. They also didn't turn it into a chick flick which was good, Hemsworth's character is clearly portrayed as a dumb sex object but it's at least done in a humorous way. Females will probably like it more than males which is fine, I still enjoyed it for the most part and of course the original two films still exist. I'm sure in school yards boys and girls will argue which version is better so at the end of the day both sides have their own. Where it definitely lacked was the main villain and his motives. Gozer, Zuul, and Vigo were all terrifying villains with clear aspirations. This time around it felt like more of a cheap rehash of the first film. The plot in general is the weakest of the three ghostbuster films. I liked how the first films incorporated paranormal psychology (aka parapsychology) as opposed to simply having a bunch of ghosts out there for the heroes to catch, this one didn't divulge much into paranormal psychology, possibly because the bad guy pulling all the strings is human for most of the film and using the paranormal as a means to power. Also the new title track from Fall Out Boy is awful but luckily we do get one short rendition of the Ray Parker classic. Where it ended up better? The visuals are very impressive and the film used modern technology and 3D to its advantage. There were more ghosts and ghost bustings than the original film, the ghostbusters also had more tools than the standard proton packs and traps. I will say it has the best end credits of any film I'd ever seen, it actually gave a reason to watch the entire credits instead of just sticking around to see if anything else came. Final thoughts? Definitely not as good as the first two. It's a great theatre experience in 3d and I'd definitely recommend it but once it goes to home video and television, it might not be that re-watchable. I don't plan on purchasing it when it comes out, maybe in a few years I'll watch it again. I'd rate it 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far Better Than The Trailer Made It Look</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even before it was released, this Ghostbusters reboot had already been the centre of great criticism, even becoming the most disliked trailer in the history of YouTube. But whilst it never feels like this reboot completely escapes the shadow of the 1984 original, Paul Feig's Ghostbusters has successfully defied it's poor trailer by building on the talents and personalities of its entire cast to create a fun, up-beat and all-round entertaining experience. It more or less follows most of the basic plot beats of the original film. After ghosts begin to pop up in New York, three scientists (Wiig, McCarthy and McKinnon) begin to investigate and along with a subway employee who witnessed the ghosts called Patty (Leslie Jones) they form a team to start fighting these ghosts. The only major difference is this time the ghosts are being lured in to our dimension by a man named Rowan who detests humanity and wants to destroy everyone. He's a villain so uninteresting and generic you'll forget about him as you're watching it. Fortunately the rest of the cast are all hilarious. They avoid falling in to the trap of being gender swapped versions of the original Ghostbusters cast and instead let their own comedic styles and personalities form unique dynamics between the new characters without relying on the 1984 original. Wiig plays Abby, a paranormal expert who loses her tenure due to her belief in the paranormal. She is the most restrained member of the cast whose best strength is playing off the other cast members. McCarthy also does well by moving away from her brash and outspoken performances in films like Tammy and Bridesmaids, instead playing a lovable upbeat scientist, in a role that gives her a good opportunity to show of her physical comedic skills. Leslie Jones is at her best when she's reacting to the strangeness of everything that's going on like running away from a mannequin that's come to life screaming at it to stop. Chris Hemsworth plays the dim-witted secretary, in what at first could have risked being a one note joke of role reversing the dumb blonde stereotype. But Hemsworth seems to elevate the source material with some great comedic delivery that makes him become a surprisingly likable mascot for the film. Though the real show stealer is definitely Kate McKinnon whose hyper-energetic style dominates the film whenever she's on screen. Even when she's not the focus she'll be in the background doing loads of visual gags. She's a weird mixture of an oddball personality and some great physical comedy to create one of the most charming and bizarre characters from any of Feig's films.The film is definitely at its strongest when Feig lets his own style takeover and focuses on letting the casts unique personalities and chemistries lead the film. Some of the films best moments are where the characters are just given an opportunity to hang out, like when McKinnon and Wiig are at their new headquarters and randomly burst out in to a small song and dance number that accidentally sets the place on fire. In contrast the films weakest moments tend to be when it tries to homage or throw in too many call-backs to the original film. At times these are hilarious with cameos from Akroyd and Slimer being some of the best moments of the film that are bound to appease both fans and newcomers alike. But at other times the filmmakers try so hard to show their love of the original film that they end up turning away from the fun personalities of the characters and instead stop the film dead in its track to directly quote lines like "mass hysteria" from the original film. They do references like this so often throughout that it ends up feeling like the film is unable to stand apart entirely from the 1984 original. Also Feig does seem somewhat limited when it comes to some of the films big action set pieces and seems uncomfortable working with the heavy amounts of CGI. This is particularly clear in the films finale where the film sways away from the actress's chemistry that made the film fun and replaces it with an extended fight sequence against generic looking ghosts that feels like it drags on for way too long.Though there are still some creative aspects to these sequences. It is cool to see all the different weapons that the Ghostbusters have including things like whips, pistols and grenades that are something genuinely different to what we saw from the original Ghostbusters. And the film as a whole is definitely a lot of fun to watch. Unfortunately it's not going to be good enough to win over people who go in to the film expecting to hate it, but for anyone hoping for a fun movie this will not disappoint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I'm not a fan of Kristen Wig, and I didn't know any of the other actresses going in (other than knowing McCarthy was from Gilmore girls, which I don't watch), So I was unsure this one was going to be up my alley...But it absolutely was! It was funny, didn't take itself too seriously, had some excellent bull-crap science, and the dialogue was fabulous. I thought the ghosts, gags, and graphics were very in- keeping with those of the original film, and there were tons of lovely little references... the kind that fans of the original appreciate, and new folks don't particularly notice.The theater I was in laughed almost constantly, there were a couple of nice jump-scares, all the cast had excellent chemistry with each other, and there were some seriously bad-ass fight scenes-- which I definitely was not expecting from a bunch of comedians!I thought the characters were well fleshed-out, with good arcs (even Chris Hemsworth, who i think was supposed to be a throw-away character, got an arc)... and the casting was excellent! I can definitely see why so much of the original Ghostbusters' cast was excited for this addition, and chose to make cameos!If you're on the fence, go see it! At the very least, it's wacky science, good comedy (both physical and verbal), and visually exciting. I enjoyed the heck out of it!</fullReview>

It doesn't carry the exact same feel as the old one mind you but, I don't think that's what this movie was meant to do. Yes the original was great, but this one holds its own as well. There wasn't a boring second in this movie. The cast is strong and humorous, and I love the overall portrayal of women. These women were portrayed as intelligent, yet not stuck up, and their costumes were practically made (aka not for eye candy). This movie is great, especially for the new generation. My nieces are all looking up to their new heroes, the Ghostbusters. I 10 out of 10 recommend it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hated this movies marketing and ads but i went to see it and it was good. Ghostbusters 1 is still much better movie and is a classic comedy.But this movie after all of the hate was enjoyable and i chuckled a bit.It starts off very strong but drags but you are hocked at that point.----story--- The story was dark but it is the weakest part of the film.I did not like the motives of the bad guy because they never develop them enough. his only motive is everyone has hurt him his whole life. THAT'S IT ! Although i like the rest of the main cast and Chris Hemesworth who is an idiot! The movie has similar parts to the first but it is very subtle and is a bit noticeable but tries to stand on it's own. It does not know if it should be a homage movie or a reboot. It rips parts from the first movie and is a bit weak but is not bad.------comedy------ Ghostbusters is one of the best comedies of all time.Does this one make you laugh? Yes.Patty steals the show, Kevin the receptionist can be funny but not often.Erin and Abby are generic and bland though. Laughs can be found and chuckles happen a lot.The cameos were cool and are funny as well.------GHOSTS!-------- The ghosts in the trailer looked cartoony and bad but they are really detailed when you see them on the big screen. I think they should have used practical effects like they did with star wars the force awakens but CGI still works. Slimer was great and so was his girl. They acted so silly together and give a laugh.The slime reminded me of the stuff they use in game shows though.The white ghost did not look bad either and was great.-------------------------- verdict---------------------------------- Ghost busters is a silly scary supernatural comedy and is on par with Ghostbusters 2 in terms of quality and enjoyment. I hate the new fallout boy theme and marketing but it turned out quite good for what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a huge fan of the originals and had very low expectations toward another reboot, especially after hearing so much seemingly informed "fan" speculation about it during its "hype period" before it hit theaters. I couldn't imagine a scenario where the original actors could do a believable "pass the torch" type of story and with the passing of my favorite Ghostbuster, Harold Ramis, my hopes were lower still with the news of an all-female cast, pardon my sexism but that was a major point the dissenters were making. Another huge concern of mine was the effects; back in the 80's computer effects were SPECIAL, and they played a big part in the success, knowing the pop and no substance aspect of special effects of the past 20+ years, this worried me a lot about the new Ghostbusters movie. To me the ethereal effects would probably come off as campy.! That said, the movie isn't a continuation of the original's continuity, but a total re-imagining of the franchise. The women had good screen presence like the originals; the effects were actually on par with the originals but had an updated feel; the story flowed well from scene-to-scene; and there were many delightful surprises like the originals. This was truly a great film and introduction of the franchise to a new generation of fans. I hope all can go see this with joyful expectations!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see Ghostbusters with relatively high expectations after hearing the reviews. So so AWESOME!!!!!!!!! And I mean that in every way. They used a nice mix of effects. The humour ranged from slapstick and fart jokes to the heights of subtlety and sarcasm. They played appropriate homage to the original. I also thoroughly appreciated that there was no attempt to hammer home that the leads were women. They spent most of the time trying to point out that they were scientists. They may as well have all been redheads pointing out that they were scientists. It was not an integral part of the plot, they just happened to be female. They called out a lot of the misery women put up with via offhand comments, such as the joys of high heels, but they were not critical plot points. The all female lead cast in this movie is a seismic shift in entertainment politics. But, inside the script and on the screen they were simply awesome in those roles. Bravo and thanks! And okay the exquisitely flipped script of the receptionist was a glorious vindication.... Those who are trashing this movie seem to be falling into a limited number of categories: 1: racists. 2: misogynists or 3: entitled "I can't believe they dared to alter any part of my sacred childhood anythings" people. A glance at the demographics of those posters says a few things. The movie was funny as hell and well worth the in theatre ticket.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not going to be an uncommon comment amongst the reviews but, I have very, very fond memories of the original Ghostbusters films. The first completely blew my 9 year old mind, I became nigh on obsessed with ghosts for about 4 years and it cemented my life long love for Bill Murray. That's comedic love, not sexual may I point out. Ghostbusters II came out, however many years later and, it was good but not quite as good as the first. But, since the original came out in 1984, memories of it have grown fonder, hell, it's achieved legendary status in the minds of some which begs the big, fat question, in the minds of some , "why would someone remake such a classic. Why?""And why cast women in the main roles, what are you trying to do to us, Hollywood. The original had men, so this must have men, it won't work with women. Blah blah blah. If Bill Murray's not in it, it's not worth watching. The film hates men. All the male characters are made to look stupid. Yawn yawn, moan, yawn. "Get over it. I loved the original ghostbusters, you did too, put it to rest. You can still continue to love it, this new one won't spoil it. It won't be the same, but that's because it's a different film.Go along to the cinema, sit your ass down, turn off your resentful 9 year old's mind and just enjoy it for what it is - a funny, mostly well paced, mostly well written piece of fun. Remember fun? It's FUN!.The lead characters all gel very well with each other, timing's good and there's a lot of nice off the wall, improvised bits which add a lot of warmth and a sense of inclusion for the audience.There's tons of little nods to the original films, a bust of Egon Spengler in an early scene and cameos from everyone apart from Rick Moranis (Rick/Rik?) who's' given up acting and couldn't be enticed back even with the offer of nestling up against Signourney Weavers bust.Chris Hemsworth is well cast as the dumb receptionist that, inevitably goes bad because, Ghost stuff. I also liked that, on many occasions the settings and plots more nodded towards the originals than stole from them directly. Bit of a scene that's a bit like the scene in the library. Bit of a scene that's a bit like the scene in the hotel. That is, apart from the Marshmallow Man/Ghostbusters logo merging later in the film. And the fire station. Which has a decent enough joke constructed around it also. Yes, it ain't perfect, yes there's a few bits of humour that fall flat but, it's enjoyable. Don't expect a masterpiece but there's laughs, there's action, there's BILL MURRAY.Go on. Do it. And stay for the end credits. Right to the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie has ONE agenda and that is to have fun...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is one thing we have to remember, that when we saw the original and thought it was awesome, we were just kids. This is WHY the original went down as a lovable classic and became a small part of our childhoods. Therefore, Ghostbusters is a movie that is aimed primarily at kids but something the adults can laugh at too. Kids seem to make the greatest audiences than so many teens-adults. The reason being is that when kids enter a movie theater, they don't have any hate on their minds wondering if they will see anything political, sexist or even racist stereotyping going on, NO. They go in with ONE AGENDA, and it's one that makes kids seem a lot less childish and hateful than SOME adults seem to be ( SOME meaning not all obviously) ?. The kids agenda is ( to lay the emphasis ) TO WATCH A FUNNY MOVIE AND HAVE A LAUGH DOING SO! That's it, nothing more, nothing less, just pure fun. My daughter saw the original when she was 5 years old and loved it. Now, 5 years later, she got to see this new version and loved it more. So much that she wants to go and see it again. And she will do. ---------SOME SPOILERS AHEAD------------ There were some laugh out loud moments, when the Ghostbusters were trying out their ghostbusting gadgets and Slimmer hijacked the Ecto 1 and went for a joyride. Along with other gags and jokes, and not to forget Kevin, he was playing the dumb receptionist, he took part on delivering some funny moments. Some may think it was sexist, but please, there have been thousands of women playing similar bimboish roles in so many movies and TV shows, it'done a million times and then some?We females are well used to seeing women play the dumb roles and we don't care, it seems to be the norm. I never once felt the Kevin character was worth complaining about, it was funny. Men have played dumb roles too ( Dumb and Dumber, Stoogies, Mr Bean, PeeWee Herman, Caddyshack etc etc, ) for kicks, because people with a good sense of humour can laugh it off..You'd be a miserable sort if you took it all too thick. With that in mind, I loved Kevin's character, he made us laugh. Besides the laughs this movie came with cameos from all the original's leads I love how they prominently placed a bronze bust of the late Harold Ramis, which can be seen early in the movie and later note that they dedicate this movie to him, I felt was touching. I am glad I ignored the hate and got to see this?It's worth it.</fullReview>

It wasn't all about them, it was about the villain, it was about Kevin, even Andy Garcia had a great screaming match with a Jaws reference was had us adults cracking up.

		<fullReview>There has been a lot of hate and bile directed at this movie, most of it long before a single scene was even shot. My advice is to make up your own mind. It definitely doesn't desecrate the original (which had more than a few issues of it's own). There are plenty of nice nods to the original Ghostbusters and some fun cameos. They also get to have some fun with some of the trolling the movie has received online.Far from being a shot for shot remake with a different cast, this is a movie that stands on it's own. It's obvious that all the actors involved got to have plenty of fun with the script. There might not have been anything to immediately rival some of the iconic scenes from the original, such as the library ghost or 'that' dream sequence with Bill Murray. It's also obvious that very little of the movie was shot in New York, which is a shame but understandable given how expensive it is as a location. Hopefully this is something a sequel can rectify.The standouts in this movie were Kate McKinnon and Chris Hemsworth. Most people are probably only familiar with Hemsworth from the Marvel movies but he gets to have some fun here, especially in the end credits scene.My suggestion is to ignore the vitriol directed at the movie and go into it with an open mind. Who knows, you might even enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't judge the movie without actually seeing it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is one thing I hate, it's when people judge the movie without actually seeing it. The amount of negative reactions to this movie is ridiculous, while most reviewers deny the fact that they don't hate it because the main characters are female the opposite is sadly true. The second the all female cast was announced, it released a s*** storm of epic proportions. I do believe there is a very mean misogynist movement since the backlash first started and carried on through production, certainly reared it's ugly head as soon as the trailers came out and now it has continued through opening weekend. There is a segment of the ghost busters fandom that is very varied and had existed through decades. There is a sense of ownership that is among male fans that came out even when the project was announced and even members of the press were:"this is kind of a guy movie isn't it?" So there is a feeling that this movie belongs to guys and specifically belongs to guys who grew up with it. Well guess what Women also grew up with it so no it doesn't just belong to you and it seems the fanboys never actually grew up. There is no excuse for all the hateful comments the cast received not to mention the racist misogynistic comments Lesslie Jones received. It is absolutely fine to don't like a movie and give it a poor rating but can you at least watch it before all the hating. I strongly dislike the twilight franchise, I read the books and saw the movies and only after that I formed my opinion, I thought it was all horrible ( Buffy would kick Edward's behind) Ghostbusters had one of the lowest scores ever before it even came out so how do you justify that. Last Saturday my friends and I went to see the movie. I loved it, my friends loved and so did the rest of the audience, male and female. We all laughed, got spooked, giggled and most importantly had a really great time. It's genuinely a fun movie and as far as a reboot goes definitely not the worst thing ever done to mankind( surprise sweaty fanboys!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun movie with lots of laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really surprised to see all the negative comments and reviews regarding this movie. It was nothing groundbreaking but there is really nothing here to get worked up about. The comments about it being sexist or racist are ridiculous. It seems like most people formulated these opinions based on the trailer and just wanted something to complain about.I saw it in 3d IMAX last night and really enjoyed it. Some of the jokes fell flat, but overall, it was quite funny. The theater was mostly empty, but the people who were there were all laughing and having a good time.I thought that the all female cast was a fun choice. It was a good way to mix things up. They each brought a little something and had a lot of charisma. Kate McKinnon was especially creative with the way she played her character. And Chris Hemsworth's character is hilarious. It was actually refreshing to see the "dumb blond" comic relief played by a guy.The visuals were great. In fact, some of the CGI was very impressive. Other times, it looked a little cheesy, but a little cheese works fine in a movie like this. I went in with an open mind and not very high expectations, and was pleasantly surprised. Let's not over-think this people- it's just a movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't get the bad reviews. My daughter and I thought it was awesome!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure it may not be Shawshank Redemption or The Godfather, but it really isn't bad at all. In fact, it is probably as good as the original which was awesome! I don't really get what people have against this movie. Is it sexism? Do people have a problem with a group of empowered intelligent women who can accomplish something without men being involved? As a father of a young daughter that's my favorite part of the movie. I think we need more movies like this that show that women can be intelligent, single and independent. A woman doesn't need some dumbass guy to be whole and complete. Is society still threatened by that idea? Seriously, is that what everyone's problem with this movie is?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie - What is wrong with many of you!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>May contain spoilers.I cannot understand the massive negative criticism that this movie is getting. It points to a huge conspiracy plot in the movie industry. This movie was a REMAKE. What do you all expect. The story is going to be similar/the same, only this time the CGI was a thousand times better and they used a team of girls instead of men. I read a comment saying this was a man hating movie - such nonsense only displays that the person who made those comments has some serious insecurity issues.I sat in an Imax with the kids thinking 'the reviews are horrendous, what have I let myself in for'. As a result of the bad press there were only 8 people in the entire Imax for the showing (including my family of four). What followed was great great fun. It was funny. Even the team of women played their characters so well you could see who they 'were' in terms of the original movie. The male receptionist 'Kevin' WAS the exact male equivalent of the original airhead. My 6 year old who is a great fan of the original LOVED it, so much so that after finishing this review I have been persuaded by the two kids to take them back for a second showing today.There were huge nostalgic parts to the movie with cameo appearances for all but one of the original cast. Stop trying to compare the movie to the original and saying "it was too similar"it was a remake for Gods sake. The four leading ladies worked, the male airhead receptionist worked and made it all the more funny. There was a huge sense of internal satisfaction when once again we see the original disused fire station that we all became attached to so long ago, and the converted hearse. Big smiles from all when we got a glimpse of the stay puff marshmallow man!Lighten up everyone, take the kids and if you have no kids what the hell are you doing going to watch it and criticising it for anyway. It's a kids movie. My kids gave it a 10/10 but for my adult input I can't go that high so will stick at 9/10. Off to the second viewing now, the kids can't wait.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignore the angry reviewers and give this movie a chance!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew going into the theater that this was going to be full of cheesy humor and hefty laughs, and I wasn't disappointed. If you were a fan of Bridesmaids, the humor is similar and has just as many laugh-out-loud moments. If your brand of humor is no where near Bridesmaids, you might not like this movie (no harm, no foul). What I ask is that you at least give it a chance with an open mind instead of either: reviewing the movie without even seeing it, or going into the movie with your mind made up that this cannot be good since they are remaking such a national treasure (let alone with all women)! Is this a 10/10? Of course not. I wouldn't rank the original as 10/10, either. That being said, I would seriously consider watching this movie a couple more times while in theater because I found it that funny/entertaining. It simply might not be your cup of tea humor-wise, but I definitely got a kick out of it. So I ask you to give it a chance!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great writing, smart one-liners galore, talented comedic ensemble cast. Loved it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this in a sold out theater with an audience that laughed their asses off (as did I and my boyfriend) and clapped at the end. The snappy one-liners just kept coming, and the retelling of the backstory was handled pretty deftly. I also loved the unexpected bit of social commentary that came along with the main villain (a subtle response to the rationale often used by mass shooting perpetrators in the U.S.) Great cameos by most of the original 1984 cast, too. I grew up in the 80s and loved Ghostbusters, but I can honestly say I loved this new version more. I have a feeling I'll be buying this one to watch over and over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You know you're going to watch it so be prepared...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been excitedly anticipating this movie and did not watch the previews or read any articles so no story lines would be spoiled so I had no idea of the controversy surrounding this when I finally saw it.If you are a fan of the original you know you're going to want to see this, my suggestion would be if you can wait try to hold off until you can rent it. Also you might want to invite some friends over when you do, watching it solo you might not find it funny but sometimes group mentality can change affect your movie enjoyment.The first 5 to 10 minutes the movie I was very excited, it started off with a little bit of a scary scene that had me excited for tone of the rest of the movie. I thought we might get some chills and some laughs, but regrettably the comedy fell flat. We have to face facts that the type of comedy that is popular now is a lot different (and maybe not the right kind of Comedy for Ghostbusters) than what it was before. There was a lot of stream of consciousness dialog where the actresses sort of ramble and mumble what's on their mind and we in the audience are supposed to find that funny. It almost felt like the actors had not rehearsed before they filmed because they seem to just be chatting with one another and there was no feel of camaraderie. To befair I did laugh maybe 3 to 4 times in the course of the whole movie, and I did think while I was watching it that at least it held my interest but I guess I was hoping for a movie that made me laugh all the way through. There are a lot of slime jokes and a couple crude jokes that fell flat. The one real chance for comedy with Chris Helmsworth as a dumb blonde bombed. He could have been hilarious but his terrible stupidity eclipsed any believability. There's a scene where he keeps trying to grab something through the glass of a fish tank as though he's never seen one before. I actually thought he was supposed to be crazy rather than then dumb during the first part of the movie until the other actors kept commenting on his stupidity.I really didn't know any of the characters except for a nodding acquaintance with Melissa McCarthy. After reading a lot of the trivia on IMDb it appears that there were a lot of nods to the Animal House movies and SNL characters more than the Ghostbusters movie which is a bit confusing but may explain some of the attempts at humor a little more. Not only were the actors unfamiliar but the characters didn't endear themselves to me with the exception of the black actress who at least had some heart. In reading some of the reviews though I can see some of the stereotypes others commented on. The villain was lackluster and it might have been nicer if we were able to sympathize with him a little as I felt the director was trying to do but we didn't get much exposure to the bad guy before he was off doing his villain thing. He wasn't even a terribly good bad guy, I got the impression he was more of a vessel for something else though I never clearly saw what. And I was disappointed with Chris Hemsworth not only for his lame comedy but his portrayal of a villain as well. His character shows no interest in Ghostbusters and is only mildly interested in his coworkers yet suddenly mid movie he appears wearing a jumpsuit and claiming he wants to be part of the gang and a Ghostbusters as well. Apparently that's how it's done because the fourth lady Ghostbuster simply inserted herself into the group by "joining the club" and then later it is revealed she quit her job to become a Ghostbuster which was a weird way to incorporate a member and rather unbelievable at that.There's a lot of techno-babble thrown around in this movie and I swear had I played a drinking game where every time they said "let's go save our city" I would have been drunk right there in the theater. There are one or two semi chiller moments that did add to the fun, the mannequin part had me ready to cover my eyes and peek through my fingers but the scene does pan out in a non scary way. Having said that you may want to be cautious allowing children under 13 to see the movie, it might be a little scary for them (not to mention there's a scene towards the beginning of the movie where a man gives the ladies the middle finger about seven or eight different ways, though some may find that funny I guess). Also, I did have fun looking for the cameos from the original and I thought I missed Sigourney Weaver's so be sure and stick it out to the credits because she is in there.Bottom line you know you are going to see this movie,try not to read any of the extreme high or extreme low reviews, this flick is probably somewhere in the middle and you shouldn't feel guilty if you do like it nor should you feel bad if you realize this did not live up to your expectations but I think for a lot of true fans it simply will not. Take it with a grain of salt and just enjoy it as a mild summer blockbuster, don't think about it too hard (don't expect to laugh though) and I think you might enjoy this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gags, guns, ghosts, girl power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon release of the allegedly "lousy" trailer of Paul Feig's gender- bender reboot of the 1984 classic, Ghostbusters, netizens immediately imagined numerous ways how it could go wrong. Sure enough, this controversy is addressed during the film with a misogynistic, break-the-fourth-wall YouTube comment to a ghost footage, "Ain't no bitches gonna hunt no ghosts." Perhaps, this where the reboot shines best ? it is unapologetically confident and goofy at the same time. Ghostbusters gets the business done by strapping on a proton pack and carefully aiming at its themes ? gags, guns, ghosts and girl power.One step away from earning her tenure, physics professor Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) is dragged back to the world of paranormal investigation when her friend Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy) and an eccentric engineer, Jillian Holtzmann (Kate Mckinnon), coerced her to accompany them into a historic New York mansion believed to be haunted with ghosts. As the group witness and upload online a malevolent ghost attack, enthusiastic transit worker Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones) signs up for action and even provides a vehicle for their adventures ? her uncle's hearse, soon refashioned to Ecto-1. Also enlisted as the group's secretary is the unbelievably stupid Kevin (Chris Hemsworth) who is hired mainly due to his physicality made of "pure muscle and baby-soft skin." (as Erin points out). One thing leads to another and "The Conductors of Metaphysical Examination" opens in business with the mission to capture ghosts using proton packs and an array of unstable-looking equipment. It doesn't take a while before the media starts dubbing them as the "Ghostbusters."If there's something wrong with this movie, it's definitely not the four perfectly-cast female leads. They are in fact the film's greatest strength. Wiig's underplayed style of comedy may be outshined by other casts but she's also allowed by the script to occasionally lose control. I'm pointing out to a hilarious scene when she hysterically warns people to evacuate the city while being dragged by a couple of security guards. McCarthy may be more restrained here compared to her role in Spy and Bridesmaids, but she still manages to be sharp and snappy especially in picking fights with her delivery boy over the number of wantons in her soup. Jones' loudness never comes as annoying to me. Her reaction when a gremlin/dragon (or whatever that thing is, does that qualify as a ghost?) perches on her shoulders is one of the film's best moments. Special commendation to Hemsworth for taking on a role that does not rely mainly in the looks department but also one that requires comedic chops to pull off. His character though is just too stupid to be real: He hangs up the phone whenever he's overloaded with info and stops to grab a sandwich amidst an action-packed fight. The real MVP, however, is McKinnon. She could be babbling instructions how to operate gadgets or just there in the background munching Pringles ("Try saying no to these salty parabolas.") still she constantly steals scenes with her punk swagger.Ghostbusters is a seminal classic that requires to be approached with care and consideration. Director Feig's challenge here is not to capitalize mainly on nostalgia but also to add something refreshing to the franchise. Feig does an excellent job in casting and introducing more ghost-busting gadgets but the script itself (co-written with Katie Dippold) could have use more ingenuity. By the third act, the comedy is slightly trampled by the gorgeous and glowing CGIs that the film obviously laid most of its budget for. I generally enjoyed more the first half a.k.a. getting to know the ghostbusters part. When it comes to paying homage, this reboot certainly does not forget and includes copious amounts of cameos from the original cast (eight, if I'm accurate) most of which, however, fall flat. Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, Slimer and this time, her female counterpart is also present in this film ? these are the moments when the movie stops to wink at its established fan base. I just hoped that Feig has more confidence in his current cast than being too subversive to its predecessor. Smart choice, however, on using more of the original "Ghostbusters" theme sung by Ray Parker, Jr. rather than Fall Out Boy's version (The former is way better and that, I can agree with the majority.)Purists who believe that Hollywood is doomed to the endless stream of recycling old films will still be hard-pressed to care about this reincarnation, or will even metaphorically spout torrents of ectoplasmic green slime after seeing it. Still, this is Feig's so far most visually engaging film. Did I laugh? A lot of times, actually. This is worth watching for the four female leads alone and for that, it is safe to say that this reboot of Ghostbusters successfully passes the torch to a new generation. This is no masterpiece but it's a solid piece of summer entertainment."Bustin' makes me feel good!"Full review: http://www.filmpolicereviews.com/reviews/ghostbusters</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really enjoyable film that's been too heavily criticised</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I could, I'd give this a 7.5/10.For some reason- and I actually don't think it's due solely to misogyny, people have said some truly horrible things about this film. People criticized the comedy, implying that the original ghostbusters was some 10/10 comedy where you're lying on the floor laughing, which it simply wasn't. The whole idea behind ghostbusters is to be a little bit silly, quite sweet at times and to kick some ghost butt and this film definitely did that. To those who say that the film contained 'awful racist stereotyping' in Leslie Jones's character, have you ever seen an interview with Leslie Jones? She talks that way, it's who she is and she's brilliant. Leslie Jones is awesome and most likely put that whole spin on her character and for you to say that's 'racist stereotyping' is to say that Leslie's personality is somehow racist? If they had cast Kerry Washington or Halle Berry and then forced them to act in a kind of 'urban stereotype.' of course that would have been racist. But Leslie Jones was great in this film and stop trying to turn this into something it's not. Anyway, I really liked this film. It was funny and witty. The story line wasn't the most ingenious but that's the most important thing in a comedy about killing ghosts. Kate Mckinnon was especially fantastic and provided the Weird that ghostbusters needs. Melissa McCarthy's character was endearing and Kristen Wiig pulled off her awkward, tweed-wearing character well. The CGI was extra ridiculous and added to the fun of the film, I particularly appreciated the slime and there are some awesome fighting scenes that contain the perfect balance between funny and kick-ass.This film is not man-hating. People complained that every mam in the film was either dumb or evil. The are TWO main male characters in the film. I'd also like to point out that Chris Hemsworth's character of the ditsy receptionist is just simply changing the gender of the original female receptionist. Would you have preferred them to change the gender of the ghostbusters, but keep the receptionist a woman? That makes zero sense. The other man was the villain and what's wrong with that? Seriously I don't see the problem, they probably made the character a man to even out the women to man ratio. Were they supposed to create a whole new MALE character who was liked just to appease those who leap at the phrase man-hating whenever there's an openly feminist film released.When you watch this film, just embrace it for what it is, a bit of fun. Don't try to pick at it because you'll ruin it and it's supposed to be enjoyed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much fuss over an average movie, but still entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to go and watch the movie by myself. Not that it should matter, but I am a 41 year old male.In short, I enjoyed the film, and I have no complaints. It cannot replace the original, simply because no film can top the original.That aside, it was an okay movie- nothing astounding, but a fun, entertaining 90 minutes.I am a fan of Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig anyway, but now I am a huge fan of Kate McKinnon- for me, she stole the show!Regarding the feminist stigma attached to this project, I am more of an 'Equalitist' than a Feminist, and not that it really matters, but I think a mixed Ghostbusters team would have been more representative of Equality. In the end, the cast and crew worked hard on a film that was going to be a thankless task anyway, and I for one, appreciated it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent comedy - barely avoids disaster porn cliché</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was entertaining. While I can quote some lines of the original, I cannot remember anything special about the remake. I do remember the first jokes are shockingly bad, so bad I groaned. There was a certain campiness to the ghost that seemed in contrast to the Ghostbusters themselves. The action scenes seemed a little to polished and extensive for women who were just given their equipment (invented and created overnight), and no one told not to cross the streams.The end barely avoided the disaster porn pitfall, and I have feeling was cut extensively.The original GhostBusters cast all had parts, but they seemed forced, and more of an afterthought. The two surprising standouts were Kate McKinnon and Neil Casey, who really nailed their parts and stole every scene they were in. McKinnons character is bordering on being, yet another, Mary Sue.Overall, its was an entertaining entry, only marred by some unrealistic action scenes and forced cameos.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Honest Opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. Everyone seems to hate this movie except me. I'm not sure why, I mean, this movie is no Godfather but it certainly isn't the worst movie I've ever seen either. I'm going to take the risk of being tared and feathered by the IMDb community and write something positive about this movie. Because guess what, I genuinely enjoyed it.What's to enjoy? The all female cast (there I said it. Sue me); Do the characters fall flat at times? Sure, I'll admit that. However there were some admirable traits to each character that paid homage to the original set of Ghostbusters. Here's a quick breakdown:Kristen Wiig's character is a hopeless romantic who comes off as slightly annoying just like Bill Murray's character in the original.Melissa McCarthy's character is the ambitious yet na?ve character that Dan Aykroyd played.Kate McKinnon is the weird and awkward scientist, just like Harold Ramis.And just like Ernie Hudson, Leslie Jones plays the "normal" team member who asks the plot-driven questions to help the audience understand the scientific on-screen jargon. (This really was Winston's purpose in the original film, look it up).I like these four actresses. Individually they do great work. As a team of four they do okay, but overall it's a good dynamic of weird, serious, and funny performances from the group as a whole.Stop complaining about Chris Hemsworth being the dumb and pretty receptionist. For every one guy that plays the mindless eye-candy in a movie there are like fifteen women that play the same role in other movies (just watch any of the 3,000 James Bond films).This film is definitely an underdog story both on and off the screen. The plot is simple and straight forward but that is common with big budget Hollywood films. Honestly, if you ask me why this film stands out amongst the summer Hollywood canon, I would say it's because of the progressive and bold move by the filmmakers to cast all females. Does that automatically make the film good? Certainly not, but it also does not make the film automatically bad. Overall, I found the movie fun and entertaining. As far a re-boots go, there have been way, way worse re-boots that haven't had nearly as much criticism. If you think my judgment is off, I'll give you my personal top 5 and bottom 5 movies and then you can gauge my film quality experiences, standards, and assessments from there.Top Five: 1. The Abyss 2. Jaws 3. Independence Day 4. Back to the Future 5. Mad Max: Fury Road Bottom Five: 1. Batman &amp; Robin 2. Star Wars: Episode II ? Attack of the Clones 3. Fantastic Four 4. Jurassic Park III 5. Spider-Man 3There. Use this information to determine weather or not I have good or bad taste in movies. If you agree with this list in the slightest, then there's a small chance you'll find it in your critical, movie savvy heart to find some good in Paul Fieg's Ghostbusters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very funny movie. This is exactly the case when the sequel (or remake, call it what you will) is a very enjoyable and very hilarious one. The tempo of this almost 2-hour long movie is very fast, and the modern CGI Dept make this film a huge bag of fun. Cameo appearances of classic Ghostbusters cast and Ozzy as Himself add a certain gusto and a greater fun to this even really merry and jolly comedy. Melissa McCarthy as Dr. Abby Yates Kristen Wiig as Dr. Erin Gilbert Kate McKinnon as Dr. Jillian Holtzmann Leslie Jones as Patty Tolan Chris Hemsworth as Kevin Beckman Cecily Strong as Jennifer Lynch Andy García as Mayor Bradley this is just a few and they all deliver awesome lines, both deep and humongous approach.

		<fullReview>The bad news about this movie? It goes a little slow in places. There is one obscene gesture that lasts quite a while. I don't remember any other vulgarity. The rest is good news.The cast is 100% delight. I didn't mean to love Melissa McCarthy, but I do. She is hilarious. Her deliveries are hilarious, as is her acting.Kristen Wiig brought a nice verisimilitude I didn't expect. She has a kind of sweetness, a familiarity, something approachable that makes you love her.Where has Kate McKinnon been all my life? How is it possible to make over-the-top that believable? And that enjoyable? The word for Leslie Jones is "perfect". And that obscene gesture I talked about, that's what I want to express to the critics who say they shouldn't have made this movie with a cast of women.And keep alert for how much fun Chris Hemsworth has lampooning his great good looks. It's joyous! The cast gives a great ensemble performance. The earlier two were star vehicles for Bill Murray with everybody else supporting him. This is a true ensemble, and every character is more interesting than any character in the originals. And I loved the originals! Watch for the cameos (You did expect cameos, didn't you?). They are delicious.And be prepared for the feeling of ice water splashed down your back. There are some nice, surprising chills.One a scale of 1-10, I would rate this between 6 and 7. It's not a great movie, nothing life-changing or epic. But it's fun, worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"If there's something strange, in your neighborhood. Who you gonna call?" The answer to that question was so much simpler before this year. Ever since the announcement of the reboot, there has been epic debate about the quality of this upcoming film. Quotes like this will suck because it's not the original cast, or how dare they replace the Ghostbusters with females! Well putting the stupid sexism battles aside, this reviewer is back to share his thoughts on the latest movie to haunt the theaters. So let's get startedThe GOOD: ? A fun story ? Leslie Jones ? VisualsOkay, lets get if off our chests right now, the story is not as good as the original. However, that doesn't mean that it's bad either. This installment's tale is a decent origin story that places our heroines against a deranged, albeit lame, bad guy with an obsession for ghosts. As simple as it is, the story has many entertaining moments and set a fast pace to keep those with short attention spans into the mix. While it certainly lacks the mysterious, darker qualities that brought suspense to the first installments, it still has some fun to it and sets us up for a potential sequel (especially the end credits scene) Perhaps a bigger topic of debate though, is the cast itself. I'm going to lay it out right now that I have no biased towards male or female actors, my analysis is based on what they bring to the movie. This assembled cast is notorious for comedy, and they bring their usual bag of tricks to the screen in hopes of getting you to laugh. Of the leading ladies, Leslie Jones was my favorite of the bunch. As promised in the trailers, Jones brings bold, brash comedy that nearly had me rolling in the aisles. While her loud rants and meme worthy faces are entertaining, I mainly enjoyed her sarcastic jabs, statements of the obvious, and bitter monologues the most. In terms of visuals, modern technology continues to be impressive as our ghosts were brought out in a grand visual display. While the make up and realism were tapered down, the ghosts had the wispy, ectoplasmic look that we often associate with ghosts. Fortunately the new technology allowed for fluid animation and very unique looking ghosts. Even the proton packs, and the assorted other gadgets, have some flare as well, with dazzling sound effects and flashy colors. These provided some exciting action scenes, again being a bit on the overdramatic side that brought nostalgia back. The BAD ? Forced humor ? A story missing suspenseAs I feared from the trailers, the biggest fault for this reviewer was the forced humor of this movie. If you remember the classic films, the writers produced clever dialogue, witty insults, and relied on the actors' delivery to provide the comedic punch. Not the case in this movie. Our SNL cast has brought their modern touch to the mix, which means less cleverness and more infusion of overacted silliness. Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy deploy their usual stunts to spur out laughs, this means lots of prolonged banter, recurrent jokes, and sometimes overrated comedy. I know it's their method these days, but it would have been nice if they had injected some more wit into the mix. And Kate McKinnon had some well timed moments, but like the others the overzealous antics get stale and lost it's punch. As for Chris Hemsworth, well this movie attempted to make him funny, but failed immensely for me. Our writers focused on his looks being his selling feature, while belittling his intelligence to that of a rock. His lines can be humorous at times, but making him a complete boob (or better phrased idiot) got old? quickly. Fortunately there are a few moments where the stupidity lightens up, especially in terms of the well-placed cameos, but for the most part the comedy is overstretched and overdoneDespite the story being fairly entertaining, it did lack a lot of the suspense and mystery that the other tales had. We know who the main villain is from the start, and I must say he wasn't that impressive. You remember Goza the Destroyer, or even Viggo the Destroyer? They were terrifying and dark in their control of the paranormal forces. But Rowan wasn't that well developed and his ability to manipulate the dimensional portals was a bit of a stretch even for me to swallow. Thanks to the comedic approach of the movie, the story lost much of its edge, the danger essentially absent until the very end when the action stirs up and the girls kick butt. Sure these scenes have little suspense behind them as well, but it finally gets things stirred up a bit. Perhaps if the team had traded some story for the comedy things would have been better, but Hollywood still refuses to find balance. The VERDICT Is Ghostbusters the worst movie of the summer? Not even close, but it certainly has ground to make up in the sequel that I believe will come. The cast is not the worst part of the movie, but more of the writing and direction they took it. If you want the Ghostbuster cleverness with well written dialogue and sarcasm, then you best skip this film altogether. However, those who are fans of the current SNL theatrics will surely find entertainment in this film. While the visuals are certainly impressive, I can't say they warrant a 3-D showing due to the lacking story and action. This reviewer does encourage catching it at home though. My scores are: Comedy/Fantasy/Sci-Fi: 6.5 Movie Overall: 5.5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it wasn't awful...!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see Ghostbusters in IMAX 3D. First, let me start off by saying that the 3D in this movie was the best i've ever seen in a movie.... by a landslide. Second, although the storyline had many plot holes and the characters were upsetting to watch at times, it did keep you entertained throughout the movie. Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy's characters had great chemistry to work with. Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones were both the heart and soul of the movie that kept the comedy and people laughing. Chris Hemsworth.... had no purpose whatsoever to be in that movie besides the fact that they needed to draw teenagers ages 13 to 18 to see a movie that was a reboot. Although it didn't match the original Ghostbusters at all, it did a good job of entertaining the audience and keeping them on their toes both with the plot and wanting more laughter. B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but probably because the bar was so low.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm as surprised as anyone by this. First off, we can probably all agree that Sony completely botched the marketing for this movie; three awful trailers, an egregious tie-in song, and one interview after another with the cast fomenting the man-hating furor on social media. Just, bravo. It felt like an agenda movie from day one, so who wouldn't walk into this with reservations? The strange thing about it is that I found myself laughing a lot more than I'd expected. The material that didn't work at all in the trailers seemed to do pretty well in the context of the actual film. There's a nice chemistry between the leads, and that made up for quite a bit. Now don't get me wrong, it's uneven, at best. The script is chock-full of jokes - just one after another - and when they thud, it's painful. At some point (somewhere around the first suiting-up moment) the comedic magic dissipates, and it's pretty mediocre from there. Just when everything's clicking, cue Fall-Out Boy to mess that right up. I did enjoy the first half much better and, oddly enough, that's before all the cameos start pouring in. Here I was expecting to see old familiar faces, and they're shoved to the back half when the ha-has dry up.Unfortunately, the movie is hyper-aware of the anti-feminism sentiment (more than a few "screw the naysayers!" lines), so you never really forget about it to settle in and have a good time. But it is better than the Internet gods (or trolls) would have you (anyone) believe.But believe me, there is room for improvement.6/10(Updated 07/19/16): Ended up seeing it a second time with my wife, and it was a similar story for her: she couldn't believe how night-n-day this was compared to the advertising, and she really took to Kate McKinnon. For me, the jokes that originally worked didn't hold up as well the second time (they're just sort of overwrought). It's not bad enough to change the rating, but the "holes" were much more apparent this time. I do still think that McCarthy's Chinese food troubles were the best jokes, and that, oddly enough, Leslie Jones is actually the heart of this ghostbusting team.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off i personally have no idea why everyone is 'hating' on this movie or calling it a 'man-hating mess'. If women are in a movie does that justify calling it a 'man-hating mess?'. This movie was funny, witty, had a great cast, high-tech special effects that the original was missing and never a dull moment. I am a man and I would definitely go to see this movie again, it wasn't targeted primarily at women it was targeted at people that simply want a good movie to watch. When Itunes releases this for Pre-Order i will be sure to purchase it, please if anything don't believe in the stigma associated with this gem of a film. Just go and see it :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll admit, I wasn't sure about this movie after seeing the first trailer. I saw lots of bad things written about it, lots of men my age were vehemently opposed to it even existing. I see a lot of the reviews on this page and I just think they're wrong. This movie was fun. I enjoyed it very much. It made me feel excited about Ghostbusters like when I was a kid. I loved the original films, and I remember skipping Boy Scouts just so I wouldn't miss the cartoon back in the '80s. I had the toys. But this didn't ruin anything about my childhood. It took me back. It doesn't matter that it's women or men, I want to watch a fun movie about Ghostbusters, and that's what this is. Kate McKinnon is awesome, and Chris Hemswoth is hilarious. There was a real missed opportunity with Leslie Jones, I thought she should have been a scientist and maybe someone else could be the MTA worker and it would have worked better. I can't wait to watch it again, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow. Lots of haters up in here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Look, it's pretty simple. This is a stupid comedy remake of a stupid comedy from the 80s. Anybody trying to uphold the original Ghostbusters as some sort of untouchable masterpiece is trolling. That was a movie that had a female ghost sucking off Bill Murray, FFS. Anyone who goes into this film expecting Shakespeare or Schindler's List is going to be disappointed. Were there issues? Absolutely. And I can sit here and list them all, I'm sure. But here's the deal. At the end of the movie, when I walked out of that theater, I walked out with a grin on my face. I spent $10 and two hours of my time, and I was smiling at the end of it. And that's really what a summer comedy is about. People in my theater--which was about half full on a Saturday night around 8pm start time--laughed at the jokes, and there were a lot of people walking out saying, "man, I'm surprised at how fun that was."All the cameos were great, and it was apparent that EVERYONE involved had a great time making this movie (especially Chris Hemsworth, man he was obviously hamming it up every chance he could, and loving it). It was meant to be light-hearted fun, and that's what it was. I thought the four main actresses killed it together. There were enough hat-tips to the original to satisfy all of us 80s kids, but not enough to get old. The villain could have been better fleshed out, if anything I thought he was the weakest link in the movie. Predictable as all get-out. If they do another one, I hope Feig &amp; Co. feel they can take more chances with the next one. My husband, who was originally quite MEH about the prospect of going to see this because he doesn't care for the SNL actresses, said, and I quote, "This is how you remake an 80s classic." He walked out of the theater grinning as well, and very pleased. I can't give this movie a 10 because it wasn't perfection. But it was a solid 7. Solid comedy outing from Feig &amp; Co. Would see again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was well done, and had great cameos throughout it. The only real complain I had was that the ghosts looked "too pretty" due to the cgi. Other than that, I really enjoyed the movie. You have to stay through all of the credits to take everything in (hope that's not a spoiler!). I know people complained about the lack of chemistry between characters, and I think that that was intentional as there were tensions and not everyone truly knowing each other. I think we will see them more cohesive as a group in the second movie.Did it have its silly moments? Sure! Where they THAT bad? Not at all! Nothing will ever beat the original, but this is a solid modern Ghostbusters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first there was no way I was going to see Ghostbusters. The trailer didn't really appeal to me and I hadn't seen the original movie. But after I saw that some people had problems that the main characters were female, I knew I HAD to see it. Why? To support intelligent female main characters kids can look up too.And let me tell you, if I were younger I'd look up to these girls. I'd dress up as them for Halloween instead of the typical princess or witch. I'd want to hunt ghosts and be as smart as them, I'm glad they decided to go with an all female cast.What I Liked&#x25fe;The main characters were amazing. I loved how smart they were, how funny they were and I loved their friendship. For once, I don't think I could really pick a favorite character, they were all great in their own ways. Each of the main four girls had their own personalities, they were nerdy, and awkward, and weird but in a good way. They were someone a girl (or guy!) could look up too and think, "I want to be like them one day." Plus it was actually funnier than I thought it would be. &#x25fe;Kevin (Chris Hemsworth.) He was SO HILARIOUS! Usually I never laugh in a movie but all of the characters, especially Kevin, where super funny. People thought that the movie was sexist because there wasn't a single smart guy character, so let me just address that for a moment. I know that it's frustrating having no role models to look up too in a movie, how do you think women have felt for years in the movie industry when all there roles are Princesses, love interests, plot devices or mothers? Just let the girls have this movie. One other thing about Ghostbusters, not all of the guy characters were unintelligent. The villain was a smart, socially awkward, lonely guy. So you can't say that all the male characters weren't smart. &#x25fe;I think my favorite part of the movie was the final battle. It looked SO SO cool. I think it was incredibly well done and I'd love to go back and see it again. &#x25fe;The visual effects in this movie were stunning! I don't care what people say, I loved how the ghosts were saturated in one color, it really helped set the mood.What I Didn't Like&#x25fe;One thing that made Ghostbusters less appealing to me was the plot, or lack thereof. It wasn't an in-depth story line, but Ghostbusters is supposed to focus more on the humor, with a light-hearted focus on ghost hunting. &#x25fe;The trailer didn't really do it justice. When I first saw the trailer for Ghostbusters I was kind of taken back. The trailer made the movie look like it was going to be really stupid, and the character posters with the quotes didn't help. Honestly, the trailer made me not want to see the movie because it portrayed the movie as a low quality, gross, waste of time with lame jokes. The sounds in the trailer made it look weird too Overall&#x25fe;Ghostbusters was really good! I'm glad I went to go see it, despite what the reviews said and the trailer showed. It had an amazing cast that knew how to make me laugh. With smart main characters and light-hearted ghosts hunting, what more could you want?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, it's the film that practically no one has looked forward to (except a select few, including me). The fact that there was more content being added to the Ghostbusters universe thrilled me so much, and the fact that it was an all female cast? Makes a change for once.The plot was good, it kept you interested and wanting to know what happened next, and I personally didn't find myself getting bored at all, which does sometimes happen during films. You can see a lot of thought had been put into it, with interesting moments where you go 'OOOHH!'.There was good humour in it, with me giggling a lot and occasionally literally 'laughing out loud'. Some kid friendly jokes and a few sneaky adult jokes thrown in to get you laughing. It isn't just a funny film either, there were a few heartfelt moments where you appreciated friendships.The characters were all lovable, my favourite being Holtzmann. The way the four leads all interacted with each other made you jealous for your own friend group to be like that. They made jokes with each other and were just general bad-ass ladies when it came to kicking those ghosts' butts. Kevin, their receptionist, was a lovable 'stupid' character. He was the 'dumb-blonde woman' in this film, expect, of course, he is a man. How about that, stereotypes? There are also lots of homages to the original, a load of fun cameos, as well as a lovely tribute to the great late Harold Ramis. If you were a fan of the original, you'll be a fan of this one, trust me.Overall, I'd definitely give this film a watch! Ignore all the people who are saying it's a sh!t film when they haven't even watched it yet. You go see it and make your own opinion. If you don't like it, that's fair enough! We all have different views. But in all honesty, this was genuinely an amazing film that me and my family loved. Definitely a new favourite!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ghostbusters needs Trollbusters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two words - Kate Mckinnon - She is the best and adds a great quirky performance as Jillian Holtzmann, their engineer. The movie was uneven overall. Some of the humor worked and some just fell flat. The pacing was a little slow and the chemistry between the characters was not quite working, with the exception of McKinnon who fit perfectly with the crew. McCarthy and Wiig's characters were supposed to have a history but this was not well established. The storyline was very similar to the first Ghostbusters movie but with the reboot they had a chance of creating something more interesting and original with the assistance of today's CGI. Just to set the record straight - there was no Man-Hating (whatever that is) nor was this an anti-male movie (whatever that is). Chris Hemsworth plays Kevin, the receptionist, and is hilarious, each interaction with him brings unexpected and puzzling responses. Despite my criticism the writing was not all bad, just really uneven. There is a cameo by each of the original ghostbusters including Harold Ramis - watch for the bust, who died in 2014 - though I did not see a Rick Moranis cameo (may have missed it). If you are a Ghostbusters fan I would recommend it - even if only to criticize. Pay close attention to the mansion tour guide and his patter - hilarious. With a new (and more experienced director), and better writers, I would not mind seeing a sequel with the same crew.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mixed but pleasant summer surprise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ghostbusters begins with a strong start, a tour of Aldridge Mansion leads to a tense and interesting introduction with familiar beats to the library sequence of the original. This sums up the majority of the films pro's and cons. for every great and fun idea the film has, it's held back by it's need to remind us of the previous films.The main cast hold the film up and each come into there own as the new Ghostbusters but out of all of them Kate Mckinnon stands out. Mickinnon plays the role of Jillian Holtzmann, the teams tech expert and weapon quartermaster. She steals every scene with her impressive range of body-language and subtle visual jokes. The best part of the film is a battle sequence near the end of the film where the camera is squarely focused on Holtzmann with the classic Ghostbuster theme playing as if cheering for her.But for every strong moment from the main cast it can't save it from it's villain of the film, Rowan. Compared to more grand villains of the franchise; Gozer and Vigo. Rowan comes off as small scale and lacking in character, even his master-plan lacks originality and intelligence. But while the film falls on it's antagonist, it gains strengths from it's cast, colour and effects. With special mention of Gertrude Aldridge and her wonderful appearance from the basement during the intro sequence.In the end, Ghostbusters builds an OK foundation for a future possible franchise, with a stellar cast, great visuals and some nice jokes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it the original? No. Is it perfect? No. Is it an entertaining movie that pays homage to the past? Yes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be easy to say that all the negative reviews out there for this movie (GB16) are complete garbage, that they're part of some weird conspiracy to ensure that GB16 fails, and in so doing somehow preserves the original. It would also be incorrect - though it does seem to apply to some of the more extreme ones out there. It also feels unfortunate that I have to declare this in a review, but it seems necessary: I'm a man, and I'm also a fan of the original Ghostbusters movie (GB84), less so of II. Despite that, I enjoyed this one, and would be cautiously optimistic to see sequels with this cast.When the movie was announced as being a reboot, with an all-female team of Busters, I was concerned. That concern didn't come from the new team being all female, but from the new team not being the old team. Given that I was 1 year old when the original came out at the movies, I don't actually remember a time in my life where I hadn't seen it, and don't remember the first time I saw it. In no way perfect, and with several references I wouldn't get until I was at least 12 or 13 (or if my parents are reading this, I still don't get) I loved it. All of which meant that anything that came after it was going to suffer in comparison unless it was somehow perfect. (Just look at II.)As I alluded to in the title, this isn't a perfect movie. There are a couple of gags that feel forced or left to run a little long. There's what you might call "background entertainment" during the closing credits that I suspect may have originally been part of the main movie but was thankfully relegated to where it is now, which actually helped pass the time during the credits for those of us waiting to see whether there was a post-credits scene. There are one or two failures of logic when you go back and think about it - and I don't mean the movie's paranormal science logic, just the real world stuff. And yes, a couple of the CGI effects, particularly towards the end and the effects are fullscreen, are a little rough around the edges. But at the end of the day, the movie did it's job: I was entertained the whole time it was running. I liked the new Busters. Though there are similarities to the original, they aren't lifted wholesale and stuck together in a mish-mash, they are changed to suit the new story and characters. And it for me it manages to find the right balance between telling a story and not taking itself too seriously while doing so. Slight spoiler, though not a story one, the cameos feel nicely timed. I think for fans of the original they may take you out of the movie for a bit, but for the new generation that will watch this first it probably won't matter, and for fans like me it was nice to see and felt like a blessing to continue.For people new to the franchise I think you'll enjoy it. For fans of the original, you should enjoy it too, just remember that "different" doesn't mean "bad". And know that if you genuinely don't like this movie - or refuse to watch it for whatever reason - that Peter, Ray, Egon and Winston, along with Dana, Louis, Janine and Slimer will still be there for you: Sony didn't acquire every copy in existence of the original and destroy them. You still get to choose who you're gonna call.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Messy and imperfect, but still lots of fun and very respectful to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To set the context for this review, I came at this movie as a middle aged guy who grew up loving the original and I don't care one bit about the "all-girl" reimagining. I wasn't impressed by the trailer much and I was worried it would be unfunny since nothing on the trailer made me crack a grin. All I went in hoping for was an entertaining movie, and that's exactly what I got. What surprised me was that I also got more than bargained for. I was pleasantly surprised me with how respectful of the original it turned out to be - even having the courage to open with the original Ray Parker soundtrack instead of the modernized 'Madeon' sounding one on the trailer. It's got to be a really tricky task to navigate a route between a brand new story and a classic old one, but they pulled it off nicely, giving plenty of amusing nods and homages to the source material while still managing to tread fresh ground.Another nice surprise was that the trailer hadn't shown all the cards, which is unusual for an A-list film these days. The villain and his nefarious plot wasn't shown on the trailers, and the role of Chris Hemsworth was hugely downplayed (he actually has a much bigger part in the movie than the trailers suggest).Although I was surprised by the anti-female backlash directed at the trailer, I was initially offended that the only black member of the cast appeared to have been once again relegated to the non-smart, non- scientist role. But while the character isn't a scientist, she is played as the smartest of the group - passionate about New York history and the one that puts most of the mystery pieces together, which was nice.Hemsworth steals the show really, he's clearly enjoying making a fool of himself and you'd have to be in a pretty bad mood as a viewer not to let that enjoyment infect you a little. He hams it up with glee and that's enjoyable to watch.As for the supposed "feminist agenda", I really didn't see it. There's a little material that seems to have been added maybe as an afterthought, poking fun at the youtube commenters, and there's a couple of jokes which I guess could be construed as "feminist- agenda" if you were really desperately stretching - a line about how "safety lights are for dudes" for example, or a moment where they shoot the evil ghost in his twig and berries, but you seriously have to be stretching to think this an anti male movie.I've seen some reviews on here about how it was unfunny and cinema audiences being "in silence". All I can say to that is the auditorium I was in was only half full and there was plenty of laughter. A few of the jokes were misses for me, but there were enough that made me laugh aloud to let the weaker ones slide.Probably the only big downfall for me was the messiness of the script which seemed to lack a second act. It feels a bit like it jumps from the intro act to the climax without much of a build in the middle. I'm not sure if it was a product of the writing or the editing, but it's not much of an issue since, let's be honest, we're not expecting an Oscar winning script from a Ghostbusters movie anyway.In summary, it's fun, it's entertaining, it's good natured, and it's respectful of the original. It's not feminist, it's not unfunny, and it's not perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ghostbusters (2016) has a lot to offer - it's a funny and contemporary reworking of a much-loved comedy classic of the 1980s, the original being a film I saw many times and loved as a teen. The reviews have been puzzling...and the utterly disgusting sexist attacks on the actors of this film unwarranted and horrifying. Quite frankly if all you are thinking as you clutch your pearls and wring your hands while watching a film is "that character has a vagina!" then there is something seriously wrong with your perception of reality. Unless the Official Rules for Ghostbusting state that penises are somehow required to operate the required equipment then, you know, gender doesn't matter. This film spoiled your childhood? How exactly does that work retrospectively? Do you frequently travel back in time to your childhood? Okay so we can safely disregard the feeble, whining MRAs who can't fathom a woman in a strong position or lead role. It makes not one jot of difference what gender the Ghostbusters are, as long as the film is entertaining. And this one certainly is!!There's a comfortable sense of familiarity in the premise, with the delightful discovery of these new personalities and their relationships. The cast is more than adept at delivering confident and convincing performances, with standout McKinnon stealing every scene with her quirky yet magnetic energy. I can't wait to see her in more major film roles. McCarthy anchors the film in a surprisingly measured performance. Mind you the last film I saw McCarthy in was Spy, where she dominated every scene in a fabulously OTT story. Similarly Wiig was comfortable in this ensemble performance. Combined with Jones' affable and generous "Patty", the four new Ghostbusters are a cohesive and fun team that bring it. Chris Hemsworth is capable in his role as ditzy receptionist, with a &gt; 50% hit rate with his humorous lines, however I couldn't imagine a better film conclusion (and credits) due to Hemsworth's fine performance.Is the film flawless? No. There are some hiccups in pacing here and there, and issues with some character formation and progression. In a way the sheer familiarity we all have with the original combined with the abundant cameos detract from full 'suspension of disbelief' in Ghostbusters 2016. But I expect this would always have been the case in the reworking of such a comedy classic. I must stress the film stands on its own merits, with a solid storyline, great CGI and typically fine direction from Feig. I watched the film with my 15 year old son. Not that it matter much to me, but for some it will be good to know the film is largely free from swearing and sexual content. He has seen the original but also loved this remake. His favourite character was also McKinnon's Holtzmann. My enlightened son also understood the tongue-in-cheek silliness of Hemsworth's character without losing his mind over the objectification (by one Ghostbuster) of the character in this small ditzy role reversal.Overall I rate Ghostbusters (2016) an 8/10. With a bit better pacing in parts, maybe some reworking of script to ensure character consistency throughout the film it would have been the "perfect" fun comedy hit. This film had me smiling all the way through it, with some real LOL moments. Go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay this was so good. As good as the first one definitely! There wasn't nearly as much gross out humor as I thought there'd be, the characters were fun, competent and delightfully awkward.If you are at heart an anti-feminist then this movie is not for you. It's women power, anti-men the whole way. The villain, and Hemsworth's roles both fit right into why you'll hate this movie.But if on the other hand you like women, then hell yeah this is awesome. I'm of the personal opinion that these 2 scientist characters, one engineer, and the horribly awfully stereotypical black lady are all in their own right really fun. Personally as a software developer and wannabe scientist myself I found Kate McKinnon's delivery of all the epic jargon fluid, on spot, and believable, and her awkward carefree antisocialness entirely endearing and super cute. She stole the show for me.So you can ignore the obvious gender and racial stereotypes and have a good time with a decent story, or you can bring your personal internal biases into the theater with you and basically turn your movie ticket and free time into a heaping pile of hate and disgust, I'll leave that to you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ghostbusters (2016) is enjoyable and entertaining reboot of the original 1984 film. First of all, the casting is so great here! I absolutely loved Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, and Kate. I feel like Leslie jones deserves a special specific praise for her hilarious and likable performance, she was just so hilarious. "I don't know if it was a race thing or a lady thing, but I'm mad as hell!". That line is just comedy gold to me, and Leslie has sooo many more lines just that funny or even funnier, loved her staunch New York character Patty! The movie isn't perfect or like the best reboot ever made, yes, some of the jokes fall flat, but luckily the jokes that do work and succeed at making you laugh outweigh the ones that don't. Chris Hemsworth, while amazing to look at and drool over, didn't bring his best here I feel, but I feel like that was the scripts fault, his comedy didn't really work that well, but once he became the somewhat villain, he worked, I believe his villainous performance. And I LOVED how they gave all the old ghostbusters main actors roles/cameos in the movie at some point, Sigourney weaver is even back. RIP Harold Ramos. So all in all, no, it's not a 10, no not ALL of it works, but the good very much outsides the bad in my humble opinion, 7/10 for Ghostbusters 2016. Oh and CGI effects worked VERY well, very cool looking and didn't appear fake at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like everyone else I watched the trailer and instantly took a dislike to it. Ghostbusters is one of the most iconic films in the business and it annoyed me slightly that Sony felt they needed a remake of it. So when the went to watch the film, I went in with a fairly closed mind thinking I would really dislike it - however the film was great. Sure there are some very bad cameos from the previous cast but overall I think this is a real gem. I think the overall relationships and dynamics between the characters work remarkably well and the visuals are just as good. Maybe one of its downfalls is that some of the jokes are relatively cheap, and slightly predictable, but there is still enough there to make you laugh. I think this movie will always have negative press because of the instant dislike to the trailer, but it almost seems the worst parts of the movie were included in the trailer! Honestly I cannot recommend that you at least give this movie a try - you might even surprise yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got back from seeing this with my girlfriend earlier tonight and I've got to say - we both had a blast. She hadn't seen the original - and I haven't seen any of the original movies in a while - so I was really glad this movie didn't rely on having to have watched those to enjoy it. I loved the different characters and you can tell everyone must have had a ball working on this film (best use of your Chris Hemsworth. Good job movie). Over all - it was funny as hell, the different designs for the ghosts were pretty cool (if straight out of Disney's Haunted Mansion - but it's all in good fun) and the music was awesome.Also - stick around for a scene after the credits - I'm totally pumped for a sequel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LOVED this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen the original 80s Ghostbusters and it never really interested me, but when I heard about the reboot with all female leads I was excited. Especially after hearing Melissa McCarthy was one of the leads. I wasn't sure how much I would actually enjoy the movie since the original never interested me but I was pleasantly surprised. The characters were funny and likable, my favourite being Holtzmann (played by Kate McKinnon.) Seeing the movie as someone with no real knowledge of the original I can't talk about any comparisons between the plots but as it's own movie I think it was interesting and clever and it made me laugh. Overall, it was a great movie, and I LOVED the idea of remaking a classic all male movie with female leads. I hope I see more movies like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Ghostbusters EVER!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit that I was not a big fan of the original Ghostbusters movie. I didn't hate it, but it was not on my top 20 list. I also admit that I did not have high expectations for this one.BUT ... I loved this movie SO much, that I'm going back next week for a second viewing! These women, both the characters AND the actors, deserve a high five! It was so good, that I am writing my first ever review here.Before the halfway mark of the movie, 'I' wanted to be a ghostbuster too! The movie has such good energy and intelligence and warmth. I really felt like this was a group that I would join in a heartbeat.As soon as I left the cinema, I bought the original version and I intend to buy this one when it's released on DVD.My advice is to ignore the negative reviews and go see it for yourself. You will be pleasantly surprised. My granddaughter will have a nice collection of Ghostbuster action figures by the end of the year!Fabulous movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredible movie for all ages unless you hate women</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was excellent, the graphics, casting, jokes and sets were all amazingly perfect for this movie. It has amazing representation for queer women and people of colour. The geeky male didn't get the girl like so many movies have them do, none of the women were sexualized for the sake of getting sexualized, the only person that was was the dumb blond role, which was played by a man for once. It's so nice to see that a movie has catered towards women with out making us feel dumb or like we should only like rom-coms, this movie has something for everyone and everyone should go see it, the only problem is how Patty, the black woman, was portrayed as the only ghost-buster that isn't intelligent, the others all work at a university or college and Patty works in a subway. It plays on the stereotypes that black women are trying to break out of and prove wrong, they could have easily just made her a history professor that grew up in NYC, she would still know all there is to know about getting around on the subway. They could have even thrown in a cameo and have that person be the one to show them onto the subway tracks for finding the ghost. Patty had a lot of wasted potential and if there is a sequel I hope that it gets explained. Other than that this movie was incredible and worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I actually saw the movie -Pretty solid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not the best movie ever made but a lot of fun and solidly funny. Cool effects - your kids should like it! Not a terrible way to spend a few hours. Kate McKinnon stole the show while Melissa McCarthy was dissapointinglymsubdued. The pacing was odd at parts but I liked the specter effects. Wish I would have seen it in 3D. The movie is pretty family friendly with only some off-color humor and scary parts. I liked the emphasis on girls and science because we need more role models like that for our daughters (there is only so much Disney Princess a parent can handle). What's (sadly) interesting is the movie seems to have anticipated the pathetic whiny reaction it was going to receive from certain unhinged segments of the population (think Gamergate) and directly addresses it. pretty brilliant. Anyway, another solid entry from Pail Feig, Kristin Wiig, Melissa McCarthy and the rest of the crew.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I gave it a chance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Which is all anyone can do. I didn't want to form an opinion based on a few trailers, I wanted to actually give this a shot. But it's hard to remain neutral, 'cause I grew up on the original movies and cartoon. I've always hated the idea of a reboot, no matter what gender these new Ghostbusters would be.So I'll give my opinion, but I wouldn't go so far as to say anyone should listen to it. I always find that experiencing something and forming your own thoughts on it is better than listening to a stranger. But when/if you do go into it, and you happen to be a fan of the original movies, try to keep them out of your head. That'd be setting yourself up for disappointment, because this is something...different.This movie is not terrible, nor is it really anything special. The jokes fall flat, the story is weak, the dialogue is bad, and the main villain isn't really terrifying. I found the plot intriguing, though. Rowan amplifying paranormal activity? That was fascinating. The SFX was actually pretty good -- better than in the trailers, I thought. The callbacks to the original movies were fun, and I loved the cameos. And I thought the main actors did a really well job with the material they were given. They were good. Making characters obnoxiously unintelligent wore thin pretty fast, and I thought only the male characters would be portrayed that way, but the female characters were also portrayed as unintelligent and made bad decisions occasionally (even our heroines). So it was kind of an equal-opportunistic decision. I did notice that, throughout most of the movie, the ghosts were portrayed as being more intelligent and effective than the living. I'm gonna choose to believe that, in doing this, the director was making some kinda statement. This was the world he fashioned. I would say that this is an average film. It wasn't a funny comedy or a scary ghost story, and it was kind of uncertain about what type of movie it wanted to be. But despite its flaws, I thought it was enjoyable enough that I didn't lose interest. It was simply just entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ghostbusters (2016) is not, despite what some people are posting, an awful film. Neither is it excellent - taken as a whole its highs and lows resolve to a completely average film. In many ways it strongly resembles Ghostbusters 2, which wasn't a great film.Thirty years of advancement in special effects has made for some brilliant action sequences, the visuals are far better than in the eighties.The decision to have Kate McKinnon's character go full mad scientist was a brilliant one, and if there is a sequel, some experimentation in Ghostbusting would be a definite improvement over the original.The plot also hangs together reasonably well, and there's little to complain about acting wise.Where it all falls down is the script, the direction, editing, and the mixture of characters. The humour is much more in your face and less sarcastic than the original, the camera continually swings between characters rather than using wide shots to show the interaction between the characters at that point in time. The pacing is off, and the scenes do not mesh together smoothly.It just isn't as funny, and doesn't capture the last chance nature of the original team getting by on a wing and a prayer. Neither does it feature a straight comedy lead - Harold Ramis was absolutely essential in providing a contrast for the original team.Then there's Lesley Jones' character. Surely she could have been given a better script? In the original Ernie Hudson plays a black guy who applies for a job, and copes as well as a guy thrust into an unusual situation would do. Not so in this film, where there's a contrived method of getting her involved in the team, and her role is slapstick and shouting.The main villain is lacklustre, too. True, his actions are consistent in the plot, but it would have been far better to have someone a little more flamboyant. That would have provided further opportunities for comedy later on in the film.With a little more effort it could have been a good, but not great film, as it is it's relentlessly average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all let me start by saying that this is not a 1 out of 10 movie. Any review that states as such should be immediately dismissed. Ghostbusters is not a perfect movies and has a few major flaws but I have seen plenty of movies this year that are worse then this movie.The four leads are well fleshed out characters who are all distinct and add a different type of comedy to the movie. There are some real solid jokes in here with a bunch of smaller silly things peppered throughout to keep the tone of the movie fun. While out of the four leads Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig get top billing, Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon drive the movie comically. They both impress and bring a unique style that would be tough to replicate.Paul Fieg has certainly made his Ghostbusters movie. The timing of the jokes and the type of comedy displayed here are very formulaic and bring Bridesmades and Spy flashbacks. I enjoy Fieg's movies and even I am starting to get tired of the same sort of movie over and over. The story is fairly middle of the road and easy for audiences to understand. This is not necessarily a bad thing, I don't really want Ghostbusters to have a plot from a Christopher Nolan film.Yes most of the male characters in the movie are either goofballs or jerks, but to be honest every character in this movie is quirky in some way. This is not a movie about women being better than men or really anything to do with gender at all. Only people who have not seen this movie would complain about gender in this movie and by the end of it I had completely forgotten all of the nonsense surrounding the movie.I simply had just enjoyed a female led Ghostbusters and did not feel like my gender was attacked along the way. Women don't need to prove that they are funny, but Ghostbusters helps the cause.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly, when it comes to the movie it wasn't bad. Now before the entire internet comes down and crucifies me, just hear me out. From my perspective I thought it was a good movie when you look at it on its own. The movie's plot was I thought good, look it was a standard plot, compare it to the fifty- million movies about "edgy" teens taking on the system, the movie was a fantastically original plot. Now when it comes down to the brass tacks, the movie was just about busting ghosts, and being just fun. I feel like some people are taking out of proportion (seriously some reviews say stuff like, in the finale when McCarthy, and Wig have white hair, their eye lash colors don't change.) Look I'm not one of those feminists who think that all men are evil, and would defend this movie like crazy, but if you look at it, it really wasn't bad. Honestly I just think people are salty about them putting women in the suits. In conclusion from a casual standpoint it was a pretty good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I thought it was bad, but I was pleasantly surprised...but Chris Hemsworth steals the show to the girls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an ex kid of the 80s I grew up watching movies like Ghostbusters, Goonies, Explorers, Back to the future etc... I was also an avid fan of the cartoon series that I considered from some point of view better than the movie itself. When I heard they were remaking it I thought "God, this is going to suck!", and when I heard about the all female cast I thought "It'gonna suck more". After checking what they were saying on the net I was seriously considering not going to watch, but on Saturday the other choices were even worse, so I gave it a try. The first surprise was that the theatre was almost full, pretty rare in the area I am currently living, and the audience giggled a lot during the projection, which is even rarer in these days when comedies are not funny at all. Going straight to the movie, the premise is simple: it's a remake of the 1984 movie with female cast, the protagonists do not closely match the original team but they have a good chemistry, in particular the two long time friends, while the punk engineer is definitely the funniest character of the movie AFTER the receptionist, Hemsworth, who actually is fantastic and should play more comedic roles...to be malignant we might add he's born to play the part of the dumb beefcake. He might even become a serious competitor for Zac Efron.The original cast plays a series of cammeos that unlike many remakes (remakes) are real characters who speak and do something for the plot, their appearance actually work. The movie is funny in a 80s tongue in the cheek style, so it might appears outdated to a younger audience, the direction recreates in a decent manner the atmosphere of those years with all the science gadgets the Ghostbusters are using. Mention of honour to Ozzy Osbourne who plays Ozzy, Gerry Garcia who plays a godfather like major of NY and his hysterical assistant. In conclusion, valid movie IMO (7.5 rounded to 8), unfortunately it is receiving bad press from Omega males who think the movie is sexist (???) and/or male teenagers in heat who complain the women are not carbon copies of Kim Kardashian or some other plastic looking celebrity. Well, they are supposed to be funny, not attractive.</fullReview>

This remake of Ghostbusters made me laugh a lot, and I liked the all the characters. The ghosts felt much more dangerous than they did in the original two Ghostbusters films, with the help of great updated special effects in comparison to the original. The new weapons are also a great addition really expending the possibilities for new merchandising for the franchise. The credits are really entertaining, and there was an Easter egg waiting for fans of the original movie at the very end. Can't wait for the sequel! =)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I shall preface this with a few points. I loved the original Ghostbusters, and like many people here it was a huge part of my childhood. I grew up with it as well as the cartoons. If people where to ask me what my favourite movie of all time was it would be Ghostbusters. Here we are in 2016 and the moment that all Ghostheads have been waiting for has arrived a new 21st century Ghostbusters, after many years of speculation it has finally happened. But by god the nerd rage is strong in this one and i've lived through Star Wars prequels, and Star Trek reboots. The movie brought a smile to my angry jaded face. I went in with the lowest possible expectations like I always do, especially with reboots. and here is something that all you haters going to hate. The movie was really really good. Please if you're reading this review ignore the small minded idiots who believe that Paul Feig invented the time machine and single-handedly violated their childhoods. It's all pure and unadulterated butt hurt from people angry they never got to see a proper Ghostbusters 3 with the original cast. Now I have that aside (and without spoilers) I will attempt to tell you why it is good. Ignore all the comments of racism, feminism, bad CGI, Bad Acting, bad characters (infact I think most of the top bad reviews slate everything). All of this is irrelevant, its again simply very angry fans of the original film who want to pull everything and anything apart that they possibly can.The film is an enjoyable romp, that treats the franchise with respect whilst bringing it up to date. The story is a more fleshed out variation on the original film. The characters work well together and the effects are spot on . Acting is a little stilted in places, but overall well done. There are even a few little scary creepy bits in it for good measure. It caters for the fans by having the little nods and cameos here and there, to make the fan smile. Overall it is a job well done and a thumbs up from the most jaded moviegoer out there who usually hates most reboots/rehashing of old IP. I for one am looking forward to what this updated franchise is going to come up with over the coming years. I write this review simply to try and redress the balance, ignore the naysayers and the rage, you're right, you're a Ghosthead and your beloved franchise is back in town. Who are you going to telephone?... Mike Hat!NB: Nobody paid me for this review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun summer flick! Nods to the original while creating its own story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have very fond memories of the first ghostbusters. The original movie, with its cast and story, was amazing! I could, and have, literally watched it countless times. The new movie is an excellent re-boot. It has nods to the original movie while creating its own solid, funny story. It has great action sequences while still always moving the movie forward. Having said that, the original ghostbusters is iconic and anyone who is expecting this movie to do the same is going to be disappointed. If you truly love the original, no remake, male or female cast, will ever compare (if you want proof, even the original cast could not make another movie as good as the original- look at ghostbusters 2). Just because it isn't as amazing as the original (remakes rarely are), that doesn't mean that this movie isn't worth seeing. The whole cast is solid with Kate McKinnon's character being especially hilarious. As for the male bashing that some IMDb reviewers have commented on (many of which were put up 5 days before it was released), I'm not entirely sure where that is coming from. It seems to be based on the fact that the only male characters are either villains or are limited to the ditzy role of secretary. There are very few (if any) gender specific references or jokes at all in this movie.If you want to see a funny, entertaining comedy, see this movie! It was a fun summer flick!</fullReview>

I thought Hemsworth also had a funny performance. Although I did think the movie's final action scene dragged on too long and was somewhat boring, I see that they have to wrap it up somehow. The movie is not any good for its action or effects, however, comedy-wise it was not bad. I thought this movie wouldn't be very good going into it. I was pleasantly surprised, though, at the number of times I laughed out loud at some of the jokes (but I also must note that some were not funny). 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grew up with an older brother who loves the originals, spent my childhood with a Slimer salt shaker staring down at me from a shelf, I've seen the films countless times and the theme could rouse me from sleep ready to bust some ghosts.So I wasn't sure about a reboot. I mean, sure the graphics would be better, but I felt it was unnecessary. And then I heard the ghostbusters were going to be women, and I was sold.I can't even remember the last time I saw a film with more than a single woman. Let alone four of them, let alone a woman who's intelligent, who's following her dreams, who get to eat and be gross and wear professional, fully covering clothes and tie their hair back sensibly.I don't even know how to articulate how I feel about this film. There are no fat jokes, no sexist jokes, no dick jokes. As a white woman I can't comment on any racial problems but I felt like I could fight anything, even the horrifying specter of patriarchy, with three friends wearing jumpsuits.If you identify as female, please see this film. If you identify as male, see this film. And when you get irritated over Kevin, or the other male characters, watch the original ghostbusters. Imagine how it feels for your only representation to be dim, pretty, the subject of inappropriate comments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well this was a tough shot, a reboot of a classic film. I ended up liking this film. Here's why: The casting was good, effects were great, cameos were fun, and it didn't try to be the original, exactly. Generally, it followed the outline of the original, but it was it's own story, as well. The cast, I felt, clicked really well, and they were all fun characters in their own way. I liked Kristin Wiig, in particular. I thought she was phenomenal. Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones did really well, considering I only knew them from SNL. I was worried that Melissa McCarthy would be a little annoying, as she usually annoys me a tad bit, but here she restrained her physical comedy, and I believed her as her character. (She was even, dare I say it, kind of cute in this role!) The effects are as good as one could imagine for a 2016 film, pretty darn good! Overall, this could have been a big disaster, but it ended up quite enjoyable. 7/10 from me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Important</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm writing this review because I felt it was necessary after seeing the overall rating for it. Ever since this movie was announced it's been controversial for so many different reasons. It's been a target for racists and men who just love to degrade women. Many fans of the original movie were crying out about the sanctity of their childhood. I'm a huge fan of the original, it's been one of my favorite movies since I was little. I understand the feeling of nostalgia that comes along with something so near and dear to your heart.I expected this movie to be bad. To be fair, it's not like it's the best movie ever made. It's not necessarily good, technically speaking. I wasn't sure that I even wanted to go see it. But a friend of mine invited me to go with her and offered to pay for my ticket, so I agreed. The first ten minutes or so of the movie was sort of painful, like how I expected. The rest of the movie makes up for that painful ten minutes for so many reasons.If you don't laugh at the comedy in this movie, I feel sorry for you because you must have a lot of stress or negative things going on in your life. This movie is so lighthearted and goofy, something that I think is incredibly important considering everything that's happened in the world this year. It's not as if it's the greatest comedy ever made, or even of the year, but it will take your mind off of everything bad going on and make you laugh if you let it.My biggest point though is the characters themselves, and just how important they are as role models. They are normal women. They do silly things, they flirt, they make mistakes, they have hobbies and passions and they do all of these things while supporting each other. For little girls to be able to see a movie where, for once, women aren't perfect or angelic or seductive or dumbed down or sexualized overtly or constantly being catty to each other is incredibly important. This brings me to my next point: Chris Hemsworth. A lot of men are complaining that his character was created to make all men seem like big dumb idiots who women just want to use for their sexual fantasies. Congratulations, they finally have a sliver of understanding of what it's like for women in almost every blockbuster movie. Regardless of this though, they are reading FAR too much into it. Chris Hemsworth's character is not dumb because he's a man. Never once was there a "Look at how stupid all men are" joke. Chris Hemsworth's character is stupid because that's just how the character was created. As far as Chris Hemsworth being sexualized, when one character becomes infatuated with him, the other characters point out just how ridiculous she's being. There's no patting on the back or "go get 'em's" or anything of the sort. They explain just how ridiculous it is to over sexualize someone. Personally, I had a blast when I saw this movie, which definitely came as a surprise to me because I expected I wouldn't like it at all. There are people who haven't even seen the movie who are giving one star reviews, which is something that ticks me off. If you don't want to go see the movie, don't go see the movie. But don't rate something you haven't seen. If you want to rate something, go see it. It's not that hard. As far as preserving the sanctity of the old movie and all of our childhoods go, this one does just fine. It's a remake in concept, but not in plot or characters. This movie is not trying to replace the original, it's trying to pay homage to it, hence the appearance of the original actors (all except for Rick Moranis, which is really the only crime this movie can be accused of). They wouldn't have agreed to their cameo's if they didn't support the movie. This movie's creation is not the end of the world, or even of anyone's childhood. It's fun, it's goofy, it's not meant to be taken seriously. If, one day, those of you who claim that you hate the movie without even having gone to see it decide that maybe you will watch it, I hope you're pleasantly surprised just like I was. If you're not, then that's okay because everyone has different tastes. Go ahead and pop in the original and enjoy reliving that part of your childhood, just like how in twenty years from now, some people may be doing the same for this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good effort, but adequate result</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was one of the people who was really looking forward to this film. I knew since the official video game came out that we would never get a Ghostbusters 3 in cinema, and when I saw the first trailer I thought it would be a "passing the torch" kind of film where a new team takes over the business. I was very disappointed when I learned this was going to be a straight-up remake, where none of the previous movies wouldn't even matter.The movie has a good strong start. It sets the tone of the movie really well, and we get introduced to the three first main characters almost right away. It has a good pacing, which leads to adding the last main character and the supporting character, and immediately the audience know that this is a fun movie that doesn't take itself seriously. Sadly things starts to fall apart in Act 2. Almost every joke falls flat. The characters has very little chemistry with each other, and the villain is unoriginal and uninteresting. It is a bad sign when Chris Hemsworth is the only one who is consistently funny, and he's not even a professional comedian. The main plot is on rails, and the sub-plot of the mayor trying to shut down the Ghostbusters makes no sense in context. Ghostbusters just follows the path set by the original without adding anything of substance, and whatever new they add just feels hollow. Like a checklist.Things does not get any better in Act 3. The villain just instantly get super-powers without any explanations, The Ghostbusters has somehow acquired superior agility and marksmanship abilities after just a few test shots in an alley, and the ghosts looks like they were taken straight out of the live-action Scooby-Do films. In the end I just felt tired and bored.The film does have its strong points. The pacing is very good and it smoothly sets the tone of the film. Even though the CGI looks way too cartoony for my taste, I did really like the designs for each ghost. The set designs are very clever, and I liked the idea of replacing the old ambulance with a hearse. All the actors did a good job in portraying the personality of each character, and I especially liked Leslie Jones as she was definitely the strongest actor of all four.I wouldn't recommend a watch since it's the kind of movie that won't add or subtract anything from your love of Ghostbusters. Wait for a home video release as it's not really worth rushing to the cinemas to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>32 years ago Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, Dan Aykroyd and Ernie Hudson would form the Ghostbusters and save New York from many paranormal beings such as Slimer and Mr Stay Puft (just to name a few). Now in 2016 the franchise has been rebooted but with a twist, this time the Ghostbusters are women... "WHAT IS THIS" the internet exclaims. "HOW DARE THESE WOMEN TAKE ON THE ROLES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE FAMOUS MY MEN!!!". As the saying goes "haters gonna hate" and hate they did as the films official trailer is now the most hated movie trailer ever, and is in the top 25 most hated Youtube videos of all time. Oh the misogyny. I would like to make clear that I am not one of the misogynistic haters to which I am referring to. Like some who disliked the trailer, I didn't like it due to other reasons, as I thought the CG didn't look great and the jokes weren't all that funny, but my interpretation was that hopefully the best is yet to come.I think the best place to start is with the Ghostbusters themselves. I thought they were alright as a whole. Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones were great in this film especially McKinnon as the incredibly smart as she is eccentric, Jillain Holzmann. Both fresh off SNL, the two bring real character to the film and ultimately steal the show from such familiar faces like Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy. It's not that Meliisa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig are bad because they aren't, it's that they play themselves, or at least a version of themselves that we have seen in many a movie and so they aren't as fresh as their fellow Ghostbusters. I also found Kristen Wiig's character slightly irritating with her need to impress people like Bill Murray and Charles Dance, but then again the rest of the team (even unofficial member Kevin) help weigh the scale on the side of good. Speaking of Kevin, Chris Hemsworth is given a rather well written character in Kevin the Secretary, Hemsworth is given the funniest character with the funniest lines and gives a decent performance, but it is more the writing that makes Kevin so entertaining more than Hemsowrth's performance (Although he (ghost)busts some moves in the credits that will make you chuckle).Now for the film itself. It's a fair film, its funny in places and it entertains those with an open mind. One of the stand out moments of the film would be the Beast's of Mayhem concert scene. In the scene Leslie Jones is given some really funny things to do such as the crowd dive and the ghost on her shoulders. As well as this scene, the many scenes where Holzmann showcases her latest inventions make for great entertainment and shows why these two are the films best characters.A problem I had with the film was the number of nods and winks to the original film. I don't think it's "VOMITTING ON YOUR CHILDHOOD" as some would think, its just a bit too staged and frequent for a film that wants to stand on its own. The only other real issue I had with the film was its ending. The films climax is ironically anticlimactic as there is no real sense of danger or struggle for our friendly neighbourhood Ghostbusters. Instead the ending feels a bit too easy and doesn't deliver on the excitement you would expect of a final showdown.Overall, Ghostbusters is a fair film with an unfair amount of hate surrounding it. With such negative hype the film is never going to live up or down to it, instead the film sits happily in the middle, and in my case the scale is tipped more over the good side. I would be interested to see more of these Ghostbusters and encourage sequels as I think, to be honest, the only way is up for Ghostbuster sequels. So to all the ghosts and haters out there all I say is this. THE POWER OF PATTY COMPELS YOU!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious and refreshing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really can't understand all of the bad reviews this movie is getting. The movie is ridiculous because hey, it's a movie about a bunch of people that go around fighting ghosts in New York City using things like nuclear lasers. Obviously the original Ghostbusters is a cult classic, so the new one has a lot to live up to. In my opinion the 2016 version did a fantastic job of giving a nod to the original version, all without being too derivative, and managed to make the story fresh and modern by hilariously referencing current culture.As far as remaking the film with all women, it felt gimmicky only because it flipped the typical stereotype and so few films do; no one batted an eye that the original Ghostbusters featured a team of all men. That's really the point and necessity of films like this one, and I hope the bad reviews this movie is getting will not dissuade other filmmakers from taking similar risks in the future. I must say that, personally, this film was so incredibly refreshing. I am in my early thirties, born right at the height of the original Ghostbusters popularity: some of my earliest childhood memories were playing with Ghostbusters action figures, acting out scenes from the film with my brother, and endlessly singing the theme song. Being a nerd in all the right ways, I ended up growing up to become an experimental physicist with a Ph.D.; and for what it's worth, I also happen to be a woman. Maybe I'm taking the film too seriously, but as I was sitting in the theater watching the new Ghostbusters, I couldn't help reflecting on how few films there are that actually feature women as real, live intelligent human beings who can be just as nerdily interested in something as men can. Almost without exception, female characters are relegated to the role of the love interest, and if she is shown to be intelligent or have some nerdy hobby, it's solely as the catalyst for the leading man's interest in her. When I think back to my own childhood favorite films, I had almost no real role models to look up to; one of my favorite films was The Saint, which does in fact have a female scientist as one of the main characters, but it's pretty much the only film I can think of that does. That character is also not nearly as amazingly three-dimensional and hilariously unique as the leading ladies in Ghostbusters are. I'm so glad that the next generation of girls will grow up with a few more eccentrically hilarious female characters to look up to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At least as much fun as the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big Ghostbusters fan. I design props and themed environments for a living and have built proton packs, a large scale Ghostbusters sign, a Slimer hologram and so much more as part of an elaborately themed nightclub special event. BIG FAN. I also LOVE the eerie/spooky aesthetic, like Disney's Haunted Mansion or their Twilight Zone Tower of Terror (which I think both influenced this film). I thought this movie was every bit as fun (and flawed) as the first one. I thought they did a fantastic job of honoring so many details of the original, but reinventing them for a modern audience. With such a nostalgia-laden property as is Ghostbusters (or similarly, The Muppets), it's going to be an almost impossible task to please everyone. I like many of the production design details at least as much, if not more than the original. The settings, character and costume decisions, I think, were spot-on. I LOVE ALL of the casting. LOVE. Given the previous work of some of these actors, I was happily surprised to see more understated performances from everyone. Some of my favorite funny moments were the most subtle? "Ain't no bitches gonna hunt no ghosts". Oh, and Chris Hemsworth's moments were another welcome surprise. So funny. I LOVE all of the ghost interaction moments. Someone put a lot of thought and research into them. They were all very Ghostbuster's ? yet perfectly refreshed. And YES, the 3D for this movie is goofy fun- another very clever 3D idea someone came up with that you'll just have to see in person. Is it a brilliant cinema? No, it's Ghostbusters. Perfect summer movie that I look forward to watching during Halloween seasons to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never thought this movie would be bad. But is actually a surprise. The Acting is great, the comedy is good (Especially Mckinnon and Jones), the effects are OK. There is nothing that bad. It is actually one of the best reboots in such a mythical film. I mean is not perfect: Some jokes are to childish and the main character, played by Kristen Wiig is kinda boring and bland. Even there are some stuff that have no reason to be there. Like the Marshmallow. Hemsworth is great as always. The plot is kinda confusing at one point and the villain is soo bad. Really. Why? With all the possible villains they give us the outcast? I don't care that is a stereotype. At least make a good stereotype. There are no reasons and the character comes out of nowhere. How does he knows how to bring spirits to this world.There are something that have no sense like killing a ghost or the slimy guy with his girlifriend.But...I keep thinking this is a good movie and it has this charm. You should give it a try</fullReview>

The special effects were nice and the easter eggs related to the to the previous Ghostbusters movies were great. All the actresses did a good job and their characters have their own distinct style.Favorite lines were: "You try saying no to these salty parabolas" and "That's a room full of nightmares."I'd be willing to see it again in theaters and am definitely interested in nabbing the DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Im a little tired of the film getting disreputed for its lack of a feminist viewpoint. The fact it was a strong female cast should prove otherwise. Yes these were some "girlie" references, to which i felt it just built the persona of the cast. Although no one seemed to bat an eyelid it the original when Sigourney weaver was the prize turkey in the original ghost buster films.I watched it with the same intent as i did the ones in the 80's. Yes the story line wasn't as captivating as the original but the characters were. Melissa Mccarthy is one my favourite Actors and never fails to deliver.

Knows it will never top the 1984 film, but it was at least funnier then Ghostbusters 2(1989). Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Leslie Jones, and Kate McKinnon all have great chemistry, and great comic timing, and never try to copy there male counter parts. And unlike the depression that was How to Be Single, I actually felt the females here really liked each other. Chris Hemsworth seems to be having the most has the ghostbusters dimwitted assistant.Some the original cast members make an appearance, effects are pretty good, never once feel dated.

		<shortDescription>One of the Most Original, Successful Reboots of All Time. Yes, really.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a Ghostbusters fan since I was 4. I just threw an elaborate themed party, spending exorbitant amounts of money acquiring Ecto Cooler, Limited Edition Twinkies, and even a sticker book never printed in America. I am a lifer, and I went into my showing VERY cautiously optimistic after several bad trailers and TV spots did the film no justice. But you know the pain of having seen all a movie's best moments in the trailer? GB 2016 is the exact opposite of this all too common problem. It is original enough to justify revisiting the franchise, but so jam-packed with reverence and references to the original, it almost feels less like a reboot and more like a tribute. Exciting, visually dazzling, and comedically sly, this film is almost perfect, and QUITE possibly the strongest film in the series, as blasphemous as that may sound. Go see for yourself. Yes, really.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the SNL cast members pulled off a very entertaining movie. It was a good and funny film, and I loved seeing these 4 funny SNL women play leading roles in what is usually male dominated casts in action roles movies. I especially liked Kristen and Melissa, but Jones, and McKinnon were great as well. I thought it was a great mix of pulling from the original, as well as adding new material and great special effects and some pretty scary ghosts in the subway. Don't pay attention to many of the negative reviews, they are probably people who think that any action movie must have males as leading roles. The small cameo roles by Murray and Aykroyd and Weaver were a nice touch. Go see this movie if you liked the first two Ghostbusters, you will not be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The FRESH version has done the FRANCHISE RIGHT!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It plays homage to the nostalgia of the original movies. It Also gives a fresh look on the franchise as a movie that actually stands on its own. Some of the original actors make cameos throughout the movie and they all are nicely placed throughout the movie. The HATERS POV are not valid until they actually go see the movie. I SAW it last night and I was reluctant to all the negative fan base reviews. The movie is actually REALLY REALLY GOOD they did the movie and franchise right. It now makes those haters now look like complete idiots. It's actually what you expect out of a summer fun popcorn flick. I like a to go into a summer movie to escape reality for a few hours this movie does exactly what I expect out of a summer movie. Leaving feeling good. The story is well written and the comedy fits well for the movie a lot of sarcastic smart dialogue. So like myself don't go on the negative reviews that were posted before the movie was released to the public. Follow the more current reviews from people who actually went and saw the movie with their own eyes. I highly recommend this movie if you want that fun summer flick to enjoy with your family and friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Actually Enjoyed This One...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know I really enjoyed Ghostbusters. It was not a groundbreaking movie of the summer, but it was not that bad either. I enjoyed the chemistry between all four characters, and I laughed quite a bit throughout the movie. It also had many great special effects and an interesting storyline. I definitely look forward to a sequel if they decide to create one.However you have to erase all memories of the first two Ghostbusters films in order to appreciate this one at all. They give homage to the past films, but this is a total reboot for a new audience . I have no problem with the "female power" message within this film. I do like strong female characters in action movies, so it did not bother me. The only thing I did not really like is that all of the male characters were either dumb, or had some type of strong obvious negative character trait. I don't think that a movie has to totally diminish the male characters in order to make the female character shine more. Why can't there be a balance? The main villain was interesting too, but they could've built him up more, because in the end he wasn't the most memorable to me. But otherwise I really enjoyed this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than I expected!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by being honest: I'd probably actually give this movie about an 8 out of 10, but I'd like to help make up for the disparity in ratings caused by users who are simply trying to push an anti- feminist agenda. Looking through most of these reviews, you'll notice many similarities: "man-hating," "not funny," "bad CGI," "racist caricature," "ruined childhood." Let me assure you, this movie is in no way man-hating. There are many more things in contemporary media that are far more in-your- face about their agendas (not that I personally think there's anything wrong with that but Neighbors 2 comes to mind), and ghostbusters is not one of them. The only thing about it that has a so-called agenda is that the leads are female. So what? How many of these reviewers complained when the leads were all male? In that case, is almost every single movie ever not pushing an anti-women agenda, considering the huge difference between male and female protagonists. They did not make jokes at men's expense or talk about any sort of modern gender issues. So they had a dumb man? Do people not realize how much of media contains either no female characters or absolutely terrible portrayals of women? Plus, I found that Chris Hemsworth was hilarious. Comedy is subjective. I can't say whether you'll find this movie funny or not but, based on the trailer, I expected not to find it funny and I was pleasantly surprised. Sure there are some cliché jokes but there were plenty clever and original ones too! Very impressed. Maybe I'm wrong but the CGI seemed pretty obviously cartoony on purpose! If they had been trying to make it realistic, it would have been far worse but they were clearly paying homage to the original movie. Do people expect a realistic version of slimer? I'll admit it was a little over the top at some points but for the most part, entertaining and aesthetically pleasing in my opinion. Patty's character certainly had some stereotypes that need to be overcome. I won't deny that and I'm on the side of those who were disappointed with her character. But she was also much smarter than they first made her appear and many reviewers only bring up this point to make their sexism seem more justified when they really do not care about racism in media. Finally, if this movie's existence ruined your childhood, don't see it. Go watch the original. It hasn't changed at all just because this one came out. Don't spend money, don't leave a review, don't ruin it for the rest of us just because you hate feminism.</fullReview>

A part of me wanted to dislike it on principle, as if I'm being disloyal to what made me love Ghostbusters to begin with, but I let that go and decided to ride the wave instead.Its true that I can see why the older folks might not like it, even I was like "Whoa, slow down, there's too much going on." but for this ADHD generation it was perfect and I loved seeing the enthusiasm of the young boys and girls, watching them fist pump and dance.

		<shortDescription>Hard to love, but equally hard to hate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard, throughout Paul Feig's reboot of beloved 80s classic Ghostbusters, to work out whether you're enjoying it or actually just enjoying remembering the original.It's also impossible to watch it without being aware of the ridiculous outrage from certain sections of the internet community at the simple fact that four women could be Ghostbusters. This sort of misogyny apparently still goes on, in 2016.The fury started as soon as the project was announced, in 2014, and hasn't let up since ? often intensifying with every new piece of news about it.But amongst the crap there was, quite fairly, the same genuine concerns that accompany any potential franchise reboot. Could the fun of the originals be recaptured? Could a Ghostbusters movie be a Ghostbusters movie without Bill Murray?The problems were surely supposed to be hidden within those two questions. That the movie wouldn't be funny enough, with Paul Feig directing and Kristen Weig and Melissa McCarthy starting, seemed the least of its potential problems.It's odd, then, that the actual issue with this reboot ? which stars Weig, McCarthy, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones as a band of Ghostbusters who come together after Manhattan is invaded by ghosts ? is a lack of laughs. All of the fun of the originals is here and a painstaking attention to detail means this looks, feels and romps along like a Ghostbusters movie should. Although Kate McKinnon's wacky Jillian appears to be in a totally different film to everyone else, the four main leads strike up enough chemistry.But there are barren periods where the jokes consistently fail to land or, in the case of Chris Hemsworth's Kevin, are pretty much dead on arrival. There's definitely a problem with the character work, too. Erin and Abby have very little to distinguish between them ? a problem the film never resolves and strangely leaves Melissa McCarthy with less to do than the other three Ghostbusters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the early years of the ghost busters had some steam in both dialogue, and action this remake did a pretty good job at delivering some funny lines. Using some of the locations from the first film was a good idea to at least give some of the fans an idea where it all started. Yet the scenes could have been done a little better during some of the fight sequences. A person can tell what is a green screen, and what is real. The plot needed some serious work too. Why was rowan evil? What drove him to become the next messiah of the apocalypse?, and why use a four hundred foot tall mock up of their logo? It all seemed too rushed in the making of the movie to allow some satisfaction to be delivered. However it was a good idea to let those bumbling fools such as Bill Murray, Sigourney Weaver, or even slimmer to show their faces for a last time to give the movie more juice. I can say though that the humour was great. Lots of particular strangeness to the characters especially with Kate mcinnon. I'm not much into slapstick comedy but she did give off a nice shine to every punch line she spoke with added body language. All in all, this remake is a good summer filler. I just wished that the evil character could have been better. Including the dreaded device used to bring about the end of the world. It needed more depth, possibly more ancient lore to make the story more believable. Using the ley lines however was nice touch. If only additional legends worked in the mix the plot would have been cemented better. I can give this seven stars out of ten. Kids will love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ghostbusters (2016): Seriously guys (and I'm picking on the males in particular because they've been the main abusers online and elsewhere), give it a go, it's an absolute blast!There's copious amounts of nostalgia for the aforementioned naysayers and over-righteous fans of the original 1984 version to keep them more than enticed. This includes major and minor cameos from all of the original cast apart from Rick Moranis (retired). Even Harold Ramis (dead) appears twice along with the Manhattan fire station, Slimer and the now famous StayPuft Marsh-Mallow Man, who has spent the last few days trying to climb out of the concourse at London Waterloo Station. He is starting to look a bit frustrated now so I'm assuming he's just trying to avoid Southern Rail.The film itself follows the basic lines of the original but deviates slightly, primarily because of the gender-reversal of having women as GB's instead of men (OOH...Scary! See what they did there?). Melissa McCarthy's Abby (Ray Stantz), Kirsten Wiig's Erin (Peter Venkman), Kate McKinnon's Jillian (Egon Spengler) and Leslie Jones' Patty (Winston Zeddemore) are almost perfect and there's also the bonus of having the ridiculously handsome Chris Hemsworth (he of Thor fame) as Kevin, a bespectacled, mentally malnourished exec PA instead of... well, we all know a few of those.The opening scene is somewhat scarier than the original library scenario and there are a few more jumps when you least expect them but overall, the comedy value more than lives up to the original when the characters are interacting. The CGI ghosts and ghouls have been upped a few levels due to advanced tech and look extremely good, especially towards the final showdown with the upgraded weapons.My one small complaint is that, unlike most of his previous films (Bridesmaids, The Heat, Spy), director Paul Feig was restricted on the use of McCarthy's and Wiig's proper foul mouths (no hysterical C- bombs this time around) and full on toilet humour (there are still some more subtle ones in there though), due to the film itself having to be 'kid friendly' to grab the next generations' attention. However, the line "Let's loosen his grip!" and it's follow on made me grab myself in a funny, not-so- good way. That said, if Feig had said, "Screw the kids!" while signing the initial contract, the BBC would've probably come along and offered to double his salary...I look forward to finding an extremely unrated version on the DVD/Blu Ray.I spent the best part of two and a half hours at Cineworld, Wandsworth watching the 2D version, laughing my moobs off and gave it a solid 7/10. Having had a day or two to think about it, I may well go back and watch the 3D version simply because I want to feel that I have been properly 'lubed' so I can up that score.Also, make sure you stay to the very end of the credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"That wasn't terrible."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No question, the trailer was bad. The marketing got a bit too into the "all-female" casting. But in the end, Ghostbusters is at least no worse than your average Hollywood action-comedy zombie; has no moments of truly horrid writing or offensive stupidity like, say, the Huntsman sequel; and enough legitimately funny and clever bits to make the thing worthwhile.The fact that, at the time of this review, it has gotten 35% 1 star ratings has nothing to do with its quality; it's entirely due to the insane levels of hate that female-led projects receive among hairy palmed cave trolls. Hollywood summer blockbusters aren't my thing, but if you're going to see one, you might as well see this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Feig has no d***.What can I say that hasn't already been said? This movie is a masterpiece. From the intelligent ORIGINAL plot, to the superb academy award winning performances. The brilliance of Paul Feig strikes again! I just can not believe how good this piece of cinematic ingenuity came into place. What's the next movie going to be called, Ghostbusters 2? MINDBLOWN. Actually, I came from the past via a time machine built by Dr. Emmett Brown. I just watched a film called Ghostbusters in 1984, and man, that movie totally ripped off this one! And they had the AUDACITY to make it an all male cast, totally disrespectful! We are living in progressive times, get with it guys! 10/10Well, 5/10 only because I left during the middle to take a big number two and missed the rest of the movie. Coincidence? Maybe not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really don't get why people are bashing it so much. No, it wasn't a cinematic masterpiece, but that was never the intention. It was a funny, goofy, entertaining movie. I was laughing thru most of it. Yes, it was predictable like 99% of all movies. But it was amusing and endearing, just as the original was. Don't go into expecting the original movie. Just appreciate that it's a comedy about four women hunting ghosts. With Hemsworth as a nice bonus. Kate McKinnon was fantastic! I am honestly hoping they make a sequel; I would very gladly go see it. This movie serves its purpose of providing laughs and entertainment for two hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(No Spoilers)I should start by saying that I saw the original when it came out in the theater and loved it so the remake had a lot to live up to going in.I should also say that I liked other Paul Feig films ("Spy", "The Heat" and "Bridesmaids").Finally, the notion of remaking "Ghostbusters" with an all-female main cast is bothering a disturbing number of people far more than it ought to.This film is a typical, Hollywood Blockbuster summer "event film". Lots of money spent on effects and promotion.Lots of annoying product-placement (note to John Schnatter, if you took the money you spend on advertising and put it into buying better ingredients and paying your employees a decent wage, you'd sell more pizza).That being said, what we get is a good movie - better than most blockbusters and better than many other reboots we've been subjected to recently. Much better than the abominable Star Trek reboot.Fortunately, director Feig keeps his stars (especially McCarthy) from going too crazy. He keeps the CGI from overwhelming the story and even makes sure that there actually is a story.Wiig and McCarty are actually almost subdued compared to other films - though McKinnon manages to steal nearly every scene she's in.Is it "great art"? Of course not. But, then again, neither was the original. The new one is a worthy successor to the original and does exactly what the original did in its day - entertains and amuses us.Bottom line: don't listen to the sexist weasels who hate this film because of some preconceived notion that this is "political- correctness run amok". It's a good and funny film - well worth paying to see on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a fun, funny playful movie. The characters meshed well together, and there were ways that the movie challenges viewers to think in an edgy but kind way. I can't wait to watch it again, to catch many of the more subtle jokes that I likely missed. It's clear a lot of thought went into the many layers of references and nerdy jokes throughout. I suspect that in the background, there will be revenues to science, the prior movie, or other jokes that will be overlooked the first time around. The way academic sconce depart,nets were spoofed was particularly enjoyable to me, as someone who has suffered in academia for decades. Loved it!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand why there are so many bad reviews, this movie was a masterpiece. From the absolutely terrifyingly scary intro that was both AWESOME and MYSTERIOUS... to the hilarious lines and comical/colorful events, all the actors made this movie so good, they all did so well! Absolutely loved Holtzmann especially. They kept it true to the original, and improved it in SO many ways! this new Ghost busters has a great story line, and a scary villain. They were so creative and even added in details on how the crew met, their history and even the way they got their logo and team car. This movie did so well, and coming from a fan of the original Ghostbusters, I was so impressed with their new movie! Hope to see another one soon! Cannot wait to buy the movie when it comes out on DVD! I have recommended everyone go and see it and make their own assumptions instead of listening to hateful reviews that are actually very wrong. This movie had me entertained the entire way through, not only was it adventurous, funny and scary but it felt original, and that's HUGE in this day and age, where so many movies feel plastic and re written. They kept it true to ghost busters, and true to the new technology of this day. AWESOME WORK GUYS. everybody go and see it!! I already wanna see it again and I saw it last night. (and I also watched the original ghost busters this morning to compare) Ghost busters shines again in 2016!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't usually write reviews but so many people were dogging this movie, and I just saw it and thought it was pretty good. I also usually don't like remakes either, especially if it's one of my favorite movies but I felt like they actually made a whole new story, just keeping small reminders of the best parts from the originals. The original actors had small cameo appearances, and just one or two of the classic lines were quoted. Normally remakes and even sequels just rip off of the first movies and try to stretch a story that isn't there. This was like meeting a whole new cool group that reminded you of some old friends.I agree that on a lot of movies lately, they take awesome actors and give them some basic crap dialogue, and this could have been a little better in that department, but it wasn't awful either. I definitely laughed out loud plenty of times and there were some great scary moments like the originals. To the people saying this movie is sexist, it's the all female ghost busters, that's the point so of course they're taking liberties with some of the male characters. I'm pretty sure it was on purpose and more tongue in cheek than truly offensive. No one complains about all the other movies with stupid half naked female characters, so in the nicest way possible, bite me.I wasn't a fan of some of the typical "action movie" background music . They need to hire some new composers. Lord of the rings and gladiator music doesn't have the right vibe for ghost busters. If you disagree, that's your opinion, this is not to put anything up for debate, just to give another view to people who may also want to see the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very entertaining ride, and a worthy successor to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on all the hate, I wasn't sure what to expect. When my partner and I went to see it, we were thoroughly enthralled. The characters are re-imaginings of the originals. The constant hitting on Kevin? Much like Venkman hitting on Dana, though less creepy, considering she wasn't packing a ton of Thorazine. The jokes for the most part landed well, though there were a few that didn't quite gel. I did wonder why, they trapped the one ghost, but later they just go on a straight up ghost murder spree. (compared to the original where they shove everything in a containment unit, kind of like ghost prison) The homages to the original were well done. The cameos were all pretty good. (Murray doing the same entrance/exit as he did in Zombieland) I would have loved the late Harold Ramis, or the retired Rick Moranis would have been great. Aykroyd's appearance in particular made us laugh. We joked he wasn't even acting there, since he is a huge paranormal buff.Anyways, it wasn't perfect, but it was very fun. Much better than Ghostbusters 2, and pretty close to the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Undoubtedly superior to 'GHOSTBUSTERS II'!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'GHOSTBUSTERS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A reboot to the classic 1984 sci-fi comedy hit, and it's 1989 sequel. This modern update has four women starting a New York City ghost-catching business together. It stars Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones (as the four leads); and it features Chris Hemsworth, Andy Garcia, Charles Dance, and most of the original movie's cast, in supporting roles. It was directed by Paul Feig (who previously directed McCarthy and Wiig in the hit comedy flick 'BRIDESMAIDS'), and it was written by Feig and Katie Dippold (who also wrote 'THE HEAT'; which was directed by Feig and costarring McCarthy). Ivan Reitman (the original two films' director) returned as a producer of this installment. The movie has received mostly positive reviews from critics, and female fans alike, but it's also taken a lot of sexist backlash from misogynistic moviegoers. It's been a hit at the Box Office as well (so far). I really liked it. Dr. Erin Gilbert (Wiig) and Dr. Abby Yates (McCarthy) co-wrote a book on the existence of ghosts, many years earlier. Gilbert has since attempted to distance herself from the publication; in order to become a teacher at Columbia University. Yates has continued to study paranormal activity, at a technical college, with her new colleague Jillian Holtzmann (McKinnon). When Gilbert is approached about a possible ghost sighting, she reunites with Yates (in order to investigate it). Gilbert, Yates and Holtzmann later start a 'ghost busting' business together; where they're soon joined by a subway worker named Patty Tolan (Jones). The movie is without a doubt funny, and also aptly made. Feig is definitely a talented director, and he and Dippold wrote a great script together. The cast is all exceptional as well. While the film is definitely not as memorable as the classic original, it is undoubtedly superior to 'GHOSTBUSTERS II'. I think it has the perfect combination of supernatural thrills, intelligent humor, and nostalgic magic. As far as your average reboots go, it's nearly flawless. The movie is also a very noticeable crowd-pleaser (at least at the theater I saw it at). It's definitely a lot of fun!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/176638264</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rotten Tomatoes had this movie at 78% when I checked it. That's about right, but they don't lose points for acting. All four women did a great job - very on par with the original. The story line was good. There were cute cameos by five members of the original cast. No, any weakness was in the editing. There were at least three transitions that were rough. It messed with the flow.I really appreciated the variety of women characters in this film. There was no ridiculous costuming. Conversations focused on ghosts. The women were smart and funny.But the really delightfully unexpected moments were in the ending credits. Whoever put those together deserves an Oscar. There was a post-ending scene buried in the credits that hinted at a sequel (or implied that this new one was the prequel to the old one.) And there was interplay between ghosts, props, and the text of the credits that was so clever.I'm 57 so I've been to a lot of movies. There are always a few people who sit through the credits. This time, almost the entire audience sat through the entire credits, laughing with delight. When it ended and the screen went dark, we all sat there another minute, hoping for more. I've never seen that happen. Amazing.P.S. Kate McKinnon is comedy gold.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen all the movies in the franchise, and this one was as good as the original. The characters were believable, the science was wonderfully geeky (even if ... well, science about ghosts), and when Holtzmann did her thing, it was amazing.And Patty wasn't a stereotype. She was the non-scientist and brilliant at it. It takes a combination of skills to make a good team, and this lot made a good team. Kevin? Icing on the cake. Fluffy, airy, piles of sweet icing on a solid, well-performed story.And more than anything else, the characters had distinct, very believable personalities that had foibles and weaknesses. Fears. Doubts. And who changed and became strong together as the movie progressed.Corny? Of course. Silly? At times. Fun? Definitely. My only criticism is that there were just a few too many harks back to the old movies. But I almost cried when I saw the bronze bust near the beginning.See it. Take your daughters. Show them that science and engineering and technology are amazing. She'll be the *next* generation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me first say, I tried to avoid reviews, trailers, comments and interviews before seeing the new Ghostbusters because I enjoy surprises. I went to this movie without a lot of expectation beyond a lighthearted and goofy remake. That's exactly what I got. The characters are likable. The humor is silly. I loved the original and my teenage self would've loved this too. Special effects don't make or break a film like this, in my opinion. It's about fun and this flick had lots of it. I was in a crowded theater and could hear the laughs around me. The movies are expensive. My husband and I agreed this was worth the price of admission. Better than any superhero movie I've seen in years. Give it a try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very entertaining summer film with all concerns addressed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When is the last time you've actually gone to see a summer film, and it made you feel good? I'm not talking a Disney or Pixar film. It's been a while. I left this moving feeling energized and happy. NO superhero movie of late made me feel that way, perhaps with the exception of Guardians of the Galaxy. Simply put, this film gives the appropriate nods to where it came from, and starts to make it it's own. It's humor is funny AND deliberate. It's okay to not want to see this. If what you see in the trailer doesn't appeal to you, then don't go see it. That's what a trailer is for. That being said, leaving the nostalgia where it belongs (30 years in the past), just go enjoy this. Keep in mind the original Ghostbusters films are perfect. Far from it. All female cast? Awesome. Why not? Go ahead, ask yourself. My only hope is that they continue making it their own, entertaining franchise going forward now that they've given tribute to the false god that *suddenly* everyone started worshiping once they had their man-hoods threatened by an all female cast. Loved it. No, it's not perfect... but a small few are. The whole concept of "Ghostbusters" is ridiculous any way. Just like all the super hero movies. We still go and accept them, though, with a grain of salt. So please don't elevate or compare this film to something they sloppily threw together in the 80's, or films they make now to OBVIOUSLY sell shirts, video games, toys, comics, TV spin offs... It's just a fun entertaining summer film. Give it a try, it's worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many, MANY laugh-out-loud moments in the new Ghostbusters. The film carries on the spirit of the original film and its sequel, but still stands on its own. Lots of little winks back to the 1980s version, and several fun cameos. Lots of action, a few scary moments, cool special effects. A LOT of thought and research was put into the scientific equipment and settings used in the movie ... this thing wasn't just thrown together. Of course it's got its lackluster moments ... some cheesy dialogue, a really corny action scene with Wiig and McCarthy near the end, jokes that fell flat, gags that weren't as funny because they'd already been released in the trailers. But overall it was incredibly entertaining. Also, it's *incredibly* refreshing to see a movie with four female leads where their main concern isn't to get a boyfriend. The focus is on their mission and their friendship with each other. Easily passes the Bechdel Test.Well worth the admission price!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, Entertaining, but a little Clichéd.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The female led Ghostbusters reboot is finally here, and I've got to say I think it's a pretty good movie. There has been a lot of controversy surrounding this film, mostly from internet hacks who were clinging to the sexist chant that "women aren't funny." Ghostbusters is clever and funny, features cool special effects, but is admittedly a little clichéd. That being said this film is very good, and I would say don't let the audience reviews online sway your opinion too much.For those who don't know anything about the Ghostbusters reboot, it's being made by the same people that made Bridesmaids. Bridesmaids is one of the funnier recent comedies, but i'll go so far as to say I enjoyed Ghostbusters more. While Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig are their reliable selves, the show stealers for me were Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones, and Chris Hemsworth. All 3 brought an unexpected level of humor and screen presence, and almost every joke delivered by Leslie Jones had me laughing out loud. Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon may have entered this film as almost exclusively SNL stars, but after this film I think you'll see them in a lot more.The rebooted Ghostbusters, much like the original, uses a lot of special effects, in an attempt to mix big budget CGI with comedy. The original Ghostbusters, sort of broke ground by proving that comedy and big budget special effects could work together, nowadays it's commonplace as every Marvel movie uses the same approach. That being said the effects in this movie, especially the sound design, were cool and looked good. I will say that some of the effects reminded me of Star Wars, but they aren't the first and they won't be the last to copy that movie.The only big problem I had with the movie was that it felt somewhat derivative. Many moments in the movie it felt like they were nodding to the original instead of trying to be different. That along with the reliance of Paul Fieg on the overly talkative humor, where characters refuse to ever let the audience figure a joke out for themselves, are really the only things that seemed weak in the film. That being said major fans of actions films should beware that the action sequences are nothing special, and some characters aren't all that well developed.So in essence Ghostbusters is no masterpiece, it's really not even a great movie, but it is pretty entertaining. The cast is great in the movie, many of the jokes worked, the effects were cool, the soundtrack was nostalgic fun, and the movie even featured cameos from the entire cast of the original, that are still with us. For those who feel weary because the online fan reviews and ratings have been bad, I fear many of those reviewers never saw the movie, and instead gave the movie a bad rating out of hatred that women are in a traditionally male movie. This is a fairly entertaining comedy, and regardless of what you've heard if you like comedies check this movie out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid comedy, mindless fun, just like the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I rule I detest remakes, especially films that I have a connection to. I grew up with Ghostbusters. It was never my favourite, but I enjoyed it. It was SNL comedians and writers coming together for a bigger budget sci-fi comedy. It worked. Ghostbusters 2 was immediately forgettable. It lacked the rawness, the originality, but also the comedic punch of the original. So to remake Ghostbusters, the question is, why? Well remakes make money for one. It sets us in a familiar universe that audiences can understand easily. In this case remaking with the original cast after 2014 is impossible. The great Harold Ramis was the glue that made Ghostbusters work. Plus bringing back older actors to recreate their older roles is a sad display. It sets up for immediate failure. So when the idea of recreating the Ghostbusters world with an female cast, it's immediately an interesting idea. It changes the universe just enough to take the journey again but through the eyes of female characters. I recall seeing one of my favourite plays Glengarry Glenross with an all-female cast because I was intrigued at a familiar subject matter played through the opposite sex. The dynamic totally changes, which is what I find interesting about it. They found four top notch comedians to take the roles which puts it in a good place for success. So with all that I'm not going to deconstruct the film, I'll leave that for other reviewers, all i'll say is that comedies are subjective, you find them funny or you don't. If you don't find it funny then the film won't work for you. But if you do find it funny, then it does, it achieves the entertainment goal you set out when you paid money to see it in the theatre. Sifting through reviews I find a lot of personal biases coming through, which is fine, comedy is subjective, but rating the film 1 out of 10 seems a bit odd to me. These reviews are not actual reviews of the film, they're boring diatribes. So if it helps anyone, my honest opinion of the film is that I found it funny and enjoyable, I'll forget about it in a few weeks, but for now my entertainment has been satiated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why the low ratings?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to be seriously honest: part of the reason for low ratings on this film is almost certainly modern day sexism. 'Man-hating'? Why are you trying to excuse the male- dominance of lead characters in films by making these women take the blame for a film 'dead on arrival'?My advice, to anyone who wishes to watch this film with with an open mind, would be to watch 'Ghostbusters' as a standalone film. Don't compare it to the previous Ghostbuster movies and don't think of it as a sequel: it's a reboot! A funny, modern and awesomely feel-good reboot.Anyone who wants to give this movie a rating of 1 or 2 must be so boring. It's just a bit of fun and entertainment and cameos from Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson and Sigoruney Weaver pay humorous yet subtle homage to the original franchise.Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones and Chris Hemsworth all have brilliant comedic timing. No way - women can be funny? The 'dumb receptionist' role CAN be played (and perfected) by a man? Who knew? Jesus, lighten up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie nowhere near deserves the 1-star it's been getting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story, characters, and plot are different enough from the original that it stands on it's own. Leslie Jones wasn't quite as stereotypical as I expected, and she wasn't terrible. She wasn't amazing either, but wasn't terrible. The same goes for the other three female stars. Not spectacular, but they carry the film. I wish Kate McKinnon would have toned it down a notch, she really seems to have a need to steal the scene and it becomes annoying.Helmsworth (Thor) makes the movie however. The actor &amp; writers did a pretty good job on that character, and justifies the price of an early matinée showing. I would say that I laughed harder during his scenes than any point of either of the two original films.Is the film misandrist? Yes. But considering the history of misanthropy throughout the past hundred years of Hollywood, I'll give it a pass. The film isn't bad by any means. I even put it into the halfway-decent range. People giving it one-star are being disingenuous. Some parts are pretty good, and other parts are not so good (the Bill Murray green screen cameo should have been left on the cutting room floor). But to put it in league with films like From Just to Kelly or Gigli is terribly unfair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First things first.I am a big fan of the original movies but have to admit that my reaction to the trailers for this one was very different to many I have read both here and on the Net.Mine was one of excitement at the thought of having another Ghostbusters movie. The trailers looked fun. Sure the jokes were a little hit and miss and the CG a little too cartoonish but there was a nice mix of nostalgia and freshness to put it on the 'to see' list.Walking out of the movie last night, my original concerns remained valid. The CG is a bit Scooby Doo and it tries a bit too hard to get laughs the whole way through but enough of the jokes land and I found myself chuckling along for the majority of the movie.Wiig and Mcarthy are both fantastic in their roles, totally committing in every way and having great fun doing so. The movie noticeably picks up when Leslie Jones comes on the scene.I loved the idea of Mckinnon's character. I could see what she was going for. A mad scientist straight out of Rocky Horror but for some reason, it never comes off completely. For me, Hemsworth was the only real dud. Not his fault. He did everything he was there to do. The script just doesn't do him justice. The cameos from the original cast are all fun but you can't help feeling that it would have made more sense (and perhaps more fun) for them to have taken on their former roles. Having said that it didn't feel as if they were wasted and there was one particular cameo right at the end (during the credits) that had me smiling from ear to ear.The story is on a par with the originals and treads the right line between fun and frightening.Will it be a classic. Probably not. But it is a fantastic origins story. More in the mould of a Marvel flick than Ghostbusters but no less worthwhile for it.The climax is terrific with a Ghostbustin fight, the likes of which has not been seen before in a Ghostbusters movie.At the end of the day, the film more than met my hopes for it. I left the cinema with a smile on my face. Can you really ask for anything more from a summer flick.I think not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie from the star it establishes its going to be a fun ride, Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) its a physics professor who reunites with long life friend Abby Yates to inspect a manor which there are ghost and discover that they truly exist. The chemistry between this actresses is awesome, for me Jillian Holtzmann (Katte McKinnon) was the best of all of her. Kevin (Chris Hennsworth) was OK but not memorable like the secretary in the first film. the villain was weak and the rest of the cast OK. Its fun and funny but it doesn't have the the story doesn't have the depth the the first two haves. The cameos are bothersome sometimes and theirs a lot. Its a fun ride for the whole family and believe me you are going to laugh, in honesty its the thing it outranked the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really enjoyed this comedy. I laughed through most of the movie. Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones in particular were hilarious. The four Ghostbuster characters had great chemistry and played off each other really well. I thought it might just be a remake of the original, but while they showed a lot of love for the 1984 film, they took the time to make their own plot. All of the cameos and references are really enjoyable - it's great to see the original cast in their new roles.Everyone in this movie clearly had a blast making it. Chris Hemsworth especially seemed happy to be doing something different and seemed to have a lot of fun in his role. I would love to know how much of what he does is improv and how much was scripted.Great ghosts, great action scenes, great jokes. This movie is a great addition to the franchise. Definitely recommend it! I hope there is a sequel to this one, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey, all of you misogynistic, nerdy fanboys who have been viciously attacking this film for a year before it was released because of the female casting, too bad that the antagonist in this movie is you. Boo-hoo. Women have been suppressed for thousands of years, and here's a movie with girl power. So suck it up. It was also produced by Ivan Reitman and executive produced by Dan Ackroyd, so it has the imprimatur from the original GHOSTBUSTERS, which I adored, too. Yes, there are a few plot holes. The script's not perfect. But it is about 500 miles above that bloated corpse BATMAN V. SUPERMAN. And yes, we girls do happen to like cute guys, and I had no problem with Chris Hemsworth, who seemed to be thoroughly enjoying himself.Paul Feig is extremely capable at writing chick flicks, such as BRIDESMAIDS and SPY. He knows what women are like when guys aren't around. Sorry that your minuscule sensibilities were offended. This movie is actually a bit tamer than Feig's other films in presenting the feminine viewpoint. It's not high art. The pacing is efficient, the plot development sufficient, the women actors have good chemistry with each other, and the CGI ghosts were lively (the evil balloons were my favorite). Leslie Jones is my favorite new action hero.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I honestly don't get the hate. I understand that some may feel nostalgia for the 1984 original, but I was shocked when I read early reviews claiming Ghostbusters to be horrible... Why? Even the original cast gave it their blessing, with a smattering of fun cameos. And their support was well deserved, IMO- there's really nothing about this movie that tarnishes or hurts the original. It's an entirely new interpretation with a new cast, new personalities and quirks.This is also very much a Paul Feig film. If you've been a fan of his previous work, you'll enjoy this one too. The only difference in this movie verses his others is it's rating. Ghostbusters is more family friendly, meaning the dialogue has been toned down. But my audience enjoyed it quite a bit. My theater was over half full, and a large majority laughed the entire time. Nobody stormed out, like I was expecting from the "horrible" reviews trashing the film. It was a pretty decent movie that's there to (at times) make you laugh, make you scared and occasionally wink at the 1984 classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First and foremost,ignore the hating on this movie. It's exceptional and in no way harms the original. They could not have got a better cast and director to move this movie forward in the way it has ended up being. Kate Mckinnon is a revelation and steals every scene but that does not affect the chemistry with the others in anyway. Everyone is hilarious in this movie and yes, while it may nod to the original in places, it is entirely well acted and written enough to be its own entity. I would go as far to say it will be a future classic and stands up well alongside Paul Feig's other work. Ignore the hate like I said and I for one will be getting the Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very skeptical going in to watch this movie. A good majority of the reviews I read said this movie should be avoided at all costs, but I think I may have watched a totally different movie. I loved it! And I'm going to go see it again! In my opinion, the movie maintained a good balance between, nodding to the original, but being its very own movie. The plot was not reliant of the original, the characters were unique and there were many Easter eggs throughout that didn't make you forget about the original. Growing up with the Ghostbusters, I cherish it and this movie had a lot to live up to! I was not disappointed. I laughed throughout and could not wait to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Of Ghosts, Ghoulies and Trolls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aside from the curiosity of grown men walking off cliffs in pursuit of imaginary creatures, 2016 might go down in sociological terms as noteworthy for the vitriol meted out on a particular film ? namely this all-female reboot of the much loved 1984 Bill Murray/Dan Ackroyd original (which spawned a rather less-loved 1989 sequel). Not only it seems have ghosts and ghoulies been unleashed on the world, but also trolls? lots of them. Quite why this is the case, before anyone had even seen the film, is a bit of a mystery to me?. Would this have happened if it had been a "traditional" male-dominated reboot? I suspect not. In which case the phenomenon is unpleasantly sexist and wrong. Notwithstanding the internet furore, I went into this with low expectations?. but was pleasantly surprised. It's not the best film ever made? but as a piece of summer confection, it is far better than most.The plot is largely inconsequential, and follows the vague outline of the original 1984 flick: scary opening; Ghostbusters formation; ghouls released by misfit bad guy; big squishy thing (literally); Ghostbusters to the rescue; will they win through? (erm? guesses anyone?).In a bit more detail, Erin (Kristen Wiig) is alarmed to see her academic reputation rocked by the appearance on Amazon of a book she ghost-wrote (arf) many years ago with Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy). Abby and her kooky colleague, engineering whizz-kid Jillian (Kate McKinnon), are quietly beavering away at a dodgy academic institution in a pseudo-scientific study of the supernatural. The three ? together with freaked-out subway ticket clerk Patty (Leslie Jones) ? get drawn into the supernatural schemes of loner terrorist nut-job Ed Mulgrave (Ed Begley Jnr) as New York goes non-linear on the spookometer.Classifying the film is a bit tricky since it's not strictly a remake; neither is it a complete reboot. One of the charms of the film in fact is its warm and frequent referrals to the original classic, including (largely) amusing cameos from all but two of the main original cast (excluding Harold Ramis, who died in 2014 ? and to who the film is dedicated ? and Rick Moranis who just said "no"). A nice example is the selection of the fire station as the Ghostbuster's headquarters: a choice that is then declined due to the astronomical rents in favour of the upstairs floor of a Chinese takeaway! But as well as wallowing in nostalgia, the film is also aware of its 2016 roots, with some topical jokes and an hilariously barbed anti-trolling reference to the internet furore: a Youtube comment "Ain't no bitches gonna hunt no ghosts.".I have to admit to not being an enormous fan of Melissa McCarthy's shtick (she falls in my 'Rebel Wilson' categorization box), but Kirsten Wiig is excellent and consistently made me laugh: and there is a lot of good laugh-out-loud humour in here, with the script by Katie Dippold and Paul Feig ("Bridesmaids", "Spy" and who also directs) hitting about a 70:30 hit:miss rate. A more acquired taste is Kate McKinnon who takes kooky to a whole new level. I quite liked her: my wife felt her the weakest of the four leads. But the standout comedy performance here was ? surprisingly ? by Chris "Thor" Hemsworth as the 'dumb but can dance' male secretary Kevin ("such a manly name"). He's a scene-stealer, and adds significant entertainment value to the appealing and clip-filled end-titles.But perfect it's not. The start of the film lumbers rather than launches into its stride (not helped by the up-front 'scar-ee' ? tour guide Zach Woods ? being a wise-guy joke cracker rather than a straight-man? library-lady must be turning in her grave); some of the interplay between the lead characters comes across as forced and a tad cringy; the music editing seems curiously inept at times; and some of the special effects bear more comparison to the 80's films than modern day state-of-the-art.But as a park-brain-at-door summer comedy it didn't disappoint: and if my rating is perhaps a star or two over-generous this is just to counter the internet haters.(If you found this review useful, please visit http://bob-the-movie-man.com to see the graphical version and to sign up for future reviews.

		<shortDescription>A decent new take on an old favorite, very good entertainment with a good mix of slapstick, tongue-in-cheek fun, and big- boom action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a 10-star movie by far on most criteria, but an honestly funny movie, with good special effects, truly "scary" parts (OK, more startling than scary but well-executed all the same), lots of self-deprecating jabs, and jabs at stereotypical movie/cultural clichés. Low-brow and slapstick humor, as well as more subtle jokes, fun cameos, fun references to the original movies. Is it an imitation of the first GB? Yes, of course it is, but I don't understand the criticism to this: it's a fun remake of the original, with many twists and turns. Of course, the plot, some scenes, characters are going to look similar, it was done on purpose. Is it crass commercialism, lack of imagination...? It did not appear so to me, just a bunch of writers taking the old original movies, and putting their own touches to it, and produce a 2016 version of it. I didn't feel that the characters always meshed 100%, might have hammed it up over the top at times - but i also felt it was part of the theme of the movie - over the top. Unlike most all the 1-star critics of the movie, I was certainly NOT offended by any depiction of a vapid male: and I'm a guy. There has been million female counterparts to his character, and this was obviously done as a caricature - and well done. I also don't understand the criticism of the special effects. I'm a fan of big CGI movies, and i certainly didn't find fault with this one: ghosts, battles, crazy weapons... it all worked together well. I saw the movie in 3D, I'm not a big fan of that (because prescription glasses interference, mostly), but it was well done, added to the "depth" of the movie, and the intended startling scenes worked, and got me jumping out of my seat. No complaints there! The soundtrack only partially worked for me - no problems with the sound effects, perfectly meshed with the CGI, but the new take on the famous theme was not always welcome - might be because we're so familiar with that original that any variation sounds surprising. Still - nothing abysmal that would deserve a 1-star rating.So, in conclusion, not the movie of the year, but a decent new take on an old favorite, very good entertainment with a good mix of slapstick, tongue-in-cheek fun, and big- boom action, well worth paying full pop to view in the theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, some of these reviews are blown WAY out of proportion. People hating for the sake of hating. It's a movie, not a political statement or positioning. And i might add, reviews done before it was released! HELLO?! Secondly, most of all the original people involved were involved in this re-imagining! So suck it up and deal with it. Watch it for what it is. A very good movie for it's time. The 1st act is genuinely laugh out loud funny and jump out your seat scary. The 2nd act gets a little lost but keeps you on the plot with a few laughs and more scares. The 3rd act seems to fly by, and although not as funny or scary it is satisfying. The girls turn in great comedy performances as does Hemsworth. It does stumble where it tries to nod to the original and should of kept along it's own unique path. Although as an origin story, it was always going to be difficult not to tread on the original's toes. But if it wasn't in New York with Armageddon beckoning there'd of been uproar. Besides the "Ain't no bitches gonna hunt no ghosts", they address all the haters with a subtle hand in the face, because, who cares about the haters!?I was 7 when the 1st came out and loved it, my niece and nephew are a little older and will love it too... So, grow up a little bit, be a big kid and love it. And more importantly go watch it before hating!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's start off by saying that I'm one of the original GB generation and so was surprised that the reboot of this classic would have 4 women replacing the all-male cast. I believe that a number of men of a similar vintage across the globe were not only surprised but also angered by this, which it seems has fueled a surge of hate-posting on various forums and movie review websites. Clearly, this is nothing more than misogynistic madness aimed at discrediting the movie before it even hit the screens. Considering that this movie is produced by Dan Akroyd and stars a number of the original cast in support, it is rather paradoxical that in attempting to keep the original version sacrosanct these haters have probably offended the very men who brought them this movie in the first place!Anyhow, I am pleased to report that this movie is GREAT -- go and see it! I'm glad I did, and hope that they make a second one. The script is especially funny...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Worthy Companion To The Parent Franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd heard rumblings of a potential remake/third Ghostbusters film for a while. Seth Rogen and some of the other usual Apatow suspects were involved. Which I thought was fine, but why bother remaking the film if nothing changes all that much. Personally, I think the video game that came out a few years ago was an equitable solution: you get the original cast and there's a passing of the torch.Flash forward to roughly two years ago when it's announced that Paul Feig would be directing the remake and that the four leads would be women. I've enjoyed Feig's work since Freaks &amp; Geeks and after reading his two memoirs, know he has a deep love and affection for the work of Harold Ramis &amp; Co. Plus there are a lot of hilarious women, many of them are probably in your life if you're lucky enough. I was initially lukewarm on the film after the first trailer came out. But that's typical for Feig's films, they play much better than the trailer's indicate. And as it turns out, the same holds true for Ghostbusters.The film's cast is a murderer's row of hilarious actors and actresses. I was sold from the beginning. Zach Woods has a knack for selling ridiculous lines with a completely straight face.One criticism I've seen is that the film hews too closely to the story beats of the original. It's fair to point out, but I don't think it hurts the film. The Force Awakens roughly did the same thing and more overtly with A New Hope.Feig's films find humor in relationships between characters along with visual gags and slapstick material. There's a lot of joy in watching McKinnon, McCarthy, Wiig, and Stone together. And speaking of McKinnon, this is a star turn for her. Holtzman is a force of nature and steals nearly every scene featuring her. With her shock of wild, curly blonde hair, visually she recalls Egon in The Real Ghostbusters.Chris Hemsworth is great as the Ghostbuster's deeply weird and incompetent secretary, Kevin. And speaking of related parts of the franchise, the film is full of nods and fan service to the original films, from the cameos of the original four in various ways. Even Harold Ramis makes an appearance, as a bust outside of Dr. Erin Gilbert's office. Some of the cameos feel a little forced, but it's nice to see the original cast on screen and passing the torch to a new generation of Ghostbusters. There's a bit of inside baseball in the film when it comes to acknowledging the backlash to it from whiny man-babies who got so in their feelings they made the first trailer the most disliked video on YouTube ever.The film's villain could easily be one of the horde crying, "Actually, it's about ethics in paranormal investigation."One criticism I have is pacing, but that's par for the course with Feig/Apatow films. But it doesn't hurt the film overall. It's a deeply funny film with substantive characters and it's a pure joy seeing funny and talented women comedians get to have a swing at sci-fi comedy.Near the end of the film I hoped we might get a sequel even though Ghostbusters II was middling in comparison with the original.The post-credit scene involving the mention of a familiar foe from the franchise made me giddy with anticipation.It will likely be difficult to walk into the theater with an uninformed opinion, given the conversation surround the film, but you'll be in for one of the funniest films of the year and one of the best films this summer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In order to appreciate this movie you have to first accept that it is not attempting dry humor, it is not a competition with the original, and it refuses to take itself too seriously. That's the fun and uniqueness of it. The whole tone is light and fun and the costumes, sets, and bright CGI are designed to fit that atmosphere to perfection. I think people are also ignoring that this movie is partially targeted to a young teen audience. There was no swearing, no dirty jokes. Just a really well rounded well designed movie. Kate Mckinnon's comedic timing was incredible. I'm a fan of dark crass humor but it was refreshing to watch a movie with such a pure and unpretentious comedic strategy.

		<fullReview>Before I saw the movie I decided to read some reviews. And what surprised me was that a lot of the reviewers hadn't even seen the movie. I feel if you are going to rate a movie you should hold judgment until you actually watch the movie. With that being said, I thought the movie was great. It was funny and had good animation. Yah, some of the acting was a little silly, but it was still good and it fit into the movie. Have you seen the acting int he originals? Talk about cheesy and I am a huge fan of the originals. It was not a retelling of the original (I saw in another review, saying it was a rip-off of the original - did they even watch the movie like they claim?). It has nods to the original movies, but with a story line of its own. It was very women empowering with a few jabs at men, which was funny and refreshing. I will be watching the movie multiple times before it leaves the theater.</fullReview>

It is amazing fun and promotes women as heroes, a stance we sorely need. If you're looking for a fun summer movie that has enough energy to hold your attention for a few hours, and make you feel exhilarated afterwards, you've come to the right place. Don't deny yourself the pleasure of seeing this movie because a few people have made it their life's purpose to hate it. It is honestly amazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome summer movie! Ignore the haters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My family thoroughly enjoyed this movie. In fact, "Ghostbusters" has been the number one movie my nephew has wanted to see all summer and it did not disappoint! And this is coming from a family who are big fans of the original. All of the actors were hilarious! Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, and Leslie Jones all cracked us up,as did Chris Hemsworth. Feig's reboot was very enjoyable and Dan Aykroyd is even an executive producer for the film.It's such a shame that a small group of ignorant, sexist trolls who can't handle the idea of smart, funny women taking on the starring roles in this reboot are trying to tear it down with a 4.6 rating. I'm proud that my 10 year old nephew is able to recognize the movie for what it is: a fun-filled summer blockbuster and that women (like his loving Aunties and Grandmother who took him to see it) are smart, funny, complex beings who can take on any role they want. We are all looking forward to the follow up!With "Ghostbusters" earning $3.5 million on its opening night, it's on pace to make $45- $50 million during its opening weekend. "Always stay gracious, best revenge is your paper".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignore the critics and nostalgic fanboys. It's a blast!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Under normal circumstances I'd give it an 8, but since there are thousands of 1 star reviews that were put on this site by people who haven't seen the film, I feel compelled to give it a ten.I loved it. Yes, it's not the original, but I give them credit for doing something new with the Ghostbusters concept and doing it well, as opposed to ripping off the original.Chris Hemsworth is definitely the funniest character in the film, but as with any Feig film, there's plenty of humor to go around. It starts off early with Abby (McCarthy) and Jillian (McKinnon) draw in Kristen Wiig's character to listen to an 'EVP', which turns out to be a fart. It ends with Hemsworth's character, powered up by a ghost possessing him, forcing the national guard to do a synchronized dance routine. Leslie Jones' character, Patty, is the stand-in for the audience, and her signature brand of crass/loud humor is a riot! I especially liked the tribute to Egon Spengler, which was a bit subtle but appropriate. You'll see what I mean.At any rate, go see it. Don't listen to the legion of nostalgic fanboys or the critics. Provided you can enjoy something a little different, I'm sure you'll love this film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off: I straight up loved this movie. I enjoyed it so much that I cried starting in the last ten minutes and didn't stop until after the credits. That's how much I liked it. So be forewarned.I really enjoyed a lot of things about the movie: the effects were pretty good, the dialogue was pretty snappy in general, I laughed a lot (and yes, a lot of it is "low brow" humor, but whatever), and it was fun overall. There were a couple things that really stood out for me.- I have never seen a movie with geeky, intelligent, conventionally attractive and "not conventionally attractive," dorky women of so many different body types and personalities. I haven't. Maybe I'm missing something? But this movie has geeky women - about different things! Tech! Ghosts! History! - being both effective and able to fail, being dorky (oh, gosh, sometimes so awkward), being feminine AND somewhat masculine AND disregarding both, being straight and awkward about it, being very obviously queer (no, the lines stating that one of the characters is gay aren't in the movie, but it's demonstrated well in the film without interfering with the plot in a non-romance film, which I thought was great!), being kind of ambivalent in sexual context (possibly asexual!), being strong physically, being weak physically, being book smart, being street smart, being academic, being working class - they were REAL. HUMAN. WOMEN. I can't say that enough. I can't.- This movie was a movie about women and about women's friendships. There were a couple of different friendships represented - one was a long-term teenage friendship with a falling out, one was a working relationship that was also a really strong friendship, one was a newer friendship that was very quickly a "I'd die for you!" friendship, and there were other arrangements within that. It was amazing and beautiful. I never saw Bridesmaids (not so much my crowd), and while I enjoyed Heat, it was a much simpler film in regards to relationships. This film had some conflict, but it wasn't that awful entertainment-ruining conflict for me, and it made the characters seem real, and seeing women's friendships in a non- "women's film" context was really cool.- The women were unapologetic dorks and geeks. You know those like, "cool tech techno babble" moments that like, every sci-fi film or show has, where everyone crowds around a table to look at stuff? THIS. HAD. THAT. BUT. IT. WAS. WOMEN. and I just couldn't stop squealing and being so freaking excited. And like, the women used jargon and confused people with their intelligence and knew things other people didn't know and were silly but still were SMART and GOOD AT THEIR JOBS and SHOWED ENTHUSIASM and YES. - The villain was so appropriate. I won't go into details here. They were just so perfect for the context of the film internally and externally, and it really just felt so right. A+ on the film writers and creators. Just, yes.- Men were secondary. I love men, I really do. But men have a lot of their own films! A LOT. So I was like, oh, we'll have more men heroes. But wow, the men came out on the rough end here. Men were shown for the superficial issues we often see, but some of the toxic parts of masculinity and men's behavior was highlighted, too. That was really cool to me, because it felt like a reversal of the norm. And even though the guys were kind of idiots, the women didn't treat them awful the whole time. They may not have respected them and been frustrated with them, but they didn't dehumanize them. Which, you know, was kind of a deviation from that reversal.- Callbacks were cool, but weren't needed. The film had a number of callbacks to the original films, which were great! I've seen the originals, but I'm not a huge fan. The callbacks were cute, and I recognized them, but they also served a GREAT role in explaining why this movie was good, approved by its predecessors, and how the movie didn't really need validation at all because it was just a great movie. - I felt like I was a part of it. Ghostbusters was such a boy's club when I was growing up. I watched the films young, and even then I had issues with the content and was pretty unenthusiastic about it. I mean, I saw them before I was 10 and the main characters were like, 40 year old sexist men. Like... not my thing. But this? This movie was made for people like me. Not to the exclusion of others, no, but it made me feel so welcome. Finally, something I had grown up alienated from was for me and I could know that.- There are some moments that made my heart swell. There were plenty of silly things, plenty of goofy things, laughs, groans, cheering for cool action bits (Seriously, Holtzmann's scene near the end HOLY MAN)... but there were a few lines that were about like, friendship, and acceptance, and it was so good. I really loved it. I will probably see it again in the theater, &amp; I'm definitely buying it when it's out. I won't "recommend" because I know there will always be people who come back complaining that I didn't warn them it was "stupid" or "immature" because it had some toilet humor (cuz it's okay if Puck does it but not a woman) or because it had slapstick or something. I can't get hung up on that right now, so I'm just gonna say: I loved it, it made me happy, it made me feel welcome and included, and it made me laugh so hard I cried. &#xfeff;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good summer fun that defies the negative reviews.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first review I've ever written on IMDb. While I like discussing movies, I rarely feel like I need to inform the public at large as to why they need to go see one... in this instance, I was inspired to write a review simply because this movie has been grossly misrepresented in the other user reviews on this page. Here are the main complaints people seem to have with the movie (that I've read) and why they now, after actually seeing the movie, seem to be a bunch of bologna: 1. It is a copy of the original Ghostbusters. Now, this one confuses me a little bit. If you were not expecting to see a remake of the original Ghostbusters, then what exactly were you expecting to see? A gritty reboot? A prequel? Anyone who went to see this movie knew darn well that it was a remake. There were elements of the plot that were similar to the original Ghostbusters... because it was a remake. In the place of an entirely new plot and setting, there was a fresh-faced cast, better special effects, and different jokes. You know... like a remake. 2. The comedy was unfunny. Comedy has always been subjective, and it always will be. Not everyone likes the style of Kristen Wiig with her clever one-liners mumbled under her breath, or the style of Kate McKinnon with her funny voices and facial expressions. I, my husband, and the rest of the theater in which we were watching the movie, however, were laughing our butts off this whole movie. Chris Hemsworth showed his comedy chops as a clueless receptionist and got some of the biggest laughs in the whole movie. Leslie Jones screaming, "The power of Patty compels you!" and smacking a ghost out of Melissa McCarthy's body was pretty darn funny, as well as the mayor of New York proclaiming, "Don't you EVER compare me to the Jaws mayor!" and Kristen Wiig trying to unsuccessfully translate every Spanish phrase she came across. Everybody got some good lines in, and to proclaim the whole movie unfunny would be a lie. 3. The Patty character was a black stereotype. I have to admit, I was dubious about this one as well. From the trailers, it looked like Patty would be the street-wise magic black woman of the film. I was happy to find that not the case, though knowing her work on SNL, I should have known she would not let herself be shoehorned into a racial stereotype. Does she speak with a New York city "black person" accent? Yes. That's probably because she is a black person who lives in New York city. If you're expecting her to mumble and stutter like Kristen Wiig, you won't be seeing that, since that has never been a part of Leslie Jones' comedy style. You won't find her shaking her head and complaining about "these white women" or something like that, either. In fact, her race was not mentioned in any of the dialogue during the film, which I would take as a pointed message: it doesn't matter. She gave a loud, funny, performance, and it balanced nicely with the other actresses, who were all a little quieter. 4. This movie is sexist (against men). Oh, here we go. This is the real big one. I'm sure keyboard heroes behind their computer screens were waiting with fingers poised to write this complaint about this movie. I could almost taste the wounded vindication from all the reviewers who were incredibly quick to point out that all the male characters in this movie were "2- dimensional" and "useless." I can't even begin to explain the irony of men pointing this out in a female-led action movie and expecting the world to be outraged for them, while women have been making this complaint about almost every action movie since the dawn of the film age (James Bond movies, anyone?). It is so completely tempting to say, "don't dish it out if you can't take it, fellas." However, as a mature adult, I will resist. Yes, the male characters in this movie were, on the whole, pretty simple. I would say that is probably because 1) this is a comedy-action movie, not a psychological drama, and 2) THERE WERE NO MALE MAIN CHARACTERS. You know who were developed as characters? The four leads, especially Wiig and McCarthy, who were the stars of the movie. Who, incidentally, were also all female. Shocking, I know. My final thoughts: This is not a movie that is trying to win an Oscar, and you know what? Neither was the original Ghostbusters, so I don't know why people are acting as if this movie has desecrated hallowed ground. It is a summer blockbuster, and a darn good one at that. There was no sex or swearing, it was funny, there were some good action scenes (the final battle with a crowd of ghosts in Times Square is especially cool-looking) and I didn't have to think too hard while I enjoyed my popcorn and a good night of distraction at the movie theater. The only reason I felt I had to write this review was because all the other reviews I saw on here truly misled me before I saw the movie for myself. My best advice to others is to do the same: see it for yourself, and ignore the plethora of writers who seem to be hating this movie for no good reason.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has a lot of unwarranted hatred. Based on a trailer and people's own prejudices, it has been deemed a total failure, and I'm here to tell you that is not the case.This movie is good. It's fun. It's campy. All the leading ladies are funny and smart and an individual. And there is no competing for men, no catty insulting, no unnecessary romantic subplots. Chris Hemsworth's character is an excellent satire of the ridiculous gender stereotypes prevalent in movies today. The story is decent and well-paced, and the cameos never felt forced (okay maybe Ozzy's a bit weird). The effects are fun and campy, much like the original. There are nods to the original movie, but never too much. It is its own story.Please don't let irrational nutcases on the internet stop you from seeing or enjoying this movie.</fullReview>

These women were awesome and it's about time they redid this movie with women! Why shouldn't they be women? Women are just as capable. And, funny. Loved that the blue humor of the previous movie was gone. In its place was a refreshing romp, scary, chilling, funny and delightful. From the music to the cameos to the action and special effects - I'm glad I saw it in theaters and I hope that the bullies who want to tell everyone else what to watch will go get lives and stop with the lynch mob mentality.Way to go, creative team! Hoping for a sequel all the way, baby!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I haven't been this giddy after a movie since I was a teenager.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disclaimer, I put a vote of 10 on here to combat the one star votes this movie is unfairly getting. Is it a perfect movie? No, but it's damn good.I agree with most of the newspaper reviews I've read, the cast is fantastic, the jokes are hilarious, the action sequence at the end is a little too long and for the last quarter of the movie it felt like they sacrificed comedy in order to have action - but I'm guessing that's a result of studio interference. There was obviously a big comedy bit cut from the film itself when the bad guy makes all the cops and military guys strike a disco pose ... and then nothing happens. Big set up, no follow through at all. (The subsequent scene appears in the credits. Hopefully the directors cut will put it back in)I was not familiar with Kate McKinnon before watching this film, and am now a huge fan. She is by far the breakout star, and I can't wait to see all sorts of little girls dressed up as Holtzmann for Halloween. I left this movie giddy and literally jumping up and down with glee. That doesn't happen very often!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously all of these man babies are having breakdowns about what a man hating mess this was. And yet there was not a moment of man hating in the entire movie. If you are saying that the only reason this was man hating is because all of the main stars were female and one male actor brought on because they are attractive then the reverse must be true. Making over 90% of all block buster hits women hating. Yet these activists who are crying out for equality don't care when it is the women being overly sexualized. This movie was hilarious and had perfect timing with all of the jokes. It kept the same styling with the modern cgi twist and the star cameos were the cherry on top. Don't listen to all of these men throwing fits, give this phenomenal movie a shot and you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is AMAZING and nothing negative anyone else is saying about it is accurate nor should it dissuade anyone from seeing this movie. I grew up a giant fan of the original movies and the cartoon. I spent many hours of my childhood pretending to be a ghostbuster with neighborhood boys and it always ended the same way, I would "fail" somehow to be a good ghostbuster because I was a girl and they would have to capture my ghost while I was forced out of the game. This movie means the world to me. There are things that can be improved certainly, but it is incredible to see an action film where women are heroic, strong, intelligent, and empowered without the help of any men that need to come save them when their "inherent feminine deficiencies" manifest. Go see it, see it two or three times, women take your daughters, sons, husbands, parents, cousins, siblings, and buddies. It is fun for everyone I would say 7 yrs old and up. All I found myself thinking was "This is how boys and men must feel when watching every other action movie that exists, this sense of identity, pride and accomplishment." This film is a childhood dream come true and I can't wait to own it!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ghostbusters holy god this movie. please, /please/ ignore the hysteria reviews, this movie is not terrible, and neither is it particularly 'man hating' at all. in fact, the only people I see shitting on the male characters, are the males. personally, I found Kevin fantastic. and this movie was exactly as powerful and feminist as I needed it to be, as many girls, boys, non binaries, everyone needed it to be. I saw many people saying "the whole cinema was bored to death", "the atmosphere was so dull, everyone in the cinema hated it." - I don't know which cinemas these people were going to, but it wasn't mine. it was positively roaring with laughter, and everyone seemed to have left with a smile and enjoyed themselves, young, and very old people alike. it was funny, it was exciting, it made me, as a young teenage girl feel empowered. I'm sure it made the old man next to me feel empowered as well. and the girls along the row, and the man in the wheelchair at the front, and the children, and the parents. Everyone can look up to these women, these smart, lovely women. they kick ass and they do it well! in my opinion, better than the original (I know lots will disagree, and that's okay.) but we needed this movie. we needed jillian flirting with erin. we needed women who took the spotlight. we needed (more) poc characters, and patty is one of the funniest, badass woman I've seen in a movie like this. this movie is for everyone, and it's amazing. the effects, the music, the atmosphere. it was beautiful. I almost cried a lot of times during, not because it was sad, but because I was so in awe. it's my favourite movie I've seen in 2016 (that was made in 2016) and my favourite film I've ever seen in the cinema. one of my favourites ever. I cannot describe how perfect and amazing it was. but I hope you put aside these pissy crybaby reviews whining about how it wasn't the original and go see it. it wasn't the original, it was better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is no where near a masterpiece and is no where near as good as the original. But this movie is not too terrible. It has some good moments and laughs. I would say, don't listen to critics and don't let a trailer fully decide if you will like it or hate it. I was very skeptical of this movie because of all the hate I heard from many places about how terrible and horrible this movie is. I was surprised to see that this movie was not the hell spawn that everyone says it is. It could have been written better with some more intelligent jokes. But, It could have been a lot worse.

		<fullReview>First of all, I would like to say that yes, this is the first review from my account and no, I wasn't bribed to say something positive about this movie. My motivation was, only and exclusively, all the men-hate towards this movie. Guys, I get you, I really do. You are not used to be represented by the stupid one, are you? You are used to be the hero. I bet that the sexist jokes made you really angry. But guess what? We, women, have been dealing with this jokes since the first movies of the history of cinema. "The girl that needs a man" or "the hot girl that is almost too stupid to function" (yeah, I kinda quoted Mean Girls there). This movie really turned the roles, right? And you did not like that. I think that this movie is funny for the genre. If you were waiting for an Oscar nomination... Well, you had extremely high hype. All the jokes were supposed to be stupid. Don't you get that? It's the type of movie that makes you facepalm a lot but be able to laugh. About the script: I saw a lot of comments saying that is basically the "copy paste" of the first film and other that say that it's the worst script they have ever read/listen to, so... Yeah, I wouldn't say that as the best script ever, be again, it's not an Oscar film. If you wanna read a nice review, read The New York Times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just to be honest, I never seen any of the original Ghostbuster movies in full. I have seen a scene once or twice on TV though years ago, but I never had the chance to see it, but I'm hoping one day I will. I do love the original 1984 theme song. So yes this movie had a whole lot of controversy thrown at itself since the trailer was uploaded on YouTube and to be honest, the trailer didn't leave a huge impression on me either. However I was interested in seeing it still and see how it turns and...I thought it was fun and decent. The movie had a few problems, one of them, who had left me cringing ever since the trailer was announced, was Chris Hemsworth. There were times where he had some funny moments like him saying his glasses were always getting dirty and he had to take the lens out to avoid it, that was pretty funny and clever in a ditsy funny dumb way. But when he covered his eyes as he mistaken them as ears you just cringe at him being dumb!There are many problems this movie could've fixed, one of them was the villain. He had no backstory for his reason, all we know is that he's just this creepy guy who works at a hotel being an a**hole. He said he had been bullied or ridiculed during his 'reveal' around the middle of the film but a backstory would've been proper. Plus I hate it how he was revealed earlier in the film, straight away due to his creepiness and use of the ghost machines we know he's the villain. Why can it be a different that the Ghostbusters assumed that it was some other person and it turns out the villain was the one who used him/her to prevent himself being arrested and carry on his plan until the GB's knew who the real one was.One other thing is homeland supporting them behind the scenes and publicly saying they are fraudsters, feels like they are forcing a 'government are the bad guys!!' tag here. Another problem is the lack of explanation of some certain scenes. In one scene after they found the creepy guy in the hotel after he killed himself, Dr. Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) was in a hotel room in a robe after the 'arrest' by homeland security. First off why was she separated from her team and second of all during the fight scene Dr. Jillian Holtzmann (Kate Mckinnon) said to her 'welcome back!' was there a fallout between them because it feels like they cut a scene out that made this part of the plot make no sense whatsoever.There were cameos that felt a little forced but OK showcasing a throwback to the original. Those were the problems that I had with the movie. But why did I say it was fun? Well the story, despite its problems, was entertaining, some jokes still pull off rather well, my favourite was when they saw their first ghost and then it cuts to YouTube saying 'GHOSTS REAL' feeling like one of those hoax videos made by people who want some attention. The build up it for it was good as well starting small and ending big! The effects may not be the best to some but to me I think they were good to look at.I think the female actors that played the Ghostbusters were funny and did some good acting in it as well. Yeah I think the female actors were good, not those sexist morons that think it's wrong of them to do that, I know that's not the main problem from many after the trailer as it was mostly the jokes and effects. But there are some morons who hate it because women are playing Ghostbusters, despite that the cartoon series did that as well and no one cracked each other's heads open over it. I also hate how some people on Twitter were saying many sexist and racist words to Leslie Jones all because of her role in Ghostbusters, absolutely stupid and pathetic of those losers who just want to whinge about 'mY childH00d was rwined'. I hate that tag line! First off the original Ghostbusters is still there to watch and to enjoy even with today's younger generation. Second, no one is forcing you to see this movie and you can have your own opinion but saying your childhood is ruined is just a weak excuse. There are people in this world who sadly had a troubled childhood and there reason is not because of a movie that is being rebooted. Disagree with me all you want, but it's rather petty to make it as your exact reason to hate this movie. I know some people who like the original GB film and they enjoyed the reboot too. In the end, there were some hit and misses but whether you're new to Ghostbusters you might find this decent and fun. By the way if anyone or as millennials put it, 'haters', think this is part of a stupid theory that movie companies pay people to say good things about a movie that people thought it was going to be bad, please don't show your ignorance. There are people who can enjoy a movie be it a bad or good one, it's subjective, like Art and music. Don't expect everyone to hate this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lot of Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm at a loss to understand why this film has garnered so many bad one-star reviews from supposed "ordinary folks" while the professional critics were a lot more positive about it. Personally, I had a lot of fun and enjoyed the film thoroughly. I'm glad I listened to those professional critics in this case. What a relief to see something so entertaining in a summer movie season that has been something of a disappointment so far. I was the only one in attendance at a 10:45 a.m. Sunday showing, but even then I wondered where everyone else was. Not even a couple more moviegoers? Then I read the reviews. Ignore the naysayers. Perhaps the film is not for everyone, perhaps there's been something of calculated campaign on the part of some activist group or another (for whatever incomprehensible reasons) to target this film for critical sabotage ... but I got a real kick out of the performances of the main actors; their chemistry, banter and quick, witty lines had me chuckling throughout. Plus, the special effects were much more than passable (even in this day of take-it-for-granted CGI); and the musical score and riffs on the original "Ghostbusters" tune enhanced the whole. The final credits and final tag/teaser scene after the end credits were entertaining as well. It's a complete package for a comedy. Go see the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four women respond tot sightings of ghosts all over the city.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I love about this movie is that it does not take itself too seriously. It takes the concept of battling ghosts and has fun with it. It is seriously well- made though. From the jokes, to the plot and including the cool music - everything is there for an entertaining couple of hours. And I love the fact that 4 female geeks and nerds in this movie never look out of place. They rock the look :-). I think they did a good job balancing nostalgia and modern progress. For instance: they use 3D as it is supposed to. I am not entirely sure, but if memory serves me right the plot is more fleshed out in terms of the potential threat than the original. And the gadgets are cool :-).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great, but not as bad as some claim</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't help but feel most of the negative reviews come from people who adore the original 1984 movie and are comparing them each step of the way. This is only to be expected, given the classic nature of the original, but reinforced by the original cast cameos sprinkled throughout. Good scenes, but invited comparison. If this film could have been allowed to stand on its own merits (impossible, I know), it might have fared better. I did my best to simply enjoy the film for what it is without comparing every scene.It's not uncommon for 'hero team' films like this to portray just about everyone they deal with as ignorant or mean, obstructions to be overcome and it's no different here. "The only sane ones in a world gone mad!" The original certainly did that (Walter Peck, anyone? The owner of the Sedgewick Hotel?) and I suspect some have mistaken this as man-bashing since the primary cast is made up of women. It seems to come down to 'this was man-territory and you're taking it from us! grr!' but it's just not warranted. There's quite a few good male performances, Charles Dance of course is always classy, plus a few other minor roles. It's fine.I enjoyed the flow of this style of comedy (only one fart joke even!) The directing style is... interesting, but I didn't have trouble following the story. Didn't really care for the CGI style and it was overused a lot towards the end. Definitely more of an action movie style than the original (there's that comparison again, ugh). I feel a lot of decisions were made around the idea of keeping the franchise going for a while, since those 'expanded universe' things the cool kids are talking about are all the rage these days. Standouts - Kate McKinnon is amazing from the very first instant she appears in the film, I love her delivery and quirky energy, that lady's got talent. I'm not a huge fan of Melissa McCarthy's work but she was quite restrained and entertaining in this, as was Leslie Jones - I hadn't expected to like either of them in this film but I loved all four main characters. I feared Kristen Wiig would have been wasted playing a buttoned-down lady of science but she found a way to do subtle comedy at every opportunity. Oh and I almost forgot, the manner in which the heroes dispatch the big-bad at the end has been a spot of some controversy, back to the man-hating thing again I'm afraid. I will say that: a) It was right in front of them - even if the cast had been male, it would have been (tactically speaking) the right spot to go for. b) Women are taught in self-defense classes to go for the man's crotch as it's a good way of disabling a larger, stronger opponent, very relevant in this instance. c) A bad guy getting hit in the groin is funny no matter who's doing it. Overall I enjoyed the film and laughed often (though rarely loudly) and didn't mind this remake at all, even if I think Hollywood should be creating more original products instead of rebooting everything in sight, for I couldn't help but think "this is cute, but I really think I've seen it before' for the most part. But fun was had, hence the 7/10. Your experience may vary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>IMDb Rating Wrong Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again, the IMDb reviewers got it wrong. Is it lol funny? No. Is it engaging, well written, well produced, and yes, true to the original movie? Hell, yes! Finally, Melissa McCarthy shows her genuine warmth and humour, perhaps because she is playing opposite Kristen Wiig who can act like no one is watching. Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon round out the close knit team. Both the paranormal science and ghost busting devices seem quite reasonable and add to the story line. Chris Hemsworth serves as eye candy for the female audience although his ham- fisted awkwardness does nothing but take up time. The publicity surrounding Bill Murray's appearance, one of the original ghostbusters was perhaps more cleverly contrived than meets the eye. I, for one, did not expect to see Sigourney Weaver and was totally clueless to Dan Akyroyd's cameo as the cab driver. The final shot of New York city light up in hearts for the ghostbusters was touching and was followed up by a special gesture for Harold Ramis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a Total Bust</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(RATING: &#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;? out of 5)THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: The spirits are high, even if they fall a bit short in this sporadically funny remake.GRADE: B-SYNOPSIS: More ghosts in the movie machine.JIM'S REVIEW: Rest assure that the misogynistic rantings on social media about the all-female casting of the rebooted Ghostbusters is for naught. While this newly minted version lacks the overall fun and iconic moments of the original (more on that later), the comedians do it justice, even if they become lost amid endless CGI effects by the third act.&#xfffc;The gang is back to fight evil spirits who are suddenly materializing in midtown Manhattan. Only this time they, being the new estrogen-fueled Ghostbusters, take the form of an all-girl hunting party fully armed with proton zappers and funny zingers. The casting of Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, and Leslie Jones, all talented and funny ladies who have incredible comic timing, take a standard been-there-before script and add needed energy and verve to the predictable. &#xfffc;Director Paul Feig never finds the right rhythm as he constantly sacrifices the comedy elements for the state-of-the-arts CGI, which overshadows the hi-jinks. (To be fair, the original film also had that same issue.) The effects are better than average, otherworldly but still ho-hum. The squad battles phantom after phantom...that's the essential plot. One set piece after the next becomes overkill, with little screen time to develop the characters and their relationships. As the film reaches its end, too many ghosts may have lost the war but they have successfully clogged this movie machine.&#xfffc;Of course, the specter of the popular 1984 film haunts this version. It almost intrudes. Feig's walk down memory lane becomes an apt reminder of the superiority of the original. There is an almost desperation to connect both films which upstages this new film adaptation in comparison. While there are pleasant reminders interspersed in this 2016 model, the screenplay never deals much with the personal angle of the group. Most of the original cast members, including Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Sigourney Weaver, and the Stay Puff Marshmallow Man, do make an appearance to earn this film their seal of approval. While the film is heavily endorsed by producers, cast, and crew of the earlier franchise, the numerous product endorsements, including Papa John's Pizza and Sony, are also glaringly front and center.&#xfffc;But the green slime is back in full force, the film's trademark logo and theme song are present, and the quick banter between the quartet exists, even if the sinister Zuul and its demonic body possession is sorely missing...as is that fond memory of Mr. Murray and Ms. Weaver's hilarious sex scene was an iconic moment in cinematic comedy. (However, the mere mention of Zuul in the lengthy end credits may be enough to plant another sequel in the minds of filmmakers and producers, even if this film is a bit of a financial bust with the movie-going audience.)&#xfffc;Still Ghostbusters (2016) more than amuses, thanks to the actors involved. The four leads are fine replacements to the cause, especially Ms. McCarthy and Ms. Jones. Chris Hemsworth adds nice support as the dim-witted boy-toy secretary to our crusaders. But the formulaic screenplay by the director and Katie Dippold just doesn't give this assembled crew a ghost of a chance.&#xfffc;NOTE: Stay for the aforementioned end credits to witness a cut 80's dance sequence with Mr. Hemsworth, who has all the right moves. It owes a tip of the hat to Michael Jackson's Thriller. Too bad the entire sequence wasn't in the actual film, a poor decision by its director, Mr. Feig. At least, some of it has been saved for our viewing pleasure.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty tame - could have used more zaniness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of the 1984 Bill Murray/Dan Akroyd/Harold Ramis GHOSTBUSTER's film. So when they announced that they were making a new one, I was skeptical, but with talents like Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthey and Kate McKinnon in the mix, I was cautiously optimistic.And that optimism was rewarded - for the most part. It is a fun action/comedy with good, watchable performances by the 4 leads, but didn't go far enough to be truly unique. It was funny, not hilarious. Interesting, not quirky. Fast paced, yet safe.As the titular GHOSTBUSTERS of this film, director Paul Feig (Bridesmaids) assembles an all-star quartet: Melissa McCarthy (who dials it down a bit in this film - which is good), Kristen Wiig, who plays it pretty straight (except for a scene in a restaurant where she goes full-on crazy, which is fun). Leslie Jones does what Leslie Jones does - loud and angry (which is a little too "one-note" for my tastes). The standout in this group is Kate McKinnon's Jillian Holtzman. Her character is unique and quirky and my eyes were glued to her whenever she was on the screen. I could have used more of her - and her quirkiness - from others on the screen, especially the supporting characters.The problem with this film is that the supporting characters are all pretty bland. Gone is the Annie Potts, William Atherton's (Walter Peck) and (especially) Rick Moranis' quirkiness of the first film. In their place is pretty generic Neil Casey (as the villain). He just wasn't interesting enough and I think this movie needed him to be more interesting.And, in the end, that's my major issue with this film. It didn't push the envelope enough and, ultimately, except for the 4 leads, no else is interesting enough to watch.There are some fun cameos in this - from pretty much all of the original cast (except Rick Moranis) and the likes of Andy Garcia, Cecily Strong, Steve Higgins show up briefly and were all too tame. I would have liked to have seen them all "go off", but they kept the restraints on (Higgins tried, but it wasn't far enough). And, I guess that's my issue, in the end. This film seemed "safe". McCarthy and Wiig's performances seemed "safe". The cameos were "safe", even Chris Hemsworth's dimwit secretary went only so far, where he needed to push the envelope.So, did I enjoy it? Yes, I did. Is it worth seeing? Sure. But, ultimately, what leaves me dissatisfied is that this is a "good" film, it had the potential to be "very good" (or, maybe "great"), they just didn't trust themselves to go far enough.7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>21 July 2016 Second Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Ghostbusters. Remakes....should they be allowed? In this case I can say it's a definite YES. Melissa McCarthy, who can be a little full on was absolutely perfect for this role. Four women....yes women, come together to form the new Ghostbusting dream team and with their incredibly stupid yet good look receptionist Kevin (Chris Hemsworth no less) they take on the slimy, the scary and the green and set out to save New York and possibly the world from all thinks ghostly. Loosely based on the original film, this one is right up to date and totally works. These four girls work well together and look out for lots of cameos from original cast members. It's a fun film, and I ain't afraid of no ghosts!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Solid, Fun Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't sure what to expect of this movie, as I am of all remakes, but I was pleasantly surprised. The film was well composed, with pithy writing and excellent CGI. It matched the feeling of the earlier films, but with a modern refresh to the humor. It's definitely comparable to the first Ghostbusters, and outshines the second. Overall, the female representation was excellent. To see four badass women in non-sexualized outfits being *people* and having deep dynamics and kicking butt without a romantic subplot or skintight catsuits was a thing of beauty.My husband, son, and daughter were all absolutely enraptured by this film. It was fun. The heroes were vibrant and full of energy and personality. The whole dang movie theater was on its feet at the end, whooping and cheering.This movie felt good. The mad science mayhem felt good. The special effects felt good. And the look on my kid's faces as they watched the heroes win the day felt amazing.There need to be more movies like this. I would watch every last one. Nicely done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good, fun movie if you want to give it a chance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I want to address all of the negative reviews and press this film has received. While it is by no means a masterpiece it definitely does not deserve all of the 1 and 2 ratings it has received. I have seen MANY bad movies over the years and believe me, there is no way this is a 1 or 2. That being said, it does have some problems. I do think that they should have gone with a different title or even a subtitle and there are some flaws such as over reliance on cgi effects and some jokes that fall a little flat. Other than that this movie stands up to the classic two ghostbusters movies just fine. Don't believe the negativity on the internet, give this one a chance!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Notable for the many belly laughs and the important gender flipping narrative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The comedy: There were many, many laugh-out-loud moments in this film. I heard males and females of all ages laughing in the theater. There were also jokes that weren't all that funny, but when it was funny, it was REALLY funny. Definitely a good time. The gender flipping: If you're female, or a male who supports gender progressive movies (like my male date for the film who really enjoyed it, too) this film gets high points for images that we rarely see on film that are inspiring and way more accurate as to how women are in real life than Hollywood would have us believe. Namely, women are 1) funny 2) brave 3) intelligent 4) warriors who are 5) supportive of each other. And all without cleavage, perfect hair or pornographic posing. Oh, and it also sends the message that females are attracted to sexy males. Wow. How revolutionary...women lust, too! Who'd have thunk it?I was sitting next to a young white girl of about 12 who laughed and clapped throughout the film. I asked her about the film after the credits rolled. She was smiling and excited and could not stop talking. Here's what she said:"My new favorite film!" "I didn't want it to end. I kept saying don't end, don't end, don't end!" "I liked the black Ghostbuster--she really stood out and was really funny!" "I have a new crush-- the boy in the film!"So, while this film may be "ruining" some adult men's childhoods...it seems to be poised to be a highlight for the childhoods of the current generation of girls.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Call them again (spoiler alert)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So i was very curious about this one. First of all i'm a huge fan from the originals and when i saw the first trailer i was a little worried but them things where coming together until those really awful commentaries came along.It's the movie that will make your life worth it?! No! It has a great story and Oscar winning performances? No! Of course not! It's just a fun, action and sometimes a little spooky movie.I loved all the cameos from the original cast. It was so "sweet" to see them again entering that world if just for a little. And also Slimmer (i guess) was fun to see again.OK, some jokes were off and could be excluded but the cast do it's best with the material they have and they seem to enjoy it has i did. And Crhis Hemsworth?! What a perfect joke. Instead of having the clichéd big boobs blond girl stupid we have a guy making that role! It was hilarious!I also enjoy the fact that was pretty surprisingly scary. The beginning in the haunted mansion. That basement was damn scary. The action its almost all in the final act which is very awesome e full of CGI. Please see it in 3D| What a ride!!About the cast being all women. I really didn't have a problem with that but it lack some male strong character. Someone more serious.Resuming Ghostbusters it really has good intentions and tries to pay a sweet homage to the original but it lacks more stability and more mature jokes that can be enjoyable to more people so that we can also relate to them and the characters.Love to see a sequel, maybe with another director and making it more reliable.Go and watched just for the fun of coming back again to this "universe" that most of all love so much since the first one</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading all those horrible reviews saying "we're not misogynistic after all, we told you it will suck and it does", I was a bit hesitant to spent 15 euros on a certain (from their perspective) disappointment. But Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy AND Kate McKinnon in one movie? I was willing to take the risk. And honestly, I laughed. Not my a** off, but I laughed. That is the point with comedy, right? And the important thing is that I wasn't bored and was entertained throughout the whole movie. I mean, come on! This movie is not worth a 10 - not by a long shot - but is certainly worth a lot more the 5! Kristen Wiig's character swooning over Chris Hemsworth was kind of silly to say the least and Kate McKinnon's character was a bit cartoonish but still managed to get the most laughs. Some of the lines felt forced and lame, others were brilliant. But, honestly, that is still better than most of the comedies nowadays that can't even deliver a couple of good lines to save their lives. I do feel that the cast had a lot more comedic talent than what the script allowed them to show through. I can see that the problem for most people is the "remake" part. But I loved the original and I loved this one. The only thing they have in common is the premise of New York getting invaded by ghosts and a team named "Ghostbusters" manages to save everyone. That's about it. It did not feel "blasphemous" at all. All in all, this was a good, fun movie, one able to keep you entertained, as long as you keep an open mind and don't compare it constantly with the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the movie was well done and funny! I mean when you have a talented cast such as this one its hard to mess it up. I feel compelled to write a review because i have actually SEEN the movie and yes I loved ghostbusters as a kid( and still do as an adult). It's up there on my fave all time comedies. I thought it was a good stand alone movie and had a lot of nice homages to the original movie. In no way do I feel it lessened the awesomeness of ghostbusters and why should it??? It was pretty nice to watch a movie with some girl power and i still love the original movie as well. Imagine that! It was enjoyable. Not the best movie ever but it does what it sets out to do; be an enjoyable popcorn movie. Although there are a lot of funny lines I feel Chris Hemsworth stands out and is hilarious! I feel it doesn't deserve the low scores and poor reviews it is getting. I say see it for yourself and form your own opinion but I was pleased.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining homage to a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a believer in the saying "don't fix what ain't broke", I was skeptical when I heard they were remaking Ghostbusters. It's a timeless, classic piece of cinema that will continue to be loved for decades more to come. When the news broke of a remake, I was horrified, sure that any reboot would be nothing but insulting to the original.However, I gave into the temptation and before I knew it found myself sitting in the cinema. To my sheer delight, I was blown away by how hilarious and entertaining the movie truly was. The delivery and comedic timing from each of the leading ladies had me laughing out loud throughout the entire film, and each nod to the original gave me the warm fuzzies. Smiling like an idiot throughout the entire film, I fell in love with each of the new characters and found myself once again enthralled and invested in the adventures of the Ghostbusters team. Whilst the original Ghostbusters could never and will never be replaced, the 2016 Ghostbusters is a brilliant rendition of a classic story, featuring some of the most brilliant and talented women currently working in comedy.The film is not perfect, and I still question whether or not Sony should have made a sequel rather than starting from scratch with a complete reboot. But nonetheless, Ghostbusters is a feel-good comedy that kept me entertained throughout and left me giddy with excitement afterwards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I usually don't have as much time to write reviews as the dudes living in their parents basements, but with a film like this I had to make an exception because my god did I love it, like really.Is it the funniest film I've ever seen? Probably not (though it really does have its moments).Is it one of the happiest films I've ever seen? Without a doubt.This film just really, really made me smile. I couldn't stop. It was honestly one of the few films I've ever seen that really truly brought me joy and that I urged people to go see afterwards. I mean there were some really nice throwbacks to the original films (like the scene with Holtzmann licking her guns then going to battle was just perfect) but it was still a great stand alone film. It's part of the reason I really don't get all the angst surrounding this film because the originals are still out there; if you really have such an issue with this reboot and with the idea of 4 really funny people who - spoiler alert - happen to be women being funny, then don't watch it? I mean, yea sure, is it going to get an Oscar? No. Is it going to make people happy, and make people laugh, and give young people a new generation of heroes to look up to? Definitely.They're not shitting all over the original. They're paying a really cool tribute to it and making something new, and cool, and fresh for this generation as well. I mean it's a really cool film about friendship and hunting ghosts. What's not to love about that? Honestly, it's the most fun I've had watching a movie in years.</fullReview>

The best performance was Kate McKinnon who perfectly embodied a kind of punk Egon role and of course Chris Hemsworth who played the vacant beefcake with absolute glee. The whole movie was a fun ride, the 3D was worth the extra cost and you absolutely have to stay through the credits as there are just continuous Easter eggs until the very end of the credit roll.

This movie does a great job in tribute to the original while at the same time standing alone. Nothing will beat the classic, but this is a good start to the reboot of the franchise. It is a little uneven at parts, but it picks up nicely and we are off and running at that point. The special effects are NOT done in a bad way. You can see where they took extra time with the actors and enhancing their images on screen. The only complaint is that the villain does not get enough screen time.

		<shortDescription>Lots of laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For context: I'm a mid-40s male who is still a big fan of the original Ghostbusters, and took the family to see the reboot tonight. In our showing in Seattle there were about 150 people in the audience and roughly 80% of them were laughing loudly multiple times throughout the movie. The remaining 20% were quieter (or maybe hated it), but shrug, can't please everyone. Lots and lots of jokes, most of which worked well enough for full audience laughs. Most of the audience was clapping as the movie ended and credits rolled. I'd say most fans will really enjoy this, and a few will hate it. All four of the primary actors did a solid job. Leslie Jones is both funny and smart. Melissa McCarthy plays both funny and 'straight man' to the others throughout the movie. Kristen Wiig plays funny+uptight well and Kate McKinnon steals just about every scene she's in. Chris Hemsworth is a bonus playing the dimwitted secretary Kevin and while I get the if-the-genders-were-reversed-that-would-be-sexist outcry from some folks his general cluelessness is pretty damned funny.The cameos from the original cast members worked for the most part. There's a too-quick homage to Harold Ramis that made the entire audience gasp and then cheer, and it set the stage for each of the other cast members to eventually make an appearance (minus one, which I won't spoil). Oddly, Bill Murray's felt the most forced and was one of the least funny (short) parts of the movie.The final 20 minutes of the movie did go into special effects overload but its heart was in the right place and it got the story across the finish line.I'm giving it a solid 7 of 10 for laughs, good heart and being true to the spirit of the original. Ignore the haters and the basement-dwellers claiming "only Sony shills are giving it high marks", and go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, I smiled from beginning to end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not generally keen on remakes - it seems a lazy approach to film-making - so at first I wasn't sure about how to approach a reboot of Ivan Reitman's 1984 "Ghostbusters", but the replacement of the four male eponymous roles by four women was inspired and, in spite of some outrageous online trolling, it works wonderfully. The director (Paul Feig) and two of the stars (Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy) of the comedy hit "Bridesmaids" are reunited and gay Kate McKinnon and black Leslie Jones make up the intrepid quartet who battle all sorts of ghouls in downtown New York.The script - by Paul Fieg and Katie Dippold - is sharp. I thought that "Bridesmaids" lacked a feminist punch, but this remake of "Ghostbusters" makes some good gender points, notably by casting beefcake Chris Hemsworth in a role reversal piece of eye- candy for the girls as the receptionist Kevin. I had a smile on my face from beginning to end and by the end I mean all the way through the credits where one more cameo awaits those patient enough to stay watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw the film, didn't expect much, but it was very funny and I really enjoyed it. A new SNL generation was appropriate for the film and you can see their mark. The trailer was bad, I admit, but the overwhelming dislikes on Youtube is a result of a social movement, not really based on merit. I would recommend this to anyone. The film tips its hat to the original film and the original cast. They had some fun with the female cast, but it is simply not 'man- hating.' Its ironic that those are the criticisms being mounted against this film- its just thinly veiled misogyny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this last night with my family and we all really, really enjoyed it - as did the audience we were with. There was laughter and giggles from all over the theater throughout the entire movie and most of the audience sat through the credits to the scene at the end too! And as soon as that had ended both my boys turned to me and said "I hope they make a sequel". And so do I. I've watched the bile spewed on this movie with growing horror for months - the fact that something can be so universally slated before anyone has seen it (and for such ridiculous reasons) just amazes me, and I was so glad that the actual movie was as good as it was. I haven't had such fun at the movies since The Force Awakens. The characters were fresh and engaging (Kate McKinnon's character Jillian Holtzmann was fantastic and a firm favorite with my family), the humor was sharp and in the majority hit the mark and the nice little nods to the earlier movies (cameos, lines etc.) were well played and added a nice nostalgic touch to the proceedings. All I can say is, I really enjoyed it and came out feeling very happy. This morning my sons were talking enthusiastically about it over breakfast and wanting to see it again. We are all big fans of the original, it is one my absolute favorite childhood movies and to be able to experience a similar thrill again with my kids was magic. Ghostbusters 2016 rocks. Enough said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just as great as the original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of the original Ghostbusters movie all my life I went into this movie with high expectations. Within the first 30 minutes I knew that it was going to at meet those. By the hour mark it has surpassed them. The movie was filled with actually great jokes, fantastic chemistry between the girls, and a villain that was actually well fleshed out. There is a sequence near the end that actually made me giddy to watch, and I will definitely go see this movie again. The people bashing this film have NO idea what they are talking about. This movie was everything a Ghostbusters movie should be. Chris Hemsworth especially surprised me by how funny he could be, and the cameos from the original cast were especially awesome to see throughout the whole film. I can't wait to own this when it comes out on DVD! GO SEE THIS MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like being a kid in the cinema all over again. Loved it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing Ghostbusters (1984) for the first time as a wee boy. I wasn't old enough to be allowed to go to the cinema but as soon as I could rent it on VHS, I did. By the time Ghostbusters 2 (1989) came around, I was straight there to see it on the big screen. They were ridiculous fun and I've been a fan ever since.When I first saw the trailer for Ghostbusters (2016), I admit that I wasn't impressed. It just didn't land what it needed to for me but then I find that with many trailers from the studios nowadays (Batman v Superman immediately springs to mind here) and I was concerned that this was going to be another Charlie and the Chocolate Factory - a decent cast and a bunch of money thrown at a reboot/remake that should never have been green-lit.Then the critics reviews started to come in and the opinions of friends I trust on this stuff started to come in and I decided to give it a chance. I'm REALLY glad I did.I think it's really good. It strikes the right balance of slapstick comedy and clever dialogue. It makes some great nods to the original cast and movies. It feels familiar and faithful without being derivative and stale. Yes it could have done some things better (Leslie Jones is under utilised and some of the interactions seem a bit awkward at times) but overall the cast and crew have put together a Ghostbusters film that appealed both to the adult and the child in me.Head immediately to your nearest showing and see this. It's well worth your admission money. As an added bonus you'll even be able to afford to buy snacks at the cinema with all the money you'll save on drinks because the tears of self-proclaimed "fans" (many of whom have not even seen this film according to some of the reviews left on here) are on tap for free.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Go Have Some Fun: Your Questions Answered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a delight. Is it an instant classic? Will it still hold up in 30 years? Does it have the same kind of timeless comedy as the originals? Who cares. For right here, right now, the year 2016, it's a delight - and completely undeserving of the onslaught of bad reviews its getting online. The style is a little wacky, a little Parks &amp; Rec, and it plays to some low-hanging feminism, but what comes together is a hell of a lot of fun. Plus, ghosts make a fantastic metaphor for women's issues (because no one believes in them). To answer some questions you may have before seeing this film: 1. Does the film hate men? Answer: No. This movie is mean to entitled terrorists and lying politicians, and that's about it. It's incredibly kind to Chis Hemsworth's character who is probably the most un-hateable man ever portrayed on screen. 2. Am I going feel attacked by this film? Answer: Maybe if you identified with the villain too much. In which case, you're probably feeling the same way I did when I identified with Voldemort. I get it, it's rough. Take a vacation and do some soul searching bro, you'll be fine. 3. How's the film do on diversity? Answer: Not great - it's the movie's weakest point. I'm really hoping Leslie Jones's character gets some more screen time in the next (because I'm sure there will be another) movie. I'd love to see the story focus more on her, but for what it was, her character is an integral part of the team, and it seems like Leslie had a lot of fun playing her. 4. Are there lesbians? Answer: There better be. I mean, I certainly think so, but I'd like to see them scream it from the rooftops next time. 5. Will Kate McKinnon turn me gay? Answer: If you're asking this, you're probably already there, but yes, she'll make it worse. Don't worry about compromising your bisexuality, though: Chris Hemsworth is right there to even it out. 6. Does Chris Hemsworth appear without a shirt? Answer: Yes, but that's not even the best part. 7. Isn't that proof that they're objectifying men in this film? Answer: Well, actually, they're making a statement about privilege, as well as building on tropes established by the objectification of women in film, so it makes for a well-developed critique of masculinity and gender roles, as well as sexism on a more meta level. Maybe you just don't get the joke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Captivating Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i saw that this was ghostbusters i thought of a cheesy remake of the original story line, which, to be honest, is dreadful.However this film is the exact opposite as it gives us a modern and contemporary story line with plenty of humour injected into it. I particularly loved the use of the assistant which really added to the charm of the film. The film only hinted to the outdated originals through the music, car and outfits and still managed to come across as an entirely new and fresh concept. I think it is very creative as they switched the male and female characters of the original and in my opinion made them even more badass! Overall i highly recommend it, especially in cinema or surround sound as it can really make you jump!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Favorite movie of the summer!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate to admit it, but I didn't actually want to go see this movie. "A" because the original Ghostbusters is a classic in my family, but I never really cared for it or found it funny, and "B" because I don't think Kristen Wiig is particularly funny either. I'm glad my sister talked me into it though because this might be favorite movie of the summer! It's absolutely hysterical and Chris Hemsworth is a total babe in glasses. The four main characters were all love-able, and each had their own distinct personality. The plot was intelligent and able to stand apart from the original two, even though being a remake there were a lot of similarities. I also thought that the throwbacks to the originals were creative and well-placed throughout the movie. I would recommend this movie to everyone, whether they've seen the original or not, or they're like me and think the original is stupid. This movie is hilarious and I can't wait to go see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed the heck out of the new "Ghostbusters." I love the concept and the fidelity to the original "Ghostbusters," not to mention the cameo appearances by some of the original cast, including a great turn by my favorite actor ... er, Bill Murray. Nice bits by Dan Aykroyd and Signorney Weaver and Ernie Hudson, too.Kate McKinnon steals the show, though. A totally weird and wonderful performance. Melissa McCarthy looks, and acts, just like she did in "Gilmore Girls." Chris Hemsworth as the beefcake receptionist is perfect. I'm still laughing about his eyeglass bits.We saw the 3D version, which I recommend not so much for the special ghost effects but for the Manhattan scenes.</fullReview>

Each of the four ladies are written well, and Holtzman easily steals the show with each scene she's in. It's good fun and the humor was on point. The plot structure, at its bones, is like the original movie, but Erin, Abbey, Holtzman, and Patty all make it an entertaining new experience. And it has cameos from the original actors! Look, it's not trying to replace the original movie. It's its own experience. You can have both. I like the original. I really liked this one, too. If you're looking for a fun film, definitely go see this. I'll being seeing this again.Remember to stay until the end of the credits!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Entertaining!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT: may contain information that may shed light on certain elements of the story. This was done unintentionally and I tried to be very vague. But I apologized if it gives anything away. Please do not read further if you have not seen this film yet.I like most was not pleased a classic from my childhood was being re imagined. As Hollywood in my opinion has failed drastically in the last decade with this re imagining of many films from the same time period. Red Dawn (awful which Chris Hemsworth was in as well), Poltergeist are examples that jump to mind. Heck they are remaking, Flatliners and The Lost Boys supposedly.(awful is too good a word). There are more I sure I am forgetting. But you get my point hopefully.The originals were classics that in my opinion still hold up to this day and do not need to be remade as they were relevant in there era and just do not work necessarily outside it. Not all remakes have been bad. For example, The Mummy and The Mummy Returns, The Fly. They were remakes of the originals.I did find some jokes that fell flat but I found some in the original as well. However, many jokes did make me laugh so not all the jokes fell flat. Film is art and is meant to be interpreted and not everyone is going to get every joke. I saw similarities to the plot points from the original but the film had its own story to tell. It just used the beats that every screenplay uses. It was not just rehashing the story. However, the plot points thing you'll find that in many films. It like screen writing one oh one.The visuals were simply superb. And the actor for Silicon Valley was the right casting choice and I really enjoyed the opening sequence he was in. It brought me back to the kid I was when I watched the original. I also liked how characters were introduced. The interactions felt to me legit and believable.I thought the ladies did very well in their roles. I found Leslie Jones delightful. I think she broke the stereotype and evolved. Which every character needs to do for a story to work. I think all the ladies played off each other well. Andy Garcia's scenes could have been better. Feel like he phoned this one in. Chris Hemsworth, let it all hang out and it worked for me. He really owned the character and I found that made him identifiable. You see what I mean when you sit down and watch.The cameos were amusing, as well as, the various Easter eggs throughout. Keep your eyes open people. Stay all the way through the credits. IMAX 3-D is the only way to go. This is a must for this type of visual film.As it is starting to do well financially I like to see the sequel setup take fruition. I think they learn from any mistakes the made and the sequel will be that much better for it.I would suggest everyone give it a chance. I was certainly entertained. I tried to be vague in my opinion and not give anything away. I saw it this afternoon and liked what I saw.- David How 7/17/2016</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was everything I hoped for for the new Ghostbusters movie. The homages and nods to the original are clever and well done without being stupid or obvious. Hoping it busts out and gets a sequel. Every single member of the cast was perfect and the chemistry among the core team was a delight to watch. Very impressed by Paul Feig and his team for creating a perfect summer blockbuster film. Funny without being convoluted and managed to ride that difficult line of "feeling" like the throwback without being the throwback. I'm really excited to see what they do next and hope we can keep making movies like this one. Thoroughly enjoyable, kid friendly (important) and incredibly positive. &lt;3</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Reboot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not sure why all the haters are out and I was expecting to be disappointed, but me and my family found this to be a pretty excellent reboot. I loved the originals and found this to be done in the same spirit, not surprising given that Ackroyd was a producer and there were cameos by all the originals (if you include a statue of Ramis) except for Rick Moranis and Annie Potts. And for those people criticizing it as racist or man-hating, it's a comedy...all the characters are exaggerations including Wiig as a stereotypical middle-class, and therefore somewhat clueless and stuck up at the beginning, white academic. And despite any superficialities, all four women end up displaying bravery and loyalty to each other, so get a freakin' life. In summary, Ghostbusters is a fun movie that honors the original while providing a fresh story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers ahead:I liked Ghostbusters a lot. There's an infectious silliness that is definitely of a different tone from the snarkiness filling in the lines of an action horror movie played straight of the first two films, Hemsworth even riffed on a classic Buster Keaton gag. As everyone else says, Kate McKinnon is hilarious in her gutsy and defiant nuttiness. Hers is a character that doesn't care what anyone thinks, yet is passionate about her work.A major difference between this one and the original is that the Ghostbusters have their name thrust upon them. They're not a commercial enterprise that flaunts EPA regulations as in the original, rather an independent team that skews closer to actual scientific methodology (within the rules of this world everything makes much more logical sense than even Ray's explanations in the previous films). When they stumble upon their terrifying discoveries, they're quickly contacted by the Department of Homeland Security and forced to conduct their activities covertly, at least officially. While the government condemns them publicly, they thank them privately. It's a more nuanced premise than the EPA being relentlessly reckless and for City Hall to be relentlessly cynical.The villain is played by Neil Casey, formerly a similarly creepy character Kent Woolworth in Feig's previous sci-fi comedy venture "Other Space." SPOILERS for Other Space: But where Woolworth was part of the most endearing couple on that show, here Rowan is a sociopath bent on reforming the world in his twisted image of a utopia. Where previous Ghostbusters films would use ancient gods and dictators as villains, this film uses a seemingly ordinary guy, but with similar pretensions.While I loved the movie, a couple of things slightly bothered me:But when the HQ is above a Chinese restaurant, it would have been nice to see one Chinese person. As is, Karan Soni is the only person from the restaurant, and like Leslie Jones, the two major POC from the film kind of get piled on more than others.Also, if Leslie Jones was supposed to be the historian, I figured she'd be a bit more the Ray type, being well-versed in Tobin's Spirit Guide or something. Maybe instead of the MTA, she should have been the tour guide from the beginning. The closing credits have her ask who Zuul is, but I feel like she should be the expert on that. Or she should at least be the person the others ask about it.But overall, I'm excited to see if they make more of these movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bustin' Makes Me Feel Good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite all the negativity that trolls from all over will try to spew to overshadow this movie, this movie is actually pretty darn good! I wouldn't say that it is better than the original, but I can definitely tell you that it is way better than Ghostbusters 2. And that's a pretty big hoop to jump through in my opinion. Let's talk about the cast and the chemistry between them. They are all fantastic and very funny, and you can tell that they were all just having the best time on set. Not only that but there are several unique qualities about each of them that really make them stand out. Erin is the very analytical calculating one, but also incredibly awkward (especially when she is around Kevin). Abby is kind of a cross between Venkman and Ray. She's cocky but also brilliant with a giddy fascination over the paranormal, just like Ray. Holtzman is... Well I would say she's the Egon of the group but she's very unlike Egon in many ways. She was hands-down my absolute favorite. She's got way more of a gutsy attitude and you should see the things that she invents for the group. That's another thing that I loved about this film, the gadgets. As a Ghostbusters fan I have been craving to see more gadgets and weapons for the Ghostbusters to carry, and this film gave me exactly that: more cool weapons to use on the dead. Getting back to the characters, Patty was definitely one of my favorites for one particular reason. She's obviously supposed to be the Winston of the group, but Winston never contributed to the group the way Patty does. Not only does she provide the car, but she also provides a lot of intricate history about New York. She's a massive history buff, and her knowledge proves to be pretty useful and informative. This is what I ultimately loved about this film, it tries new things. Sure there are a lot of homages to the original and a LOT of cameos, but besides that and being called Ghostbusters it doesn't try too hard to essentially copy the original. The story is very similar in many ways, but you could argue that all Ghostbusters films (and even the video game) follow the same sort of formula. Plus this is the first of what will become an entirely rebooted Ghostbusters franchise, which I am very excited to see. So hopefully they will not do like they did in Ghostbusters 2 and use basically the exact same formula for the plot. Hopefully they will shake it up a bit, but I'm pretty optimistic. As for this film it is very fun and very funny. I had a great time seeing it and hopefully you will too! Don't listen to the haters!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what's wrong with those people who gave a bad score to Ghostbusters. This is a very fun movie and totally worth the money and time to see it. In fact, when I saw the IMDb score on Friday, that was intimidating. Some haters just gave the lowest score for whatever reasons. Many of them I bet they did not even go to see the movie! Yesterday, I read a very positive comment and it mentioned on a famous website some people were irritated by Ghostbusters and call others to bully the movie. Unfortunately, it worked and reflected the very low score on IMDb. That was why I missed this movie until today I decided to find out on my own rather than the comments on the internet. And it turned out a very nice movie. Thanks to more and more people actually went to see this movie and gave positive feedback, and that is why Ghostbusters' IMDb score is slowly but steadily rising now(from 3.6 to 4.8 now). All I can give is that Ghostbusters is tons of fun. The story might be a bit flat but it surely is hilarious. Don't let haters influence your judgment. Go to see this movie and you will enjoy it:)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now that I have finally SEEN the movie (unlike most of you wanna be critics) ... it is very good and it is funnier than the original. The original has a more serious approach with comedy sprinkled in, this one is a comedy with serious parts sprinkled in. It was great to see SPOILER ALERT cameos by most of the original casts. RIP 'Egon'. And respect to Rick Moranis which lost his passion to act after losing his wife. Everything you loved about the original, is LITERALLY somewhere in this movie. Make sure you stay through some of the credits. Another cameo, some hilarious dancing, great music. I know it will probably never get a sequel because of the unnecessary hate for it, but I would sure like to see one. I thought each character played their parts very well. My only negatives would be that the 3D was not really worth it except for the ghost vomiting near the beginning. And MORE SLIMER !!</fullReview>

If this was my first time seeing a Ghostbusters film my score would probably be higher but any reboot is simply not going to have the awe-effect and magic of being the first. That being said my enjoyment level was on par with the original Ghostbusters and it was far better than Ghosbusters II.I hope they continue the franchise and we see more sci-fi comedy films as that would be a refreshing break from the over-saturated comic book market. Ghostbusters was a refreshing change of pace and it's the only film I've seen in so long I can't remember where I laughed out-loud, jumped a couple times, and enjoyed big-budget special effects. Lots of great cameos and great summer fun.Better to see in the theaters as the comedy will still be fun at home but the effects simply won't translate. And it's in Real 3D, so, worth it to see in 3D on a big screen. I would have seen it at the Arclight but every good screen in town was sold out, and so even on a smaller 3D screen I still managed to have a good time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Safety lights are for dudes." - Dr. Jillian Holtzman This is my new favorite movie of all time. IMHO, this is a movie that EVERY woman should go see in the theater. Multiple times. Just to let Hollywood know that THIS is the portrayal of women that we want! It's hilarious, but never once makes a PMS joke or does anything that disparages women. They make gentle fun of themselves, at times, but there's no "punching down" in this movie. No cattiness or mean- spiritedness. There's plenty of eye candy, no matter your preference (Chris Hemsworth and Kate McKinnon are both adorable), but not a single romantic subplot to be seen. In fact, we're not even sure about the sexuality of most of the characters, whether they're gay / straight / bi / other, because it (gasp!) DOESN'T MATTER to the plot. (A refreshing change from the creepy stalker vibe of the original movie.) Yes, ladies, Hollywood actually made a movie that doesn't assume we're all trying to catch a man, doesn't assume that we're miserable if we're single, doesn't require smart women to also be sexy and fashionable in order to be taken seriously, and DOES assume that women are just as capable at doing any job as any man. All the heroes were funny women OVER AGE 30 (gasp!), where the emphasis is on their talents and not sexualizing their bodies. Depicts four extremely intelligent, well-educated and well-read women who successfully go into business for themselves after being dismissed by the male hierarchy. No one was "in charge" or "the hero" or "the lead." They all worked together as a team, each smoothly saving the others' lives multiple times. ALL of them were kickass heroes together, and none of them were competitive or tore each other down. Even though two of them were women of size, there was not a single mention of this, and not a single fat joke. All four women were portrayed as brave, strong, and competent in their fight scenes, regardless of body type. (I'm already planning how I'm going to build proton packs for my little niece and nephew. What smart, brave, kickass role models for them!) Humor for all tastes, everything from fart jokes to slapstick to intellectual puns. Oh, and watch for all the fun shout-outs and references, both obvious and subtle, to the original movie and to classic horror films. And stay to the very end of the credits, or you'll miss something cool.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This female-centric version of Ghostbusters is a mostly entertaining reboot of the original version from 32 years ago</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading positive reviews from many critics and knowing of the negative comments from fans of the original 1984 version based on their viewing of the trailer for this current one, I decided to find out for myself with my movie theatre-working friend who said he enjoyed it when seeing it at an employee screening beforehand. Verdict: I actually liked this female-centric version of the now-classic that originally starred Bill Murray and was written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, both of whom were the co-stars of that one. This version stars Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig and both have some funny lines with nice support from Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones. Oh, and the cameos of the various stars from that original were pretty amusing to see including the bust of one who passed away a few years ago. To tell the truth, it's been about 30 years since I last watched the original version and I don't know if this version would become a classic like that one. Still, this version of Ghostbusters is worth seeing whether you liked that other one or are just watching this particular version as the first time for any of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to go see this movie because of all the anger on the internet- Words which I can't use because of the IMDb "prohibited words" filter.I wasn't expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised! The cast is hilarious, the references to the original (duh) are spot-on, and overall it's quite funny.I give it 10/10 because, while I'd normally give it an 8/10, the other reviews on this are...clearly...weighted by people who haven't gone to see it. By people whose clear purpose I can't describe, because of the IMDb filter.People who hate an all-female cast, but who say it isn't about their gender. They're just not funny, am I right guys? Yeah.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun Summer Movie Worthy of the Franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amazing movie, absolutely hilarious, I was crying by the end of it. Plot wise, I found it much more interesting than the old one. The characters were amazing and the villain an interesting take in the world of cut-and- paste villains. Jillian Holtzmann was amazing, stealing the show with everything she did. Erin, Patty, Abby, and Kevin were all hilarious and all the characters were given area to grow. The pacing was slightly off, though that was due to the original cut being 4 hours, many crucial scenes for pacing were cut because of the time limit. Thats the only real concern I have for the movie except for one scene of cgi, though the cgi throughout was very good. The cameos and nods to the original were fun and thought out, with Annie Potts being my favourite. Pay no attention to the hate its getting. Yes, it has some problems, but this is still a fun movie for the summer worthy of the franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great re-imagining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie this evening and laughed throughout all of it. The movie was solid, characters very likable and the story line was great. I also really liked all of the cameos dotted around too. I don't want to spoil anything but this movie did a really great job of making it feel a lot like the original movie in the 80s. I'm really glad it is in New York still -the pure scale of New York is breathtaking. There were lots of nods to the original movies and lots of gags-even the original soundtrack. i really liked the dynamics of the new team, they felt a lot like the original cast and it had a lot of the original excitement too whilst being all new at the same time. I would definitely say to try not to listen to anyone who hates this film (and haven't seen it). Go and see the movie and make up your own mind. You will be pleasantly surprised. I came out of this movie smiling a lot and hoping for a sequel. All in all I really enjoyed this movie-it was really great-hope they make a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and Witty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a 4.1 rating at the time of the showing, I went expecting the absolute worst. Instead I laughed my ass off. It was so funny and witty. Perhaps because I accepted it for what it is. A totally implausible situation and movie- meant to be funny. I really liked one comment about how in academia one needs to kiss ass till you get tenure- perhaps because I myself am a female professor on that track. Regardless, if you actually catch the under breath comments, which there are many (and what makes the lines witty), you will find it really funny. Totally not a 4.1. I gave it a 10 because it is not meant to be an academy award winning movie, it is meant to be relatively mindless (not referring to stupid but referring to not cerebral), creative, silly, fun humor to enjoy, which is exactly what it was.</fullReview>

The cast was talented, the jokes were hilarious and the movie was definitely in the spirit of the original but updated and modern. It had nods, cameos and parallels which were awesome for fans of the original but it wasn't all inside jokes new viewers wouldn't get.The CGI was a little over the top, but Kate McKinnon was a rock star. Melissa McCarthy's ability to act with her entire body never ceases to amaze me. My roommate and I laughed ourselves to tears and we left the theater in the best mood after a really bad week.

There are fun nods to the original, cameos that will make you giggle with delight, and even Ozzy makes an appearance. Looking forward to seeing kids dressed up as ghosts and ghost busters this Halloween, so cool a new film is made for the next generation. Brings back great memories for me and will create some fun new ones for the kiddies! All the bad reviews I've seen seem to be from folks who want to take this movie seriously.

I had fun watching it, I didn't think it was 'a sexist man-hating mess that only appeals to radical feminists'. Let me guess, you're also the same kind of person as the ones that are harassing the actresses on twitter right??Like any movie there were jokes that I found funny and ones that just flopped, but I didn't go in there expecting to laugh at every joke. But I still had a fun time seeing it, because A) I didn't go into the theater expecting a movie on the same level of terrible as the Last Airbender live action movie. B) I wasn't being a pissy baby about how 'wahh wahh they made all the ghostbusters ladies wahh wahh feminist garbage'The movie wasn't amazing, of course. I liked the actresses and their performances but the movie's script obviously wasn't perfect and there were quite a few things that had me thinking 'deus ex machina'. The CG was a bit over the top at times, I do wish they would have followed in the footsteps of the old Ghostbusters in using some more practical affects. They didn't really attempt much new things, besides the obvious casting differences, which is a bit disappointing but not overall unexpected. I haven't known any movie remake to try anything that hasn't already succeeded, so I can still commend this movie for doing something different with the cast at least.</fullReview>

I haven't seen the old ones because, well I'm 18 and never watched them as a kid, so when trying to watch the first one last year I gave up after half of the movie because it wasn't funny. This one however- the characters were weird and lovable, there were characters you didn't like, the soundtrack was fantastic, and let's be honest, Holtzmann was just wonderful. Sure, the cgi wasn't what you expect from a 2016 movie, but it's also Ghostbusters. It's kind of part of the charm, isn't it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw this today, wasn't hopeful due to the dreadful trailer. But it really wasn't that bad. Yes it's cheesy in parts, it didn't really flow well and some of the story line seemed tacked on. But it wasn't that painful to watch. If you want some lighthearted fun that has a few funny moments and some genuine scares... then this movies works. If you want it to be like the original (who didn't), than you will be disappointed. I'm not sure why it got so much attention, maybe messing with a childhood love, or that immensely terrible trailer did it.

The trailer was terrible and doesn't work, maybe because some of the funniest moments are clearly improvised. But I thought I should at least see the movie before judging (unlike many "reviewers" on here). I was sooooo pleasantly surprised!!! This movie is FUN and laugh out loud funny, my main criticism is it tried too hard to service fans of the older movie, but really it's full of quotable lines and improv. It will undoubtedly become a classic and is the first movie this year I want to go see again!!! I would consider this as good but quite different from the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly refreshing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the original Ghostbusters, so I entered the cinema half expecting a mediocre movie (at best). But, although the new Ghostbusters was far from perfect, I was pleasantly surprised. Not only is this new take on the sci-fi classic refreshing (mainly thanks to the four leading actresses, which do a pretty good job), but the 3D is great. Many of the ghosts and special effects surpass the letterbox bars and make for a very impressive ghost-hunting experience.The definite highlight of the film is, in my opinion, Kate McKinnon, whose character (Holtz) embodies the perfect combination of wit, slapstick humor, bad-ass moves and irreverence to make her instantly likable. This, however, does not overshadow the performance of Melissa McCarthy,Kristen Wiig and Leslie Jones, who are decidedly funny, each in their own style. I thought Chris Hemsworth's participation quite overdone, though. In his role as the dumb sexy secretary, he's portrayed exactly in the demeaning light historically assigned to women in the media. This was rather disappointing: the movie being starred by four women, I expected it to do away with this sort of stereotypes and not merely to reverse them. That's just me, anyway.Although it's a humorous movie, I have to admit I found some of its jokes rather exaggerated (as if the cast were trying too hard), but this happens in very specific scenes and in no way ruins the movie as a whole. So, all in all and despite its many flaws, it is a very entertaining film, action packed (especially at the end) and full of celebrity cameos.I simply don't get all the hate around it.There's a scene after credits, so you'll definitely want to stick around until the very end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie. I thought it was funny, I liked the characters, I thought it was a great homage to the original. This is a movie that, through satire, calls out some of the sexism that is common in movies. I read one of the negative reviews and it totally missed the mark, I think because the reviewer apparently does not recognize satire. There is an amazingly beautiful, incredibly stupid and useless male in the film. That character and the way the main characters interact with him is some pretty biting satire. It is a role reversal of SO MANY female employee/male boss portrayals made just enough over the top in comparison to many mainstream Hollywood films to show it is satire. But, the main thing is that I was having a seriously crappy day on top of two dreadful weeks and this movie gave me two hours of laughter where I could forget all of the stress and enjoy myself. I really liked it.</fullReview>

Yes, this movie is very sexist but I couldn't care less (I am a man). The characters are all stereotypes but I've seen worse.

Also, I appreciated the gender role switches, which shed light on a long history of stereotyped female/male roles. I also liked that there were no lame love stories that detract from the plot. I thought the first ghostbusters movies were a little stilted in that department. I thought the cameos of the original cast were well timed and thoughtful. The music was very fun. There were some random dancing scenes, which were a little bizarre. Overall, I would definitely like to watch the movie again! Great addition to my traditional Halloween film selections.</fullReview>

No. But if you want to have a fun time at the theatre with some friends, you will definitely enjoy the show. Despite all of the hate this movie is getting, it was nice to sit in the theatre and really enjoy the fun trip back to the 80s memory lane. Don't come in expecting Bridesmaids level hilarity. It has the same spirit of the first movie, where the jokes hit most of the time but aren't the driving force of the movie. It's not the best movie of the summer, but it doesn't deserve the amount of hate it's getting. I laughed out loud many times. The performance are great (specifically Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon).

		<fullReview>This movie was very funny, the actresses were all great in their own ways, and the characters were smart. It's great seeing female characters being smart and funny for themselves. The male receptionist is hilarious and, i'm assuming, supposed to be an ironic gender-swap of a classic female idiot receptionist character. The character is a joke which must have flown past the heads of the people who think he made the movie a "man-hating mess". The hate and low rating that this movie got was obviously from people who dislike the gender-swap and/or the reboot, and I understand that that can be frustrating when you lived through and loved the original, but it does not deserve a 1/10. A 1/10 is a movie consisting of literally watching paint dry, not this awesome movie with great special effects, actresses, and characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is good, don't listen to the trolls!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ghostbusters review: a strong 8 out of 10. Here's why: The plot is original and it in no way makes an attempt to recreate the originals in any way. That said, they attempted (and succeeded) in paying respect to the originals, including using the original theme more than the cover by Fall Out Boy (wise move). Also, every living main cast member (aside from Rick Moranis) made cameos in this movie, and a bust of Harold Ramis can be seen early on in the movie. Could it have been funnier? Sure, in quite a few places. But, overall, if this movie tanks it's not because it's a bad movie, but because of people listening to Internet trolls who say this is a bad movie without seeing it themselves. Which brings me to my next point: unless I've completely missed out on the whole "seeing movies before they've released" memo, most of these bad reviews for this movie were written prior to the release. I get that a lot of people are allowed to see some movies before they're released, but you can't tell me that all of these negative reviews are based simply on some of these people being trolls for the sake of being trolls. This is NOT a bad movie, and is NOT insulting to the originals. I love the originals, but let's not forget how ludicrous the plot for GB:2 was, or forget we're talking about a movie where people trap ghosts for a living. It's meant to be silly, good fun. See the movie, or don't; but don't write negative reviews just because you saw the trailer and thought this was going to suck. The trailer, uncharacteristically, doesn't give away any plot points or show the best moments from this movie. In short, take the advice of Wil Wheaton and "don't be a d**k". If you enjoyed the originals, you will enjoy this movie, plain and simple. Plus, I think it speaks volumes that every main cast member makes an appearance. I get that they are actors who get paid to do this work, but not every "remake/reboot" has been able to get the original cast members back (Dukes of Hazzard movie anyone?). I think this says a lot about their endorsement. Lastly, stay through the credits for a set up for the sequel, which is well deserved in my opinion.</fullReview>

Having a non-sexualized, all female group with a diverse bunch of personalities, strengths and weaknesses, and a story that's doesn't rely on romance (the most important relationship being the friendship between the girls) was truly a breath of fresh air. Chris Hemsworth's twist on the 'token dumb blonde female secretary' trope was hilarious and i loved every second he was on screen. I only wish that there were more movies like this when i was younger, seeing girls who were weird and were totally OK with being weird would have certainly helped with some self-acceptance issues i know i (as well as many other girls) had. Also, the fact that, despite not being a genius like the rest of the group, patty was extremely knowledgeable about the city and all of its hotspots was awesome! and you have to admit, fighting off a ghost-possessed friend with one arm while trying to prevent your other friend from falling to their death (or at least some serious damage) with the other is pretty badass.</fullReview>

People acting like they are so upset about a reboot when so many other films over the past 20 years have been reboots makes no sense. Leslie, Kristen, Melissa, and Kate were a great ensemble. They were funny and kicked butt at the same. It is a shame that so many people will write off this film and not actually go see it. I encourage everyone to go see for themselves.

		<fullReview>Yes, OK, there was always going to be some trepidation regarding a remake of the beloved 1984 comedy/horror classic, Ghostbusters, i was quite worried about it myself, but the backlash against this film and in particular, its female leads has been astonishing and a lot of the time, downright disgraceful. I absolutely adore the classic original and its 1989 sequel, but i decided to go to see this new version on opening night with an open mind and boy was i rewarded :) Ghostbusters 2016 is the first film in quite some time to make me leave a movie theater with such a big, beaming smile. It was sweet, charming, funny (yes it was!) and Melissa MaCarthy, Leslie Jones, Kristen Wiig and in particular, Kate McKinnon brought such fun and warmth to their individual characters. A lot of people have criticized the CGI but i thought the majority of the ghosts looked fairly impressive. My only gripe is that Bill Murray's cameo was a huge letdown, how could he go from being the best thing about the original to the worst thing about the remake!? He wasn't funny, just dull. Oh well... Also, i could have done without see that dribbling idiot, Ozzy Osbourne...Its not as good as the original of course, very few comedies are, but it is a very well-made, feel good Summer movie that has proved a hell of a lot of people wrong, even though you all seem to be having a hard time admitting it.

		<fullReview>I saw this movie with my husband and 26 year old son. We saw it after it had been out a few weeks. There were people in every row, different ages, too. Everyone stayed until the end, and there was a lot of laughing. Although we had seen all previous Ghostbusters movies, you didn't have to to enjoy it. We cracked up regularly, and thoroughly enjoyed the references to the previous movies. The men in my family were not offended by the presence of new, and female, actors in previously male roles, or a male receptionist. Did it deserve a 10? Maybe not, but it sure didn't deserve all those ones, and a lot of those I do not believe ever saw the movie. It was a very enjoyable way to spend evening, and my men gave it a 9.5 to a 10 because they laughed so much, and loved the choice of actors for the characters. My son mentioned he had friends who saw the movie and absolutely loved it. The ones who talked it diwn never saw it, and were very negative about messing with past success. The people who are ao reverent about Bill M's irreverence are missing the point! By the way, we stayed all through the credits to the little foreshadowing and flashback prequel at the end. Would love to see another. These women rock, and I think they would only be better in the next. Loved all the cameos, but give Annie Potts a bigger spot next time, her characters still make me smile!</fullReview>

The innuendos that he and Aykroyd were "forced" to appear here are plain silly. I bet they got good money for it. And I like this one too, and see it as a homage to the first one. Not a timeless masterpiece, maybe, but quite good, warmhearted and really funny. Why the persistent comparison? Why the hate?What seems to be happening here with the vile reviews is the usual stuff: Men (i.e. overgrown boys) feeling threatened by women - especially funny women. In the theater where I watched the movie yesterday people were laughing a lot, and heartily. So did I. Maybe the Swedish sense of humor works in strange ways? Maybe we have fewer misogynists compared to, for instance, the USA? Or maybe we just don't find female comedians the most despicable thing on Earth. Horrifying, isn't it?But beware, you whose childhoods were "ruined": Some of these days in the future people will laugh their pants off at your absolutely ridiculous reactions to this movie and your obsessive efforts to sink it. I'm giving it a 10 because of the wonderful comedians. Female or not, being funny is the hardest acting job, and they do it so well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ghostbusters has to have been one of the funniest movies I have seen this year. It is the perfect mix of innovation and nostalgia. The look and feel payed much homage to the original while remaining fresh. Nevertheless it's not perfect, but it does have this great momentum and a lighthearted feel to it. Although there are some issues with tokenisation, this film gets so much more right. I get so much joy from the jabs at the original sexism (aimed at women) of the first film. It's great to see the typical roles in sexism being reversed and how men are reacting. It's an added bonus hearing all these neck beards complain about their childhoods being ruined.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely worth the watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have the (probably rare) viewpoint of someone who has never seen the original(s) but honestly despite this, I'm not sure what some people are talking about. I absolutely adored this movie! The comedy was on point, the four leading ladies absolutely compelling and hilarious. Major props to Kate McKinnon in her portrayal of Jillian Holtzmann who was a standout character for me. I saw this movie twice and both times the cinema was full of laughter. Melissa McCarthy is always a hit and miss actress for me but boy was this a 'hit' movie for her. Not sure what the fuss is about regarding 'man-hating' because neither my boyfriend or I got any vibes of the sort from the movie. Regardless, it was a great movie that didn't rely too heavily on nostalgia and managed to stand on its own two feet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful, One of the Best Movies of the Summer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason I didn't vote 10/10 is because there's always room for improvement! However, this movie was so wonderful. I've watched the originals before but I never became a super fan like those who seem to be complaining about this one. The cast is great, the jokes are funny, the plot is wonderful and interesting. Many are complaining about the way the receptionists is portrayed but there isn't a problem at all. Most of the complains are from men who hate the "Dumb Blond" trope when its pointed at them, but when it's a woman it just happens to be okay. But Kevin as a character was okay as comedic relief. The CGI was a little cartoony, but honestly, that to me was just a nod to the originals. Patty honestly was so relatable and funny. Holtz was wonderful and had such great facial expressions. An the relationship between Abby and Erin was so good and pure, I loved how all the Ghostbusters and Kevin worked well together.I've seen a lot of the new movies that came out this summer, and this one is honestly one of the greatest. I recommend everyone to see this movie, especially those who keep giving this movie such a bad score without even seeing it first. If you see a score here that is 3/10 stars and below its from people who have not seen this movie. Honestly, there is no reason for this film to be rated so low.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lighten up people! I'm writing this review just to counter all the 1 star votes. It wasn't as good as the original but it was still a good popcorn flick. They aren't trying to win academy awards for goodness sakes. This movie was exactly what a summer movie should be. It was light, funny, and short enough. It didn't take itself too serious. The actors, IMO, did a very good job as well. They gave our entire audience quite a few chuckles. Enjoyed the cameos as well.The only knock I can come up with is the horrible new Ghostbusters song. Sometimes they should just leave well enough alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Summer movie fun revisited</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was hoping not to see a remake, and the movie had a fresh story line, characters while maintaining enough of the original with cameos from both original actors and original ghosts. A long movie, but my friends and I didn't even notice. Ignore the ignoramuses, see for yourself &amp; have fun. Mathematically speaking, the queen is far and away the most potent force on the board. Yet there are certain situations in which the lady's subordinates are more deserving of reincarnation. To be sure, under promotion is exceedingly rare in tournament practice. In fact, there are only two circumstances under which it makes sense to under promote:1. Promoting to a queen (or rook!) allows a stalemating combination. 2. Promoting to a knight is a better tactical or positional choice based on its unique movement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keep crying man babies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to see this movie nine more times to spite all of the men on this site who are heralding it as an awful film. This movie was anything but terrible. It is now officially one of my favorite movies and I'm recommending it to every single person I meet. People are so upset about the "reverse sexism", newsflash, "reverse sexism" does not exist. You cannot oppress a group (men) that historically and societally has been seen as inferior. Stop trying so hard to feel oppressed. It's not going to work. You sound like idiots. The characterization of Kevin served to highlight the way women have been treated in cinema from day one. He serves as "the lamplight character", the character who is solely present because of their good looks. He was unintelligent and did not help in any conceivable way but he was attractive. This has always been the case with women in film, they exist to adhere to the male gaze. It was refreshing to see a man play this part. Obviously, your sense of humor sucks if you think this film isn't funny. I laughed throughout this entire movie. I laughed so hard I almost peed myself. I saw it with my uncle and after we exited the theater, he said, "That was absolutely hysterical." I have so many good things to say about this movie. There was no fat shaming whatsoever. This movie, for the first time, showed women sitting around, eating pizza and just talking. We never see that. This movie showed heavier women running. There were no comments made about them "being out of breath" or needing to stop running. This movie showed women moving in slow mo action shots. It did so many things right. I'm sorry that all of the crying man babies hated it so much. Masculinity is fragile. I'm sorry that you're suffering because for once you're not in the spotlight. Go watch the thousands of other movies made to inflate your manhood. Let women enjoy something for once, Jesus Christ. You have countless movies that you can watch. Excuse me while I buy tickets to see this movie for a third time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Loved it. Funny, well paced, perfect popcorn cinema and a worthy successor to the classic original. Of course, when you have fond memories of the original, a reboot is unlikely to ever recapture the 'magic', but this is a Ghostbusters for a new generation.My only complaint would be that, yes, the one black character is a bit of a 'streetsmart' stereotype, and I would have liked to have seen a more well rounded, 3-dimensional black character.People whinging about 'sexism' are missing the point by a mile; the film pokes fun at the way women have typically been portrayed in film by including Hemsworth as the dumb eye candy character. It's making fun of a stereotype, not men in general. And, dudes, this is the way women in films have been portrayed since the inception of cinema. Lighten up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun film that I can't wait to see again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure this isn't perfect, but for a well done film with a fantastic cast to receive so much hate before it was even released is sad! This was one of the most fun movies I've seen in awhile, the girls were spot on and even Chris' character "Kevin" was a blast. From the moment the film started it never seemed to lag. In fact, I wish there were 30 extra minutes of it. It never felt rushed, but I didn't want to see the characters go. The villain was the biggest flaw in this film. There was hardly any insight into his thinking. But he still was not too bad. As a fan of the original two films, I was worried this one would just be a copy. I was wrong. Yes there were many similarities, but the idea of this was original enough to work. It is great for those new to Ghostbusters, but even die hard fans can enjoy it. P.S. I was not paid yo give this a more positive review, there are people who actually liked it. I'm tired of any good review for this movie to be brushed offed and accused of being a sell out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great fun. Nice tribute to original Ghostbusters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My husband and I saw this movie in 3D and that really was a nice way to view it. I loved the first Ghostbuster movies and did not realize until the end that the same folks put this new one together, with the exception of Harold Ramis who is deceased. It gave tribute to the 1980's GB movies (and to Ramis) with a familiar plot and many surprises and hidden gems to discover along the way while watching the movie. I don't want to spoil it since all were sweet surprises to anyone who enjoyed the first Ghostbuster movies. My brain had trouble adjusting to Chris Hemsworth being in this movie, but I saw the great humor in it and enjoyed the ride without letting his alter ego as Thor get in my way. Hemsworth really knows how to play a dumb blond! I stayed through all the credits and also enjoyed the surprise at the end. This movie revels in pure fun and humor along with wild stretches of the imagination. The ghosts looked great. The acting was top notch by the 4 women leads, each very, very different from one another, just like the original cast was. Most of the gags delivered hit the mark. My husband and I had some good chuckles throughout. I recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys the same kind of humor as the first Ghostbuster movies, and who is not hung up with women being in the lead roles. Kudos to the writers for taking the franchise in a surprising new direction. I think it works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ghostbusters was never going to be a cinematic masterpiece. It's a comedy about people who catch ghosts, which isn't exactly profound material. However, it seems as though everyone expects far too much from the movie. Male-driven comedies are taken as they are and enjoyed because all people are looking for is a good laugh and maybe some fun special effects, so why is it that a female-driven comedy has to 'prove itself' and be more than it is? The film is hilarious, with really great leading female characters (bonus points because they aren't sexualised in ANY WAY!), plus great cameos from the previous cast, as well as the funny dumb-blonde trope reversal with Chris Hemsworth. The special effects are great and I definitely recommend watching in 3D to get the full effect, seeing women working together to kick ghost ass is 100% better on the big screen. Obviously, the movie had flaws; little plot holes and a few jokes that were cringey and awkward, but if you were expecting perfection then you clearly don't understand what the movie is about. Also, it isn't going to 'ruin your childhood'. if you go into the movie expecting to hate it then you will, but if that's the case then this film wasn't made with you in mind. I say give it a chance, don't expect too much, but equally don't go in adamant that you'll hate it. I had the most fun watching Ghostbusters than I've had watching anything so far this year; you'll have such a good time if you let yourself really enjoy the movie for what it is. (Also Kate McKinnon is fabulous and it's worth going to see for her portrayal as Holtzmann alone)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fun and funny movie to watch. They did a great job at sticking to the theme while starting a "new" thing. They also did a great job at paying tribute to the former cast members without "stealing" the new cast members thunder and losing focus on the new story. Sure some of the dialogues seemed a bit forced (specially on the comedy side of things) but that's kind of Ghostbusters is all (well mostly) about and the 80's feel they were going for. They played well with gender and racial roles BS subjects. They never tried to hide what some people are calling a "feminist hidden agenda" so I don't get why so many complaints..?! Well, my male friend and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and we both agreed it accomplishes what it set up to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Worthy Ghostly Reboot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ghostbusters (2016): Dir: Paul Feig / Cast: Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones, Chris Hemsworth: All female update of the classic monster comedy, Ghostbusters. This is a stand alone film that never succeeds the original but is a far cry from the mess that Ghostbusters 2 was. Kristen Wiig plays Erin Gilbert who wrote a book on ghosts with Abby Yates, played by Melissa McCarthy. Erin prefers to shade that experience in event of a possible promotion while Abby is shacked away with Jillian Holtzmann inventing weapons to fight the paranormal. Jillian is played by Kate McKinnon who steals scenes with sarcasm and bewilderment. Leslie Jones plays Patty Tolan who works at the subway where she has a paranormal encounter. Upon meeting Erin, Abby and Jillian she decides to join them and rigs up her uncles hearse with the Ghostbusters logo. Chris Hemsworth is hilarious as the newly hired secretary who hasn't two clues in his head. Director Paul Feig tries to bring together what worked originally combined with a screenplay that contains tense moments as well as a lot of humour. Many of the original cast appear in cameos while many of the original ghosts including Slimer and Mr. Stay Puff make appearances. The special effects lack the originality of the first film but they still manage to dazzle even when the Ghostbusters logo produces a giant problem. Wiig is dosed in slime twice and we cannot help but enjoy the memories. Some are opposed to its female approach but this reboot still produces lots of proton beams, ghastly images and green slime. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Honest Review of the new Ghostbusters by someone whose childhood wasn't ruined just by the trailer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the original Ghostbusters when I was 18 as someone who adored the SNL days of Murray and Aykroyd... And to be honest my mind was not melted by the sheer genius of it. I thought it was a fine comedy, pretty original with a good cast, but I was not going to go out and get the Busters logo tattooed on my ass and spend the rest of my days walking the streets, holding crumpled Ghostbusters fan fiction and praising the writers like a raving lunatic. So now it's 2016 and we have a new Ghostbusting crew, and after seeing it with my friend and talking with her about it, we came to the conclusion there's a lot of sad and angry people over a movie that plays about as well as The Force Awakens plays as a sequel to the original Star Wars trilogy. The new cast mirrors the old cast in a lot of ways. Homage is paid abundantly through out the film. And all the old characters get a chance to smile and wink at the camera as if to say "Remember when we were huge stars and you drooling nerds would come running up to me, screaming catch phrases and demands for autographs, when all I wanted was to have a coffee outside my house in peace? That's these people's problems now, I'm getting the Hell out of here." Most of the complaints I saw on here are about how this is a rip off of a masterpiece that's full of man hating. If you watched the original "masterpiece" you would (or maybe you didn't, you were too enamored with Bill Murray's dry wit!) notice the only mentionable female character is Sigourney Weaver who is basically turned into a sexualized and possessed piece of meat for all the boys. And the only black buster is a janitor (for all those complaining that the new black lead was just a stereotypical, loud mouthed, streetwise black lady.) All in all I enjoyed the movie because it was fun and if given a sequel I would think could be about as good or probably even better than Ghostbusters 2. For all you reviewers who are sobbing for their lost Ghosbusters, now relegated to cameos in this new "atrocity" I leave you with this thought. Ever heard of an alternate earth or multiverse? This is the Earth where our Busters instead of chasing ghosts decided to debunk them, drive taxis, and be a funeral director while some "strong willed young strumpets" took up the mantle. On the other world the boys are still in town and kicking all sorts of ectoplasmic ass, frozen in time, without having to think about really scary thoughts like giving women and minorities meaningful roles, or what will become of poor Rick Moranis's career after the 2nd Buster flick. I guess this could all be summarized as this: "The film was better than fine, and maybe don't invest all your happiness in whether your childhood classics remain untouched as this is Hollywood, where we've seen three Peter Parker Spidermen in 16 years and two Fantastic Four teams in 10. They want your ass in a seat so maybe this one isn't for you. But is it so terrible that they included the girls on this run through? The theater I was in had plenty of laughter and a lot of young women who left it full of energy and wanting to bust some ghosts which is awesome. And if you can't be selfless about your childhood memories, be selfish and think of all the new men and women now interested in your favorite franchise, people that might want to seek out the original and talk with you about it and the series in general."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good family entertainment - ignore the internet snobs and faux-intellectuals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read reviews of this movie before I took my two sons (5 and 9) to see it at the cinema this weekend.The reviews that I read promised it would be diabolical rubbish - with suggestions of rife gender politics, race discrimination and flat jokes that don't work. Some people have taken the time to say that this new film offends the laws of continuity and generally the sensibilities of anyone who loves the franchise. I'm glad to say that I didn't listen to such snobbery.This is not an intellectual film and it's not an intellectual franchise. Nobody goes to Ghostbusters III expecting a didactic on gender politics. Nobody is going stand up in parliament and point to Ghostbusters III as the foundation of a sensible gender dialogue. Anyone who genuinely feels offended by this movie needs to take a long hard look at their sense of humour.Ghostbusters III is a 'reboot' movie - I think they could've easily made this a sequel/spin off - but they chose to go to 'reboot' - perhaps not my preference, but it's OK.Let me tell you my acid test for this movie - my five year old loved it. He watched it on the edge of his seat from start to finish. He cheered when Stay Puffed and Slimer appeared. He spotted some - but not all - of the cameo appearances and got excited by that too. He enjoyed the special effects and laughed at some of the jokes. At no point did he get scared, and he left the movie theatre singing the Ghostbuster song.Tell me that is a movie that is worthy of two stars? My nine year old also enjoyed it, but not as much - but he laughed and he smiled and didn't get bored.For me, I particularly liked the cameos on offer - they were great. Ray, Spengler, Jannine and so on all took a turn to wink at the camera and give us a nod.The special effects are great too. It goes to the next level.OK - the funnies aren't going to make you require stitches - but let's be honest the original Ghostbusters wasn't ever a balls out comedy either, and managed to get by on a few regular chuckles. This is the same really.It's the dry observational stuff that you expect from Melissa McCarthy - it's a shame that there wasn't a bit more opportunity for her to just riff around a bit, because she is very good at that - but the script held together and it never got too much like a pantomime (which is tough when you're doing a comedy ghost movie).It's nice that the film was dedicated to Harold Ramis too - the only significant character (outside of Rick Moranis) who wasn't there to say hello in some way.Some pencil sharpener somewhere will tell you that the voltage wasn't correct on the proton screen or something - this s**t is not real folks! It's a fond recreation of a family franchise, and it works. I chuckled, my kids loved it, you've got to work really hard to get offended. This is a seven out of ten all day long - six at worst.</fullReview>

I really enjoyed them company and Kevin in general. The ghost are scary enough but not too scary... I just wish they can push this movie further to make it a perfect 10.The plot is plain and simple expect the death of the bad guy is so unexpectedly good!Its so refreshing to see women not in ROM con always, I also like the original cast came back for 1-2 scenes!

		<fullReview>I'm proud to say that I'm one of the few people that really enjoyed this new Ghostbusters film. This review will contain spoilers! There were a few jump scare moments, but the majority of the movie was a comedy. I love both Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy, so I was pretty happy that they were both together again in this hilarious reboot.Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Sigourney Weaver, Annie Potts, and Ernie Hudson all had cameos. (It felt very similar to The Brady Bunch Movie)Dr. Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) is a teacher at college but her reputation is at stake when a book which posits the existence of paranormal phenomenon such as ghosts is republished and being sold online by Erin's friend, Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy) she tries to put a stop to it. In exchange for getting the book out of publication, she agrees to assist Yates and her new assistant, Holtzmann on a paranormal investigation. They all see and witness a malevolent ghost. This makes them want to continue their research and become 'Ghostbusters' Holtzmann creates gadgets that allow them to capture ghosts. The villain that is unleashing all these ghosts is a man named Rowan, an occultist who wants to bring about the apocalypse. Some of the CGI was pretty cheesy. If you watch it with an open mind, you'll hopefully really enjoy it. I highly recommend GHOSTBUSTERS!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessarily torn apart/solid "DNA sequel"/homage to the originals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, let me say I'm a big fan of the originals, grew up watching #1 in particular. Love the original quartet. My thinking was, and is with other franchises, these two movies are greatRegardless, I wanted to see the Ghostbuster "reboot" (I feel that's a problematic term. This is more of a reimagining of the story. I've heard the term "DNA sequel", so let's go with that.)As a mid-30s male, I'll address the demographic that I suspect is tearing this movie apart: to you 30-40something males who grew up with the original franchise, give it a rest. No one is stealing your childhood memories. Nor is your sexist vitriol helping matters. And to the few people who didn't like the movie and presented legitimate reasons: thank you for at least building your case -- though even if you don't like the sum total that is the movie, how can you not like Kate McKinnon and Chris Hemsworth? They stole the show!Still, you're entitled to your opinion. It's those that shoot invective directly at the female cast (simply for the movie HAVING a female cast) that make me facepalm and feel ashamed of my gender. Bill Murray got over himself; why can't you?Now that I have that out of my system...I would suggest that you ignore the hype (negative and otherwise), see the movie for yourself, and make up your own mind. It'll no doubt attract new/young fans, and that's okay. That, in my mind, doesn't take away from the legacy of the originals. Moreover, the new movie pays affectionate homage to those very movies (the resurfacing of the original lab and the cameos alone...so worth it). Beyond that, the story keeps the spirit (har har) of the originals alive. Not to deep, just the right amount of cheesy, good banter amongst the leading cast (and the lesser known cast, IMO, like Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones really shine). Even the ghost effects...the special effects people could've gone full CGI but they preserve the look and feel of the originals nicely. The result is a movie that is simultaneously fresh but also comfortably familiar.I was also impressed with Neil Casey as Rowan -- the epitome of genius gone bad. Nice touch that he used the very methods and beliefs that Erin and Abby eschewed in their book.And again...Chris Hemsworth. Nuff said. So, I liked it over all. I really liked it. I suggest giving the movie a try; even if you are a die hard and are wary of reboots, I feel there's value in this movie and a laugh or two, to boot. If you're just taking the negative hype at wholesale value, at least go see the movie so you know what you're avoiding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had low expectations after seeing the trailer, but i came out pleased and very happy there was a new Ghostbusters movie in theaters. I was born in 1990, therefor I only watched the first two ghostbusters films on VHS and home video. Im a huge fan of both films and couldn't be happier to see a new film in theaters. many of the people in the theaters cheered and laughed during the film and once slimer appeared with his ms. slimer, people stood up and clapped. It was a surreal experience. This really makes the movie going experience more enjoyable when you have a room full of fun loving people who are having a fun time with the film. Is it a perfect film and better than Ghostbusters 1 and 2? No, but Im not sure that was the point. This is simply a fun film. There were a few kids in the theater as well, when they left one little girl had her action figure of Rowan the Destroyer and Patty in her hands and told her dad "Daddy I want to watch the other Ghostbusters movie now too"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>GHOSTBUSTERS (2016) **1/2 Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones, Chris Hemsworth, Andy Garcia, Cecily Strong, Neil Casey, Charles Dance, Ed Begley, Jr. , Zach Woods, Michael Kenneth Williams, Matt Walsh, Karan Soni, Steve Higgins, Bess Rous, Nate Corddry (Cameos: Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Annie Potts, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver; Ozzy Osbourne (as himself) ) Much ballyhooed remake/reboot to the smash hit blockbuster '80s sci-fi comedy with a sex change works for the most part with a fiercely funny foursome of McCarthy, Wiig, McKinnon and Jones as the paranormal quartet setting up shop in NYC where yet again another apocalyptic event is cooking no thanks to a disgruntled native (Casey) who is about to unleash a seismic spookiest of biblical proportions. While filmmaker Paul Feig (who co-scripted with partner-in-crime Katie Dippold) has the chops comedically down set many of the pulse beats are retreads or touchstones to the original classic (which is well and good; you can't please everyone including the haters) yet even despite using more practical visuals succumbs to CGI overload in a bloated grande finale that feels like Roland Emmerich leftovers from ID4. At any rate the girls just wanna have fun (McKinnon is a hoot as a combo of Yahoo Serious (seriously at least in her off-beat get ups) and Aykroyd &amp; Ramis' characters while McCarthy &amp; Wiig have a dynamite back-and-forth schism of natural on point low-key hilarity) adds up to some solid laughs amidst slime time and prove chemistry outweighs a few potholes in the film (what is with all the Shouting? Ms. Jones is always a large goofy presence but at times Everyone is up one decibel than necessary and a game Hemsworth attempts to be humorous but his stupid receptionist is oddly sexist considering the ongoing backlash about the sex change in the protagonists; oh well so much for progress). And yes the original members (sans Rick Moranis and a nice visual tribute to the late, great Harold Ramis) show up in lackluster cameos; nice try from the producers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The second best Ghostbusters movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this film is not perfect, it is a decent and enjoyable film. Far superior to Ghostbusters 2 I might add. Don't listen to the 1/10 ratings on IMDb. A lot of them are trolls who haven't even seen the film yet, they just wanna hate on it. The film does have some trouble spots, but there is a lot that is well done. The action is good, the acting is good, some (not all) jokes land, the cameos were fun. The first 40 minutes of the film were very strong, it kinda got off rails towards the end. That being said, the original Ghostbusters did have the same feel. The ghosts looked cool, especially the first few. Would I watch it again? Yes. Will I get it on DVD? Possibly. My only problem with it is the cheap cash-ins for some of the jokes. Like Patty is just a stereotype, sadly. With that I give this film 6-7/10 for good acting, fun and colorful visuals, decent script, fun cameos, some funny jokes that land, and the characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed the first Ghostbusters movie, and it had a wonderful cast, but this remake takes advantage of improvements in special effects and the cast is equally as good.I thought Kate McKinnon and Chris Hemsworth were so hilarious!! I can't wait to buy the DVD so I can watch it over and over.Apparently some anti-female organization is asking people who haven't even seen the film to go online and make up lies about this film. If you listen to those people, you'll miss out on a great comedy. There is nothing controversial about this movie. It's just great fun.I especially love the cast. Each one is brilliant. Very funny, and very smart. This movie is so smart. You will love it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I answered the call, and it was worth it! Really, It was it was fun and funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do understand some geeks on this. I've been waiting for Ghostbusters 3 forever. Bill Murray is still funny and still relevant enough to lead the return of Venkman, Stantz, and Zeddemore, but tragedy hit, with the death of Spengler (Harold Ramis) in 2014. Part 3 would never be the same without all Four horsemen.Then Paul Feig announced his all female Ghostbusters, which I was fine with, because Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig would star, so I knew it had a good chance of being funny (I have to say good chance because the last few McCarthy movies were not funny)But then that teaser trailer came out and showed us nothing. So little that It made me think it was going to be another McCarthy dud.Plus the character of Patti only hit home how this was not an all female Ghostbusters but an all white women Ghostbusters (Guess Maya Rudolph was to busy to be in it?)That became a real pet peeve. Despite the trailers getting better (As they showcased Chris Hemsworth's role in the movie to get the geeks off their backs (Weird that they needed to decrease the hate of boys by showcasing some beefcake in an all female Ghostbusters). I was still not into the role of Patti (even though I love love Leslie Jones).So here's the moment of truth and this is what it comes down too:From beginning to end the movie made me laugh. It's funny, women can be funny, It's not Bridesmaids funny, but what could ever be that funny?It turns out that the trailers do Kate McKinnon a big disservice, cause she was so funny in the movie as Jillian Holtzmann, an out of her mind Engineer who makes all the Ghostbuster's gadgets.I still wish Patty (or some other woman of color) was one of the core scientist, but once again, Leslie Jones owns it and nails. Absolutely HilariousI don't have to tell you that the comedic team of McCarthy and Wiig makes up for the string of crap McCarthy has been doing by herself lately? Cause these two bouncing the comedy off each other was great.Plus Chris Hemsworth as the receptionist being hired just cause he looked good in a tight shirt was perfect. Not as funny as he was in the remake of Vacation, but fun to watch for all you boy geeks who needed some beefcake to look at when you got tired of the "all- female Ghostbusters"The Villain they go up against was super cool too. He was a super nerd that used technology to try to bring the end of the world by unleashing a Ghost vortex. If you seen Captain America: Civil War , it's like a funnier version of that villain.The special effects in the film were actually top notched, I really like the ghost creations and how they interacted with the live action. It's rare when it looks that nice.Is this all female remake as funny as the original? The answer is yes, it is as funny as the original. Some of the jokes are spot on for modern viewers and a great update that perfectly explains what today's Ghostbusters would have to deal with (The fire house is too expensive, scientist who believe in ghost work at community college and of course the internet hates them)Is it as good as the original? Of course not, it's a remake of a classic, it would never live up to that. At least it's not the same situation as the 2015 Fantastic Four film that had a black Human Torch and even though I love Micheal B. Jordan as the Human Torch and still support that casting, The movie was complete garbage. The All-female Ghostbusters was not complete garbage. However, their focus on being funny made the story unbalanced. The narrative was very weak. Ghostbusters reads more like a sketch comedy brought together with a common theme. Not that there was not a story it just could have been explored better.Keeping up with the times, Ghostbusters also works as a Superhero movie. The origin of the Ghostbusters was laid out more in detail, their connection with the villain is cliché to all Marvel studio movies(just like the End credits), the Ghost they battle are monstrous and city destroying, and they have this scene in the final battle in which the females act like the Avengers. I must admit, this does not work as well as it should, it really makes the whole thing corny as hell.Plus, there are a bunch of different versions of Ray Parker Jr's. Ghost busters theme. With it's small flaws I'm good with the remake of Ghostbusters but not fine with the covers and remakes of the original theme song layered in this movie. All crap.So if you think that women cannot make a funny Ghostbusters than you're wrong, no one should have ever remade the Ghostbusters cause it will never beat the original, but the girls are funny and it's a fun movie to watch, hands down.Very impressed.http://cinemagardens.com/index.php/2016/07/16/ghostbusters</fullReview>

It was funny, colorful, had great acting and story, and was just downright enjoyable! I don't that many movies, but man oh man would I pay to own this! It's one of best movies of the year, and people need to calm the f**k down. Was it the original? No. Was GB2? Hell no! It's its own thing, and it deserves to be judged as a standalone film, and not just a dumb summer movie. To say this ruined your childhood is an overstatment. I mean by Jesus, the film has only been out for 2 days, and there's already 438 reviews, 90% of them negative. 2 DAYS!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haters gonna Hate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I am a fan of the original, and I think this reboot unlike many others adds something to the franchise. The movie had the best amount of new and respectfulness nostalgia for the original. Not to mention the awesome chemistry between ALL of the girls. They are funny and amazing all by themselves but together it is golden! Paul Feig is the best at bringing funny people together and have it work to benefit the comedy as a whole. In short, it doesn't feel like it was written by one person who had only one sense of humor. This reboot give a new generation something to be thrilled over and maybe go looking for the original and be pleasantly surprised. So let the haters hate and enjoy a kick ass movie with your friends. If you enjoy Ghostbusters and/or Paul Feig movies you will not be disappointed. A blast to watch and kid friendly, what more could you ask for?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the controversial reboot that is Ghostbusters (2016). What are my thoughts? Despite the trailer being the most disliked trailer in YouTube history, upon seeing it in theaters, I don't know about you, but I haven't seen a film that had so much controversy and Internet drama since the first Equestria Girls movie. So, upon seeing it today, while drinking Ecto Cooler, I do think, in my mind that the reboot has pulled off more executions than the old one did.So, before you call foul on this, let me make it personally clear with you before you get the wrong idea: there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with the Ghostbusters being female. I just want to see it without expectations like Pixels, despite having Adam Sandler on it (What else can I say? I'm interested in video games? How can I resist?), and this is what I get from the four main characters. Sorry, so no. I'm not looking forward into hearing anymore of this SJW drama. Okay?Anyway, I give my high score. I do hope I don't rage people. So, yeah.</fullReview>

Comedy is extremely subjective, but if you like Paul Feig movies I think you'll enjoy this one.It's a remake where women are the Ghostbusters (shocking!).

Well, guess what? It's not. This movie had the entire audience laughing through almost the whole movie. "But what about the BAD CGI?!?!" For one thing, this is a campy movie and comedy, and for another thing, GO WATCH THE ORIGINAL. Tell me how that looks, then come talk to me. I loved the pacing for the most part, though emotional moments did kind of fall flat. The movie was too funny to let that drag it down, though. I actually don't think that Chris Hemsworth was just eye candy, his part as Kevin was very entertaining. What's really funny is that I don't see many gals saying he was hot; they really just liked the movie. Seriously, people, ignore the one-star reviews. This movie is a fun paranormal romp.</fullReview>

As critics have said, Kate McKinnon steals the show. You can tell the all the actors are having a blast. It's a little crude but nothing worse than what you see in most comedies. Not sure what all the negative reviews are about. It makes me thinks there's some women hating group organizing their members to flood the comments.

		<fullReview>I watched Ghostbusters with my husband on the first day it came out - and we both loved it. It really captured the quirky humor of the original Ghostbusters movie, from 1984 (that I was also able to see in the theater). This new version of Ghostbusters had me laughing the whole time and I would love to watch it again.Those who are familiar with the original version of the movie will be able to pick out several cameos from the original film. It's clear that the original cast approves of this new version.I love that this movie had four fantastic female lead characters who get to use science to catch ghosts and save the world. I would have loved to seen that back in 1984 when it seemed (at least to me) that there weren't any action movies with female characters not only taking the lead roles, but also doing things that are typically reserved for male characters. It makes me smile to know that little girls today will get to watch a version of Ghostbusters that they can see themselves in and relate to in a way that little boys got to back in 1984.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ghostbusters (2016) has exactly what you'd expect from a horror comedy: laughs and scares. With an A+ director and cast, not to mention some terrific cameos, it's the best film of 2016. In fact (and I mean this in all honesty), this is much better than the 1984 original. Everything about this film works. Kate McKinnon can do it all. I was thrilled to see her on the big screen, whether flashing a grin or rocking yellow goggles, not to mention those ghost gadgets! Please ignore the bad reviews! This movie had us smiling from start to finish. We loved the scary effects and the 3D made everything pop. At one point I thought slime was actually going to flood the auditorium!

		<fullReview>I think I'd give this a 7/7.5 out of 10, but I'm happy to give it the extra points since so many trolls have made it their singular mission to give this movie a one star rating. I'm so sorry that their fragile dispositions can't fathom the idea of a female-led Ghostbusters remake and that they'd rather devote their time to tearing this movie down than to, I don't know, contributing anything positive to the world. My family and I are fans of the original, but that did not stop us from greatly enjoying Feig's remake. It was definitely one of the better films I've seen over the summer. I feel like there's been a dearth of great summer movies since the earlier releases (Captain America, The Nice Guys, etc.), so this was a pleasant change. Wiig, McCarthy, Jones, and McKinnon all had hilarious moments in the movie and continue to show that they are some of the funniest actors around. Chris Hemsworth has never been funnier and was a scene stealer with his character's idiocy. I know some critics have said that the plot was thin or that the jokes didn't land. I'll concede to the plot being pretty light, but there were literally only a couple of times where the jokes didn't get a laugh from the audience. Some of the lines were a little cheesy, but there's nothing in this movie that warrants it having a 4.4 rating on this website. If you're looking for a thoroughly enjoyable summer movie, Ghostbusters fits the bill. I hope people realize that the almost 20,000 ratings on this site are bogus or have been given by sexist crybabies who need to come into the 21st century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't believe the hype - Give it a shot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Allow me to preface this review by stating that I have always been a fan of the original movie (part 2 was only 'Okay' in my opinion, as opposed to the first film), and I've heard all of the same criticisms of the newest film in the franchise that many of you have. Despite the naysayers, I sat down to watch it in order to see for myself how bad the movie really is, and here is my take on it:The Cast - Melissa McCarthy plays Melissa McCarthy, accept with glasses, and a pseudo-knowledge of the 'other realm' as attained by someone who's been looking for ghosts all of her life. She's the Dan Aykroyd of the film, and other than the standard (if slightly toned down) McCarthy-esque sarcastic humor, she does a decent job in the role.Kristen Wiig - As the (sort of) Peter Venkman, Kristen Wiig fails as a female version of Bill Murray, yet her character is not unlikable; in fact, she's quite likable as the nerdy, romantic scholar.Kate McKinnon - As Jillian Holtzmann (the Egon of this incarnation), she was my favorite character, and played the slightly insane, sort of steampunk-ish mad scientist with a heart. Her character's gags in the film were handled the best as far as I'm concerned.Leslie Jones - As the Winston Zeddmore sans testicles of the film, Leslie did decent job of portraying the streetwise non scientist of the group, and had a few chuckle-worthy one liners as well. Her character (in my opinion) had a much more central role than Ernie Hudson did in the original film, and didn't drop the ball.Chris Hemsworth - played Kevin, an incredibly dim-witted model/wannabe actor, secretary, who was clearly hired by the Ghostbusters as eye candy, and he brought a ridiculousness to the role that was actually enjoyable.The Story - The story was standard Ghostbuster fare, if not a little darker with regard to the spectres themselves. It shadowed the original film pretty closely, and other than feeling a little rushed, it wasn't terrible.Cameos - There were several cameos from members of the original cast, and they were true cameos in the sense that they do nothing to overshadow the current cast members in the film. All in all, they were fun to see, without getting in the way.In closing, this film doesn't come close to deserving the ire of fans of the franchise; it really wasn't that bad. Was it a masterpiece of film making? No, but neither was the original, and it certainly isn't the worst film of the year. If you want to watch a film for the simple enjoyment of it, give the new Ghostbusters a shot. I was expecting something horrific, and was pleasantly surprised to find the film more than just watchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than Ghostbusters 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ghostbusters is perfect proof that weak trailers and internet trolls should never be trusted. Feig and co. have heard the vocal hordes of overreacting nostalgia nerds and straight-up bigots, and has decidedly ignored them, except to call them out with a couple of decent meta-jokes placed within the film. Is the movie perfect, or even great? No; its unnecessary self-awareness and lazy character writing make it feel too slapdash at times. However, it's bundle of laughs and good-natured scares keep it from being the "childhood-ruiner" people assumed. For one thing, it thankfully isn't the photocopy that the trailers promised. Sure, it similarly follows some ne'er-do-well scientists on a hapless adventure to capture ghosts. Otherwise, much of its likeness is mostly found in its respectably old-fashioned structure and tone, along with some fun Disney's-Haunted-Mansion-esque FX and cartoonish practical sets. Feig used the passing of years to up the stakes in only the scares department (i.e. awesomely scary mannequin segment). And while I wish these new characters were more clearly defined than as just vehicles for plotting and humor, that humor still shines throughout, with a scene-stealing turn by Hemsworth as a pretty-boy dope. The smaller comedic moments are what made the original film hold-up for so many years, and Feig does his darndest to continue that style. Unfortunately, some of that forced reverence is its biggest distraction, leaving us questioning, "Was this movie really necessary?" It's packed to the gills with pointless cameos that offer nothing but annoyance, and the final battle is a hasty and uninspired mess. Luckily, the humor and cast make 2016's Ghostbusters colorful pop entertainment that's at least outshines Ghostbusters 2.</fullReview>

When there's plenty of alternative spider men and women to tell their stories. But about the film, I loved how different each of the characters were. Erin and her respectable "real science" arc, the backstory with the neighbour, how desperate she was to make people see the truth. Fell in love with Holtzmann. She's crazy and practical and chill, and incredibly clever. Patty was so different to the others, she brought the practical street level knowledge with her love of reading and human interaction. Abby and her passion for something no one credited for years. Chris Hemsworth proved he can do comedy here. He's the first male dumb blonde I've ever seen, which means there's no negative impact on blonde guys in the real world. It's not like he will become a common stereotype, holding back men from pursuing scientific careers...</fullReview>

And I can a sure you the reboot will not crush your childhood in any way or in any ghost form! The reboot doesn't hurt men, pretty much everyone is a complete idiot in GB16, I mean everyone! This unpaid review is coming from a guy who fully hated the marketing! Terrible job from SONY! Literally TERRIBLE job with the marketing! Truly GB16 was a blast and it doesn't deserve the hate, it just doesn't, but I can understand why! The only thing I wish they could have fixed was the pointless MARVEL villain in the first two acts, still loved his ultimate form, it kinda reminded me of The Real Ghostbusters cartoon! Also the cameos didn't felt forced in my opinion, except for Murray's, he's still amazingly funny in his role, better than Rock the Kasbah, that's for sure!Probably the best 3D experience in a while! Very different and unique! Bonus: Here's my GB Top List:5) The Real Ghostbusters 4) GBII 3) GBIII The Video Game (2009) - This game needs a remaster! 2) GB16 1) GB84Acceptable in my GB List: Extreme Ghostbusters (I used to own most of the action figures, including Eduardo Rivera!)P.S.

		<shortDescription>Honors the 1984 classic &amp; brings something new to the table.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ghostbusters is a reboot of the 1984 film of the same name. This movie is set in Manhattan. After New York City experiences a surge in supernatural activity, four women join forces to stop these ghostly threats. Abby Yates(Melissa McCarthy), Erin Gilbert(Kristen Wiig), Jillian Holtzmann(Kate McKinnon) &amp; Patty Tolan(Leslie Jones) are the four women. They call themselves the Ghostbusters. Ghostbusters is an awesome movie. I have no idea why this film was embroiled in so much controversy. Having an all-female cast, does not disrespect the original Ghostbusters(1984) in any way. I am so glad that we got to watch another Ghostbusters movie, after so many years. Director Paul Feig, has successfully introduced the Ghostbusters to a new generation. This film will make you guffaw uncontrollably, just like Ghostbusters(1984) &amp; Ghostbusters II(1989) did. The visual effects are superb. All the scenes involving the Ghostbusters' encounters with ghosts are a treat to watch, especially in 3D. The actors' performances, are the highlight of the film. Melissa McCarthy is outstanding as Abby Yates. Kristen Wiig is spectacular as Erin Gilbert. Kate McKinnon is excellent as Jillian Holtzmann. Leslie Jones is hysterical as Patty Tolan. McCarthy, Wiig, McKinnon &amp; Jones have the same effortless chemistry &amp; camaraderie that, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis &amp; Ernie Hudson had in Ghostbusters(1984) &amp; Ghostbusters II(1989). Chris Hemsworth is hilarious as Kevin. This is completely different from any other role, Hemsworth has played before. Neil Casey is good as Rowan North. Karan Soni, Ed Begley Jr., Charles Dance, Andy Garcia &amp; Cecily Strong are impressive as Bennie, Ed Mulgrave, Harold Filmore, Mayor Bradley &amp; Jennifer Lynch, respectively. Ghostbusters is a must watch, for fans of the original &amp; newcomers alike. Just watch it with an open mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just a great girl power movie, but a great movie overall!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been waiting a long time for a movie like this.This is a movie that, although it is a reboot, could very well be a stand alone. The jokes are cute, the spooky parts are spooky, the human side of the characters glints through, and it's just overall a great movie. I wasn't sure what to expect for the jokes as I'm not a big fan of the current trend of the humour in comedies with female leads, but I truly loved this movie.While watching it, my heart was breaking a bit thinking about all of the trash that had been thrown at it, just because it was a girl movie. These ladies did an amazing job, the writing was right where I would want it, the characters and their development was fresh... I can't complain. It was nice to see women portrayed as women and not caricatures or where their sexuality plays the lead role, not the personality. I'm looking forward to seeing a lot more ghostbusters, and a lot more of the Ghostbusters. Oh, and seeing it again, a day later!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Reboot of the Original-Don't believe the haters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally, I really liked it. I thought it was a good reboot of the original. I admit there are parts I liked mainly because I'm coming from the female experience. These parts may make some men roll their eyes. However, women have been rolling their eyes at overly "manly" moments in film for decades, so I won't apologize and I'm glad the people involved in the film (including Ackroyd, one of the producers) haven't.There's no replacing Ackroyd, Ramis, Murray, Moranis or any of the beloved original characters. However, I don't believe they were trying to here. If they had to make a female version, these are the best female comedians right now and I don't think they could have done better for casting. To better understand the negative hype, I even re-watched the original movie right after and I certainly laughed harder at the new one. I also noticed that some character moments in the 1984 film aren't consistent. So, although it is a good film and deserves its praise, don't believe the haters who are a little too starry eyed about it &amp; are just trying to make a point against this new one. Trust that the original cast and creators thought this was good enough to release after all these years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genuinely funnier than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like a lot of people, I chose to ignore the (mostly negative) hype surrounding this movie and draw my own judgments once it came out. I can honestly say that I found this movie much funnier (and better in pretty much every way) than the original. Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones steal the show, with some of the best lines in the film. There are a ton of cameos and Easter eggs for people who have seen the original movies to appreciate. The movie is cheesy and silly in the way the 1984 version was, with CGI that mimics the 80s special effects (worth noting here because I keep seeing other reviewers complaining about how "bad" the CGI was. If you'd actually seen the original which you claim to uphold like the bible itself then you'd recognize that it's done on purpose). As for those calling this movie "man-hating," that comment literally has no merit whatsoever. Yes, the main villain is a man, but plenty of other movies have male villains, so... And yes, Chris Hemsworth's character is the embodiment of the "dumb blonde" trope (a trope, you'll notice, that is typically reserved for women), but it is expressed throughout the movie how much the women genuinely care about him and appreciate him as part of the team, despite his incompetence as their receptionist.All in all, it's a great movie. I saw it twice. Everyone I went with loved it. Don't believe the negative reviews. Go see it for yourself and draw your own conclusions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignore the idiots giving this bad reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interestingly enough, pretty much ALL the bad reviews I've seen are from men. They're all complaining about how men are portrayed as stupid, etc., when I doubt one of them would have complained had the roles been reversed. Because they're used to having the dumb-as-rocks eye-candy aimed at THEM. How about all the women go back and rate down every movie where the women are portrayed as helpless, stupid, big-boobed morons? Men don't mind those, because hey, that's how it is, right? Literally the only reason most of them hate this movie is because the gender roles are reversed, so no matter what, they are determined to stick with that. I don't care if people call this a reboot, or remake. I'd call it neither. Much like the 'reboot' of Total Recall, there are similarities between the movies, but there are so many more DISSIMILARITIES that they each need to be taken on their own merit and not compared to each other.Anyway, despite the reviews, the movie is actually really good. The chemistry between the cast is great, the storyline, aside from the basic 'group of ghosthunters', is original and entertaining, and the subtle and not-so- subtle shoutouts to the originals are great. The cameos by the original crew minus Harold Ramis are awesome, and all 3 of the living, original Ghostbusters LOVE this movie.So instead of hating it based on some reviews by baby boys who would prefer not to see themselves portrayed as women have been for decades, listen to the people who ARE Ghostbusters. And for the record, my husband and son saw no sexism, anti-man BS like other reviewers are saying. I guess if you're determined to hate something, you'll make up whatever reason you think will work best. Give it a chance on its own merits. You'll be pleasantly surprised!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My review of Ghostbusters (2016) | MY FIRST REVIEW</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, this was a bit better than I expected. First of all, I kinda agree with the negative reviews, the humour barely made me laugh (my mother kept laughing at every joke I didn't laugh at) &amp; it felt like the scriptwriters simply took the script of the original Ghostbusters and modified it a bit. The cast is good, not gonna lie, I liked the cameos from the original Ghostbusters cast members &amp; the VFX looked great, also the Ghostbusters logo as the final ghost villain was very surprising to me. So to summarize this review, here's a short sentence.The movie is good enough, cast is good, VFX is great, writing was a bit sloppy &amp; the music was OK. Rating: 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great cameos from previous casts. Wicked comedic timing- McCarthy and Wiig are amazing together, McKinnon's facial expressions were hilarious and all rounded out with Jones's one liners. Add in Hemsworth's character and you have tons of laughs. Awesome homage to the previous movies too. I like that it wasn't a continuation of the last sequel but tied symbols and characters in. I had high expectations and Ghostbusters nailed them. I would almost give this movie a 10 but that is reserved for completely original movies. I recommend everyone go and see it and keep an open mind. I know the female cast feels sacrilegious to some but hey give it a shot!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good reminder that the current trend where everything has to be a remake or sequel or tie-in doesn't have to be horrible. There were good nods to the first two movies, but these are their own people, and they are given more humanity. Good energy and willingness to just go with things. In this case, this especially meant letting Chris Hemsworth and Kate McKinnon do odd things that didn't necessarily add to the story, but did add to the charm. I know at least some ad-libbing was involved, and that may have added to a set where everyone felt supported and free.It's a minor thing, but there's a Jaws joke that really made me happy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the trailers left me worried that my excitement about ladies as Ghostbusters would not be what I had hoped, the movie itself went above and beyond to meet my expectations. For all these folks whining and crying about the first Ghostbusters movie, which I loved so much as a teen that my brother and I would quote it and I would dream about being a ghost buster not a receptionist or damsel in distress, please get a hold of yourselves. I watched the first one after the reboot and honestly, for all those lavishing praise on it, I saw things about it that aren't so great, like Venkmann's smarmy, lecherous professor at the beginning trying to convince a young co-ed she has powers...the sort of tasteless and completely pointless scene of Ray having a specter visit him in the night for a little pleasure. I find it humorous so many folks think the new movie lacks plot and substance, it wasn't like the first didn't have some stupid parts and tasteless bits (and I say that while still loving it). I personally found this movie fun, exciting and hilarious and refreshing in that it didn't try to stick in some romance bit and focused instead on the friendship factors of the team. It made me laugh way more than I expected to and I found the special effects to be pretty awesome, especially in 3D. I have rarely jumped into cyberspace to defend a film so vehemently, but this is the movie I would have loved to see as a 13 year old but I'm just as glad that I got a chance to see it now, and that my young daughter got to see female characters that weren't princesses or romantic leads being funny and smart and strong. She loved it too and I certainly hope there will be a second!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just returned from watching a film I was skeptical about. Having four women lead a film originally led by men gave me the impression I would be watching some trendy, PC, equal opportunities mess. Instead, Ghostbusters is a mess of fun, scares, truly unPC antics. A mad man has found a way to break the wall between the living and the dead. As he releases ghosts and ghouls on the unsuspecting people of Manhattan, it is up to a group of disgraced scientists and a lonely MTA worker to put a stop to it. Ghostbusters works because, rather than cast four women to play the exact same roles as the ones made famous by Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson and Harold Ramis, they are allowed to create their own chemistry and characters. They're all strong comedians and they're all given the chance to show off. The film doesn't feel like a retread of the old material, rather a hilarious, modern take on a hilarious, once modern spectacle. Of course, a lot of the original shock and awe is missing here because, as an audience, we know what to expect, but in the one of the films funniest scenes involving a mannequin and a rock concert, Feig and co prove they've got cause to be here.I was familiar with McCarthy and Wiig. Their work on Bridesmaids was stellar but I've found McCarthy's humour to be far too coarse (except in Spy) and I've not seen Wiig since. McKinnon and Jones are an added blast of crazy cool. As for the unPC nature, Chris Hemsworth is sexualised beyond belief. Playing dumb as a coot and as fit as Adonis, he shines and almost steals the show from the girls. Not to mention, one of the Ghostbuster's almost flagrant touching of him and you're amazed no one has called in social services. The film isn't man hating, it's not "feminist" propaganda. It's a movie that just so happens to have women kicking ass. The film is messy, though. Like the original, it's kind of all over the place. However, it's amusement more than makes up for it. Kristen Wiig running helter skelter down Manhattan telling people to evacuate whilst a possessed McCarthy rotates her head a la Exorcist elicited big laughs from the audience I saw it with. There were also moments of collective gasps. The 3D is some of the finest I've seen in film, yet. Although the ending is flat and runs out of steam before the final ghost has been apprehended, it still manages to find a source of entertainment.By far the most fun I've had at the cinema since Captain America, I'd give this 4/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How is this offending anyone...?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so yesterday I had a burger, and then went to see the Ghostbusters-movie. Sat front row, in the middle. Ate some tasty chocolate candy bars, drank my chosen beverage (tried a mineral water infused with a taste of a popular chocolate pastry ? it was disgusting!).It was a matiné showing, on a smoldering hot, picture perfect summer day ? so no, it wasn't packed. Not by a long shot. Still, I did share that front row with three other people, and the theater was probably at least half full. It was insanely difficult to shake the feeling of slight trepidation, this was after all the first time I went to see a movie not ONLY because I thought it was going to be great (I did think that though), but also because so many people had decided to hate it ? on general principle ? that I wanted to see it just to make a statement; You CAN NOT judge a movie unseen!There really is no end to the stupidity among the people calling themselves "real Ghostbusters fans". Oh they will say that it isn't the female leads that bothers them, it is the story, or the effects, or the humor, or simply the fact that it doesn't star Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis (?2014) and Ernie Hudson. But trust me, most of them are bothered ? to one degree or another ? by the female leads.So, there I was. Expecting to be entertained, hoping that I would be THOROUGHLY entertained. And guess what? All these small minded people judging the film way before it ever came out ? they are MORONS!The opening scene set the tone pretty well, being somewhat eerie and having a nice jump scare, leading right into the title and the theme tune. Somewhat mirroring the original's librarian-scene. This follows throughout the movie, with humor added to the mix.I'll skip walking you through the story, as I run the risk of spoiling things, and cut right to the chase? In the original I had to suspend disbelief when it came to Venkman getting as far as he did without studying, and the department they were at at the university staying open as long as it did. There was also the problem with the firehouse ? as rundown as it was it would still have been a fortune, even back in 1984 ? a problem dealt with in the reboot. There was also very little said about the four 1984 leads. You knew basically nothing about them, except that Venkman was a possible sexual harassment suit recipient. The characters of Ghostbusters 2016 actually got some meat, meaning I felt I got to know more about them, who they were, where they came from and why they ended up where they are. They also made more sense to me, in a way? I love the initial dynamic between Erin (Kristen Wiig) and Abby (Melissa McCarthy), you get a real sense of bitter history there, and it was great seeing Melissa McCarthy in a position of actual power. I also love the fact that they gave Patty (Leslie Jones) a real story, instead of letting her succumb to the Ernie Hudson fate of having basically no character. One of my favorite moments though, was right at the end, where (and I'm not gonna give too much away here) they let the awesome but basically cartoon character of Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon, rocking it out!) give a real tear jerker of a speech.Also, Chris Hemsworth has to be mentioned! He plays the part of Kevin, the Busters air head receptionist. Kevin spends his time not answering the phone, trying to chose which photo of himself makes him look most like a doctor and drinking (and spitting out) coffee. I really like Hemsworth as Thor, but this was another side of him. The guy is hilarious! More comedies please, Mr.Hemsworth!I know the effects have taken a lot of heat, what with them looking all glowing green and blue. But I really don't mind it ? and the fact (yes, FACT, straight out of director Paul Feig's mouth in a Total Film interview) that there is very little CGI involved when it comes to the ghosts and monsters I find encouraging. The glowing doesn't bother me one bit, and in comparison with the original the effects are consistent ? adhering to one style throughout!The people whining ? HATING ? on this are usually very quick to claim that they wanted a sequel, not a remake, that they wanted the principal actors from 1984 in the lead roles, and also that this movie is basically feminists hating on men. What I don't understand is this; Ghostbusters 2016 is executive produced by, among others, Ivan Reitman (original director of Ghostbusters 1984) and Dan Aykroyd (one of the principal actors from the original). It is visibly supported (you figure it out) by Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver and Annie Potts (all starring in the 1984 original) and the whole thing is dedicated to Harold Ramis (the only one of the four original leads to not be alive today).SO WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM!?This wasn't the best movie I have ever seen, but it was pretty damn entertaining! Entertaining enough to make me laugh out loud several times, and it made me choke back a tear (believe it or not).It has also made me make space on my shelf, right next to the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I made the ultimate mistake of reading comments/reviews, and you should never ever do that. I can't even believe how many fragile masculine egos there are whining about how this movie has an all female cast. I've seen this movie 4 different times in 4 different theatres now - every time the audience was made up of all genders and ages, and they all laughed hysterically through the whole thing. This cast is stellar, they have wonderful comedic timing and improv skills, and I feel sad for any man who is so butt hurt over them being female that they can't enjoy it. I think my favourite comment was, "Every man in this movie is either stupid, evil, or eye candy." OH MY GOD, you mean like basically every woman in every movie EVER? Further than that - this movie isn't for men anyway. This is for every little girl who hasn't been brainwashed to think science and action movies are only for boys. And for every woman who has had to sit through movie after movie after movie where the women are little more than a blow up doll for the male lead to woo or save. Suck it up, boys. It's a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why All The Hate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not surprised about all the hate that this film has been receiving the last couple on months. I will admit the trailer were not good and it had some of the worst marketing I have ever seen for a film. It also had some of the worst audience response to a film I have seen. I did hold out hope that it could be a fun movie because the cast is great and Paul Feig is a talented director. I will be the first to say I actually really enjoyed this film it is a fun summer comedy that I think if you go into without telling yourself you will hate it you will have a good time with it. The film does have some flaws near the ending but all the chemistry between Wiig, McCarthy, McKinnon, and Jones is great and their were moments I could not stop laughing. I also cant praise enough Chris Hemsworth in this movie shines as the not so smart receptionist for the Ghostbusters. One flaw I did have with the film thought is that a lot of the time it did have moments were it was calling back to the originals. I am fine when movies do that but it became a little bit excessive in this film and some of the cameos just did not work. Yes it did also get a little to big on special effect in the third act in the film which drew it down a little bit for me. Overall thought I had a great time with this movie and it is a good addition to the summer movies that have not been very good so far. It did not deserve all the hate is got and it's ridiculous how some people are refusing to go see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard about this movie even being made I had some apprehension to see this movie. This was before the trailer was released, once the trailer was released and watched it I got a sense of what the film was going to be and I realized that I should give it a chance once it was released. I saw it yesterday and I honestly cannot see why so many people were mad about this film before it was even released. In my honest opinion this reboot is worthy of being up there with the original 1984 film. People complained about the special effects, I thought they looked good for the film. Ghosts looked pretty good and the cast was amazing. Honestly the only gripes I have with the film is the awkward flirting Kristen Wiig's character towards Chris Hemsworth's character. It was funny at first but it kind of got stale after the 20th time it happened. But it's minor so I can over look that, the climax of the film I thought was amazing when they get taken back to what looks like late 70's New York City. All in all, this was a great film and well worth it. Not many films I would go back and see when they are still in the theaters but I will go back to see this in the theaters. Before you actually pass judgement on it, actually go see the movie before writing if off as a terrible reboot like so many did before the film was released.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THIS REVIEW DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS I loved this film. I loved the shout-outs to the original franchise, the actors, the "nice guy" villain. It was funny and well acted, in a very SNL way. You could tell the actors had a blast making this film. I know a lot of men have panned this movie as man-hating, but it's not really. Yes, a lot of the jokes were made possible because the cast were women. Good thing a lot of the audience is also women. The villain, as I mentioned before, is a "nice guy" - he thinks that he deserves something just because he hasn't got what he wants from the world. The scene in the basement where Abby tells him that this doesn't make his special is quite telling. There was so much about this film that was aimed at a female audience and I loved it. I love science girls and history nerd girls, and dorky boy and awkward flirting and just pretty much everything about the soundtrack. I'm so glad there wasn't a "romance" in the story, that it was about friendship and looking out for each other. So good. So fun. Definitely will watch again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Film Most Controversial of The Year Scares, Entertains &amp; Satisfies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to release my review - principally positive - of profane languages and emotions towards the haters, the only thing I will express would be: "Swallow your own sh_t, fuc__ng haters". Now, let's start.'Ghosts from Our Past' is titled the book written by Dr. Erin Gilbert and Dr. Abby Yates, in which establish how to identify and counteract a paranormal entity. The book is a failure and as a cliché of ' female buddy films ' take directions different. Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) works as a professor at Columbia University, while Abby continues to studying the paranormal with a peculiar engineer, Dr. Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon), However, ghosts from past will return to torment to Erin. She find out that Abby returned to publish the book in digital platforms such as Amazon without her consent, decides to reunite with her partner for remove from the network the stormy book that will possibly ruin her life. Abby accepts with only one condition: She guiding them to a museum in New York, where powerful supernatural forces have evidenced, this, the first venue for a series of conspiracies to will free all the vengeful spirits of the city. A very suggestive and promising initial plot that will impressed even the most skeptical with the best of a summer film.We all remember with affection and nostalgia to supernatural comedy film released in 1984, directed and produced by Ivan Reitman, which left an indelible hallmark on the global pop culture and became a obliged reference for corporate films of today. Although, we are in the period of resume ideas (" Mad Max: Fury Road "-" Ben-Hur ") and apparently the productions of Hollywood is being obsolete, however, this not means that all reboots has been a fiasco. 1984 are gone, and new generations deserve to know the foundations for the comedy films, therefore, Paul Feig's "Ghostbusters" is a complete delight. The reboot offers some tributes to the original - it is obvious, they were inspired by it - but the atmosphere is different, team is different, the spirit is different, so it has to be assessed as a individual product, it not as the cheap copy that they have sold us detractors.The relationship between the new team is palpitating, glorious and powerful; showing its hefty power in each frame. Which makes innovative and entertaining to progress of the film is not its screenplay itself, it is the analogy of its characters, the colossal and different attitudes of its protagonists, each one struggling to dominate, but it is nonviable to declare the winner, is like a frenzied crescendo. We have already seen the knowledge that McCarthy possesses for the comedy genre, with the comical film of last year "Spy", "Bridesmaids" of 2011 (directed by Feig), or even this year with "The Boss"; a woman with a so unique and bold humor that has become the humorous lady of the decade in the film world, I am a great admirer and outside the world praises her; with so much potential, it's no wonder her performance in her last movie, boundless guffaws. Kristen Wiig goes by the same road, and despite she is not stand out like Melissa, the duo plays of wonder and remain in place of beginning to end in the film, with their supernatural form of make laugh and also cry.Rowan North (Neil Casey) plays a villain singularly strange. A guy inspired in the book of Abby and Erin that want to avenge of the world that called him weird, he is part of the heterogeneous mix developed around the film; his quality is proportional to the progress of the film - his final manifestations are fantastic, they will be a pleasant surprise for fans. North is also responsible for guiding Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones) to the team, an African American woman, who works in the subway of New York requests the help of the Ghostbusters for later inundates of laughs and exceptional moments to the audience. Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon) is the queen. She portrays a crazy engineer, with a couple of screws loose but with strengths and well represented in the corresponding scenes. Perfect and ideal complement to the team, it is not the silly addition says absurd and irritating comments, that role fell into the hands of another. Holtzman is the brain of the operation, constantly, makes improvements of her weapons, her technology and her defenses, a character special. Hemsworth has tried to venture into the comedy world, he had a small cameo the last year with "Vacation", but this time, he dared to be the sexy secretary of the 'Ghostbusters', Kevin, a young man with glasses without lens and with childish pants invades in the life of the quartet to fill of comments to some extent funny, but Feig knows how control it and do not exceed this resource until the end. Characters, creatures, ghosts and songs from the original are perfectly implemented by Feig and his team, something that fans will love of the original, I did it.Paul and his team have done an extravagant work, a puzzle meticulously armed which only falters in small and invisible aspects, nothing is superfluous nor badly worn, it is simply "Ghostbusters". I confess, when I heard the emblem song the franchise felt nostalgia, but after seeing the final result, I say with confidence: "It was worth". 1984 has its own, but 2016 screams perfection. Beyond of the purpose of the film (Entertainment), the extension of the film and especially the end after the credits is a clear analogy to the revocation of the female voice in a misogynist and discriminatory world , the girls say: "we have achieved it" and successfully, they have achieved it with honors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It only seems like a bad movie if you do not know a good fantasy movie when see it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This a great movie. It is not better then the original Ghost busters. Ghost busters II is also better. But still this is a very good movie. It has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. It is a great movie. The people who made did a great job. All the Ghost busters movies are great movie. This is not a 5.3 that is just underrating it. This not a great remake. But it is a good remake. This is one the best fantasy movie from the decade. It is very scary. It is scarier then The Shinning. See this movie it is a great movie. I give 9 out of 10. This is one movie you do not want to miss. Do not lesson to the haters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was so much FUN!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie! Go see it. Forget the reviews from the guys who haven't grown up yet and realized women share half the planet. It was awesome! Melissa Mc Carthy plays a smart scientist without the usual gross-out lines she's been having to utter in recent films. Kate McKinnon is pure comic genius, and Leslie Jones is great in an understated role as a transit worker who's under-appreciated for her brains. Kristin Wiig, always a talented actress, doesn't have as much personality here as the others, but plays her part well. Plot was better than the original version (with great riffs on the original) and the special effects can't be beat. IMAX and 3-D made it the most exciting movie I've seen in years. Some of the dialogue could have been smarter or wittier, but all in all, great fun. I plan to see it again, and not just for the scenes of Chris Hemsworth dancing. This is the first time I've been to a movie when NO ONE LEFT THE THEATER UNTIL THE SCREEN WENT DARK. How many films can you say that about? Bravo, Ghostbusters!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful third movie for the Ghostbusters series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1) As a fan of adventure movies I won't beat around the bush. Since I was a little girl, I loved adventure movies. I grew up with "The Ghostbusters", "Back to the Future", "Star Wars", "Pirates of the Caribbean" and so on (all movies with mostly-male leads by the way). I love the supernatural, I love action movies with stories and sci-fi elements. I get excited just by hearing the theme songs - mean like super-excited. In that remark, the new Ghostbusters was a full success. It had everything: scary scenes (my scariest scene... the Mannequin...), funny conversations, freaky characters (Jillian and Abby &lt;3) and super awesome fighting scenes. I have to say... when Holtzman had her slow motion fighting scene in the end of the movie... my heart seriously skipped a beat. It. was. so. unbelievably. awesome. I can't even describe what explosion of feelings went off inside my chest. It was the best action scene starring a fully dressed female lead I have ever seen. The ghosts were scary, the special effects were wonderful and fighting scenes were incredible. 10/10 points from me.2) As a fan of the Ghostbusters Ghostbusters was (though scary for a kid) one of my all-time favourite as a child. I loved the two original movies and I was utterly fascinated by the way of combining science with supernatural occurrences. I loved the characters and the jokes and the gadgets. I love the Ghostbusters series. As a fan, this movie was a special treat for me. Not only did they have the same theme song (my heart is dancing just by thinking about it), but they made so many tributes to the first movies, I was ecstatic. There was the marshmallow man, the original fire department house, Zuul, a scene down in the subway system, the slime, the crazy machines and gadgets, the receptionist and of course... all the cameos of the leads in the first series. I was so freaking happy. I was so unbelievably blissful to be able to see another Ghostbusters movie.3) As a woman As I said, my favourite action movies as a child always had male leads doing "the cool stuff". I was okay with that, didn't know any different after all. But you know... if I had seen this movie as a child, I think the impact would have been even stronger. I am absolutely psyched they showed an all female team with so many different characters to relate to. I am still completely overwhelmed by how well it portrait them as female leads. No sexy scenes, no highlighting their sex appeal, no love stories, no talking about men or getting married or doing "girly things." No. It was showing women as human beings, scared and crazy, brave and sassy, clumsy and intelligent. It was showing them in normal clothes, eating normal things, doing stuff together. For me, as a women being raised in a mostly all male lead movie history, this was simply amazing. I can't stress how important this movie is for me as a woman. I am so happy to be able to experience this.4) As a social activist I have already touched this topic in the three points before, but I think it's important to stress this again. This movie is entering a new stage of how women are portrait in action and adventure movies. They are just people doing their stuff. No sexy armours, no presenting their breasts, no "damsel in distress", no talking about men or relationships. This is important for young girls. Because it teaches you, that you don't have to be sexy to be a super hero and I think this is very important. Rather it shows women as being scientists, as being intelligent and brave and adventurous. Also, it shows all kind of women: in different shapes and ages and colours and heights and characters. I really and absolutely love that. Furthermore, it was funny to see the "stupid secretary" trope reversed in the movie and I think Chris Hemsworth did a wonderful job. It was not really my kind of humour and I don't think it's a necessary part of the movie but it was interesting to see how they've done it. The only thing I have to criticise is that the only black woman in this movie is portrait as the only woman not having a higher education (Erin aiming to be a physics professor, Jillian being an engineer and Abby working at a technical college). Although this may be read as another tribute to the original movie, I find it disappointing that Patty is the only non-scientist woman. It just reiterates the stereotype of uneducated black woman. That's the mayor flaw of the movie I can think of right now.All in all, this movie is aiming to be one of my all-time favourite and I seriously hope they will make more movies with the cast. I want to give this movie 10/10 points because I honestly think that it is a ground breaking movie for female lead adventure movies. It was funny, it was scary, it had the most amazing action scenes and special effects, a great story, wonderful actresses and actors and was a breath-taking tribute to the series. I am just amazed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was awesome. I took my family ranging from 6 to 37 and we all loved it! We are fans of the originals and were entertained throughout this movie. I loved how it showed young girls that you can have a career in science be smart and follow your dreams regardless of who doubts you. I was laughing for most of this movie. I will buy this movie for my home collection which isn't something I do often. And as for people saying it was man hating.. Decades of movies have objectified women and now a movie shows women objectifying a man who isn't the brightest so you're complaining...It's a joke, lighten up! I'm glad Sony is ignoring the haters and planning the sequel. I will be the first in line!</fullReview>

Apparently I wasn't the only one who loved it because the theater was super crowded for a Tuesday, the audience actually broke out in applause and cheers during some parts, and of course lots and lots of laughter!I am glad that I decided to give the movie a chance and not listen to these people's reviews. I am really flabbergasted at all of the negative reviews on here... there were even tons of negative reviews before the movie was ever released.

		<shortDescription>Wow!! Such haters!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many people seem to forget that the original Ghostbusters (one of my favorite movies of all time) was simply a 'fun' movie. Crass jokes and cheesy one-liners were the rule of the day. This movie was FUN! Kate McKinnon was a blast. It wasn't intended to replace the original, it stands alone. As far as I am concerned, it stands strong. While it may be true that most of the male characters in the movie aren't 'heroes', I don't see why they have to be. In the original Ghostbusters, Louis was portrayed as a love-desperate nerd, William Atherton was a complete bureaucratic jerk, and Gozer ends up to be a practically naked female with 4 inch heels. To say it is appallingly sexist because they hit the ghost in the crotch to get him to let go of the buildings and because they hired a male receptionist based on his looks? Really? People have too much time on their hands if they have to analyze their 'entertainment' this way. All around good time, my family loved it and so did everyone I know that went to see it this week.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Fun I've had Watching a Movie in a Long Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a male nerd who grew up in the 1980's watching both original movies and the cartoon, running around with my toy proton pack and catching imaginary ghosts in my basement, I should be of the demographic complaining about how this ruins my childhood or that a cast of all women is just a stunt in the name of political correctness, or whatever their issue is. But the truth is, I REALLY enjoyed this movie. The four female leads were absolutely hilarious--especially Kate McKinnon who steals every scene she is in. The other three characters have more growth, more of a story arc, and are more fleshed out as people in general. But McKinnon makes the most out of the available material and creates a very fun and memorable character.The comedy of the 2016 version, while equally effective, is completely different from the dry humor of the original. The absence of Dan Aykroyd's and Harold Ramis's ludicrously funny lines delivered with a straight face, and the deadpan humor of Bill Murray has been switched out with a more over-the-top and in-your-face style of humor. It's not as subtle. Ghostbusters (1984) made me chuckle; Ghostbusters (2016) made me laugh out loud.While a lot of the original's comedy came from the ghosts themselves, i.e. that they're funny instead of legitimately scary, the new version reverses that. There is some very creepy imagery involving things like old timey parade balloons, ghosts pushing against mirrors, and other things that seemed inspired by American Horror Story. Plus, there were some good jump scares, boo moments, that actually caught me off guard. Much like a guitar amp out of Spinal Tap, this film turns both the scares and the comedy up to 11 with great results. I haven't had this much fun at a movie in a long time. The trailer is NOT a valid way to judge this film. The trailer seemed to splice together all the ineffective moments and jokes of the film. But those were the exceptions and not the rule. The rule here is fun, entertainment, laughs, and the occasional scare. When the film works, it works remarkably.The only real misstep was Chris Hemsworth's character. While the gender role reversal of the hot blonde ditz secretary was brilliant and long overdue in a mainstream summer movie, he was just too dumb to be believable. The character of Kevin belonged in a cartoon and not a legitimate movie. The best line in the movie references Jaws and Annie Potts' cameo made me cheer. However...If you've already decided you hate this movie without even seeing it, you probably won't like it. That's how these things usually work. But, if you have an open mind and are reserving judgement, I suggest you see it. You will be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than expected!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fab seems to be the idea of cranking out more sequels and reboots, specifically from the 80s. For a lot of people, its a mixed bag of reviews, most of them negative. To date, this might be one of the few positive reviews for the new Ghostbusters. At first, I was excited to hear about the new Ghostbusters. Having been a child of the 90s, I grew up watching both films. Who wants to mess with perfection??? This movie has a few quirks and weird parts. Honestly, I think the story-line was fine and that their reboot is somewhat original. The few things that it lacked was that the cameos of the original cast did not have their original character names,.....regardless, its works either way, but it would make the passing of the torch a whole lot better. The other thing I'd like to mention would be that both the original and the sequel both centered around Dana Barrack, in some form or fashion. The opening was great! The idea of the haunting in that old mansion had some gravity to it. Really, that isn't even much of a spoiler alert. The strongest point of this Ghostbuster entry I'd have to say is the fact that the story-line and the 'language' of the film converging was more than plausible. The first film hinted at cults and the reality of real haunting and poltergeists. This entry seems to take this concept, much, much further. The idea of even having a show-down at the rock concert made it feel like there was something larger happening. I would say, that this reboot could have been a lot worse,.....a whole lot worse,......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts slow, but gets there in the end.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me tell you what I didn't like first. It's a bit slow to start and is too full of pseudo- scientific chatter. They could have tried for a few more jokes early on, so that the few that fell flat didn't stick out as the only poor attempts. The editing was also slightly odd at points, going between a few scenes with no transition, leaving you wondering why they were there. Not anything as big as missing plot points, just slightly confusing, taking you out of the movie. But here's what I did like: the Holtzmann and Patty characters are well done. I was worried after seeing the trailer that they would be superficial and very stereotypical, but they were good. Kirsten Wiig's and Melissa McCarthy's characters didn't quite hit the mark as well, as their relationship wasn't covered well enough and I think suffered at the hands of editing again. They do have some funny interactions at points at least. It was fun spotting the cameos from the original cast.But the best thing was the action scenes with the ghosts were GREAT! Really well filmed, and the dialogue, jokes, action and all the rest seemed to click together better during them. Of course there's a big action climax finale, so by the end it was a much better film than when it started. Is it a cinematic masterpiece? No. But neither is the original movie. It's a decent summer action film once the action gets going. Go have fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** Spoiler Free ***As a kid I loved the Ghostbusters movies and all the spin-offs, so I saw this movie last night when it opened. I have to say...I'm really surprised at the animosity guys seem to have for this movie. Reading through some of the reviews, a lot of you guys haven't even seen it and you're justifying your negative comments under the guise of how sexist and racist the movie is. I guess haters are just going to hate. That said, I thought Ghostbusters was fun. It wasn't awesome, but I definitely want to watch it again and would buy the bluray when it comes down in price. There were some moments that were a little too slapstick for my taste, and I didn't think Kevin brought anything to the movie, but otherwise the narrative was exactly what you should expect from a Ghostbusters movie: hazy ghosts, pseudo science talk, quips, slime, and a one dimensional villain.Kristen Wiig felt a little flat in her portrayal of Erin, and it was nice to see Melissa McCarthy NOT acting like Chris Farley, but Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon stole the show as far as I'm concerned. All the cameos, tropes, and nods to the originals played well and felt good overall, and the last scene of the movie with Ernie Hudson made me laugh out loud. Lighten up guys. This film shouldn't threaten you this much. It's a fun reboot, and even though I don't any awards on the horizon, the new Ghostbusters doesn't deserve such harsh rhetoric.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give it a chance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I saw the remake last night, and like many, I wasn't going in with high hopes. Not because of the female cast (I personally enjoy Melissa McCarthy and Kriten Wiig comedies, I had no previous experience with the Kate McKinnon or Leslie Jones) but because of the fact the trailer's comedic moments just fell flat for me. They were fairly low brow humor and compared to the originals dry sarcastic humor it just looked juvenile.Imagine my surprise when the movie started and I was really enjoying it right off the bat. The one thing I haven't heard many people talk about is the horror aspect of the horror/comedy that is Ghostbusters. Now this isn't going to be a movie that "scares" people, but it actually does build tension, and the first scene in particular really sets the tone for the horror aspect of the movie. Following that up we get into the character development of the main characters and that's where the next pro for this movie comes in. These are not the same characters as the original just played by women, they are each their own, sure they have similar characteristics, Melissa Mcarthy is the Heart of the group much like Dan Akroyd, and Kat McKinnon is the one who develops all of their equipment just like Harold Ramis, but Kristen Wiig isn't a copy of Peter Venkman, and her character arch is a nice addition to the movie, because in the matter of honesty, their aren't really any character archs in the original. I'm going to go on record and say I was most worried about Leslie Jones because most of the scenes of her in the trailer were over the top, and while she is probably the loudest of the bunch, she does get to deliver some of the best lines of the movie, "That's a room fulla nightmares" may be one of my favorites from this new movie. Kate McKinnon however was my favorite, she will most likely not be for everyone, but her weird cadence when she speaks, and her mad scientist vibe worked for me and I really hope this movie gets her more movie parts.Chris Hemsworth might play the most lovable idiot I've ever scene in a movie, his stupidity is so over the top but he owns it, and you can tell he had fun with the role. He gets so much more than the receptionist did in the first movie and it makes for an interesting dynamic. He almost seems like the younger brother that hangs around. It's a weird dynamic and I'm probably describing it poorly but it works.I saw the movie in 3D and I strongly recommend that those who see it go see it in 3D if you can afford to and you aren't the type that 3D gives you headaches. I'm normally not a fan of 3d where things pop out because to me that effect never works, but it really did in this movie. One of the things that helped the effects was the cropping, the movie is played with extra space above and below much like old letterbox movies on VHS, however that space is used for effects to seep out of the main frame of the movie helping the effects to really POP off the screen.Now for the negatives of the movie. Paul Feig likes to write low brow crotch/fart jokes, and weird awkward moment humor, and for me there were a few scenes that could have been better had they not lowered the comedy bar so low. Also I don't know if it was always in the script or if he rewrote it because of the backlash but all of the male characters are either morons, cowards, or jerks. I'm not saying the movie needed a man to come in and save the day, but it just seemed odd. However I'm sure I'm a bit biased being a male, and maybe there are more than a few movies where there are nothing but terrible women in it. All things considered I give Ghostbusters a 7/10 and recommend it too all who like horror comedies. In my mind the Ghostbuster movies will now be ranked, Ghostbusters (84), Ghostbusters (2016), Ghostbusters 2. I really hope this movie does well enough for a sequel because this is a movie verse I would love to go back to. One last thing, there is an after credits scene so stick around, that isn't too difficult though as the credits are a blast to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly - no, this is not a 10/10 film, but someone's got to try and balance the result against those who spam these boards with unfair and unsolicited reviews and ratings...To sum Ghostbusters up in one word, fun. The four female leads have such an engaging presence and excellent chemistry that even when the script lets them down and the middle half loses momentum, it never once feels dull. Slick special effects help make the final act very entertaining and enjoyable; this is most certainly the feel good film for the summer.Long-term haters will not suddenly love the film, but everyone else should give it a chance, as it acts as excellent escapism.FULL REVIEW: http://perksofbeingnath.blogspot.com/2016/07/ghostbusters-2016-3d- review.html</fullReview>

It is definitely more of a "fun" film than one that stimulates your mind. The story line was engaging and I thought Leslie Jones and Melissa McCarthy were hilarious. This film could encourage younger generations to check out the original Ghostbusters films. On a more political note, I do not think it's possible to consider this film man-hating or sexist towards men without considering most films woman-hating or sexist towards women. Comparing reviews from other films, it seems that some folks are more sensitive to the former than the latter.</fullReview>

Some guys don't understand I guess, it's their loss. It's a rare movie that we get to see women doing the ass kicking, all while not wearing booty shorts! Mad Max (well, Charlize Theron's part), The Force Awakens...and I can't name any others recently.Saw it with my 5 year old daughter who I made watch the original movies but who then told me "Mommy I want to see the one with the girls."

		<shortDescription>There's a goat on the loose.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People who are easily led by the majority, please don't believe the unmitigated hate this film has received since it was green lit with an all female cast. Bear in mind it's produced by the original Director, and Exec produced by Ackroyd.And it's really surprising to know that it's one of the most entertaining reboots/remakes/side-quels of a beloved classic from our childhood.Two paranormal researchers join forces with a nuclear engineer and a subway attendant to fight off a slew of ghosts that have invaded New York City. Eventually, they come face-to-face with an evil entity who can control human beings........The reason why the film works so well is that it simply just follows the template of the original movie, but with different settings and characters. So as the original started with the woman being followed around the library, here we have a tour guide with exactly the same expression on his face as the title graces our screen.And the final set piece more than resembles the finale of the original, funnily enough with a little of Donner's Superman 2 added for good measure.The blatant sexist hate for this film is absolutely abhorrent, and it's such a shame that. Any people have jumped on the same bandwagon, in fear of getting ridiculed for being different, much like the protagonists of the film in question.Wiig is wonderful, and the first twenty minutes of this film is laugh out loud hilarious. The first encounter the Ghostbusters experience is hilarious and very scary to boot.Hemsworth almost steals the show from everybody as Kevin, and the first interview is priceless. If you don't laugh at least once, especially by the name of his dog, you are either lying, on that poisonous bandwagon, or devoid of humour.Yes his character is stupid, and is used just for comedy, but he is a natural at comedy, and I hope he makes a few more.The effects are really good, quite intense in some scenes, but I urge you to see this in 3D, it really enhances the action scenes, and some of it is used to really good effect.The cameos are a wonderful inclusion to the film, and they all add a little to the film rather than having them more or less saying 'hey!!! We were in the old one!!! Remember us??'.It does run out of steam toward the end, and the villain is nothing more than a bitter man who was bullied as a child (his character really needed to be fleshed out), and Jones does suffer from being the token stereotype thanks to some poor script decisions.But fear not, the reboot of one of the most iconic films from 1984 isn't nowhere near as bad as what you have been told, and what you are led to believe.It's lively, funny, scary and most importantly, doesn't try to outdo the original.And thank goodness one cameo now has a partner.Don't believe the hate, it's a great summer movie, and they are really short on the ground this year..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you like funny, watch this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ghostbusters 2016 starts funny and stays funny all the way through the credits (don't forget to stay for the cookie after the credits!). These actors have perfect comedic timing, and the action sequences kick ass. I'm super impressed with the updated story. And Kate McKinnon is a freaking treasure as Holtzman. If you have a problem with this movie because wemyn are talking to other wemyn about important things, as opposed to being set decoration, stop blaming the movie for your blatant sexism. If you think wemyn can't be funny, that's probably because you've never spent enough time listening to any wemyn talk ever. Stop blaming this movie for your awful, sexist behavior.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite all claims to the contrary, this movie was absolutely fantastic. It certainly isn't a cinematic masterpiece, but then again neither were the original Ghostbusters films. It seems as if suddenly, thousands are heralding the Ghostbusters franchise as the greatest in existence, when in reality they've always just been good comedic romps that are seldom dwelled upon afterwards. However, this film is something that I, and many others, can't get enough of. It's more than refreshing to see a group of women kicking ass and taking names while forming meaningful relationships with each other, all without any romantic subplot developing in the wings. The women and their relationship with each other is perhaps the most enjoyable part of this film, each incredibly talented actress bringing something unique to the table. Holtzmann is an absolute dream. I'd see this movie again and again if my funds allowed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the movie yesterday and I was so pleasantly surprised. I was worried it was going to be terrible - because of all the ridiculous negativity - but it was just so much FUN! I'm an 80's kid, so the original movies were a big part of my childhood. This reboot is a great addition to the franchise, and a great way to reintroduce Ghostbusters to a whole new generation of kids. The movie is silly and funny and energetic and I honestly can't remember the last time I had so much fun at the cinema. It's not a perfect movie, but the cast is excellent, (most of) the jokes are great and the effects are a lot of fun. I'm planning on seeing it again this weekend, and I'll be rooting for a sequel. If you just give it a chance you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the original. It's a classic. I was worried that this new Ghostbusters wouldn't live up to my expectations (kind of like Ghostbusters 2 was for the first one) and even put a damper on my childhood, but then slapped myself and released the ghost of fear from within. As a person who's studied comedy and performed improv, I completely 'get' this movie. It is funny. It is worth your hard earned money. It has some excellent lines, zingers, and stupid wha?! kind of lines.1. The characters are themselves. This is amazing. Each person is their own individual, fun self. They are real people being their authentic true selves. I wish this movie had been longer simply to add more depth to certain characters and to see more of their authenticity. 2. There are some great lines, some silly lines (especially from the bloke, or eye-candy Kevin), and some just completely out there stuff. I especially love the bust of the great one. (When you watch the movie, you'll see it and appreciate it all the more). 3. From some reviews here, which is why I'm writing this now, I think that people are in fear. Perhaps fear of laughing at funny stuff. With that said, as a judging viewer, not everything clicked for me personally, but that didn't take away any enjoyment of the movie. For the record, I've watched way too many movies and TV shows, so I know a dud when I see one. This isn't one no matter how many fearful people have "chosen poorly" when providing a proper rating. For those ranking this movie a 5 or lower (especially those 1's), they obviously take life way too seriously and are way too biased to really see how brilliantly funny this is. But hey, don't take my word for it. Go watch it in 3D. You will laugh. And, if you don't laugh, then maybe your Fear Ghost is lurking in your soul. Slap it out and relax.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't particularly excited about the new Ghostbusters movie. Why remake a classic? It felt like a gimmick. However, after seeing it, I have to say it was very funny, and not what I would really call a remake. Like many people, I know the original movie well. This movie uses the same basic premise, but changes enough of the plot to keep it fresh. I notice some reviewers complained that all the make characters were either stupid or evil. I say, welcome to the wonderful world of movie stereotypes. Now you know what it feels like. I found it refreshing to see intelligent, strong women who aren't just sidekicks or caricatures. Female scientists! Who would have thought it possible? Best of all were the funny one-liners. Holtzmann had a lot of great ones. Be sure to stay for the closing credits, they're fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rumours had been circulating for years that there was going to be another sequel to the popular 1984 movie, but various circumstances meant it was decided there would be a reboot, I was willing to try it, despite it having the most disliked movie trailer of all time on YouTube, directed by Paul Feig (Bridesmaids, The Heat, Spy). Basically Dr. Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) and Dr. Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy) wrote a book together, about the assumed existence of paranormal phenomenon, specifically ghosts, the book proves unpopular. Years later, Gilbert has become a teacher at Columbia University, she finds out the book has been republished, it threatens her reputation, so she confronts Yates, who continues to study the paranormal at a technical college with eccentric engineer Dr. Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon). In exchange for ending publication of the book, Gilbert agrees to assist Yates and Holtzmann on a paranormal investigation, they witness and document a reported sighting, seeing a ghost reignites Gilbert's belief in the paranormal, but a video of them is posted online, they are dismissed from their teaching positions. To continue their research, they find an office above a Chinese restaurant, open the "Department of the Metaphysical Examination", hire handsome but dim-witted Kevin Beckman (Chris Hemsworth) as receptionist, and build equipment to study and capture ghosts. MTA worker Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones) witnesses a ghost herself in the subway, she contacts the Department, investigating they document the ghost, and successfully test Holtzmann's proton containment laser, but their proof is again dismissed. The group continue to develop their ghost containment technology and advertise their services, despite setbacks, and pundits start calling them the "Ghostbusters", Patty joins the team, to provide them with her historic knowledge of New York City and a vehicle dubbed "Ecto-1". Unbeknownst to them, occultist Rowan North (Neil Casey) is summoning the ghosts with his built devices, attempting to create an apocalypse, one of his devices is placed at a live music venue, but the Ghostbusters are called, and make their first successful capture of a dangerous spirit in front of hundreds of people. Supernatural debunker Dr. Martin Heiss (Bill Murray) demands proof of their work, Gilbert resents being labelled as insane or a liar, so releases the captured ghost from containment, it escapes, and throws Heiss out of the window. The Ghostbusters are brought to see Mayor Bradley (Andy Garcia), who has been trying to keep the city's ghost problem a secret, they are denounced publicly by him as frauds. The Ghostbusters discover the pattern of ghost appearances, Rowan is placing devices along ley lines, intersecting at the Mercado Hotel in Times Square, which has a history of paranormal activity, and there they discover in the hotel basement he has built a portal to the ghost dimension. Rowan electrocutes himself rather than be captured, the portal is deactivated, in Rowan's possessions a copy of Yates' book, his plan was to become a ghost and command the undead, he soon returns as a powerful spirit, possessing Kevin, and reactivates and opens the portal. Hundreds of ghosts are released, the city is thrown into darkness, the Ghostbusters fight their way through an army of various ghosts to reach the portal, Rowan takes the form of the Ghostbusters' logo, growing to an enormous height and destroying the city. The team devise a plan to use Ecto-1's nuclear reactor to cause a total protonic reversal, close the portal and return the ghosts to their dimension, the plan is successful, and Gilbert is able to rescue Yates from being dragged down. In the end, the Mayor continues denouncing the Ghostbusters, but privately offers to fund their research, and their headquarters is upgraded so they can deal with future paranormal threats, despite the smear campaign, New York lights up with praise and tributes for the Ghostbusters. Also starring Charles Dance as Harold Filmore, Michael Kenneth Williams as Agent Hawkins, Sigourney Weaver as Rebecca Gorin, Dan Aykroyd as Cabbie, Annie Potts as Desk Clerk, Ernie Hudson as Uncle Bill, Ed Begley Jr. as Ed Mulgrave and Ozzy Osbourne. McCarthy, Wiig, McKinnon and Jones are well picked for their characters, and all work well together, Hemsworth looks like he is having fun, and it is suitable to have small appearances from the original movie stars Murray, Weaver, Aykroyd, Hudson and Potts, even Slimer and the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, the credits pay tribute to Harold Ramis. I questioned if the change of concept, with four women becoming the ghost-fighting team, could work, and I made pre-judgements what it may be like because of the critics, in fact I was pleasantly surprised, it made me laugh at the right moments, including when they get covered in slime (ecoplasm), it is also a jumpy at times, and the story is easy to follow, it might not be as witty as the original, but it is a good fun supernatural comedy. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Funny film that is worth watching and is not the 'worst ever film' despite the ridiculous criticism. However, it does fall short of the mark in comparison to what I hoped it would be. Nothing can compare to the original so I'm not gonna compare it to that but there are moments that feel slightly forced or uncomfortable which I didn't get in Feig's previous movies. I feel it's a little miscast with some of the leads and that it should have been scarier. Chris Hemsworth is amazingly funny in it. Really fun performance from him. There are still plenty of laugh out loud moments and it is a good film. Just probably not for fans of the original. I feel the film should have a direct connection to it which could have catered for the original fans while still going ahead with the way they did it for new fans. So, only slightly disappointing for me but definitely worth watching if you want to watch a fun film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most people are criticizing it for being unnecessary but when you think about it nobody did this about in independence day 2 and that was terrible. This movie did everything it was supposed to do and it was great but the only reason it's receiving hate is because it's Ghostbusters and people don't like it when you take away their childhood. But if you saw the movie you'd know that it isn't doing that because if you don't like the idea of it just don't see it and don't ruin it for every one else! Overall this movie is one of my favorites I think there's tons of hilarious jokes a lot coming from Chris Hemsworth and Kate McKinnon surprisingly. My advice to you if you like Ghostbusters or just good funny movies this is a MUST SEE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excluding the racial stereotyping which, in fairness, is unnecessary and doesn't add to Leslie Jones' otherwise really funny and lovable character, this movie was excellent. The Ghostbusters themselves were awesome, from Kate McKinnon's off-the-wall wackiness to Kristen Wig's awkward but endearing nerdy-ness, each of them had something awesome to bring to the casting, and it made the movie fun. I was worried due to Melissa McCarthy's past comedies that there would be rampant fat jokes, but there weren't! It was a wholesome, fun time, with good jokes, a great atmosphere, and a positive attitude. I also love the role-reversal of the secretary (played by Chris Hemsworth) being a ditsy, stunningly handsome man, who is only good for his looks. Too often in movies are women put into roles where their most important feature is their attractiveness, and how attractive the men around them find them. But in this movie it was the man who did nothing but be attractive, and I found that very refreshing and funny! He was an over-the-top commentary on the sexism in film, and I thought it was well done and hilarious. Mostly, though, I love the new Ghostbusters team, and I think this made for an awesome remake with plenty of Easter-eggs and cameos for fans to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ghostbusters is a fun new take on the original, with a talented cast that play well of off each other. After reading bad reviews, I expected it to be flat, boring, and slapstick, but the movie is actually quite charming, and a refreshing action movie that takes women seriously. I grinned through the entire thing, and am seeing it again in theaters. Kate McKinnon steals the show, kicks ass, and is an inspiration to nerdy, off beat, awkward girls. I expected Leslie Jones' character to be a stereotypical mess of a sidekick, but was pleased to realize that her character was smart, sweet, and (spoiler) ends up saving the day. that being said, I think that her character should have been developed more, and that she wasn't the token woman of color. I wish that there was more development of the 4 women's friendship, as the relationship that they form feels genuine, but underdeveloped. The cameos from the original cast was super fun, and a subtle, but respectful nod at the source material. I don't ever write movie reviews, but I think that this is a sweet, fun, and empowering movie that's getting an undeserved amount of hatred.</fullReview>

They should've just taken him out of it entirely. But it was really funny to see the role reversal ? in most movies, the girls are the incompetent eye candy while the men do all the work. And, as we all know, women do the hardest work in the world! Long story short, it was a great movie.</fullReview>

There were some really funny scenes and moments, not enough to make it truly great but enough to make it worth watching at least once. I thought that Kristen Wiig was particularly funny but that all the actresses were great together. The ghosts looked cool but the best parts of the film were scenes with the women talking instead of the action which takes more of a back seat. If they make another one with the same cast I would watch it and it does also make me want to go back and re-watch the originals!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you haven't seen it yet, don't let all the negative reviews influence your choice. Most of the hate comments are coming from die- hard ghostbusters fans who expected something extremely spectacular. This is NOT a sequel, and it is not a REMAKE. It is a REBOOT. To be honest, it was way better than I expected. With all the hate it was getting, I was almost sure it wasn't going to be very good. I actually enjoyed it! I saw it three times! It wasn't overpowered by humor, although there was indeed a lot of it. There were some serious and suspenseful moments as well. Everything was balanced fairly well in my opinion, not to mention the incredible actresses who are in it too. It wasn't the BEST movie I have ever seen, but it definitely was far from being the worst. This isn't a sequel or a remake of any of the original movies. It has a totally different plot. There are many nostalgic moments and Easter eggs from the originals. The original cast is also in it too as cameos. The trailers make it look bad, but the trailers don't do it justice. I loved it, and I will be buying it when it comes out to DVD. Of course, that's my opinion and you may say something different about it and I completely respect that :)&#xfeff;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a little worried about the film after I saw the trailers. It had that Adam Sandler feel - too much slapstick, too much suspension of disbelief, and it seemed to lack the seriousness the first film's characters had in themselves.The film unfolded and I was pleasantly surprised how well how original it was on it's own and how true it was to the original film. It's funny without being forced or obnoxious, it unfolds at a healthy pace, the "wacky" aspects aren't overwrought. The "science" is mentioned a lot, but just enough to entertain, not make it seem too real.McCarthy is always hilarious. Wiig is understated and makes a great place for the audience to start. McKinnon could easily steal the movie with every smile and off-the-wall comment. And the beautiful Leslie Jones adds much needed every-man flavor with down-to-earth wonder. I especially loved the ways the film makes fun of the "meninist" man-babies who decried and all female cast. It pointed out their idiotic ideals without being preachy and it really added a lot of comedy foil. Chris Hemsworth playing the role of the man-baby and seeing the reactions of the cast to him was perfect.I am looking forward to the sequel!</fullReview>

Only thing I found a bit too much was McKinnon's character and I normally love her! She overacted a bit and could contribute her unique character a little more. The rest of the characters are fabulous but they all blend really nicely together (at the end of the day, Mckinno's character is supposed to be a bit more 'mystique' than the others and that unravels in the powerful scenes she has at the end- which I didn't really enjoy as I found them over acted.

		<shortDescription>Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There aren't enough words to describe how and why I love this movie.It isn't just because of the great, fleshed out female characters. Female characters who have different personalities and goals. It isn't just because of the great remix of a classic comedy/action film, with funny and interesting callbacks to iconic parts of the previous films.It's not just because this film has inspired a new generation of young girls and women to fight for what is right, and believe that they can do so. As well as the creation of non-sexy Ghostbuster Halloween costumes, which are somewhat of a holy grail.It is because all of these things, and also because it is a genuinely funny, well-acted film with dynamic special effects.There are so many films where women are bit characters, romantic attraction, a source of dramatic man pain; and in the majority of films they have to represent their entire gender. Not to mention the even smaller percentage of women who are of colour or in the queer community.To have a film where women get to be fully fleshed out, have a representation of different kinds of women and get to be powerful is amazing. So often they must be either a tool or placed on a pedestal, but to be a person and powerful is so rare seeing it in any capacity is so fulfilling. It may not be the greatest film in the history of filmmaking, there are people that will say that the film is subpar or that it's unnecessary because its a remake. That the special effects are badly rendered, that the humour can be lowbrow or even that the actresses are unattractive.However to that, I would argue that Jurassic World was one of the most popular films of last year, this film was basically a remake of the previous Jurassic Park films. This film didn't receive nearly as much of a negative backlash as Ghostbusters despite the fact that it many of the same negative points could be applied.Sexism is extremely prevalent both in the media and in reactions to media. It costs no money, and no pride to respect and understand that films with women are no lesser than films with male characters.I understand that there are those that believe that this film is somehow lessening or reducing the previous films. That there are those that hold those films in a special part of their hearts, and see it as a classic.I would counteract with the theory that there can be different interpretations of a film and that each can be equally good. I know that I can't force anyone to see this film the way I do, and I wouldn't want to anyway.But I would ask that those who are on the fence consider how important this film can be for young women, for their perceptions of themselves and what they can accomplish. There are so many films where men are powerful, I don't think its too much of an ask to have a few where women are as well.</fullReview>

We also took my five year old daughter with us and she has decided to give up her dream of becoming a mermaid and instead would like to become an engineer who builds tools for fighting ghosts...since we saw it two days ago she has asked more than ten times if we can go see it again.

		<fullReview>Pretty good reboot. I enjoyed it and even got some scares in along with the laughs. I think the problem with reboots is, a lot of people have high expectations. I recently re-watched the original Ghost Busters prior to watching the new one. For those saying the movie was slow to begin with. It's a reboot. A lot of young people may not be interested in the original (because of its age) and cannot relate to it, so though WE a generation who know the original might think the story goes slow. The NEW generation are getting educated and schooled in the world that is Ghostbusters. Could it have been better? Yes. Almost all movies could have been better when you critically analyze them to their molecular level. I enjoyed the build up and tried to see the films retelling with fresh eyes. I think it did the job. It had enough nods to the oldie while continuing on its OWN path. I enjoyed the scene after the credits and I do hope there will be a sequel. One that will dive more into the story next time now that the generation have had their reboot retelling of critical background information.

I laughed throughout. The four lead actresses were fantastic and Chris Hemsworth was a delight. There were enough references to the original to pay tribute the fantastic films that have come before, but it also stood firmly on its own two feet. It was NOT a remake of the first two, and I would question whether or not anyone saying that had indeed seen all three films. The cameos were a great homage, but the characters were their own. I cannot praise this film highly enough. Well done to all involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am honestly shocked at how many bad reviews this movie is getting. I thought it was HILARIOUS &amp; so enjoyable. Not only does it have an absolutely killer cast, but I loved the jokes and thought that each of the characters had wonderful qualities.I adore the original movies and even though it is a Ghostbusters movie, I actually see it as something else and just a great movie based on ghosts &amp; a new set of ghost- busting badassness.I am planning to see it again &amp; am excited as it truly was utterly fantastic to me!Kate McKinnon was primo and damn, she is a HOTTIE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TIP: stay till the END!!! Watched the movie last night. Yes, I saw the previous ones ages ago, I feel like I had to say that because I'm going through the reviews and it feels like a lot of people are using it an excuse. As a reboot it was amazing.I just wanted to write a review from my perspective. It's really refreshing to see a woman character to be portrayed in a manner that was very attractive to women (not necessarily typically) or maybe I just really like her. I don't know, not enough Holtz out there, just take my money. So yeah, I have a favourite.I loved the friendships in the movie, supportive characters intertwined with action. I loved how the big four, Erin, Abbey, Patty and Holtz were unforgettable. I feel invested in them and I wanted them to keep going afterwards and I'm waiting for a sequel. Patty's uncle must've loved her a lot to let her borrow the hearse for such a long time also alluding to a healthy family dynamic.Ghostbusters a fun block buster that went beyond my expectations and I would see it again. Sure as a story it got choppy, but it never felt story driven, the comedic timing was on point. Reboot Pro - it kept the to the fun side.Credits/ending bits - super funny, you can feel everyone involved enjoyed their time there and were very proud of the movie. They cared about editing. I can also never complain about cameos.Spoiler: Omg that dance number.If you didn't see the dance number, man you missed out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite all the hate the everyone is trying to give this movie, it was very entertaining! Yes there are times when you see a nod to the other movies, but for me that's what makes it fun to watch. We live in a world of remakes and there is nothing wrong with this one!So all the woman hating, sexist idiots that are trying to ruin the rating of this film should just stop!! My family absolutely LOVED IT!! The women in this movie were very entertaining. There will always be those who wanted another film with The originals but this film stands alone and that's the way it should be. I wasn't the only one in the theater that enjoyed it, everyone was laughing at the same jokes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My expectation were pretty low for this as I loved the original so much. That said, I was incredibly happy with what I got. I don't even like comedies much but this was great. * The cameos were all well placed.* The homages were in the right place and subtle. For those who haven't seen the original, they won't leave you feeling left out.* The humor and team interaction was honest and hysterical!* The fight scenes were glorious and fun. Yeah, it was over CG'd but they're ghosts!* I enjoyed the plot since watching the build up as each team member joined, seeing the ghost problem escalate and the wondering at the villain's character develop kept me interested.* Stay to the end of the creditsSure there were flaws but nothing major and I'd love to see enough woman-led action movies that we stop noticing the gender of the protagonists and just enjoy the movie. More like this, please!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You trolls are ridiculous. Literally as soon as this film started to get good reviews, what happened to the trolls who kept bashing this film for months and months primarily due to it starring women? They just proceeded to intentionally reduce the user score on this site so it's in the low 3.0's-4.0's. I mean at this point it's just embarrassing to see these whining fanboys get so worked up over a damn film. A damn film which, might I add, isn't as bad as those trolls are putting it out to be. Now I'm not saying that this film is perfect. There are some issues, namely in terms of pacing. And not every joke hits, namely during a pretty darn noticeable lull at the halfway point. But for the most part, the hit-miss ratio on jokes is pretty solid (70-30). And aside from some scenes that borrow story beats from the original films, this film and its characters are able to stand on their own as a unique part of the franchise. It certainly helps that the four leads are all excellent and have solid camaraderie. Plus the film does a great job of making them endearing protagonists.Bottom line... don't listen to the trolls. Don't let them spoil your fun if you're one of those who was excited to see this film. Seriously even if I didn't like it I would've still recommended it to people just because it, director Paul Feig, and his cast of talented and funny actresses deserve it after all of the crap they've gotten from the fanboy trolls ever since the film was first announced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of the original franchise, so when everyone was telling me how terrible this reboot was, I decided not to even bother seeing it. Some of the feedback I was getting had to do with the alleged man-hating, some of it the allegedly offensively stereotypical black female character, some of it the reports that the director, producers, and cast were acting horribly towards people who weren't fans of the movie.Then I got stranded on a Saturday night because of the rain and found myself in the cinemas with a good friend. I am SO glad I was pressured into seeing it. Putting aside my love for the original franchise, I found this movie incredibly enjoyable. Paul Feig has NEVER disappointed me. I'm willing to concede that it may be that his humor is just my kind of humor. (Though I must point out that the cinema was pretty packed and everyone in it was laughing. Maybe not at all the jokes that got me, but enough to convince me that we were having a good time.)Conclusion: if you have nothing better to do, give the movie a shot. Leave the bile that other people have been spewing at the entrance and you may just enjoy yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable Reboot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One must view a movie as a piece of art on it's own individual merit. Smart movie, dumb movie, long movie, short movies, doesn't matter. It is what it is. It's art. If you find yourself discussing where that line is, where art stops being art or not, then you're thinking way too much. Some movies call for discussion, some don't. I digress.Before the movie came out, Internet and real life flesh-and-blood people, some friends, all dudes, where completely offended by the idea that they are making a Ghostbusters movie with an all female cast. Now, if this single fact alone creates such a volatile reaction, I think the discussion of sexism is a relevant one. This discussion can be complex and nuanced and doesn't have to begin or end with anyone being called a woman hater. When men have had so much political and corporate power for hundreds of years, and just over one-hundred in the cinema, it's understandable to have this knee jerk reaction. But it doesn't mean we, as men, can't figure this emotion out, understand why it's okay to have an all female cast and, not only enjoy this movie more, but maybe enjoy life a little more too. To continue. The trailer turned out to be the 3rd most hated video on YouTube. To begin, I thought the first trailer was promising: A few good laughs and snippets of adventure that looked like fun. Was it the best trailer I've ever seen. No. But, I can honestly say lots of good movies have mediocre trailers. If every mediocre trailer was voted 3rd most hated YouTube video, then the the 3rd most hated video on YouTube would always be a movie trailer. And in addition: most of the complaints about the movie derived from the trailer that I have heard end up being false, and naturally, because one hadn't seen the movie yet, misinformed. There's a real lesson to be learned here: don't be angry at something you're guessing is true. On to the fans. I'm a fan of the 1984 Ghostbuster movie. No reboot, recast etc. is going to take the 1984 Ghostbuster movie away from you. It's yours. It's as a simple as that, right? I saw the reboot twice. Both times the theater was full and the laughter was uproarious. That was my experience with the audience.If you're resistant to this movie, the first thing to acknowledge going in, is that it is a different movie than the first two. The team of filmmakers aren't trying to replicate the same tone or sense of humor. It's a Paul Feig movie and it feels like one. Now, comedy is tricky-- it's far more nuanced and particular to an individual than a drama. But, I'd make the leap to say if you laughed with Feigs previous films you'll laugh with this one. This one is pretty neck and neck with Spy for me (2015) as my favorite Paul Feig film. I hope that gives you a sense of what you'll most likely get in the laughs department. The action/adventure scene are pretty light and fun in this version of Ghostbusters. Again, a different movie than the original two, who handle the adventure a little more dry. I really had a lot of fun with these sequences in Paul Feigs version, who, I think has gotten better at executing action sequences period. It's two steps above Spy. The flaws. The rules of the world are not the most clear. Especially near the end, during the climax of the film. Because of this, it's hard to fully grasp what is dangerous or not. The movie plays fast and loose with the dangers of the equipment, the ghosts and even the political threat and I was scratching my head trying to figure out what the gals can and can not do to stay safe. Hopefully they tighten those things up for the, what I hope, would be the second installment of this franchise. To sum up. There's room for both franchises. Refrain from comparing and contrasting. There are lots of cameos that bog down pacing in this reboot, but remember that the filmmakers did that for YOU, 1984 fans. How mad can you really stay mad at people trying to make you feel acknowledged and smile, while trying to do their own thing. If there wasn't so much uproar, maybe perhaps, they wouldn't feel the need to pander. To me, movies are sacred and I love them, but at the end of the day they are just movies. It's important to remember that and find that balance. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actual Review from Someone Who Actually Saw the Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm an 80s baby, I grew up with the original Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters 2 was one of my favorite movies growing up. I usually HATE remakes- from Physco to Halloween to Nightmare on Elm St, remakes usually suck! That being said, I always give them a chance to shine. If you're worried that this remake is going to ruin the original, don't! ... After see this movie, it is not a remake- it's more of a re-visioning or sequel to the originals- it's as much of a remake as Vacation was a sequel/remake, to it's original. Nothing in this movie is from the script of the original, it's it's own story, it's own version, it's own movie... Its original, besides the obvious likeness that 4 people become "Ghostbusters", it's all new. The movie even makes fun of itself, by adding little Easter eggs of the original. Comparing Ghostbusters 2016 to the original Ghostbusters as a "remake" is like comparing Insidious as the remake to original Poltergeist. Give the movie a chance, I promise you'll laugh. I would say this movie is a 7 out of 10 but since some people obviously gave it 1 star without seeing it, I'm going to give it 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It entertained me, and that's all I ask of a movie.&#xfeff;</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So a friend and I went to see Ghostbusters last night. TL;DR version, it was fine and not a waste of money (that popcorn though... such a delicious salty ripoff). There was the standard geeky techno-babble explanations of things, a lot of action, very good CGI, and while I felt the villain was a little weak the overall plot seemed solid enough.I will preface the rest of this by saying... comedies aren't really my thing. I'm weird that way. Also, I will try to not spoil anything really, but there is probably some thematic spoiling going on in this. I'm bad with spoilers because I totally don't care about them, so I can miss them in my own comments... be warned.As anyone who is on the internet and as seen anything about this movie knows there has been a lot of bad press. I'm willing to bet that a large majority of that bad press comes from people who haven't seen the movie, and are just going on their gut reaction to the fact that women are being cast in a reboot of the franchise. The humor seemed solid to me. There was some physical stuff, which is totally in line for the original, and I can only think of a single fart joke as far as "gross out" type humor is concerned. I suppose the sliming that happens could fall in that category, but I put it more into the physical side... your millage may vary.There were numerous little call backs to the previous movies which were all subtle enough that if you hadn't seen the old movies they just seemed like regular dialog, as opposed to weird inside jokes you won't get. Most of the old cast had cameos in the movie, Bill Murray as a debunker, Dan Aykroyd as a cab driver, Annie Potts as a hotel desk employee, Ernie Hudson as the uncle of Patty, Sigourny Weaver as Holtzmann's mentor, and the late Harold Ramis even makes an appearance as a bust that is outside Erin's office when the dean comes to talk to her about her tenure. Rick Moranis does not appear, but he's pretty much kept out of Hollywood since his wife died so that's no surprise.Character wise Holtzman totally steals the show. To me it felt like the "main" characters were intended to be Kristen Wiig's Erin Gilbert and Melissa McCarthy's Abby Yates but Kate McKinnon as Jillian Holtzmann gets a ton of great lines, gets to be the total tech geek spilling out techno-babble like a Star Trek engineer, and her big action scene in the later third of the movie was extremely well done and fun to watch. Also I'd like to not that while Patty isn't a scientist she is shown as smart and is the group's history geek, so she's not a one dimensional character. Oh and Thor's, I mean Chris Hemsworth's, Kevin is a total send up of the "pretty but dumb secretary" trope. And that is fine.The villain, to me, was just.... I don't know how to describe it. He reminded me of the 3 geniuses from Buffy. He was creepy, and surely up to no good, but he didn't seem... scary, really. It wasn't a bad villain, exactly, but he felt a bit weak as an antagonist. Like, he would have been fine as an underling to a big bad, but as the main guy... shrugSo all in all, I thought it was a decent film. It entertained me, and that's all I ask of a movie.&#xfeff;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The new Ghostbusters is fun and you should see it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pretty sure a significant number of reviewers haven't seen the movie, and I can't help but wonder if the ones complaining about sexism have seen the original. I'd like to avoid spoilers, so I'll just say the gendered jokes in this version come nowhere close to the sketchiness in the original (which I loved despite its flaws).This movie is genuinely funny. The cast did a great job, the plot was fun, and the effects were good. The theater was moderately full, and by the end, the entire audience was laughing practically nonstop. Sadly, this is probably destined to become a sleeper hit. When the over-saturation of remakes has died down, and the noise from people screaming that this is the sign of the Feminist Apocalypse has quieted, hopefully the movie will get the credit it deserves.</fullReview>

My boyfriend and I both found the movie well written, refreshingly lacking in reliance on tired stereotypes for its humour, with amusing and well timed throwbacks to the original, in keeping with the tone of the same. Not exactly Oscar winning, but good, solid, family appropriate, fun. (If you, personally, are so sexist that you can't take a step back and let only women be the heroes for a change, this probably isn't the movie for you, though)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Is it the boobs you don't like? Because I can make them . . . bigger." Kevin (Chris Hemsworth)As the new blonde bombshell secretary, Kevin embodies the modern take on the 1984 Ghostbusters legend: It's now the boobs dealing with the boos. Four talented comediennes have nicely helped reboot the franchise through wit and grit, not gender. Kevin just turns the clichéd dumb secretary on its head and makes it a clueless man.So much of the pre-release negativity about this film came from people who largely hadn't seen it, alleging political correctness to down-right misogyny. As it turns out, I try to remember a single sexist joke, except over Kevin, that pointedly defames males to the glory of females. Ghostbusters is really about four funny people saving the big city from big ghosts.The cameos of Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, and Sigourney Weaver, not terribly funny in the current roles, remind me that so many factors are the ingredients of success you just can't plant actors and expect them to be winning blooms without sterling writing and perfect timing. However, as avatars of modern screen comedy, they are a pleasant plant of talent, along with director Paul Feig's Bridesmaids as a precursor and Harold Ramis's spirit from the likes of Groundhog Day.Of all the talent in this iteration, even considering Melissa McCarthy's considerable presence, Kate McKinnon is the stand out as wacky Jillian, the manic, mugging playful echo of Harold Ramis's mad lab hound. She provides the ghost-smashing machinery and sometimes garbled commentary that give a zany underpinning to the still outrageous conceits.While the ghost-busting finale is by far too long, Ghostbusters on the whole is a successful comic take not only on its iconic original but also female buddy films like Bridesmaids and, lest we forget, Thelma and Louise. Abby and Erin (McCarthy and Kristen Wiig) provide an emotional theme of reconciling buddies that at times raises the film above slapstick.This film is just a solid comedy that happens to have four female leads interested in bashing ghosts, not men: "Okay, I don't know if it was a race thing or a lady thing, but I'm mad as hell."

Don't make the mistake of missing one of the funniest movies in recent history because there's a vocal substrata of nostalgia Nazis who refuse to view this film on its own merits.The truth is this movie draws you in with obvious chemistry between the characters, who are played by four of the most gifted comedians in show biz and who deliver on a solid script that offers some clever nods to the original. We laughed and laughed. And let's be honest. Although Ghostbusters 1984 is one of the most beloved films of all time, it's single most endearing quality is Bill Murray's deadpan comedic style. Time to reboot a few more '80s revered classics, like Back to the Future, Top Gun, War Games, Weird Science, Fletch, Seems Like Old Times, Princess Bride, Beverly Hills Cop, Raiders of the Lost Ark. Come on, let's have some fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I honestly don't want to believe the amount of c**p this movie has received for the simple fact that it stars women, including a woman of colour, and treats men the same way women have been treated in film for decades. You can't pretend it's anything else. We all saw the same movie. The CGI was on par with films made these days, the acting was well-done, the chemistry between the actors was there and fantastic, the characters were developed to the point they needed to be. Yes, there were faults. A couple plot holes, and there was racist stereotyping of Patty which was unpleasant. That's why I'm not giving it 10/10. But the jokes were fantastic and well-played, and there weren't any of the fat jokes I expected, or anything mocking or playing on the sexuality of the lesbian character. Chris Hemsworth. It often comes down to him on these reviews. His character was dense, idiotic, and there for the eye candy (except not, because he actually plays somewhat of a role later on in the film). If you're going to hate the film for the 'sexism' of his character, just remember that it's the same way women have seen themselves on screen for decades. It's a comedy - a parody in some respects. And his character is also sweet, kind, enthusiastic, and honest. Hemsworth played him perfectly.I can't praise this film enough. After coming out of another recently released film in which I was disgusted at the portrayal of the female characters, this was a breath of fresh air, hilarious, great fun, and an all-round enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With all the hate surrounding the movie I was expecting to see a major bomb. I was, however, pleasantly surprised. To start, the special effects were outstanding as were the sound effects. So it's worth seeing in a movie theater with the latest technology. The plot was a little thin and could have been written better. The acting was pretty good and the characters worked well together at first. Enter Leslie Jones' character. She had some funny moments but overall she over-acted and served to create a disjointed cast of characters. With that said, it didn't ruin the movie. Some of the jokes fell flat, but again it didn't ruin the movie. Speaking of over-acing, the mayor's assistant was not a good fit for that role. I also really enjoyed the cameos. Lastly, I didn't like that all of the men in the movie were portrayed as stupid or villainesque; this did not come across as funny to me. Was it as good as the original? No. Is it worth seeing in theaters? Yes. Go see it and judge for yourself.</fullReview>

Their claims that the new movie is sexist and racist are contradicted by the movie itself, which is neither. Rather, it seems that these haters living in their moms' basements are just saying, "nyuh-uh, you are!" when confronted with their blatant misogyny and racism directed toward this movie. The poor trailers have been used by these people to cover up their true agenda, but now people are seeing for themselves that the new movie, while not the classic that the original is, is still a great supernatural comedy with chills and thrills.

		<fullReview>The new ghostbusters movie was quite enjoyable but it has been getting some very bad reviews and i have noticed that lots of people have been saying that is just a rip-off of the original film but if you stay in the cinema until the credits you will notice that it says 'based of the 1984 film ghostbusters'. this movie had some good humour and an interesting character combination that causes some friction between the team. I also liked how they sneaked in characters from the original including: Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Sigourney Weaver, Ernie Hudson and Annie Potts. there where also a few hints to the original movie such as the original ghostbusters HQ and them getting fired from their first place of work and then going on to a different HQ. there where a few downsides though. firstly in my opinion i would have liked to see them catch a few more ghosts before the big boss fight, end of the world scene at the end. I also would have liked to have seen Kevin fight some ghosts and be more of a part of the team instead of just rocking up in the uniform and then getting possessed. all in all it was a very enjoyable movie that kept me hooked the whole time. i Just think people need to get over the fact that it is a girl team and rate it for the actual movie and story instead of just it not being a male ghostbusters team.</fullReview>

But hey, EVERYBODY knew it would be like this. Most originals are just immortal classics that can never be matched. (e.g. the Terminator series or indiana Jones) I doubt even the old cast could have re-created that same old feeling old feeling.

		<shortDescription>So much better than I thought it would be!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite what all these nasty reviews may say, I went into the movie expecting the worst and coming out realizing it was better then the original by a long shot. I grew up watching the originals and seeing an all female reboot idea at first scared me: I thought it would stray from the original and make it a disaster. To my absolute pleasure there was no complaining from me at all. The cast was perfect: it was a close enough replicate of the original (I particularly was fond of Kate Mckinnons character Jillian Holtzmann) the jokes were funny and the CGI wasn't terrible at all, (If you can have the opportunity to watch it in 3D is it particularly good, slime everywhere!) The two boys I went with enjoyed it just as much as me, and they were fanatics of the original as well. The cameos were incredible, and I thought the villain was interesting and very realistic. It was incredible to see the two sides of neglect: those who make the most of it and those who let it cloud them. The heroes and the villain were excellent examples of both. It helped me realize that maybe my favorite childhood movie wasn't as good as I thought, and these talented women definitely stole the show. It was by far the best movie I have seen this year! I would definitely recommend the movie to anyone not clouded by what some random idiot fanboy on Reddit says: go into it with an unbiased opinion and it won't fail you! Fingers crossed that sequel comes sooner rather then later!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome reboot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the men who felt the need to cry over the YouTube trailer are just going to have to keep crying, because this movie was awesome (and admittedly, the trailer doesn't do it justice). It was super funny and did a good job balancing being its own film with its own plot and characters and paying homage to the original. The four leads (yes, they're all women - oh, no!) are phenomenal, especially Kate McKinnon, who is just so lovably weird. I also loved that of the four women, three were scientists and none of them had a romantic story line. The theater I saw it in in New York was sold out and the audience was loving it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>i've seen this film twice and i would see it again it's that good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>honestly, this is one of the best remakes i've seen! though considering jurassic world that's not a difficult list to top. irregardless, this film was so much better than i expected! the characters all have wonderful chemistry and friendships, the jokes are genuinely hilarious and just as character-driven as the original ghostbusters. the effects look great and man, those visuals... such great cinematography! and not to mention the soundtrack! i would recommend this film just for the soundtrack, to be quite honest.the film definitely holds up just as well the second time; i laughed just as much at the jokes. however, there were a few scenes and lines that probably weren't really needed and could have been switched with one of the deleted scenes. but aside from that, i really have no complaints.so feel free to take this review from a person who actually watched the film multiple times, rather than most of the reviews of this film that have been written by sad misogynistic MRAs who haven't even seen the film and are offended that for once men aren't front and centre, as an indication that this is a fantastic film you should DEFINITELY add to your watch list.an overall enjoyable experience!! i totally recommend this film to everyone</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's pretty original for a remake. I'm giving this a 10 to outweighed the unnecessary bashing this film is taking right now. Really it's an 8.5, but definitely better and less cheesy than the original, in my opinion. Is it perfect? No. Is it highly entertaining? Absolutely. You'd have to be soulless to NOT laugh during the thing. All the performances were top notch and the story was great. The ladies really gave it their all. Loved all the nods, homages, cameos and Easter eggs that gave tribute to the original. The jokes were laugh out loud funny. Wiig and McCarthy need to do many more movies together. Kate McKinnon is a revelation. Get this woman her own comedy franchise already!! Only ding really is that Leslie Jones wasn't used to her full potential which was disappointing as that woman is the funniest person on the planet right now. I adore her. Loved the ending and really hope we get that sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came for the laughs, I stayed for the man tears. I raise my pinkie in the air to all micro-P's who hate this movie. Sorry the prom queen turned you down in high school, but you're going to have to eventually get over it. Paul Feig is a genius. I have yet to see one of his movies and not laugh my butt off. Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy a comic gold. I could watch them paint a house. I'm really looking forward to Ghostbusters 2: Man Tears, which I believe is slated to be released in 2018. Gonna be so great. But seriously though, the whole theater was laughing, and while this is a ridiculous premise of a movie, it still entertained and made me laugh. The best part about this movie is that it's going to make a crap load of money and mostly because of the MRM cry babies who drummed up press for it. Once again, their childish behavior has laid the ground work for this movie to become so popular that there will now be a sequel. Nicely done, ya dumb puppets. Haha</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best reboots in a while</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just gotten home after watching this film and I'm fairly certain I haven't been this excited after watching a movie in a while.I grew up watching the Ghostbusters when I was a kid. I've seen the movies more times than I'd like to admit. Probably know more about them than I should and more than a casual viewer would. When I found out they were making a reboot of the films, I was a little nervous. On the upside, there was going to be an all female cast, giving much needed representation to the barren wasteland that is women in Hollywood, but these movies were dear to me and it is rare when a reboot lives up to the original. I was understandably skeptical. What if it wasn't good enough? Let me put your mind at ease. It was better than anything I could have asked for. These days remakes of old film franchises are a dime a dozen but it is really rare when a reboot so perfect captures what the original was. The new Ghostbusters absolutely delivers in that regard. It was humorous, a little cheesy, and full of little cameos/easter eggs that nodded to the original first movie.The cast was great! In terms of decent female representation, I was a starving women and this movie was a perfectly crafted feast that I couldn't get enough of. The main characters all fit well together and seemed to have a lot of chemistry between them. There was no shoe-horned romantic subplot, no sexualization of any of the characters, and holy cow, let me tell you about that great body diversity between our four leading ladies. This alone could have been enough for me, but it gets better.Campy effects and a style that is based wholly around the original had me absolutely in love. The the 80's aesthetic gadgets that were all flashing lights and overly pretty for the sake of it warmed my heart. The CGI wasn't /meant/ to be believable. It was based entirely around giving a modern update to the Ghostbusters style. Which does /not/ include realism at all. This isn't the Dark Knight. It's not Lord of the Rings. It's not serious. None of these movies have /ever/ been serious.I think that when it comes to modern film there is a high demand for realistic completely logical stories to the point that we've forgotten how to just have fun. The new Ghostbusters is a breath of fresh air that I welcome. Not everything has to make me cry. Not every movie has to be some epic drama. This movie made me grin and laugh and on the way home my friend and I couldn't shut up about all of the things we loved about it. I fully intend to see it again while it's still in theaters. Heck, I wanted to see it again the minute the credits started to roll.It seems to me that a lot of the negative reviews are from people expecting this to be something other than what Ghostbusters has ever been. I can only hope that a few very vocal sexist don't deter this movie from getting the kind of attention it deserves.Be sure to stay for the after the credits scene!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to write this review after reading all this bigotry and bickering... Let's be real and honest with ourselves and these times, this is a regular movie like almost all the ones that are coming out on these days: same old jokes, same dialogues, same commercial entertainment, period. So yes, you can comfortably watch it at home like the 99.5% of all movies, but then again: What did you expect?Moreover, this gender or feminist and macho discussions just demonstrate how BLIND most people are about almost anything in present time. How is it possible to write or talk about sexism, "bashing men", and so on when 99.5% of the movies nowadays are sexists but all the way around discarding and objectifying women, we're living in a MEN's world, no surprise here why this movie is getting all the whining hate. What about Batman vs Superman or else? I guess it was great for most of these "critics" here. Ja! Come on, wake up people!Just get over it and keep watching the action movies with tons of visual effects and 3D, it's "better than this one", yeah right! Ja...Is so funny all this hypocrisy and blindness...Enjoy your society and this movie, LOL!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Enjoyable Film (Read Before Hating)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So last night i saw the New Ghostbusters Reboot to the 1984 classic Ghostbusters. The Marketing for this Reboot has been getting lots of backlash and the trailers were't doing anything and there was still hate to this Reboot. And what did i thought... I Actually enjoyed the movie and i'm just gonna talk little about the cast members of the film. Kristen Wigg i always found her a good actress she's funny and she went for a more realistic role for the film. Melissa McCarthy she was in some funny movies like Spy and The Heat but there are some movies like Tammy where she comes out as annoying But in this movie she turned it down and it was way better in my opinion Kate McKinnon was like this goofy type character and i thought it was interesting. Leslie Jones i don't know much about here but in the movie she had a Meh Performance and Chris Hemsworth is in this movie and he honestly is quite hilarious in the film. He's like a funny dumb guy and i liked his Performance in the film. This Movie does it's own interpretation of the 1984 Ghostbusters and i thought it worked well. Some of the jokes i laughed at but some of them weren't funny. BTW i saw this movie in 3D and it's spectacular Ghosts popping out the screen and everything it's cool to watch. The CGI was lazy at some points and CGI Ghosts that actually look cool. I Know this movie will get hate reviews and some might hate me for enjoying the movie but whatever</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember waiting in line for hours to watch the original Ghostbusters movie in 1984. The queue snaked down the streets, that music by Ray Parker Jnr played endlessly and the famous logo was plastered all over the cinema. It was almost a phenomenon back then. It comes as no surprise then that it has been targeted by the Hollywood remake machine.This time we have some gender reversals with the Ghostbusters crew all played by women. Melissa McCarthy steals the show but is well supported by her co-stars including Kristen Wiig, both of whom worked together on Bridesmaids in 2011. There's a bit too much of Bridesmaids' Annie in Wiig's performance but that's just a minor niggle. I spent the first 15 minutes trying to work out who was the Venkman, Spengler and Stantz equivalent, which of course they are, but it really doesn't matter. The gender reversal continues with Chris Hemsworth being cast as the hapless receptionist. The mighty Thor as a receptionist? No longer Annie Potts' aggressive and overworked Janine but instead Hemsworth as a moronic character who barely knows how to answer a telephone.The story is similar to the original with a few twists and changes. Gone are ancient destroyer gods and demonic dogs in fridges and instead we have a human bad guy. This makes little difference to the story but perhaps doesn't make the ending quite as satisfying. The story doesn't have the originality of the 1984 version and that is where it suffers, you know what to expect. If you haven't seen the original, this probably isn't an issue. The special effects are updated (obviously) and we have some new gadgets for ghost-busting that are largely pointless but do raise a laugh.This is a movie that really doesn't take itself seriously. It goes straight for comedy from the onset with quirky one-liners and a fun, straight-forward story. Hemsworth pokes fun at his own macho image and there are laughs aplenty. The movie has been panned by critics and it certainly isn't Oscar material but it really isn't that bad. It's a total homage to the original and there are so many cameos, it's like a reunion. If you want a couple of hours of fun with an easy-to-watch movie, or you're a fan of the original, then this is worth a try, it's a fun ride. You could do a lot worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent, Exceeded expectations.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a summer blockbuster, what did people expect? I have been a lifelong ghostbusters fan, I grew up with the first two movies and I go as far as to collect Ghostbusters action figures, props, shirts, video games, you name it. Don't go in with the expectation that this movie will ruin your childhood and that it will tarnish the legacy, because then you won't find ANYTHING good about this film, because nothing can compare to memory, to what you loved growing up, the nostalgia aspects. So I didn't. I came in with an open mind. Kristen Wig was great, she is just a perfect fit for the rest of the team, she just gets along great with everybody, she actually was responsible for a big laugh or two. Next is Jenny McCarthy, now here was the only member I had trouble with, ALL of her jokes fell flat, not one got a laugh from the audience, and she didn't really make an effort to stand out, she was really just there, they needed a household name, I think ghostbusters is all about showcasing the talent, and so here Melissa didn't need to stand out much because she already has a very big following. Whereas, the other three I think had more emphasis on them to do just that, showcase themselves. Kate McKinnon was decent, but her non sequitur weren't really as funny as they were supposed to be, she filled the token "technical genius" of the crew, just like Donatello in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, or Egon in the 1984 original. She was there more for the kids obviously, you kind of need a more zany out there type for kids to latch onto as the fan favorite, which is what she was sort of being pushed as. Leslie Jones I know has been harassed enough about the role and that honestly makes me sick, I thought she did a fantastic job, she was probably my favorite, the character has knowledge of her own, I thought she transcended the racial emphasis of the role, to the best of her ability. Now the actress did a great job, however the writers needed to lay off of this character, they did give her many loud mouthed moments and they gave her some lines that honestly made me cringe. Now while the actresses individually more or less did good jobs, as a team, it DID tend to fall apart at times. There would be moments where they are all together in a room, struggling to get a team-like feel going, but honestly the chemistry just was not there most of the time, in fact, sometimes it would get so bad, that I would just zone out for a bit, the movie just paused on these scenes with the team, and it would put the entire film on hold. The story, however, was honestly TERRIBLE. The villain especially, was just god awful. He couldn't have spelled it out anymore, he just could not have indicated that he was the villain any more loudly, from the MOMENT I saw this guy, I KNEW he was the villain. The actor too was REALLYbad, and he was just as one dimensional in person and as transparent as the terrible CGI Ghosts. Speaking of the battling, a LOT was really really terrible. The big face off at the end just could not hold my interest, even with all of the new gadgets that are supposed to bring variety could not make up for it, the ghost fighting was just soulless, it made you wonder how they got that skilled with the equipment without any scenes indicating that they trained with it or ANYTHING. There was a scene where Kate McKinnon's character introduces it, they all test it, of course to comedic effect, without any grip on the equipment, it proved to be too much for them. So then, it goes to the end of the movie, you forgot the equipment was even brought up, the scene was so Rushed, and now here they are just taking out hordes of ghosts with it. There was just no patience for the journey of becoming a better team, it felt really empty. Lastly, Chris Hemsworth was great, he just put me in a great mood, he was of course a really bad stereotype, but that smile though, it can really deceive you. I applaud them for knowing that much, getting a guy as like able as him to extinguish the fire a little bit. Overral, typical summer blockbuster, don't let it ruin ghostbusters for you, that's your own fault. I think it's ridiculous how everyone on IMDb has to give this movie a 1 rating just because, "uhhh it's bad". Find some good in the bad you morons, this isn't the worst movie ever made, far from it. Everyone just seems to love to jump to the gun on that "1" rating, so please, if you're reading this, give it at least a 4, because this movie isn't a 1. 6/10 IGN Mates</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well... I liked it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked it. There I said it. I enjoyed it... and a lot too.I'll qualify this by saying I like the original Ghostbusters movies and have seen them many times... but I would never say I loved those movies. So for me, there was always the potential for a reboot/remake to be just as enjoyable, if not more so.And in some ways... this one is better, IMHO. I think it's more consistently funny than the originals were. I enjoyed the cameos by the old Ghostbusters... as well as the appearances by other famous actors. I thought the new Ghostbusters had good chemistry together. The story was fun. The threat, while in the "spirit" of the original films, isn't a straight-up copy of anything from the previous 2 movies. Yes, it is borrowing (sometimes heavily) from the originals in some places (it is supposed to be a Ghostbusters film, after all)... but not in a way that made me dislike the film... or wish it were the old gang back.In the end, I'd go see a sequel. I might even go see this one again. I'll certainly pick it up on blu-ray when it comes out. No movie is perfect (certainly not the original Ghostbusters movies)... and this one isn't either. But IMHO, it's not anywhere near as bad as some people say it is. As I said, I enjoyed it.If you go in with an open mind... you might find you enjoy it too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not sure why ONLY the people who gave this movie a bad rating have reviews showing. Where are reviews from those who loved the movie? Come on people, let's see some words for those who liked it - you are out there - many gave this a great rating (but didn't write a review).I loved the movie! I saw the original and loved that too, but had a great time watching this one. It had a great cast of women and they were each funny in their own unique way. So great to see a film with women in the lead roles! This was fun and funny and engaging. When I looked at overall ratings from women vs men, it was the men who gave this film a bad rating (not all men :). But come on bros, give up the male-has-to-be lead concept and/or the attachment to the original "Ghostbusters." Most women gave it a great rating. I am sure the movie has its flaws, most do, but overall this was a fun ride, with some funny and talented women that kept me interested the whole time. Even my daughter really liked it and she is very, very picky, especially about comedy. I also enjoyed the special effects - technology has advanced a lot since the original. And I loved all the cameos with the actors from the original "Ghostbusters." And all the other shout-outs from the original.So, I seem to be alone, not on giving the movie a high rating, but on giving it a positive public review. I invite others to do the same. It was great fun with talented actors and was a summer joy ride I am glad I didn't miss. I LOVED IT!! (so, there you naysayers :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie of 2016</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was amazing. Everything about it was beautiful and perfect. I'll never be this happy walking out of a movie ever again. The movie prioritized female friendship and that was really wonderful to see in a major action blockbuster. It also highlighted how women are seen as crackpots and treated badly by male colleagues, the press, etc. I loved the original?I grew up with Ghostbusters, both as movies and as TV shows. This is a different movie from the original, but it is JUST AS GOOD. I was so delighted to see so many of the original cast members?and the nod to the late Harold Ramis. I could really feel that they enjoyed taking part in a new re-envisioning of the classic original movie.More importantly, the new cast absolutely KILLED IT. The comedy was spot on and Kate McKinnon stole every scene she was in. This is a Ghostbusters for 2016, not 1984, and it was perfect to me.</fullReview>

It will never be the cult classic like the original movie, but this is not a copy, nor a rip off of that. It is taking the idea and movie further, and in to the future (today).

		<fullReview>I honestly made an account purely so I could review this movie. I loved it. Was it a deep, complex plot? No. Was it fun and enjoyable to watch? Yes. All four women were hilarious to me in different ways, but Kate McKinnon should probably be in every movie - any time she was on screen I knew I'd be laughing. The movie had a simple plot, yes, but I was thoroughly entertained, and for a summer movie, it's exactly what I was looking for. What hurts me is all of the 1 star reviews. This didn't have to be your favorite movie by any means, but only 1 star?? Give it a little credit, don't just try to be dramatic. It seems like some people have a really hard time backing a movie with a mostly female cast and felt that the males were cast as "dumb" objects only there for their looks. If that doesn't feel right to you, perhaps you should look again how women are often portrayed as objects or dumb in media. It happens all. the. time.As for how it compares to the original, I find it best to not compare reboots like this to the first. I really enjoy the original, but this movie has it's own take on things while still being in the same "universe". It's like the new Planet of the Apes movies, the idea is there, but they are not trying to be a copy of the original, and both remain good movies in their different ways.The good thing about movie reviews is that they are all just someone else's opinion. Form an opinion for yourself - if the movie seems appealing to you, go see it. Be your own person with your own opinions. Mine is that I loved this movie and plan on seeing it again. Loved the cast, fun summer movie!</fullReview>

So much better than the pets or dory movie I had also had to sit through this summer. we will be seeing this again with the nieces next weekend and I am looking forward to it this time. The theatre was packed with a healthy mix of adults and older kids, everybody seemed to really enjoy it, so it gets an easy recommendation as having general age appeal for a group movie. Special mention: It was nice to see Bill Murray, he never gets old, as the saying goes. Same for the other original cast member cameos. and fans of the original will have fun with the abundance of Easter eggs sprinkled throughout the movie- surprising how many the kids picked up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have been a fan of the originals for ages but actually enjoyed this reboot more! The jokes were constant and very funny, and the leads were excellent. Kate Mckinnon's character Jillian Holtzmann was a personal favourite There was an excellent balance between the scary/suspenseful elements and the comic, which kept up the tension. The slower moments provided useful backstory for the lead characters which I am hoping will be used in sequels. Chris Hemsworth obviously enjoyed his role, and it is lovely to watch someone enjoying themselves so much. I was not fully convinced by the trailer but they had saved all the best moments for the film, making it a very worth while cinema trip. There were the expected cameos - Bill Murray with a larger role, but a very nice one from Dan Ackroyd, showing that the original cast obviously had fun with this reboot as well. I am very much looking forward to repeat viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Devil Is A Lie" Now I am so upset for listening to these backwards uninformative critics I delayed in taking my 9 yo. Daughter to see the new unveiling of the Ghostbusters but boy once the movie started I had a delightful adventure for the entire movie. Now every name as you already know is a big name in this movie so speaking about any comedic genius or acting credits specifically I will not do. What I will do is lay out the format of a great movie just a little bit and speak on how the new squad worked marvelous together. The movie is hilarious from the start the cutey Kristen Wiig kicks it off with her usual laugh out loud comedy antics and The story line is her weening over becoming a tenured professor at a prestigious academic University the funny situation which I won't express brings her into contact with an old friend who is Melissa McCarthy and her new colleague Kate McKinnon with seemingly crackpot inventions at a run down 2 bit science school that gives them the boot. Soon after there first run in with the first ghost which the special effects of everything I really do not even have to speak of because just knowing the original movie in the 80's was superb, Of course that part of the 2016 movie is not lacking with a $144 mil budget. Once they secure a secretary played by the prettyboy Chris Hemsworth who managed to put idiocy on a whole new level and get a call that leads them to Leslie Jones the last Ghostbuster there's no denying the new ghostbusters have a camera charisma that is a style all of their own and all of them different but beautiful in their own right along with being hilarious as a team. Even bringing back the cameos of my favorites and the original ghostbusters except for 1 was a good mix and spread out through out the whole movie, But no cameo appearance out did the main characters which was a plus. Also I should mention Every commercial or trailer scene was not in the movie there were many more funnier scenes they did not show.Now the score of the movie in the very beginning they played the original tune for the Ghostbusters and it was a good introduction to getting us back into the ecto plasma vibe of the 80's, But by the time we were rolling with the new busters jazzing it up and bringing us up to speed 30 yrs. later was a very good new rendition or new arrangement of the old song which started to play about a half hour later. Some critics said that it was a hack or a bad song which is totally not true, it's not like an anthem that the original was, But The New song has a great beat, Good arrangement, Amazing male singing vocals and a quick sample of a female rapping nicely or as I would say a good flow. Now I myself am a professional rap artist who does it for a living and I have been creating music for just over two decades and I liked the song. Now the artists on this song that I am speaking about were Fallout boy &amp; Missy Elliot I don't know the numbers exactly but I think between the two they may have sold over 10 million records combined I think it's a pretty safe bet to say they know what they are doing. Now there is maybe a couple jokes that may not strike everyone the same but that's what a good diversity of comedy is supposed to do and if it's not funny to you then you just may not be as cool as most of us and that's OK your a critic it's not your job to be cool because I understand we are all not equally spread with the same circumstances in life to give us the same reactions to different situations but when I watch the fault in our stars I love that movie for the mindset it puts me in for they're circumstances even if I don't have cancer or a life threatening illness. My life's circumstances are not the end all be all and yours shouldn't be either. As for me this movie hit the mark.There was a scene that was a lot better in the trailer because they cut a scene for commercial purposes to make seem more funny when Kristen was in the restaurant at the end speaking to the mayor it wasn't set up the same way on the movie so that was a scene which should of been way more hilarious but was wasted. All in all the pace the premise the persistent placement of folly and parodys were all plausible in a ghostly world that's a family friendly film. I hope they do well enough to succeed financially from such a big budget I really would like to see a part 2. It Definitely lived up to its potential and I give it 9 out of 10 stars..

		<shortDescription>I Needed Movies Like this Sooner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this film and had it been around when I was growing up I would have listened to my dad and become an engineer. Although i still love my history (I relate to Patty on a deep level knowing how and when and where people die and such), I feel like instead of completely living and dwelling on the past to make sure it doesn't repeat itself, I could use creativity to fuel inventing a new future. My dad, who has encouraged me to pursue engineering all my life (lots of opportunities being a Hispanic woman), loves this idea. I will be taking my younger sister to see the film soon. I love Holtzman. She's weird and awkward and genuine. Another thing, this movie celebrates friendship. A friend mentioned to me that in group movies like this the group breaks up. Although at times you suspect this is going to inevitably happen, it doesn't. When things get rough, the girls stay together and work through things. This movie is a testament to how far Hollywood has advanced, though they still have a lot to work on. I know the world is kind of a mess right now. Despite this look around, at how lucky we are to be alive right now. I know that someday, my daughters will be far more encouraged than I to truly find their place in this world and to follow their dreams and kick ass and be kind and friendly to their fellow woman (and men).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Ghostbusters' isn't worth all the controversy. It's a harmless and all and all a pretty decent matinée summer movie. It isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination as it has problems that tend to plague remakes of iconic films but conceptually it takes a lot more chances than a lot of remakes do. I enjoyed it a lot.The main problem with 'Ghostbusters' is that there are times when Paul Feig just doesn't succeed in his homages. The film has some very annoying things in it's attempts to have fun with the 'Ghostbusters' iconography. For starters there isn't a single good remix of the original theme song and we get a lot of remixes. I get that the song is so classic but it's used in silly ways that sort of lose the intended nostalgic effect. Feig should have Saved the song and used it as originally performed in the grand finale. Also I can't get over Slimer's girlfriend. She is pretty grotesque. The good news is that this is a very funny film. As far as remakes go 'Ghostbusters' is one of the most original. That is the main take away here. This film has it's own distinct personality and world. It's tone is noticeably completely different from the original film. It doesn't have that dry sense of humor as it goes for very big and outlandish characters and set pieces. It also has a great deal more physical humor. And so the biggest so called complaint about it ruining the original film is pretty much completely null and void as this is a completely different approach to the same set up.I feel as if I cannot review the film without mentioning one my take on the controversy behind it. And so the one missed opportunity is even the writers couldn't be aware of the horrible people that were going to whine about it. The main villain of the movie is a socially awkward nerd trying to use ghosts as a means of revenge for being a socially awkward nerd. It's a real shame they didn't have the foresight to make him a caricature of the &#x202a;#&#x200e;Gamergate&#x202c;/MRA crowd that thinks this movie is the end of the world. It would have given the movie more of an edge and made those losers even more furious)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Upon watching the trailer, I was skeptical. If not for a friend who is a big fan of the franchise, I might have skipped it until it was available via streaming.I'm very glad I went.The film is extraordinarily well done, each of the main roles delightfully rendered by an outstanding cast.I grew up with the original movies, iconic and quotable pieces of the pop culture of my childhood. I expected a ham-fisted attempt to shoehorn what we loved about the original in to a modern franchise reboot; a shameless money-grab.What I saw was not that at all. I saw a cast that was as in love with their characters and the premise of the film as the original cast was. I saw a story carefully crafted. Yes, the pacing is different, and no, it's not the same story, but there would have been no fun in a repeat of the past. This film picks a direction and revels in it. It takes the mantle of the original and rather than just trotting around in it, it makes it its own.If you're a fan of the originals, they're still out there for you to watch. This is the movie that will bring in new fans. New fans curious about the older films who will seek them out and compare and contrast not just the movies, but the cultures that created both.My only complaint was the soft target of the villain in this outing, but after a discussion with others, I find that another interesting point... they've detached the origin story and presented it on its own, and then hinted at taking on the original plot line in the next outing... an outing which will have its entire run time devoted to that plot line without having to stop for the origin story along the way.Let's just say I'm eagerly awaiting the sequel.Thank you to the cast and crew of Ghostbusters (2016), you surprised and delighted me.</fullReview>

This movie is hilarious -- some of the jokes were so funny that I missed the dialogue following them because the whole theater was laughing so hard. It inspired actual applause from basically the entire theater. The characters are well developed, with clear and compelling motivations. The jokes are genuinely funny and don't ever punch down -- no cheap fat jokes or racist jokes. The women behave like actual people instead of like stick figures with guns. If you're interested in seeing women in movies who aren't there to be eye candy or caught up in a romantic subplot, this is your film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came to this movie to be entertained and I got what I came for! I can see this movie becoming another classic in my library, the kind of movie I won't get bored watching multiple times. The cast are great and likable. The ladies felt realer than real, felt like actual everyday people rather than an overused walking trope (I think I know someone just like Holtz in college haha). Kevin is a superstar too lol I love Chris Hemsworth in it - he's such a puppy. The final fight scene is cool. My favorite part has to be the final fight against the pilgrims ghosts. I especially love the after credit scene, got me hyped up for a sequel! There's a lot of nods to the classic too, makes me smile when I spot any one of the easter eggs.The villain was OK - he's not that interesting to be honest. His 'manifesto' reflects a lot of what entitled 'nice guys' dudebros think, which was quite funny on its own way lol.The ending was a bit anti-climatic though, I wish they got more recognition from the officials (or they just tell the officials to suck it and deal with their own problems) I'd give it 8/10 but I'll put it as 10/10 to balance the bad reviews from people who think the old Ghostbusters are somehow a perfect masterpiece that may not be changed in any way, shape or form.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Formulaic and Enjoyable addition to the Franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I'd like to open this with a reminder: Ghostbusters films are not produced to win Academy Awards. They're not produced to top the charts with the most incredible special effects that CGI can produce. They're not produced to be record-breaking box-office cash cows. When you try to hold a modern rebooted rendition of anything (music, film, book) to it's original; you're setting yourself up for immediate and immense disappointment. So from this point forward I will not be drawing comparisons to the originals. This movie can stand alone without having to struggle out of the shadows of the original films.Ghostbusters 2016 introduces the audience to the typical four- flavored team of individuals hungry to prove themselves, validate their work, and most of all- validate themselves in a world that consistently overlooks them. Holtzman was the most welcome of the four with her quirky, outlandish, and dryly sarcastic humor, but Erin and Abbey anchor the quartet with a mixture of fun, awkward humor and dry wit. Patty is the necessary injection of realism in an otherwise heady group of scientists with their heads in the clouds and their sights set too far towards the horizon.True to the Ghostbusters formula, you mix a cast of varying appeals, styles of humor, and ambitions into a skeptical dog-eat-dog world where a delightfully cheesy, over-the-top reprobate of a villain is attempting to unleash the apocalypse upon the city. Add in the expected stylized special effects for the ghosts and city-wide catastrophe, our Ecto-1, and an immensely difficult uphill battle to reclaim the city while throwing out witty one-liners, sarcastic quips, and you have yourself a Ghostbusters film. True to its franchise, it expresses itself in an over-done way of comedy and humor slammed into an unrealistic city-wide end-of-world scenario and garnished with special effects, the array of expected equipment, and even splashes in a few modern pop culture references to keep it cohesive and consistent with today.You'll see many familiar faces, and a couple of tributes to those that were no longer with us in the franchise. Keep a look out for the numerous homages paid to the original films, because they're there in abundance. Overall, Ghostbusters had me laughing, smiling, grinning, and even yelping out loud with the other moviegoers around me for a couple of the playful jump scares. As an avid fan of the original films, and a fan of its newest installment, I would challenge and recommend anyone who has reservations to give it a chance. Lower the unrealistic expectations. We have seen some terrible reboots, yes. But we've also seen some great ones.Give it a chance, you'll be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Summary: this is not the best comedy I've ever seen, but it's decent. I don't regret spending the money on it and would consider watching a sequel. This is not an intellectual or cinematic masterpiece; it's goofy and knows it. Don't expect an immersive drama and you'll be fine.Pros:+ Good initial setup+ Holtzman (one of the main characters) is fantastic+ Decent humor sprinkled throughout the movie+ Kevin (the receptionist) is brilliantly executedCons:- The character Patty is something of a racial stereotype- Individual characters are relatively uninteresting (for those moments where the movie tries to be anything other than a comedy)- A couple of the jokes are puerile rather than funny- Special effects are okay, but not amazing (though I didn't much care)A note: there seem to be a lot of reviews with complaints about sexual discrimination against men in this movie. There really isn't any to speak of.One comic relief character is a moron, the government officials are inept, and the heroes turn out to have been right all along. I have no idea why anyone would expect anything else from a movie advertised to be light on plot and heavy on humor. There is a single joke with any hint of sexist hostility throughout the movie, and it's a one-liner in the movie's epilogue. As for the four Ghostbusters being women: that should, on balance, happen in one out of every 16 movies featuring four main characters. If anything, it needs to happen more often; we've got some catching up to do.Also, it doesn't matter but I'll mention it here for anyone who thinks it does: this review's author sports his fair share of Y chromosomes.</fullReview>

Not only does the film boast an excellent cast, but the plot is engaging, the ghosts and gadgets impressive, and the cameos abundant. The only thing I would change is the terrible pop punk cover of the original Ghostbusters song which played during the credits. Anyone who hates this film is absolutely no fun. I ain't afraid of no misogynist. P.S: Chris Hemsworth isn't as hilarious as everyone keeps assuring us. It's all about Kate McKinnon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun, entertaining movie for WOMEN. Not as bad as men online say.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is just like Jurassic World. It's a modern take on the original with dream-come-true visuals, hardcore action, and lots of fun references to the original movie. It's not perfect, and it's not excellent, but it's fun and refreshing, as long as you watch it with an open mind. What does that mean? Well, if you're a man, in particular, you just have to accept that this movie was not meant for you. It will not, in any way, try to please you or appeal to you, aside from visuals and action. It's very outright about being for women and trying to review this movie with the mindset of simply comparing it to what the original did for you as a movie targeted toward men will ruin the movie for you. It's an open-minded movie that you need to be open-minded to as well. Otherwise, while some parts are a bit awkward, the villain is plain and stock (though is interestingly the only outright sexist character in the movie), it's a fun, cool movie that does a good enough job of taking the universe to the modern age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like any good carnival ride, the minute this was over, I wanted to jump right back on and see it again!The chemistry between the all-female cast is sheer gold?their delivery and ad libs are hilarious. Did it revamp some parts of the original? no more or less so than any remake. It was fun to see the echoes of the original and see a modern spin on them (I am still laughing at the in-joke about renting a former firehouse and the real estate prices in Manhattan!) Special shout out to Kate McKinnon who steals every scene she's in?a mix of Egon AND Tank Girl. And you know what? It made me feel like a kid again, a kid that didn't have smart ass-kicking non-hypersexualized women to make me say "I wanna be like them!" But in this movie I was a 10 year old girl who wants to dye and cut and perm her hair like Kate McKinnon and take up electrical engineering.Now, imagine all those little girls who are gonna feel that way.One last note: the villain is a troll who tries to use the excuse HE was bullied for his antisocial behavior. And the nerd-girl Ghostbusters are like "yeah, so were we", but they didn't become trolls. And that, kiddos, is some serious sexual politics right there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well I Laughed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sony really needs to think about firing the team who marketed this movie. Ghostbusters starring Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones, Chris Hemsworth, and directed by Paul Feig. The reboot to the 80's classic tells the story of two scientist who wrote a book about paranormal activity, but then went separate ways. One went the respectable route, Erin played by Kristen Wiig. While the other, Abby, played by Mellissa McCarthy continued to try and prove the existence of Ghosts. Fate brings them together once again when they encounter a Ghost, and then must try to prove what they saw is real. Does this sound similar to the original Ghostbusters? It doesn't because it isn't. The film tells a new story with new characters and does a good job in doing it. The trailers for this movie had me worried. They seemed not to tell an original story and looked to have many of the same beats from the original movie. It looked like they had a library ghost scene. They used the same lines from the first film. They showed the fire station the first team used as a base in the first trailer. What this film actually does is tell a new story with new characters. While it doesn't work perfectly, it is entertaining and stands on its own. I don't understand why the marketing team who promoted this movie decided to try and rely on nostalgia from the original movies to drum up excitement. It backfired in a most spectacular way. There is a fine line with not giving too much story away in trailers and getting people excited to see the movie. They should have relied more on the differences this movie had from the original instead of its similarities. The characters are all new and different from the first cast. Kristen Wiig does a good job in playing the straight laced up tight scientist. She is funny in the film and most of her jokes hit. Mellissa McCarthy does well with her role. Paul Feig seems to always get the best most reigned in performances from McCarthy, and does so again in Ghostbusters. I loved Kate Mckinnon's crazy nut job scientist Holtzman, but she is going to be polarizing. Either you are going to love what she does or hate it. I don't think everything she did worked, but most of it did. I was most worried with Leslie Jones in her role, but she was funny, and wasn't as over the top as she seemed to be in the trailers. I do wish they would have made her some type of scientist. The show stealer for me was Chris Hemsworth who played the receptionist for the new business. He was fantastic. Every joke he had made me laugh. He had great comedic timing. I even liked what they did with him in the third act of the film, but it was one of the only things story wise that stood out in the end of the movie. The story falls apart at the end of the film. The motivations for the main villain are not explored enough to be clear, and the ending feels rushed. There is also major chunks missing from the last part of the movie. It is painfully obvious a major scene or two is missing from the last third of the movie, but there is supposed to be a director's cut of the film. I'm not sure why they would have cut these scenes unless it would have pushed the movie to R status. I would be surprised if what was cut would have pushed that particular barrier. I'm not sure if adding a few of these scene back would have fixed the final part of the movie, but I think it would have helped. I liked the setup the story was going for in the first part of the film, but it goes off the rails at the end. I did however enjoy many of the ghost fight scenes found in the last part of the movie. Holtzman in particular has a fantastic fight and all of the new toys she creates in the film get put to great use. I liked the CG Ghost in the film. Many probably won't, but I thought they looked great, and where used well throughout the movie. The ghost fighting scenes are some of the best parts of the film and this with most of the comedy made Ghostbusters a treat to watch. It is far from a perfect film with the way they tell the story and the constant cameos jammed in the movie. They could have done away with the Bill Murry character and a few others and the movie would have been improved. I get having the cameos, the characters created just don't fit the tone of the film, and they all stand out instead of fit into the movie. This being said I liked the film. It was enjoyable and I could see myself watching it again. I for one never hated the idea of a new Ghostbusters movie. I did wish they would have made it connected to the originals, but I was okay with a reboot. I was just happy to get more Ghostbusters, which is something I had been wanting since the second film was released. Nothing is going to ruin my enjoyment of the first two films. The first is close to perfect, and I still really enjoy the second. So maybe it's not surprising that I enjoyed this one. I think the film is Worth Seeing, and worth seeing multiple times. I know many don't agree, but if you give it a chance I think you can enjoy the new imaging.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly Delightful and Fiercely Charming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Look, I get it -- when you really love something, it becomes untouchably brilliant. You don't want anyone messing with it. I GET THAT. I grew up on Ghostbusters - loved the movies, the music, the cartoon. When someone stole my Real Ghostbusters lunchbox at school, I was gutted.Having said all that, the negative backlash surrounding the reboot was ridiculous and uncalled for - and as it turns out, all that crying and complaining and cowardly bullying looks sillier than ever now that the movie's out. Turns out that Ghostbusters 2016 is pretty darn good! Is it the 1984 original? No, and (other than a few callbacks and familiar tributes) it doesn't try to be.The premise is the same -- four quirky characters band together to save New York from supernatural mayhem. There are plenty of ghosts, sure, but the true focus of the movie is on the bond that grows between the main characters, and that's a theme that works for both gals and guys. These women watch out for another; they'd do anything for each other, and that friendship is fiercely charming (and surprisingly realistic in a movie about the paranormal!).One of the biggest steps forward from the original is how physically demanding Ghostbusting is in 2016. Remember when the guys puffed up all those stairs in Dana's apartment building? I'm not sure they could've kept up in some of the supernatural tussles the ladies get into.And how great was Holtzmann's effervescent, giddy joy over each new piece of equipment she invented? Actually, how great was Holtzmann herself? Kate McKinnon is the obvious standout in the cast, dancing and deadpanning her way through Holtzmann's droll, off- kilter dialogue. Leslie Jones was fantastic as well - I was relieved to realize her character is more well-rounded than she appeared to be in the trailers - and Melissa McCarthy's excitement about paranormal investigation as Abby was contagious. If I had to name a weak link, I'd go with Kristen Wiig, only because her character starts off as rather brittle and fussy, the straight (wo)man at whom the others fire one-liners. As the movie progresses, though, she has opportunities to show off the comedic talent she's known for.I've read so many claims of sexism, but the only obviously sexist element I spotted was the hiring of Kevin (Chris Hemsworth) as the ladies' derpy, vapid secretary. Hemsworth plays the role with such over-the-top loopiness that the questionable premise (mostly) works, and the whole thing is less a sexist move and more a commentary that turns the more traditional trope of the ditzy female secretary on its head.And the ghosts themselves look amazing for the most part. Most of them are computer- enhanced actors instead of pure CGI, and that distinction shows in their more realistic movement and appearance. I wish we'd gotten to see more of the fantastic effects during the climax (no spoilers, don't worry) - the concept was awesome, but a lot of it played out too quickly to be appreciated.Ghostbusters 2016 is so positive, so giddy, so fun - how ironic that it inspired so much unreasonable hate. Ignore the negative pre-release hype, view the trailers with a huge grain of salt (seriously, Sony - fire everyone involved in the early marketing for this movie!), and give the movie a chance to stand on its own. It's not perfect, but it's a dizzy-good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A funny and exciting modern update.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In recent memory, there hasn't been as much controversy surrounding a movie as there was for this female-led reboot, with both outrage at the gender swap and apprehension over a beloved 80s cinematic artefact being somehow ruined. Neither concern warranted the vitriolic online attacks of course, especially as we're talking about a light-hearted supernatural comedy, and, after seeing the movie (always the best time to judge a film in my opinion), it's pretty damn good. Not an exact remake of the original, but sticking close to the broad plot strokes, Ghostbusters '16 puts less emphasis on reinventing the story and more on injecting its own kooky spin to the inherently playful tone. There is an impressive range of gags working on multiple levels, some hilariously slapstick and others more subtly tongue-in-cheek, with director Paul Feig even squeezing in a couple of fantastic meta-jokes having a dig at the aforementioned fan backlash. Although this version is clearly comfortable in its own skin, it also slyly calls back to previous outings with cheeky references (logo! vehicle! HQ!) and numerous cameos, the latter ultimately a mixed bag though. At times it is also genuinely spooky (on a PG-rated level), the pre-credits sequence is an especially effective spine-tingler, however the larger the supernatural presence the less frightening it becomes. Where this flick hits its biggest homerun is in casting. The new evil-spirit fighting quartet share a wonderful chemistry: Melissa McCarthy's optimistically rambunctious Abby, Kristen Wiig's cautiously nerdy Erin, Kate McKinnon's confidently cool Jillian and Leslie Jones' assuredly street-wise Patty make a cracking team. McKinnon steals the show though, the long time Saturday Night Live alumni is a revelation in her first major film role whilst also nabbing the most memorable moment with a totally badass action sequence in which she single-handedly takes down a string of ghouls. It's certainly not perfect ? the rote city-destroying finale and lame villain ensure that ? but it's an exciting and funny adventure that proves to be a worthy modern update. And it's ten times better than Ghostbusters 2 ever was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved it but I may be biased, the franchise is my favorite of all time, Ghostbusters was the first movie I remember seeing, it was the #1 movie when I was born, had all the toys, the jumpsuit, proton pack etc... And I've been actively waiting since I was 5 for another movie. Not to mention seeing this one a day before release on my birthday in NYC around the corner from the firehouse in 4D. But aside from that and holding the originals in holy regard, I felt fully gratified. Honestly I never understood why that trailer was so hated. It was different and the same, I know that sounds weird but watch it and you'll know. It wasn't as dark or moody as the originals yet in ways it was creepier. It also had a bit of a Real Ghostbusters vibe and it was funny as hell. The casting was excellent. I can see some critics doing the same thing they did with Force Awakens and calling it a copy of the template of the original and it is but I don't find that as a negative, I feel like it would have been more awkward if they tried to shoehorn a direct sequel. For me I can see this being multi-watchable for years just like the first two.</fullReview>

Still, I love Melissa McCarthy and Kristin Wiig -- they were the heart of the story, even as McKinnon and Jones ran away with the scenes.I want to see Patty get some shinier writing in the sequel. i want to see more of Holtzmann's mentor.

This was the coolest film of the year.Parents this movie maybe a little scary for your little ones but if you think they can handle it go ahead and take them they will love it one great movie that will be a hit forever and ever and ever. Ghost busters (2016) was truly a masterpiece on a large scale and it turned out terrific I love it.WHO YOU GONNA CALL GHODTBUSTERS</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not perfect, but funny as hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the original Ghostbusters movie, but never found it super funny. When I heard that this movie was going to be made, I was super excited, not only because the movie industry is seriously lacking in female-led movies or because I love Ghostbusters, but because I knew the actors in it and knew they were funny already. Kate McKinnon is a comedic genius, and her abilities translate flawlessly into this movie. I love her character so much, I'm dying to get some merchandise with her on it! I laughed throughout the whole movie, and the special effects were wonderful. I seriously love anything with ghosts in it and I love Kate McKinnon so I love this movie. My dad, a huge fan of the original as well, laughed through the whole thing as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy that kicks butt and traps ghosts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ghostbusters 2016 is a fun adventure with great special effects, lots of actions, and some great acting and laughs from today's hot comedians. The writing is tight and the 3d effects actually exceed the screen space so the ghosts and action seems to come right at you. I loved the female main characters that act just like action heroes and don't talk about dates, but do value friendship, honesty, loyalty, science, protecting others, etc.We all need heroes, but the laughs keep rolling and Kate McKinnon rocks the mad scientist shtick as well as being a multi-dimensional character. Leslie Jones is the NYC insider who knows all the history of buildings and people, with a touch of realistic, non- scholarly, practical knowledge to help the researchers survive. Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy provide the heart and brain. The eager scientists are so excited to have their pet theories proved right and then get to deal with actual frightening ghosts who want the freedom to revenge themselves on the living.Fun music, great ghost effects, great editing. See Ghostbusters and take your friends...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually rather satisfying. Take it from someone WHO ACTUALLY SAW THE MOVIE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me first say, I was going to boycott this movie after the terrible previews released. I don't know why I did a turn around and decided to go see it opening night besides boredom. I'm glad I did. Fandom is a hard thing to battle when talking on a reboot of a classic. I went in not expecting much as a fan of the originals and knowing they were going to throw this out the window. So keep that in mind when you see it. The best parts about this movie... It's rather entertaining as a story and has a lot going on to keep the pace moving very well. The special effects were some of the best I've seen in a long time. And the 3-D experience is not to be missed as it adds to the scare factor and things literally jump out at you and even fly past the bars of the film box and towards you. The cameos are also entertaining and that's what the fans of the originals are going to get the most out of it wanting it to tie into the originals. The bad things,... Oh its so hard to think what to start with but I'm going to start with the music. Can we give fall out boy a rest already. Personally I hated every song featured and it really took away from the film with the atrocious tunes trying to make the flick hip. I say use the original song and let that be the focus. Now the movie to me was not funny at all. At best I smirked a few times and maybe let out 2 slight chuckles. Some of the jokes were just down right poor. When you see the flick you'll know what I'm talking about with the 2 different cat jokes. (Outta the bag, and Mike Hat) ugh! Also the Ozzy cameo kinda sucked because it wasn't really even a joke and the fact he yells out Sharron after all that's recently happened made the joke poor. They should have just cut his one line. My least favorite part of the movie, besides the music, was Jillian Holtzmann played by Kate McKinnon. Her character was annoying and just plain weird. Thankfully when she does say something, it's short. But those short statements made me hate her character because what she said most of the time was just stupid and came out as baby talk at certain parts. She dumbed it down and I would have rather the part was played by Emma Stone who was originally picked. There are lots of reviews on here from people who haven't even seen the movie but hate women casts and hate the idea of a reboot when fact is, the original cast was never in a spot to give us that. Be glad we got this cause it's not that bad. I gave it a 7 outta 10. Visually and story driven it was really good and a fun time at the movies. A film is meant to entertain and this definitely delivered on that end. Go see it and get the 3-D cause it's worth it. Definitely changed my original opinion which is what we all hoped for. I get Fandom and the loyal subjects attached. I hated BVS dawn of justice and would give it less than a one because I'm such a big superman fan, but I gave it a chance. Give this a chance and I'm sure you'll agree, it can't be given less than a 5 from anyone who's actually seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good and funny film, loved seeing women in a typical male role and to top it off the cast played their roles fantastically. I found myself laughing out loud quite a lot. It was a little slow at times and the whole film was more of a prequel to me, like the actual story was yet to come. Overall though I loved it, I am a huge fan of Melissa so I was a bit biased before hand, but she didn't disappoint!I suspect a large number of the 1 reviews are from people who disliked the film before it even came to cinema, whether because of love for the original or because they are simply sexist, so I wouldn't pay attention to them. I liked the film and loved the cast, I would've given it 7 or 8, but had to go against those mentioned above on principle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite many reviews slating this film being a poor attempt at being a comedy - I thought it was a good upbeat comedy film with the odd silly jump scare. Great cast, well written, impressive cinematography and a brilliant sound track. Even my partner who went in hating the film (from YouTube reviews) found it hilarious and quite enjoyed it. The adult jokes are a nice touch, and not too evident so young children will not pick up on them. There was definitely a sense of girl power so perhaps some of the more negative views may not have enjoyed that. Only reason I can explain them. There is plenty if reference to the past films, so look out for the references!Go watch this film with an open mind. Forget what the internet has brainwashed you to think about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went in not expecting a lot. We loved the original and wow... this nicked it out of the ballpark. It's no half-assed remake, to be sure but a while new level of cool. My family and I had more fun watching the new Ghostbusters than wr had had watching ANYTHING else all year. Better plot, more science, funnier, and the action scenes actually worked IMHO. There were cameos and head nods and lots of applauds at the end (as well as hooting and laughter and shrieking from the audience throughout).And yes, guys, that's how it feels to be constantly sexualized and overlooked in movies. Honestly they turned a LOT of tropes on their heads and made some really valid points about life as a woman without ever actually making any effort at it or being preachy (like, dress code conundrums, how women make it through life getting overlooked or made fun of without turning homicidal, etc).</fullReview>

So cleverly written dealing with gender role reversals as well as call backs to the original movie and creating a new story line. Well done and thank you.Very sad to see how many negative commons have been posted on IMDb, it appears some fan boys for the original movie have created a club to rate the movie down before it was even released...Having an all female cast is very challenging to the current white heterosexual male dominant culture. Its a great shake up of the prevailing narrative of "how things should be". I found it new and refreshing and thinking out of the box.

		<shortDescription>My dad took my nephew, at age 6, to see this movie in 1984 . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . when it was a Good Ol' American product, and it was said that a great time was had by all at a flick rating 5 stars (out of five). So I naively saw no reason why I should NOT take my own nephew, 7, to watch the new GHOSTBUSTERS. What could go wrong? The first image on the screen, slowly emerging from a dark murk, is a circular shape that morphs into "Sony," the propaganda arm of the Japanese government, tasked with taking down America from within, as revenge for the U.S. military defeating Japan's War Criminals in the 1900s. This meant nothing, of course, to my nephew. But less than 10 minutes later, thanks to Japanese Tool Melissa McCarthy, the young lad is asking me "How do girls fart from their fronts?" Within half an hour Sony had me trying to explain "face bidets," "soiled slacks," and "goo in every crack." Taken as a whole, this summer's GHOSTBUSTERS is blatant Product Placement. The "product" is that Buffoonish Boor of Crudity himself, President Trump (whom Glen Beck has labeled as an "extinction event for American Capitalism). As Fox "News" fires its founder Roger Ailes for trying to investigate the blood that President Trump said was spurting from Megyn Kelly's "wherever," we can all thank Sony Pictures for corrupting America with its herd of filthy cinematic Trojan Horses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missing the Magic of the Original, but the Cast Shines,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ghostbusters is a good movie with a well developed plot and a top notch comedic cast. People were expecting a shot for shot remake of the original, but it is safe to say it stands out on it's own, it does not rely on the 1984 film or copy it in any way, it really is its own movie. The new characters are not imitations of Penter Venkman or Egon Spengler, they are completely original. Holtzmann is a particularly great new character, wacky and flamboyant, the perfect role for the hilarious Kate McKinnon. I was glad that there was no cast member that was "the female Dan Aykroyd" or "the new Bill Murray". It is certainly missing elements that made the first two movies unforgettable, there is no love story, Bill Murray and Sigourney Weaver's relationship was one of the strongest features of the original, no characters have any sort of love life here, which added a personal factor and makes them more relatable. As well as that, no one takes the lead role, Murray being in the lead allows him to hold the rest of the film together, however, all four characters are given equal screen time which gives us no one to route for. They also did not create any new, memorable ghosts, which disappointed no, there's no new Slimer or Marshmallow Man, no humorous ghost characters, only overly scary ones, and a brief, forgetful appearance from the two I previously mentioned. The cast is stellar, the four female leads shine, their chemistry with one another is terrific and I would be happy to see them together again. There are also great cameos throughout, including the original cast members and Chris Hemsworth also shines as the male receptionist, showing a surprisingly terrific flare for comedy. Fun, action packed and a hilarious cast, Paul Feig may not truly capture the magic of the original series, but he created a loving tribute that stands out on its own, Ghostbusters is worth the watch for anyone looking for a good comedy or adventure. A group of female scientists form a crew after discovering the existence of paranormal activity. Best Performance: Kate McKinnon / Worst Performance: Neil Casey</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Representation Matters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a young girl, I was surrounded my media that depicted women as objects and sex toys or dowdy wives who nagged and were basically just party poopers. But the men in media could be dynamic and heroic or anything else that they could dream to be. It is so important to have female roles that do not just exist to be support or eye candy. Each of the women in this movie is dynamic and funny and smart and it's so important to have that! I'm sorry but this movie exists for girls who dream to see themselves as powerful and smart and funny for themselves and not just to impress a guy. This movie is for little girls who haven't yet been told that science is just for boys. Girls who can be flawed but still succeed, they don't have to "have it all!" (because that's impossible and movies that say that you can are lying to you). Men have had media telling them that they are strong and successful all their lives and now it is time for women to have those kinds of role models as well. Plus! The movie was actually really funny and the effects were great. As someone who studies production design, I am so happy to see a ghost movie out there that doesn't try too hard to be dark or gritty for the hell of it. The colors are great and the story is also great. It pays homage to the originals while standing strongly on its own. Leslie Jones is helping to pave the way for POC comedians playing roles where they are smart and important to the cast, not just a cast off character who takes the brunt of the jokes. She is important and wonderful. TL;DRThis movie is actually pretty awesome despite all the whiny dudebros who are mad that "the feminists are taking over" (I say it's due payback for the gross old men who took my little pony away from little girls)And also representation is important and women are great and girls can be scientists and don't just have to exist as a hot secretary (now we have Chris hemsworth to do that!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why all the hate?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had very low expectations for this movie based on the advance press, my low opinion of reboots as a concept generally (do we really have so little imagination?) and, candidly, my lukewarm opinion of McCarthy. But my teenage daughter saw it last week and liked it so much she insisted we all see it tonight, so we went. For the first 15 minutes or so, my mind was having that interior conversation comparing and contrasting this model with the originals, then something odd happened... I was pulled in so completely that the critique stopped and I just enjoyed the show. The leading ladies were all appealing and worked well together. Who cares about the gender flip, really? Get over it folks. The nods to the original films were great with cameos from Aykroyd, Murray, Hudson, Weaver &amp; Potts-- a shame Moranis passed on the offer -- not to mention Slimer. (I also see there's an actor named Ramis in the credits; Harold's son, I hope.) And while I'm not exactly the biggest rap aficionado, I did enjoy how the soundtrack often riffed off the original themes. For the whole last 90 minutes or so, I just smiled as I felt this reboot had done a splendid job of capturing the fun, rollicking spirit of the original. Be sure to remain seated until after the credits -- the music and other fun stuff on screen is worth it on its own merits -- to see the teaser for the inevitable sequel, featuring an old villain from the other side. I'm looking forward to it.</fullReview>

I plan to go see it again, something I haven't done since Titanic.One thing I love about this movie is there is no stupid love interest, no women running in heels, no damsels in distress.

		<fullReview>Just saw Ghostbusters. That was pretty fabulous, and both funnier and scarier than I'd expected. (And I'll admit, I went into it with high expectations.) Kate McKinnon did kinda steal the show, but no complaints.Most of the original cast (Harold Ramis and Rick Moranis excepted) make cameos, but I think it's engaging without trying to either overdo the campiness or the nostalgia factor. There's some delightfully well-timed action sequences where the Ghostbusters theme shows up, and the "ghosts get loosed in New York" theme gets used again, but it's still pretty fresh and new.This is up there in one of the best movies I've seen this year, and I think much of the vitriol being lobbed at the movie was saved up, sight unseen, without a lot of evidence. The movie is funny, well-produced, fast-paced and a great flick to see this summer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My expectations for the 2016 reboot of the Ghostbusters weren't really that high, apart from the nostalgia I felt watching the trailer and listening to the all so familiar theme song. But after watching it in the cinema, I have to say, it surely left me much more than just satisfied at the results. The main cast was well chosen and spot on, a very clever reversion of roles from the original movie while still giving the new cast their own quirks and personalities. I couldn't contain my excitement at times during the action scenes, which were packed with emotion and hilarious gags. Speaking of such gags, the comedy in the movie was simply fantastic to my tastes, I couldn't stop laughing while watching it, and that says something, since it's somewhat hard to make me laugh so much in a movie. The story line diverges from the one in the original movie, turning this reboot into something that stands alone from the originals, making it it's own original creation. The special effects were pretty great, not as marvelous as the ones in other recent movies, but it fits into the comical and lively aesthetic of the story. In general, this was an amazing movie, I highly recommend it to those who seek a fun and action packed sci-fi movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gender Swap Reboot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Ghostbusters", starring Melissa McCarthy-Mike &amp; Molly_tv, Bridesmaids; Kristen Wiig-The Martian, Bridesmaids; Kate McKinnon- SNL_tv, Ted 2; Leslie Jones-SNL_tv, Trainwreck and Chris Hemsworth-Thor in the Marvel movies, Star Trek_2009.This is a reboot of the classic 1984 Ghostbusters-and it's not-quite-as- good 1989 sequel. In case you haven't heard, it also has a gender reversal going on; It has Melissa, Kristen, Kate and Leslie as female Ghostbusters and Chris is their male receptionist. Kristen is a physics professor that wrote a book about the paranormal and teams up with her long time friend, Melissa, also a believer. Kate is the gadget maker in the team and Leslie is a subway worker that joins the group after witnessing ghosts-she brings the street smarts to the team. Chris is hilarious as a male version of a dumb blonde. As far as the plot goes, there are ghosts running loose in New York and the girls come to the rescue. Pretty simple. Now, I have heard lots of criticism about the gender reversal, which I really don't understand-sexism? And most of it is from people that have not even seen the movie. To me, if it is funny, that is all that should matter. I mean, what do these complainers want to do? Keep watching the same 1984 movie, over and over and over and over again? There are 5 original cast members that make cameos-6, if you count a bust of the deceased Harold Ramis-and they are not playing their original characters; one is a person that does not believe in ghosts, one is a taxi driver, one is a desk clerk, one is a funeral home owner and one is a personal mentor to Kate. There is also a cameo by one of my all time favorite rock stars. And as far as all the hate directed at the movie's cast, I have heard that the original cast has given their blessings and full support-I saw them on Jimmy Kimmel. The movie ends with a hint at future sequels-depending on box office results, I'm sure- and as the end credits start, there is a scene. In fact, there are scenes all through the end credits and even one at the very end, so make sure you wait for that one. The movie was dedicated to Harold Ramis. It's rated "PG-13" for supernatural action and crude humor and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 56 minutes. I enjoyed it and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I seriously cannot believe that Paul Feig and Katie Dippold were daft enough to think women could play plausible scientists. OK, who cares that 46% of all recent Ph.D. recipients were women? So what if 47% of medical school graduates possess the very ovaries they studied in their gynecology rotation! Does it really matter that the overall growth percentage of science and engineering degrees being awarded to women is higher than STEM degrees being awarded to men? After all, it is a well known fact that cold, hard statistics accrued by the National Science Foundation and the American Association of Medical Colleges are just wrong, wrong, wrong. I just don't think people whose bodies contain uteri can understand math and physics like men. Shame on you, Paul and Katie!And what were they thinking when they decided to remake a classic film? We have these treasured do-overs that were totally necessary to take our hard-earned cash in the theaters: 1. Clash of the Titans 2. Karate Kid (I mean, that Jaden kid so totally crane-kicked Macchio's bum) 3. Robocop 4. Footloose 5. Total Recall 6. Evil Dead 7. Nightmare on Elm Street 8. Friday the 13th 9. Annie 10. PoltergeistI am so glad that the above films received the same amount of vitriol and negative publicity as this reboot of Ghostbusters. After all, very few reboots/remakes ever succeed in the box office or even surpass the originals. OK, so yeah, let's forget about 1. True Grit 2. Star Trek 3. Mad Max: Fury Road 4. Rise of the Planet of the Apes (A remake of a reboot, even!) 5. X Men: First Class 6. Batman Begins 7. Casino Royale 8. Ocean's Eleven 9. The Departed (remake of Hong Kong film 'Infernal Affairs') 10. Maltese Falcon I mean, these were just flukes, and there is absolutely no conceivable way that reboots or remakes deserve to blacken the memory of the original. I mean, Annie Potts, Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, Ernie Hudson, and Sigourney Weaver all thought that the reboot was a bad idea- right? They wouldn't even consider cameos in a film that was such a flat-out horrid idea. I'm so glad that Leonard Nimoy, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen didn't think enough of their classic film reboots to participate (either in cameo or significant role) in the newer films. My final beef with this film? Let's face it...female led films and franchises ALWAYS tank at the box office. Yes, I realize that Aliens, Hunger Games, Resident Evil and Underworld all spawned sequels due to their success, but women just can't headline a film. I really don't care that research shows that movies from 2006 - 2015 that had female protagonists out-grossed their male counterparts by nearly 50 million dollars per film. Facts, schmacts. Every single person who purchased a ticket to a female-led film is just an angry feminist man-hater with 14 cats and an unhealthy relationship with yogurt.I salute those of you who reviewed a film you didn't even see. It takes a lot of courage to speak with authority on something you know absolutely nothing about. That is quite brazen, and I tip my hat to you. You were in my thoughts as I chuckled, chortled, and flat out sniggered throughout Ghostbusters today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to this movie with only cursory knowledge of the original movies, since my sister and mother were really interested in seeing it. It blew my expectations away - the plot wasn't cheesy and the characters, while a little stereotypical/pigeon-holed, had great chemistry with one another. The secretary (Chris Hemsworth) was certainly easy on the eyes, but he was more than that, and wasn't treated badly by the movie at all.This is something that I feel new fans can definitely love (I'd say old fans, too, because my mother was gushing over cameos, but honestly I can't speak for them - I think it would be fine, but as someone not super-invested in the original movies, I don't speak for old fans). The few adult-themed jokes were light/delicate enough to not be too in-your-face for children, and while there were a few jump scares and the like I think kids would really enjoy the movie.All in all, I do give this a 9/10 because for all that one or two characters were stereotypical, it was a great story and a really funny movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It made me feel like a little kid again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this film and it made me feel like a little kid again. It's one that needs to be watched in 3D to feel the full effect and the full effects are really something!Being brutally honest, the first time I watched it, I felt like it was a little slow paced to start with but once it got going, it really took off. I also felt like some of the jokes were a little too crude and basic but I was still grinning the whole way through the film. The cast has amazing chemistry and Kate McKinnon really stole the show. I've seen it twice so far since its been out and would go back a third time.This film is radical and revolutionary in so many ways, I almost couldn't believe what I was watching. I don't think this is a film you really want to miss out on seeing, whatever your preconceived notions may be!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was going into this expecting either meh or slightly good but was pleasantly surprised by how great this was. The characters were interesting although Erin's obsession with the receptionist was a bit off putting and they had good energy/relationships together. Holtzman and Patti stole the show but every ghost buster had something to add to the team.And while the general plot structure was similar to the other ghost busters the actual plot itself differentiated enough that it was fresh and interesting to me. The devices they came up with were great and the fighting scenes were fun.There were also some really well done cameos that made me smile.Fantastic movie, glad I went to see this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic fun movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is what a true summer blockbuster is supposed to be. Engaging, entertaining, laugh out loud funny and yet with enough emotional moments to anchor it for the audience and the characters. The breakout star of this movie is undoubtedly Kate McKinnon - here's to hoping Ghostbuster is for her what Bridesmaid was for Melissa McCarthy. An energetic and captivating performance, McKinnon makes a banquet of what she's given and you simply cannot take your eyes off her. The cameos amp the nostalgia up to 11, Hemsworth is delightfully dim, and the entire cast's chemistry is off the chart. Will go see it multiple times, take my nephews and nieces, and wait impatiently for a sequel. PS: stay till after the credits! You'll thank me!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was not aiming for an Oscar, this movie wanted people to laugh and enjoy themselves, and it delivers. Everything about this movie is fun, from top to bottom. There are enough nods to the old Ghostbusters to make you nostalgic, but not so much that you feel like the film is stuck in the past. The jokes are up to date, with great cameos and excellent use of background characters.If you love ghosts, guns, and soup jokes go and see this film. If you love mad plots and crazy science go and see this film. If you love Ghostbusters go and see this film. Just go and see this film.It may not win a fancy award but it's definitely a good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught this at a pre-screening the week before its US release, and I have to say, if you like the original two Ghostbusters film, you'll likely enjoy this one. Fun jokes, good nods at the original, and great cameos by the original cast make for a fun time. The pacing is off late in the film, particularly around the big climax, which makes me wonder if the studio edit demanded "a bigger finish". This detractions is forgivable with the fun popcorn feel of the remaining film. As a general rule I get annoyed at Hollywood for its reboots, and I had very low expectations when I first heard of this one being done. That being said, the film turned out to contain many laughs. Note: The film does contain a post-credit sequence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haters aside, "Ghostbusters" is fresh and fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the prophetess Taylor Swift has taught us: "Haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate (baby)." And there was plenty of pre-release hate for the mid-2016 comedy reboot "Ghostbusters" (PG-13, 1:56), starting when its all-female cast was announced in early 2015. There seems to be multiple sources of this anti-reboot prejudice. For starters, it gives many Movie Fans pause when they learn that a beloved film from their younger years (such as 1984's "Ghostbusters") is being remade. That concern compounds when filmmakers announce major changes coming to the remake (such as changing the gender of the four main characters from male to female). But most of the vitriol seemed focused just on the fact of the core cast being females. That aspect of the backlash calls to mind Tina Fey's constant annoyance at suggestions that women aren't as funny as men (as she explains in her best-selling 2011 comical autobiography "Bossypants"). Criticism spread even though the cast of 2016's "Ghostbusters" includes the very popular Melissa McCarthy and some of the most prominent and most valuable "Saturday Night Live" cast members from the previous decade ? regardless of gender. The internet trolls would have been well-advised to withhold judgment. This is an excellent remake which stands on its own merits.2016's "Ghostbusters" is a remake that is not simply a retread ? and pays appropriate homage to the original. This film changes the gender of the main characters and only keeps the basic set-up of the original ? but also gets nostalgic with several significant details, fresh cameo appearances by most of the main actors from the 1984 version, some memorable 80s music and Ray Parker Jr.'s iconic theme song.Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) is a professor at Columbia University who has a skeleton in her closet. (But not a ghost. That comes later.) Her reputation and her bid for tenure at Columbia is threatened by a book that she wrote back in college with classmate Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy). In the book, the two indulge in their mutual interest in the paranormal by making theoretical claims about the existence of ghosts. At this particularly auspicious moment in Erin's career, Abby tries to resurrect sales of their book by making it available on the internet. Erin finds Abby pursuing her paranormal research at a rather unsophisticated educational institution across town and working with brilliant but quirky engineer Jillian Holtzman (Kate McKinnon). Hoping to get Abby to take the book off the internet, Erin agrees to introduce Abby and Holtzman (as everyone calls her) to the owner (Ed Begley Jr.) of an old New York mansion and the mansion's tour guide (Zach Woods) who claims he encountered a malevolent spirit.One thing leads to another (not wanting to give away too much here) and the three women open up a research facility to investigate claims of paranormal activity in the Big Apple. They hire a receptionist named Kevin (Chris Hemsworth), a dimwitted but handsome/buff young man who is the only one dumb enough to apply for the job, but also too dumb to do it properly. When Erin, Abby and Holtzman investigate a ghost sighting in a subway tunnel, they meet friendly/smart/tough Metropolitan Transit Authority worker Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones) who joins "the club" and becomes the fourth ghostbuster.With Erin and Abby's academic expertise, Holtzman's ingenuous but dangerous gadgets and Patty's encyclopedic knowledge of the city (and a hearse from her uncle's funeral home becoming the new "Ecto-1"), the four women uncover and fight against a plot to unleash ghosts of residents from New York's long and diverse history onto the unsuspecting city. But before the Ghostbusters can save the city from becoming one big haunted house, they have to get past a paranormal debunker (Bill Murray), plus a comically self-centered mayor (Andy Garcia) and his equally politically-motivated adviser (Cecily Strong), not to mention a couple clueless Homeland Security agents (Matt Walsh and Michael Kenneth Williams). It's all good. The four women at the center of this movie ain't afraid of no ghosts ? or haters.2016's "Ghostbusters" is fresh and very enjoyable. The changes work well and the new cast works even better. In my humble opinion, these are the best roles for McCarthy and Wiig since they starred together in 2011's "Bridesmaids", while McKinnon and Jones shine in their biggest big-screen roles to date. Hemsworth's character is good for more than a few laughs (although some of them are a little too far on the silly side) and "Deadpool" fans will enjoy seeing Karan Soni in several scenes as a barely-competent food delivery man. Director Paul Feig (who also co-wrote with Katie Dippold) gives us just the right blend of the old and the new (with, however, a couple awkward moments mixed in) and makes very good use of the significant advances in visual effects in the over three decades since the original.If the original "Ghostbusters" was a great "guy movie" (as some see it), then the 2016 version, with its core female cast and their receptionist being played as a hunky dumb blonde male, then this remake/reboot is "Ghostbusters" for women. But that's only one way of thinking, because this film is bigger than all that. 2016's "Ghostbusters" is a fun, funny movie that updates the 1984 classic for a new generation ? and is very entertaining in its own right, not in spite of the cast, but because of them.

		<shortDescription>Loved it! Haters Gonna Hate.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went in skeptical, and came out pleasantly surprised.I grew up with the original movies, so my loyalty lies with them; however, one thing I noticed in watching them as an adult 30 years later is that they don't seem to stand up against the test of time.The new film revises what we've already seen, and renews the excitement I felt while watching the old movies as a kid.The ladies were great ? particularly Kate McKinnon, but Leslie Jones was also a much more interesting character than the trailers would lead you to believe. The humor and chemistry between actresses works wonderfully. The supporting cast is just as good, most notably Thor's turn as the clueless secretary.The cameos and call-backs to the older movies, while ever-present, were much more natural feeling than previous reboots. Only one cameo felt out of place, and it was the one you would least suspect.While I actually don't love it enough to give it a 10 (probably 8.5 is where I would land). I'm leaving my review at 10 to help counteract the hatred this flick is getting undeservedly. It may not be the most accurate reflection of my opinion, but neither are the poor reviews.</fullReview>

If rotten tomatoes gave this a 70 something percent, that's saying something since that's the hardest rated site ever. The jokes just kept coming and I was smiling and laughing throughout! The story was also well told and it's not a redo of the original movie so appreciate for what it is. This movie was fun and why IMDb has it at such a low rating clearly shows how many misogynist are out there mad because this was a female cast. And this is not a revamp for those that are hating about that, it's more of a re-imagining so give it a chance with fresh eyes. It's very enjoyable!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a really, really fun movie. Like many, I'm usually skeptical about remakes, but with Ghostbusters, my main hope was that it would be fun and oddball, like the original but different, and it lived up to that. My only complaint is that there's one thing that I consider to be a plot hole, but a) this is an action comedy, not a movie where the plot is really the point, and b) I think the plot hole can be explained away when you consider the fact that the characters are not genre-savvy.There are lots of callbacks and cameos for original Ghostbusters fans, and lots of little things, like their gaining notoriety on YouTube, that make it feel modern without feeling like "oh, look at us, it's Ghostbusters but with cell phones!" See it in theaters while you can. It's not a movie you would go see specifically for the special effects, but they do add something on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't really understand why this film has so few stars. The plot was pretty solid, with one or two small holes that can really be overlooked. The effects were great. The humor was on point-the jokes were witty plays on words and situations. The cinematography was brilliant. Taking socio-political aspects out of the equation, this Ghostbusters is a well-crafted addition to/reboot of the 1984 film.The only issue some might have is the receptionist, Kevin (Chris Hemsworth). He is stupid, going beyond even the normal 'hot dumb blonde' trope. He regularly messes up the most menial tasks, and the women only keep him around for his looks. This role reversal (that's what it is, mind you) is complete satire of Hollywood's representation of women. Kevin is a lovable dope and even his over-the-top stupidity adds witty humor akin to that of the late Gracie Allen.As for the Ghostbusters, they are represented as human beings, rather than objects for male affection-they're scientists (except for Patty) doing their jobs, like in the first two movies. Unlike the first two, there isn't any sex implied at all.Maybe there are those who can't handle witnessing these kinds of things in film. Maybe that's why it only has 5.4/10 stars. Because overall Ghostbusters is a great movie. 10/10 will see again.</fullReview>

Might of even gotten a crush on one of the Ghostbusters in a geeky sort of way. Finally Chris Hemsworth's character. It was different, but in a good way, to see this character turned around and made into a man. It was fun. The entire movie was fun.

		<fullReview>I wish it had been a continuation not a reboot, but whatever. This is a very Ghostbusters film. More so than GB2. The all-female crew does not detract from anything. What's most important here is: does the film make you laugh? Yes, it did. Many times. Second-most important thing: does it live up to the promise of the premise? "What if all the GB were women? What would happen that's specific to THAT set-up?" And they fulfill that beautifully. Particularly when they go up against the Big Bad. Essentially, the film-makers kept the same structure of the original film, repopulated it. This film has the same affinity for the original film as THE FORCE AWAKENS had for STAR WARS. If you didn't have a problem with TFA, you won't have a problem with this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent retelling of a classic film for a modern audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this film! It was funny and silly, quirky and ridiculous in the best way! I thought it was an excellent retelling of a classic film for a modern audience. Every performance was phenomenal and all the actors' inherent comedy shined through brilliantly (Kate McKinnon's and Leslie Jones's in particular). I've read reviews that complain Kevin was the *ahem* Token Male Character. That he was stupid and stereotypical and that his portrayal was sexist. To that, I ask: would you have said the same thing if the roles were reversed? If the character had been named Kiera and been played by a woman, would you think it was sexist? Would you be upset over the poor and inaccurate representation? Would you be arguing the same points on a woman's behalf? I know it's hard to see yourself represented in such a flat, boring and unflattering way. I know it's a fairly new experience for you, but please, consider for a moment that women see themselves portrayed the same way Kevin is in almost every film they watch, and that this character was meant to point out just how upsetting it is for the sole female lead to be portrayed as a shallow, one- dimensional sex object. That was the point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I should make clear that Paul Feig's "Ghostbusters" is neither a sequel to nor remake of Ivan Reitman's version. It's more like an alternate version, with a female cast. As in the original version, there's a goof-off (Melissa McCarthy), a childlike character (Kate McKinnon), a no-nonsense type (Kristen Wiig) and a non-scientist (Leslie Jones), each using their talents to fight the evil spirits trying to take over New York. This version changes the story a little bit, but I enjoyed it. Naturally the CGI is more sophisticated - and sometimes so over-the-top that it's ridiculous - but I liked what I saw.No, the movie won't be for everyone (the previous reviewer didn't like it). But, if you're in for some plain old fun, then this new "Ghostbusters" is for you.</fullReview>

But the plot never really made much sense and the main villain doesn't show up until the final few scenes.This new film is so much better. It makes sense. The plot hangs together better and everything just works. It's genuinely scary in places, rather than the handful of jump scares from the original. The casting is brilliant, the performances are brilliant. The cameos from the cast of and nods to the original film are brilliant. Even the CGI laden final act works. If something like that were to happen for real and not look like that then I would be both surprised and disappointed.There isn't a bum note for the entire movie. I can't even think of a way it could have been made better.This isn't a remake, it's not even a reboot. It's taking the basic concept of the original and going in another direction. A different direction that I'm interested in seeing.I'm already chomping at the bit to see any sequel they make.</fullReview>

The two stands out were clearly Chris Hemsworth and Kate McKinnon, they stole the show.With this being a reboot all four leads were always going to be compared to the phenomenal cast of the original and in a way they should be as they try to clearly take certain personality aspects from their counterparts.The USER reviews this film has received, some of it has it's merit and can be justified but a lot of the hate is simply because it has four female leads which is very disturbing for this day and age.That aide i would highly recommend seeing this film, weather you're a fan of the originals or not.

As a reboot to an all-new series, the story shows how they come together and rise to fame amidst backlash from the government and other naysayers.The looming--and probably inadvertent--Cold War undertones of the original get substituted for nothing in this one. And honestly, it's better that way. We have enough social commentary in our superhero movies these days that we don't need it all the time. Sometimes it's good to have a movie that can just be fun.And that's what this film is. In many ways, this one is funnier. Whereas the the original found comedy from pretty much just Bill Murray and Rick Moranis, this one tries squeezing it out of its entire cast. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.It mostly doesn't work in the case of McKinnon and Jones. While Jones' comedy style doesn't fit well in most places, McKinnon's just doesn't fit well in this scenario. Wiig will say or do something funny and then McKinnon pipes in and it awkwardly falls flat. It's jarring. It's not just that the audience doesn't expect it--the audience doesn't want it. I think Kate McKinnon is funny, and I love the brand of humor she brings to this movie. But it just doesn't work here.There are few that may appreciate the cringe humor of McKinnon, but to most others, they just won't get it. Which isn't really what you want in a very mainstream reboot of one of the most popular comedies of all time.Chris Hemsworth is the brightest ray of sunshine in this film, as he plays the earnestly stupid receptionist who goes as far as proposing the 7-Eleven graphic as the logo for the Ghostbusters team.The script has some pacing issues, but a lot of the jokes are well-written and thought-out. Imagine if the ones that fell flat didn't. Director Paul Feig does a good job not just handing McCarthy the reins and letting her run off with it recklessly. Fortunately, she's contained enough that it doesn't just feel like her movie where she's stepping on everybody's toes. In fact, no one really does.There are enough solid references to the original film to keep old fans into it. There's that connection. It never feels like a distant cousin of Ghostbusters, but like it could, possibly, still be in that same universe.It's obviously not as much of a zeitgeist of an era as the original Ghostbusters was. No one ever expected it to be. In fact, no one really expected anything (with the exception of those fanboys who just hated its existence). And that plays in its favor as we can just sit back and be entertained, for all that it's worth.Twizard Rating: 88</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off I'd like to start out by saying anyone who gives this movie a bad revue probably owns a fedora and has never pleasured a woman. This movie was by far one of the best remakes I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. The women in this movie were all strong, beautiful, and hilarious. The way Paul directed this movie was brilliant and visually stunning. He made a really funny movie without relying on bad language and sex jokes, which is hard to do especially in 2016. It gives me hope that one day females can have strong roles like men and it was refreshing to see a man in the secretary position, which Chris Hemsworth killed by the way. I think all mothers should take their daughters to see this movie to let them know they don't have to be stick thin, or gorgeous, or dumb to be a total bad ass. So for everyone saying that it's a bad rip off the OG obviously is sexist and probably shouldn't be allowed to have a daughter. Who you gonna call? Four amazingly talented women who can kick ass.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie would have totally shaped and influenced my life if I had seen it in my teenage years - I may have also stayed awake at night thinking of those terrifying ghosts. It's an epic depiction of powerful, funny, intelligent, and truly beautiful women! There were a few references to the original so it might help to watch it first but you really don't need to. This powerhouse of a movie stands on its own and will, without a doubt, one day be described as a culture shaping classic. We've been so eager to see more diverse and strong female leads in our movies AND every day lives and this movie perfectly hit the mark! I can't wait till I watch this fun and empowering movie again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Folks, Ghostbusters is worth seeing! No, they DIDN'T make a monstrosity. I actually enjoyed it quite a bit! The one scene I was shuddering about being in the movie most was cut and moved to be a credit sequence which was PERFECTLY placed compared to where it was set to be originally.Great nods to the originals throughout. Characters were well done. Melissa McCarthy was a little more low key which suits her so well vs. the over-the-top BS she always makes. Kristen Wiig continues to be an honest to goodness actress that I enjoy, Leslie Jones acted more than I expected vs. loud and in your face the whole time (though there was plenty, I thought she could do nothing else walking into this), Hemsworth and McKinnon steal the show.Still some cringes, but they're quick to win you back. Compared to the disappointment I had been expecting, I was pleasantly surprised at the ride as a whole and that it was a solid movie from this die-hard fan's view. (They'll never get a siren as good as the OG. That noise still gives me goosebumps to this day because of how much it meant to be back when). Parenthesis aside and without question, I wouldn't hesitate to see the next one.Saw it in RealD 3D and it was designed to have things from the movie go outside of the letterbox which was VERY cool for this movie watching the beams and such actually punch through the confines of what appeared to the be screen space. See it, and see it that way. Feeling fairly relieved - the franchise LIVES!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Harold Ramis died so did the notion of Ghostbusters 3 ever getting off the ground. Columbia Pictures instead rebooted the film for a new generation with a whole new team of female Ghostbusters and nods to the original such as Marshmallow Man and Slimer.Of course some people on the internet have not been too keen on this version from the get go. However the film is self aware of the backlash as Melissa McCarthy's character takes note of the YouTube video comments: 'Ain't no bitches gonna hunt no ghosts.'This version takes a while to get going after a spooky pre credit segment. McCarthy's Abby Yates plays the co-author of a ghost book who has been tracking the paranormal phenomenon for years. Kirsten Wiig's Erin Gilbert who also co- authored the book wants her spooky past forgotten as she strives for tenancy in academia.However when ghosts start to show up in Manhattan they spring into action along with Kate McKinnon as Jillian Holtzmann, an expert on tech gadgets and Leslie Jones as Patty Tolan, a transport worker who joins the team as the only non physicist as part of the new Ghostbusters and mirrors Ernie Hudson's role in the original who also the non physicist Ghostbuster.The final segment was full on Ghostbustin but it was also too much filled with CGI in a sound-stage that was a replica of Times Square from four decades or so. I felt something was off in the editing of that segment only for it to show up during the end credits.The original Ghostbusters was a mega hit back in 1984 but the sequel under performed with the critics and at the box office.This reboot is not bad, the plot is thin and McCarthy and Wiig rein in their shtick a bit. However I felt McKinnon tried too hard to be quirky. Other people have found Chris Hemsworth's turn as the male bimbo funny, I thought it was rather annoying.The film has the stars from the original Ghostbusters popping up as if to give it a seal of approval but although it has some genuinely spooky moments it is short on comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was funny, but mainly in a 'bring along the kids' way, which would be fine were it not for the stripping down of features that made the original so iconic.I love the SNL cast a lot and Hemsworth's casting as the comic relief was pretty well placed, but a lot of the light humour spread across the movie tends to fall flat due to a severance from the original movie.For example the biggest issues for me were the neon cgi of the ghost and the erasure of the original characters (though not in spirit, heh). Despite any negative focuses - some solid soundtrack, cast chemistry and abundant well-meaningness make this a good outing, just perhaps not to the cinema (unless you have kids). More kite than balloon, but a sequel is possible though uncertain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting much from a reboot. Of course it's not even close to the 1984 original. But there are quite a few good jokes and the four main characters are played by hilarious, talented women. I must say it's quite grating to see that, more than 30 years later, there are still the same issues with the African-American character: the only main character who's not a scientist? Really? Don't the writers know that African-American women are the most-educated group in the USA today? Google it.All in all, it was entertaining. I hope the gigantic manbaby- internet-troll backlash against the film won't make it flop because we need Hollywood to be more willing to put women forward in its big productions. No, it's true, we don't need more reboots and sequels. But please don't tell me that's the real issue behind the huge internet campaign against this film, because if it were, then where's the rage against that new Independence Day flaming piece of garbage? Seriously, dudebros need to get a grip.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Downvote this all you like, I don't care, It was surprisingly good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ghostbusters (2016) is obviously a reboot and you know that, and that's probably why you've already condemned this film at the start. It also might be because of the horrid marketing and unfunny jokes. There is not really much to say about the build up to this film that you probably already know but here's something you will never know now that you've limited yourself in your close mindedness, this film is actually pretty surprisingly good. "Why is it so good then? I obviously don't see how it's going to be good in any way and it's just a cash grab without even seeing it." Well let me give you a treat. It's enjoyable as any other comedy film you'd see, it's a joy to see different spins and variety other than being another cookie-cutter shot for shot remake of the original film, it's filled with a peachy cast that has chemistry that maybe isn't on par with the original cast but at the same time they have their own strengths and specialty, and lastly (your favorite part) it's not as good as the original and still has some flaws that people will pick apart. There are lots of chuckle moments in the film and they're done pretty well enough. Of course some jokes are either a hit or miss, but maybe the weirdest part about the jokes are not everyone will get them since they're quite subtle or reference to something greater and if you like that kind of comedy then you'll find yourself laughing throughout the film but not everyone in the theater will be laughing with you though (lol). The jokes or sequences in the film that didn't work or just was downright unfunny in the trailers and marketing worked so unexpectedly well in the film. Maybe it's because these jokes and sequences worked better given the context of the film and the whole thing and Paul Feig (like the British guy he is) just doesn't know how to do one-liners or jokes (like what Americans do) that just hold on their own (see the difference between American and British comedy). The new cast is....surprisingly delightful, they have this chemistry that works with them when they're together, however if they're not together and you have individual scenes or sequences with them, they aren't as interesting and they're a bit dull at certain points except for of course a few exceptions. KATE MCKINNON, was absolutely the best part about the film and is the total exception, the scenes alone with her, plus the scenes with her interacting with the group were all quirky and outlandish. Chris Hemsworth is also a standout in the film as you may have probably guessed and he plays the idiot which may turn some people off but the film handled him pretty accordingly and all his scenes were appreciable at best. He totally gives the most laughs and that means the film does do something special with such a stereotypical idiot character so I can't really complain here. Is it faithful to the original? Well firstly this should've even be a category in a review since it's only fitting to have this film stand on it's own objectively given how much variety and twists to the original film this one made, so I won't bother with this and just talk to you about the cameos and references. The cameos and references were more or less (like the jokes) a hit or miss, some felt forced, some are just downright surprising, and some were just there for the sake of being there, but the film doesn't tangle itself up to go completely halting the film just for the sake of intertextuality. The visual effects for me are (and this will be an unpopular choice but bear with me) unique, stylish and vivid that's just like how it is in cartoons which is going to obviously going to be appalling for some people. There's a lot to like with how colorful and vibrant each design for the ghosts are however when in action with the Ghostbusters, they WILL look off for some people, but some will not mind.So what's so horrible about this film? Well for starters, lots of people will complain about how the villain has no depth and his motivations were rushed for the sake of developing the Ghostbusters more, which I would most probably agree with as well but I thought he was serviceable enough because it felt like there was nothing else more to know about him other than what the film gave us. Like I said, there are a lot of things that are either a hit or miss in this film, the jokes, the subtle nods, and the characters will all be judged accordingly by you and it may be a good thing or a bad thing. The pacing for this film actually drags at the start and doesn't get to the point real quick. There would be scenes wherein they talk for an abnormal amount of time without establishing something important and then something integral to the plot appears 3 minutes later. The final third act is also pretty reminiscent of the original and it's going to be generic for some people which can be bothering. BUT THE BIGGEST FLAW this film did is create such an enormous backlash and hate from people thus creating preconceived notions. Try and going into this film with an open minded, I saw it with 7 people, 2 of which haven't seen the original and they all enjoyed it and was thoroughly surprised. This film will only being good will only depend on you, so cheers and have fun with it :)Verdict: 7.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My 100 Honest Review of Ghostbusters (2016) (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright guys, I've just got back from a screening of the new Ghostbusters film. It released here in Australia today and has been the subject of some pretty hefty controversy! We all know about the hate that this film received right of the gate, going as far as the trailer being one of the most disliked videos on Youtube. Granted, we didn't need a remake of one of the most beloved films of all time. Nobody asked for a remake but we've got one. Let me just say right out of the gate: I could not care about the "stunt casting" that many people have condemned about this film. Women or Men, the casting does not make a difference to me as I believe that gender does not necessarily have a specific role in film (unless the script calls for it). Additionally, I'm going to say that I was not a hater on the internet who had damned the film before it came out - I did, however, go in with low expectations because of the poor marketing of the film. Finally, I will not be comparing any of this film to the original in terms of quality, as we know that that's a losing battle! Now that that's over, onto the review! Paul Feig is quite a decent director. Having directed more than a few episodes of one of my favourite T.V. shows (The U.S. Office), Bridesmaids which was a massive success, the less successful but still perfectly watchable The Heat and last years brilliant Spy, I was completely interesting in seeing Feig's take before going into this film. Let me just say, this has Feig's fingerprints all over it. If you're not a fan of Feig's style or comedy - BACK AWAY! Feig directs quickly and inserts some quite brilliant moments of humour into the film which comes very quickly and sharply. Unfortunately, most of the gags don't land and there is quite a bit of slapstick - which, to me, is the most laziest form of humour. For example, there is a scene where Holtzman (played by Kate McKinnon - easily the best new character of the bunch) is equipping the team with new weapons and Melissa McCarthy's Abby can't control the beam of the new Ecto-pack, which basically results in her being tossed around like a kid with a firehose for a good minute or two. To me, jokes like these aren't funny, are not intelligent and just feel straight out lazy. Let me touch on the cast really quickly. McCarthy is passable but she doesn't really bring anything new to the table. Kristen Wiig as Erin Gilbert is okay too and I have no bribes with her performance. She is the main character in this film and is our "in" into the film. Leslie Jones as Patty was, again, okay. I was initially concerned from the trailers that she's just going to be screaming the whole film and devolving into a stereotypical performance, but she was better than expected. Again, the standout of the new cast has to be Kate Mckinnon as Holtzman. Mckinnon brings a craziness to her character and is the "dark horse" of the new team. She has a certain energy that the others don't have and I'd love to see more of her! Chris Hemsworth as Kevin is another standout of the film. As seen from the trailers, he plays the idiotic receptionist and Hemsworth absolutely nails the performance, keeping his casual Australian accent. My favourite moment is when Wiig asks him not to listen to a conversation and Hemsworth responds with "I won't" covering his eyes. The villain, played by Neil Casey, is a bit of a misfire. He's just another lonely individual who has been bullied his whole life and ignored, wanting to get revenge - like Electro from The Amazing Spiderman 2 *shudder*. The cameos were brilliant! I expected the main Ghostbusters to make an appearance (R.I.P. Harold!) but I most certainly was not expecting Sigourney Weaver (stay during the credits) and Janine! Unfortunately there is not Rick Moranis though! The plot of the film is pretty basic and follows the basic structure of the original film. The ladies bust a ghost and are not belived by anyone in the city until more ghost run rampant after a maniac sets them loose. There's also moments where they're looking for a residence (which includes a moment with a certain Firehouse) and where they Mayor attempts to shut them down. These are familiar elements which are brought back here and they mostly work well as they did the first time around. The climax of the film is certainly fun and very CG heavy (as you'd expect from a $140m movie called Ghostbusters). Altogether, I was quite surprised with this remake! No it is not as good as the original by any stretch. But, is it fun? Yes. Is it entertaining? Yes. To me, that's all you need from a film like this! I give it a good 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike probably most of the reviewers on here currently, I actually saw the movie. It's good. It's funny. It's not perfect, but I really enjoyed it. It's not very plot heavy, but it's a lot of fun. Everyone looks like they enjoyed making the movie as well, the cast had a good chemistry. The pacing of the plot could be a bit better, but the pacing of the jokes makes up for it and helps carry it along. I can't compare it to the original, but if you like stuff like Parks &amp; Rec then you will probably like it. The technobabble got kind of tiring after the first scene. I also really enjoyed the prop and set design. I've started paying a lot of attention to that kind of thing in films and I thought everything looked very fitting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I scrolled through the reviews quickly and saw nothing but negativity. I needed to say my peace. I'm not a professional movie reviewer. I'm an average gal, and frankly I've never written a review on here before. So bear with me because this review will be more emotional than technical.Here's what I want to say about this film: It was hilarious. I had a smile on my face the entire time. I laughed until I cried. I cried from laughing more when talking about it on the drive home. And the first thing I wanted to do when I left the theater was go see it again.I know this is a remake of a classic movie so that opens it up to a lot of criticism. But do yourself a favor...pretend you're a kid again and go see this movie with the intention of just being entertained instead of picking apart every second of it. Just have fun.That being said I wanted to give a nod to a few aspects. The cameos are perfect. The ghosts look awesome. Kate McKinnon is my new girl crush, I loved every aspect of her performance. To me, she stole the show along with Chris Hemsworth who was unexpectedly one of the most hilarious characters. The only reason I rated it a 9/10 instead of a 10/10 was because it needed more Chris.I hope this helps some of you regular folk who aren't "professional" critics and I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did.Oh, and do yourself a favor and stay until the credits are over.</fullReview>

You were so loud and so persistent the cast &amp; director pretty much had no choice but to acknowledge you. I know you could have used that energy to focus on something you like, but you powered through and pitched a fit all over the internet.

It was a fun summer movie with a lot of good laughs &amp; even some scares. I really enjoyed how the main cast interacted with each other, they really have great chemistry. The characters were fleshed out and interesting. Kate McKinnon was one of the best parts. She had a fun energy a lot of funny lines. I will say that I didn't really like Chris Hemsworth's character. His dopey dumb guy act got old a little too quickly. Is this movie perfect? Of course not. But it's got heart and it's entertaining. And chances are if you're reading this review you already made up your mind one way or the other. At the very least, I hope that you are capable of understanding how another person could like a movie that you hate without accusing Sony of bribing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed feelings. Worth my ticket.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Ghostbusters 2016" - SPOILER FREE REVIEW: First off, I want to say I had mixed feelings going into this film. If anything here is considered a spoiler, then I want to warn you, just in case. But I gave it a shot so here goes... I want to say that I was a fan of the original 1984 Ghostbusters film starring Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd. However, it didn't really care for its sequel. For a while, I hadn't seen either film, and had already thought that a third film was already made. I do want to point out that I new who the Ghostbusters were because of my awesome cousin, who knows who he is, but that's not the point. When I heard plans for a third film were in the works, I figured I would watch the films and see how it could be done. Sadly, we lost Harold Ramis before such a film could be made. However, we got a new solution that was pulled out of nowhere, an all female Ghostbusters crew. I understand that there was a lot of Flak for this decision, as there were other solutions that could have been made, but it's too late for that now, although it would have been neat to see the other outcomes in some fashion. But enough of that. I was very open to see as to what a female version of the group would be like. We ended up with a very different idea than what we had in mind. I want to say that this film had a lot of fun moments. It brought back some of the classic elements we all know, well the Ghostbusters fans know, to the modern age. Some shots were well lit and most of the CGI effects that were the title creatures in the film were blended well for most scenes. Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy were rather enjoyable to watch, as I feel some of their previous roles, not including SNL, were unfavorable. I do want to say that I loved Chris Hemsworth's performance in this film. Although it's not anything magical, it is something worth seeing, as the way Chris Hemsworth portrays his character I feel is just too much for words, but I felt like I could laugh at anything he could have said that made sense in the instance of context. I want to say along with the more satisfying elements of the film, there were some nostalgic moments that were worth seeing. Some I wish had been shown a little longer, but hey, at least they made it in some form or fashion. Many familiar faces and places, but I won't say what they are. I do have some complaints though. There were some minor continuity errors that I caught, I will not say, but the average audience member wouldn't catch them right off the bat. Some repetitiveness with some score that I wish had only been used for more "inspiring moments" in the film. I want to also point out I didn't laugh as much as I wanted to. I supposed it may have been the execution of the jokes. I did;t really care for Kate McKinnon's character for the majority of the film, although she gets a little more tolerable in the later parts of the story. I don't have many words for Leslie Jones, my feelings for her character are half and half; as I feel that she wasn't really needed for this film, but I can let that slide for the most part. The villain seemed to be forgettable, but did have some interesting plot points. My main complaint is the first half of the film. It felt a little fast for what I knew it could have been. The first half of the film had little character development but that character development pays off somewhat and could possibly be expanded upon in a future title, granted if this film makes as much as the studio hopes. Anyway, the first half of the film felt somewhat out of place for the classic style we're used to, but the second half makes it all mostly better and worth the ticket I paid for. I do also want to point out that this film is a little harder for me to rate, as I have mixed feelings about the film. I may not be saying everything that I want to say, but I can certainly say that my good/bad scale is at an even 50/50. And last, I want to say that this film isn't as bad as the internet wants the film to be. Yes, the first half of the film is a bit unfavorable, but it's equally as enjoyable as a whole. Not many folks will agree with my positive notes, but hey, to each is their own. I enjoyed this film for what it was, a mostly enjoyable summer flick with mixes of action, supernatural themes, and nostalgia mixed with a modern twist. MY RATING: 6.7-7.2 Stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I ENJOYED MOVIE AS HECK. Everyone who hated it/did not enjoy it is fat and has bad taste! Sorry! Facts only! Very funny movie. Great casting. Great dialogue. A few editing or writing issues. BUT! The movie was fantastic, my friends. I am not sure what else to add to this review but IMDb will not allow me to post this if it does have ten lines of text. just know- my recommendation is a positive one and the only way you'd leave feeling disappointed is if you are a fat ugly pig with ugly kids who have bad skin and can't read! Like I said my sisters- facts ONLY! So go ahead and spend $50 on 3 tickets to a 3D version! It's not worth it (the 3D bit) but that is LIFE! And life is not fair. However- this movie is great. Loved Cecily Strong's little appearance. Queen of cameos in movies starring her co-workers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its new, its different, and its definitely Ghostbusters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They nailed it. The right amount of new while giving the perfect amount of a wink and a nudge to the original with all the original cast showing up. Well except for one. The humor in it is spot on. Some of it is geared towards women, which IMHO is not a problem and is funny as hell. Chris Hemsworth is a brainless beefcake bimbo and it just works even though it's a little over the top. The one thing missing is the subtle jokes. The original had then all over the place. This movie? Not so much. Example. The scene where the boys are in the hotel and zip the maid cart?..what the hell are you doing? Sorry, we thought you were someone else. Laughed my ass off. It wasn't a major joke, but adds to the overall movie. There really wasn't much of that in this movie. The thing that feels weird is having modern technology in the movie. It just feels off and it's because the last movie was in the 80's. Referencing the internet, blogs, YouTube in Ghostbusters is just weird because of how old the series is. But also trying to fit the ladies into the mold of the original 4 causes....its difficult to classify. You expect they are going to behave a certain way and don't. Because you think oh that is Egon's character?..umm nope. It results in making the movie feel off. And it's not because they are women. Or the movie is bad. Even if they were men the result would be the same. We've lived with the same 4 characters for pretty much a generation. If new characters had come in, in the 90's it wouldn't have been a problem. But after so long of a period Ray, Peter, Egon and Winston ARE THE Ghostbusters. It's what you come to expect. I also suspect after a few viewings these new 'busters will be just fine. It's like a new couch....there is a break in period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why the hate? The theater I was in laughed a lot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading these comments it seems like some of these people saw a completely different move. We all laughed out loud more than most movies I've seen in a while. I'm tempted to give it a 10 just to balance out the inexplicable 1's, but I think 8 is right.This is a reboot not sequel. I think it would have been more entertaining to have the original crew handing off the franchise to replacements. But, It takes place in a world where the first movies never happened. There's some slight retreading of original story elements especially in the beginning. But, that's my only real complaint.It's well paced, gives you some ghostly encounters while moving through forming up the team and keeps consistent laughs though the whole length.The effects are well rendered and visually interesting with colors and creepy designs. There's new ghost fighting gadgets.There's at least some homage to almost all the familiar faces in cameos.It's well worth your summer movie dollars, unless you just can't stand women leads on screen. Apparently that's been an issue here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you check out the profile of the votes, it would be no surprise that females rated this movie much better than males.Most of my guy friends have refused to watch this movie and are dissing it purely based on the fact that the cast is all female. Seriously, what a lousy reason? I enjoyed the movie. I had a good laugh. Actually, I had many good laughs. And so did the whole theatre. The effects were good, the chemistry of the cast was good, the jokes landed. I loved the movie! I don't think it deserves the thrashing people (mostly men) have been giving it.The only reason I gave it 9/10 instead of 10/10 was that the solution seemed a little too easy. In any case, I still think the movie is worth watching and doesn't deserve such a low rating!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Expected To Hate This Movie... I LOVED It!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just wanna start off by saying that most of the negative reviews on here are from people who haven't yet seen the movie, who hate the direction it went in with an all female cast, and generally just hate that they remade one of their childhood favourites and are butthurt, so ignore them.Ever since the first trailer came out I thought this looked awful, me and some of my work colleagues talked about how unfunny it looked and how some of the scenes looked cringe- worthy. The day it came out in England I had a chance to see it for free - from what I thought the movie was gonna be like there would have been no way in hell I would've paid to see it, but it was free, my friends wanted to see it and I do like Wigg, McCarthy and Hemsworth so thought I might as well go. I am so glad that I did. The movie is nothing like what I expected, it was actually funny, it had so many great references to the original and it was just an all-round fun movie! I was gutted when it finished since I wanted more. All the cast are brilliant and have their own hilarious moments and one liners, especially Hemsworth who was hilarious. I loved trying to spot the cameos from the old cast. My only nitpick is the 3rd act where it did get a little bit CGI heavy, but even still it was fun to watch and still had laugh out loud moments - the whole audience were in stitches throughout the whole film. I'll definitely be buying this on DVD when it is released. I also wanna mention that the comedy in this film is very much like the directors previous films (Bridemaids, Spy and The Heat, all of which I loved) so if you didn't enjoy those 3 movies or find them funny, you probably won't like the humour in Ghostbusters - but if you did, you'll love this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I don't leave feed back on movies because I find it stupid to sit at a computer and express my opinion on great art as movies because movies are an art form that is created for entertainment value. So I don't get on message boards and say if I love a movie or if I hate it, I just watch them because I love movies. but now that that's out of the way, I'm going to talk about the new Ghostbusters reboot. Sense I was a little kid I've loved comics and grew up loving comics, one of the huge things I was into as a child was Ghostbusters. Saw both original films and loved them, collected all the toys (still have them) also have the old cartoon on VHS and I still love the Ghostbusters to this day. When I heard this movie was getting made and saw what was being put into it I was upset. I didn't want to see this movie based off of what I was seeing in the trailers and I wanted to boycott it. Well last night my brother &amp; I got tickets after he asked me if I wanted to go, I wasn't going to go at first because I was going to see it later on when it would go out of theaters or to the cheap theater but I went. At first we went to the 3D and it wasn't working at all the 3D format of it was all messed up and wouldn't focus, so my brother &amp; I went to the 8:30pm showing and at this point seeing the first 5- 10min of the movie I was thinking maybe I shouldn't stay for an 8:30pm showing because I have work the next day. Well I stayed and boy am I happy I did. The movie was so funny I laughed out loud on every joke and the throwbacks to the original films were great. I was laughing so hard that I couldn't breath at one point. I had so much fun in this movie that it could possibly be the most fun I had all summer. There were some points that I was clapping and so excited to see the ghost on the screen that I forgot about the Ghostbusters being women. If you are just judging this movie based on the trailers, please don't it deserves a chance for sure and everyone bashing this movie hasn't even given it that chance yet. It's family friendly and it's a blast. I hope that everyone will give the reboot a chance because I did and it was worth it for sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not in the movie but in all the negativity around this. Dudes, you're making us look like the idiot guys in the very movie you're hating on. Truly a sad time to be a male user on IMDb. But alas, I digress. It's harmless summer fun. Not super great, not super bad. Compared to the other movies released this summer however, it's a godsend. With Cafe Society not playing anywhere close, what else is there to see? ID4 2? Please.My advice is to go in with an open mind and laugh, because it's pretty funny. Aside from that, it's just a well made film. Good effects, acting, plot, characters. It all makes sense.Is it as good as the original? Hell no!The strongest point I think was the use of 3D. The 3D did things JC said not to do, sort of assault the eye. It worked in this case, with the ghosts and the slime. Truly a fun summer movie!7.6, round up to 8 for IMDbFull Discloure-I'm not a feminist, however I use to be until I realized the lack of respect most women have for feminist men and the absurdity of that notion. Since that realization I am kind of a women lib hater type...kind of.

		<shortDescription>Tired of the sexist hate against this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ghostbusters ReviewPositives -An overall funny film that manages to stand up on its own in terms of laughs. Several quick one-liners keep the laughs going throughout the entire film, starting with the first lines of the opening scene -Despite what people (fukboys) were trying to claim, the female led cast prove they are just as talented if not more than the guys. These characters were not female versions of the original group, with each one carrying their own personality and characteristics -Kate McKinnon is the real stand out, with her quirky mannerisms and oddball antics keeping the comedy train rolling from the moment her character (the brains behind the devices seen in the film) steps in -While not necessarily scary, the effects used to create the ghosts is extremely impressive and marks a very noticeable improvement since the 80s -Most importantly, the movie is fun. During the climatic act three battle between the Ghostbusters and an army of ghosts, i literally felt a sensation of happiness wash over me. Double points for Kate McKinnon being the person on screen when that happened -Nostalgia plays into the movie, but is only partially slammed down your throat (more on that later). These come in the form of subtle little nods. The team being unable to afford the original firehouse (Rent is 21,000 a month), the appearance of Slimer as well as everyones favorite marshmallow manNegatives -Nostalgia overload. Having a few subtle jabs and prods at the original is one thing. Having literally every surviving cast member of the original team (minus Rick Moranis sadly) make random cameo experiences is another. I have nothing against cameos, mind you. But it took away from the film, making me wonder Hey Who is going to show up next instead of focusing on the movie. -Not That Scary. Despite being mainly a comedy, the original Ghostbusters had some decent scary moments, mainly with Zul and those demon dogs. The reboot has some moments that could be scary, but the comedy defuses the tension -Weak Ass Villain. Speaking of Zul, Zul was a boss villain. Which is something the remake lacks. We are given a stereotypical loser creepy guy who just wants revenge on society. Which is weak. -Hemsworth. Hemsworth's dumb but pretty secretary character (an obvious jab at the female equivalent) plays a gag that quickly becomes tired. It isn't until the Third Act that the Kevin character becomes a more important piece in the plot and the gag ends. OVERALL SCORE: 8/10. A solid, funny movie handled well by a powerful female cast but doesn't quite live up to the mammoth expectations shadowing over it by the original. Also, screw the meninist losers who went on IMDb days before the movie even premiered and wrote bad reviews without giving any details as to why.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so i feel compelled to write a review because all i am seeing is people bashing this movie for rebooting a classic (and what a classic) but most of all from an all female cast. I'll try to be as unbiased an honest as possible.Cast - I thought it was a great cast, I'm a big fan of Kirsten Wigg, I've never really liked Melissa McCarthy, although i had secretly enjoyed Identity Theft, the other two did their roles well. About the stereotypical black "hell no's"? yes i thought it was a little over the top, but i felt Leslie Jones character brought much more to the team than Winston who "was willing to believe anything as long as their was a paycheck". Back to Melissa, i thought she was brilliant at delivering the technoblabble, although i'd like to see how many takes. Kate McKinnon's character had a real dangerous psycho edge which i liked, total opposite of the nerd which was Egon.Chris Hemsworth, really? His lines were embarrassing, was he meant to be a male bimbo? I don't think there are people that stupid to think they hear our of their eyes. Without spoiling anything, watch the credits and say to yourself, why was that cut from the movie???Overall, when the movie was very sciency, it was good, when science went out of the window, which it did for about 20 minutes, i felt the movie lost its way, and i think those 20 minutes is what most people are judging the movie on. The bad guy just wasn't good enough and that for me was the let down.How about the cameos, they weren't too bad, i don't think they were awkward and a nice nod to Harold Ramis who sadly passed away before this was made.I think when it comes out on blue ray, we might get to see a proper cut of the film, i really hope so. The credits scene is in the WRONG place.All in all, give it a chance, don't see it as the childhood spoiler that everyone is saying it is, i was a child when the original came out</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't listen to all the hate out there for this movie. Is it the classic that the 1984 movie is? No, but then neither was it in 1984.This is a worthy remake with a lot of humor and its own story. The leads are great without being copies of the original team and the cameos are just perfect, not too much, not too little. Lots and lots of references to the original film, of course. Worth seeing it again just to try to catch the ones I missed the first time. I also liked the tow or three oblique asides to the coordinated attack on this movie from misogynists online; subtle, but amusing.For little kids, the ghosts are pretty scary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think I can ever say I have seen such controversy online surrounding a movie for so long before it's release although you get a sense that this surge of negativity may help the film as it has been front and centre for months now.As for the film I thoroughly enjoyed it. Is it perfect? No, but it did make me laugh throughout and most can be forgiven as long as a comedy makes you laugh. Although I enjoyed the film and found it both funnier and more frightening than he original i do feel it lacks the magic touch that would have allowed it to become a classic.Pro's 1. The chemistry between the four women was very natural and enjoyable to watch. 2. The film had good pacing, if on the rare occasion a joke missed the mark a funnier one was always around the corner. 3. Theeffects and in particular the 3D were fantastic, easily the best use of 3D I have seen in a movie. 4. Kate McKinnon. Her action sequence alone made me fall in love with her character. 5. Chris Hemsworth offers a great comedic turn even if his character sometimes becomes 'too' stupid. 6. The throwbacks. Even though I am not overly familiar with the original I appreciated the odd cameo to the original. 7. Real heroes. The four women are ordinary people who are heroes because they needed to be not because they had to prove themselves. 8. The end battle featured 'actual' action sequences something missing from the original.9. The credits. You actually wanted to sit through the entire credits due to the effects and extra clips they showed and they then reward you with an after credits scene a la Marvel. 10. The film is genuinely scary with some conjuring like moments.Con's1. The villain was a major disappointment and very basic. His reasoning was something that has been done over and over and lowered the quality of the second half of the film. 2. There was no real introduction to Melissa McCarthy or Kristen Wiigs's characters. 3. The film doesn't help itself with its references to the 'online haters'. 4. It portrays nearly everyone apart from the four Ghostbusters as idiots both men and women. 5. Occasionally the cinematography is lacking, especially from a film with a budget well north of $100 million.Overall though the film is a fun and enjoyable experience with multiple laugh out loud moments and a few scary ones thrown in for good measure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My opinion of Ghostbusters: I thought it was an amazing movie, but it doesn't come close to the original. I generally don't like Leslie Jones, but she was good in this movie.Kate Mckinnon plays a hilarious and quirky lab assistant to Melissa McCarthy who play a genuinely funny scientist. Kristin Wiig plays a professor at a college who show her character so brilliantly. Chris Hemsworth plays the good-looking stupid guy so well. This is a much watch for any person that loved the Original Ghostbusters and wants to something funny. It was full excitement all the way through and I had goosebumps throughout the whole movie. The original cast all make a cameo at some point (Exluding Harold Ramis because he's dead and Rick Moranis because he's retired) I honestly cannot wait for the sequel. I would definitely recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is not as bad or as good as it could be. I do not understand all the hate, there are a lot worse movies out there. There are numerous films that are released that focus only on the male characters but when it's reversed the film is judged really harshly so maybe a lot of the negative reviews are pure sexism - how dare a film treat men the way women often are. I can only vaguely remember seeing the original ghostbusters so I can't really compare the two but this was okay. The audience when I saw it laughed and appeared as though they had enjoyed it as they were leaving the cinema. I did think the movie started a bit slow but Chris Hemsworth was great in his role, I think he is possibly the best part of the movie. Melissa Mcarthy was a lot more subtle in this than she usually is which I know some people will see as a positive thing.Overall it was a dumb and fun film to kill 2 hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hilarious and fun paranormal comedy reboot!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The rebooted paranormal comedy is a great re-imagining of the classic film. The film rides its raucous energy right through to the credits with top-notch comics and stunning special effects. It's ridiculous this film received so much backlash but I think once general audiences see it, it will garner the appropriate praise it deserves. The story is merely backdrop for the hilarious cast to do what they do best enhanced by special effects that actually utilize the 3-D technology. The story is only partly similar to the originals but takes its own course with Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) working for tenure at Columbia University when she is confronted by a scared museum house owner because she once published a book on ghosts. This book brings her to her co- author and old friend Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy). Abby has proceeded with her ghost- hunting finding a new assistant in Jillian Holtzman (Kate McKinnon). They lose their funding and set up a business to hunt for ghosts. A nefarious plot is afoot and when subway attendant Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones) stumbles upon it, she brings it to the attention of the three physicists.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com</fullReview>

No. Will I show it to my children with the same enthusiasm that I'll introduce them to the first one with? No. Did I like it? Yeah. I did. I really liked it. Seeing this movie did not ruin my childhood. I did not feel angry that women were Ghostbusters. I do not think any less of the first movie, because that's not how any of this works! This was a DECENT movie. There were some very funny jokes, and some very funny moments. It was fun. It was entertaining. Patty's character wasn't great, and yeah, some of the jokes fell flat. But seriously name me one movie where you like every single character and joke. Don't go see it if you knew you weren't going to like it in the first place, why waste your money like that, doofus?

End of review.My word, there is some agenda-driven poison in many of the comments here. The original movies haven't been destroyed: they are still there, so you can watch them if you didn't like this one. And as for the man-hating - which of the male characters in the original were so great? Much of the criticism here is just as unfair as the pre-release hostility.Go and see it with an open mind - it's fun.

		<shortDescription>A great summer movie-ignore the haters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the film last night at a Thursday preview with my sister. I have not seen the original Ghostbusters, but this remake I felt captured the spirit (no pun intended) of the original film franchise from all the press I have read regarding men who can't deal with women being able to do anything a man has done since the dawn of time.Anyway, the film was a blast. All four leads were hilarious and lots of loud laughter could be heard throughout the theater I was in. Chris Hemsworth was great as the lovable moron secretary Kevin. The pacing was , and even the ghosts can give you a bit of a jump. I'm not sure if it was intentional, but there was lots of jokes and such in the later part of the film that could be read as digs to the wimps who kvetch about things behind a keyboard that they haven't even seen yet. The humor was effortless and sharp, though in two occasions it was a bit drawn out. The subtle nods to the original franchise were subtle and appropriate and *spoiler* the film was dedicated to Harold Ramis, the Ghostbusters actor who died a few years back. He even got a cameo as a bust in the first few minutes of the film.All in all a great summer movie to just relax and escape life for two hours. Ignore the haters and prepare for a good time at the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While I'm Sick to Death of Reboots, This One ROCKED!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those comic dynamos Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones &amp; Chris Hemsworth (why not, men can be funny too!) did their hysterical best in Paul Feig's Ghostbusters reboot.Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy play old friends/paranormal book co- authors who reunite when a ghost shows up at a mansion. Kate McKinnon is McCarthy's current work partner. When they all wind up unemployed at the same time, they decide to work together as more ghost sightings are reported. Leslie Jones is a transit worker/Manhattan expert who joins them after she sees a ghost in the subway.The ghosts/demons appear having been "summoned" by a disaffected white boy (who'd probably bitch mightily about a gender-changed Ghostbusters reboot) named Rowan, creepily played by Neil Casey, who's working as a well-dressed janitor in an art deco Manhattan hotel.The chemistry between the leads and their secretary Kevin (Chris Hemsworth) is very funny and the special effects are striking throughout.There are a few missteps in the movie, either due to some minor problems in the script or possibly with the editing. Ghosts sometimes appear in very public locations and are even filmed by people on their smart phones, yet city officials seem to be able to convince people that they are fakes. A minor character is thrown out of a window onto a street, and it's not at all clear what happened to him. If he'd been killed, it would have been an issue for the women. There are some continuity issues here and there.But, on the whole the movie works well, is very entertaining, and sets up the cast for a possible sequel. Would love to see "the mentor" very much involved if there is a sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I normally don't take the time to write movie reviews, nor do I say something is a 10/10 without really meaning it. And after looking at these reviews I can't believe people are saying such terrible things. So I must say - THIS WAS A GREAT MOVIE. If you like any of these actresses, you will enjoy how their individual humor feeds off one another and makes them one hell of a quartet. People crying man-bashing movie? OH PLEASE GROW UP. Then there's Kevin. He's hysterical in his own, goofy right. Also if you like the original (as it is one of my favorite movies) you will enjoy this. People saying it's a carbon copy of the original? HARDLEY. Yeah it's about people saving the world catching ghosts as the original does, but isn't that the point of a reboot? Other than that the story is completely its own. It pays homage to the original with a familiar (YET DIFFERENT) soundtrack and just the right amount of familiar faces! The CGI was great, the humor was great (I laughed and at times couldn't stop), the cast's chemistry was great, and it even made me jump a few times (although I'm quite easily scared). Overall it is definitely worth seeing! I would see it again in theaters. And I will be buying the DVD. I don't get all these bad reviews. So do yourself a favor and ignore them and go see this movie. PS stay until the VERY VERY end of the credits. You can thank me later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Reboot!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I watched this movie on opening day with my husband, as I was really excited to see a Ghostbusters movie with a female cast. I have never watched any of the originals, or the TV shows, so I come to this with fresh eyes.I was not disappointed at all. The characters were funny, the writing was great and the comedic acting top-notch. I posted my views on Facebook and was immediately attacked by fans of the original. Because apparently my views don't count unless I have watched and worshipped the original.I checked IMDb to see the reviews and was astonished to see how badly this movie was rated. I read the reviews to understand why people saw this movie so differently from me, and with a few exceptions, my conclusion is that there is likely a concerted effort to trash this movie online by fanboys and fangirls, maybe because of sexism, maybe because of nostalgia. Who knows. There are people who are praising Chris Hemsworth as the saving grace of this movie, and I simply don't understand why - his character was mostly pointless. There are people who are putting down Kristen Wiig's and Kate McKinnon's comedic skills down. Again, which I don't get, because they are both flawless. Kate McKinnon was fantastic, and I would watch the movie again just for her.So, here's my review. This movie was great, for a Hollywood action blockbuster. This is not an Oscar-worthy movie, but nothing from the Ghostbusters movie was ever going to be Oscar-worthy anyway. But, if you want to watch a fun action movie with strong female leads who kick ass and kill some ghosts with fancy guns, this is the movie for you. This is the Hollywood action movie of the 21st century - with badass women and awesome CGI effects. And male eyecandy thrown in for good measure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay it wasn't bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone who's a fan of the original Ghostbusters this movie was actually really good. It was surprisingly hilarious and the girls did really well. A lot of people are getting mad because the main male of the story is a stereotype and of course the protagonists are women. Most movies are the other way around. The girl is the stereotype and the guys get to save the world. Most girls don't have Role Models such as these very powerful actresses. The production with the best possible route it could have gone with Chris Hemsworth. You often see movies go the complete opposite. For once a man was hired because of his looks and not a woman. Men seem to get so upset when roles are switched. How do you think women feel on a daily basis? It must be so hard to only have one stereotyped character for your gender. Now you know exactly how women everywhere feel. Now the casting of this movie was genius. There were four completely different women all very powerful actresses and they completely rocked it. Not to mention the different body types of each woman. It's a dream come true for a girl who has only seen over-sexualized women in the role of the hero. Why is everyone getting so upset that women are doing great things? And don't even bring up that mostly men watch stuff like this because there are plenty of girls out there that got over excited to finally see something to represent us. This movie is really wonderful. Is it perfect? No, but it's one of the best movies to come out in a long time. If you don't believe me go look at some of the professional reviews of people who actually watched this movie because some of these reviews looked like some dude pulled stuff from the previews and judged the movie before even watching it. This movie is full of role model worthy women and awesome action so do yourself a favor and watch it!</fullReview>

Also I loved how they use the nostalgia wisely and give a lot of great moments for the fans. I saw it on IMAX and the FX and colors were amazing. It is fast, fun, feminist, smart, old and new at same time. Much more than what I was expected. And Kate McKinnon's character is just amazing, unique, smart, fun, weird, and even kind of hot: the whole package. I really enjoy it and I am looking forward for the sequel ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't usually like remakes but this one was great. It was funny and just the right amount of cheesy and quirky fun to bring Ghostbusters to a new generation! If you expect a serious factual scientific movie... Then why go to something named Ghostbusters? If you want a fun well done remake of an 80's film... Go see this one! I watched the old film first which might have been helpful. The four female leads feel smart, quirky, and played off each other the entire film. Kate McKinnon did a particularly great job. It felt like they gave her a general character profile, maybe a couple of actual lines and let her run with the rest of it using her SNL experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't typically do reviews here on IMDb, but from the way this film is being treated I felt that it was time I did. This is of course a matter of pure opinions, so not everyone is going to agree or be right. However, I really don't understand the hate this movie is getting at all. Right now, it seems people are trying to spam the boards with negative reviews of this film so I know my opinion here will quickly be refuted and dissected. Therefore, I'm going to say what I think needs to be said. I love the originals, they're great cult classics. However, let's be honest, we're allowed to attempt to rekindle and improve on past works. We're not stuck to history only happening one way. And thus I'm glad this is one movie that was rebooted and done. Yes, part of me had mixed feelings about this as most anyone will because change isn't always for the better. But I kept an open-mind and frankly, it was pretty damn hard not to as when women finally got to be Ghostbusters too.I don't know what happened, but clearly I am different from half the others who went to see this movie because I left the movie with the same tingly feelings the originals left me with, that thrilling feeling of "man I wish I could be a ghostbuster too!" They kicked butt, they told jokes, and they made it look good. In fact, in my opinion I felt that they improved quite a lot in these films, via the pacing, the jokes, the characters (growth and inclusion), and more. I especially liked the cameos and I also felt the effects did justice to the campy originals without making the ghosts look too surreal (Having recently re-watched them, I really liked the throwbacks to the realistic then cartoon-like throwbacks).One thing I would like to bring up and agree with is that Patty's character was pretty much a mix of racially stereotyped black women, but I have high hopes they will listen and fix that in the second one. Yes, I know, I am hoping here, but I believe it deserves it. To anyone who truly has an open-mind and excitement for a continuation of these classics, I ask you to try to give it a chance, you may love it like I did.</fullReview>

It's not Star Wars, people, the CGI is fun!Be sure to watch the "bit characters" closely for familiar faces. The music was surprisingly good, but what could possibly be bad about anything that involves Elle King. Do stay through the credits. There's a piece at the end that is stellar.Wigg and McCarthy are very believable besties, and McKinnon pulls off psycho scientist well. It's Leslie Jones who steals the show. Neil Casey was less pleasant, but I don't know if it was his acting or the character. See it in 3D if you get the chance.</fullReview>

Leslie Jones and Chris Hemsworth were the stand outs for me. They were both hilarious. All the surviving cast did a cameo with the exception of Rick Moranis. Bill Murray was awesome, and I almost didn't recognize Dan Aykroyd. There were lots of nods to the original. The Staypuftt marshmallow man makes an appearance. Overall a solid movie.

		<shortDescription>Ghostbusters was a great revival of a beloved franchise for a new generation. Solid, Funny Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of the original movies, a die-hard since childhood, I love this new film for what it is - a reimagining of Ghostbusters (1984) with updated humor, culture, and effects. The actresses are definitely some of the best women to grace the big screen, and they proved that in this film. Kate McKinnon and Chris Hemsworth take the show, along with some familiar faces from our past. This reincarnation of Ghostbusters is a great way to bring the franchise to new audiences, such as our children. My wife and I prescreened the movie before letting the family join, and we will definitely be going a 2nd time in the coming weeks. If you are on the fence about going to this reboot, just think of the idea that Ghostbusters may not survive and continue on for future generations without this film. If you care at all about the movies that drove your childhood, don't suppress them, encourage them so we can have Ghostbusters for our children and their children, etc. This film is definitely up to par with the original franchise, and the throwbacks are all the more reason why this is fan candy. Go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't deserve all the hate.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ghostbusters is far from a great movie but it does not deserve the hate it received. The plot follows four women in New York that band together to save New York from the supernatural. The overall acting is alright no outstanding comedic performances but I do think the actresses on screen had great chemistry. To be honest I did not laugh that much while watching the movie. Lots of the jokes are loud and in your face but the few funny ones are subtle and quiet. The most praise-worthy thing I can say is the movies pacing. I cant remember any time during the movie where I was bored.It kept moving like a film like this should be doing. My negatives with the movie were ( like i said) was the script and that I didn't find myself laughing that much and I had one small issue with Kate McKinnon's character. Overall I enjoyed my time with the movie and I was really surprised. Is it great? No. Is it awful? No6.8</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was only 5 when the first Ghostbusters came out. I used to dance around and sing the theme song.. the second was good but not as good as the first.. I Agree with Bill Murray on that aspect. After waiting for about 27 years for another Ghostbusters I had almost given up.. and then.. it came.. To any true Ghostbusters fan: this is just an amazing franchise comeback with a hilarious female cast. The audience laughed hysterically as I did and clapped their hands when one of the old characters showed up. I had my doubts however after seeing it tonight I really don't know if they could have done it better. Some critics will get swallowed up in the details but they are just doing their job. The outcome was much more than I expected I loved the new spin-off and it definitely opens up the franchise for possibly another... which is what I was hoping for.. Very well done. MUST SEE!! I want to watch it again...</fullReview>

We had free tickets to Gold Class and this was the only Child Care compatible showing, so we crossed our fingers and prepared for the worst. Maybe poor expectations are why we really enjoyed this film, but let me just break this down further. The movie was silly. So was the original. The ghosts were in general, not scary, nor realistic. Nor were they in the original. The characters were over the top... just like the original. So this was not original. It was however a silly, fun, amusing, and generally enjoyable return to the Ghostbusters franchise and totally undeserving of all the bad press.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meh, It's Okay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Short answer: Ghostbusters is okay. It's not great; it certainly doesn't hold a torch to the original, but I can see the argument upcoming generations will inevitably make when they swear it's better because "the special-effects are like, so much better". The story is okay, the acting is okay the direction is okay and with the sole standout being Kate McKinnon's ludicrously satisfying performance as the bat-s*** crazy Holtzmann, this franchise probably has the legs for a trilogy before fading into obscurity. Good job guys! Way to aim for the middle.Wait you want more? Fine; the film begins with particle physicist and tenure track professor Erin Gilbert (Wiig) finding her reputation besieged by the republishing of her paranormal manual. Manual co- author and fellow academic Abby Yates (McCarthy) has been using the funds from the book to fund her research into the metaphysical but thus far she's only paid for one tenth of a mini- fridge. Gilbert confronts Yates at her lab where we meet the third of four Ghostbuster teammates; Jillian Holtzmann. Yates and Holtzmann harangue Gilbert into an investigation of a creepy mansion, they see ghosts, New York history buff Patty (Jones) is added to the team later, yadda-yadda-yadda, ghosts take over New York City and they're the only ones who can stop them.Seasoned scribes Katie Dippold and director Paul Feig play the film smartly, leaning into the girl-power pluck and merrily taking aim at angry internet trolls and Ghostbros. And you know what; it works! Most of that pre-release vitriol is sprayed back at the constantly irate internet community, largely focusing on dweeby villain Rowan North (Casey) as the film's punchline. He's even got a bargain bin hate lair that rivals the childish clubhouse priggishness of Dr. Horrible's Sing-a-Long Blog (2008). The relationships between the characters and the various male-dominated institutions (academia, government, media, private industry) automatically endears the audience to them. You want them to succeed, you want them to mesh as a team and kick some level 5 apparition butt.A lot of the audience's goodwill dissipates by the time the film reaches it's second act. Fortunately none of this is the fault of the main four but rather the appearance of the unrealistically imbecilic Kevin (Hemsworth) and the downright distracting ghost skeptic character, Martin Heiss played by none other than Bill Murray. More than just a cameo, Murray's character seems to be a simultaneously redundant shout down of the haters and a rubber stamp by franchise guardians. In fact, large segments of the Ghostbusters originators make an appearances which are largely organic or at the very least mercifully short. Murray's appearance stands as a huge discord that in retrospect feels rather insulting.Thankfully the film sticks the landing with a third act loaded with visuals that can only be described as a special-effects bonanza. Paul Feig's abilities as an action director has thankfully improved since Spy (2015). Sure he's no John Woo but there are some reliable dynamics at play here. Plus he's one of the few people who can make Melissa McCarthy look like a bada**. And can we please take another moment to appreciate Kate McKinnon again. While others fall into painfully unfunny voids of improvised drivel, every single thing she does and says is at once unexpected and completely organic. The obvious comparisons would be labeling her as a proxy for the late great Harold Ramis (I collect spores), though her character's inability to take anything seriously is signature Bill Murray.It's hard to say within the context of today's knee-jerk, chauvinism tinged internet tantrums whether or not this film is really worth the price of admission. Admittedly I was one of the few who initially bulked at the idea of remaking something I still consider near perfect. But even if Ghostbusters was our worst fears made real, it still wouldn't have diminished the original. I say if film studios want to remake, reboot or retool old properties, even old classic properties, I say go for it. Spending all that money isn't going to guarantee box office. As it stands however Ghostbusters isn't our worst fears made real. In fact in comparison to most, it's actually quite okay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've heard the arguments of all sides. feminists are mad, other people are crazy, other people and liberal feminists are liking this this movie and DMCA people who do not share their viewpoint.. In short I've seen the whole soap opera surrounding the "new ghost busters".First let me congratulate the cast for doing a great job under extremely difficult circumstances ( like horribly bad script, hey even brad Pitt or Sean Connery couldn't make this movie look good with the current script). There were some funny kind of slapstick jokes in there but overall the script was guano crazy (not in a good way). yes there are stereotypes in the movie but hey its a movie! Watch and enjoy ( though for me, the horrible script ruined the experience). That said the cast was great but the bad script is what ruined the experience and the movie for me.CGI is also not the best and the colors seem to belong on a cheap China toy. Sigh another disappointment .. kinda. Now the movie isn't all that bad as some anti ghostbusters ( current movie) make it out to be. It all depend what you expect of the movie. Is it the same witty zingers as the original ghostbusters? No. Is it entertaining? That is something you have to decide yourself. I found it OK ( that is why i gave it a 6/10). Is it worth seeing in the movie theater or waiting until it is available to stream or on blue ray? I suggest you all wait until it appears on netflix, hulu, prime or other streaming services or even if you want to spend money on it buy the blue ray. In my humble opinion it is not its money's worth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We just saw it in 3D and really enjoyed it. The special effects were good--especially in 3D, and we laughed when we were supposed to. Kate McKinnon and Chris Hemsworth steal the film. We liked the music, too (there are several versions of the classic song). We heard a couple of people say "that was great" and "that was fun" as we were walking out of the theater. It's a typical summer movie, and if you see it, the 3D is some of the best I've seen in a long time--reminded me of the 1980s 3D seen in films like Friday THE 13th PART III in 3D, JAWS 3D, and AMITYVILLE 3D--lots of pop-out effects including the proton streams and the ghosts themselves. Let's put it this way--we see 2 or more movies every week during the summer (I am still trying to get the smell of that awful INDEPENDENCE DAY: RESURGENCE 3D off me.) This film was one of the most fun---it's an old-fashioned summer, popcorn muncher, just the kind of film I wanted after a hectic week at work. By the way, stay through all the credits.</fullReview>

Plenty of winks to the original, for old fans, although it's by no means inaccessible to new fans.It's not a perfect film per se, but it is as enjoyable as any I've seen this year. 10 stars might be a bit of an exaggeration, but no more so than all the 1 star reviews.Stay for the whole credit sequence.

		<fullReview>I went into this expecting to be disappointed, but the flaws were few and ultimately forgettable. The chemistry between the actors was smile- inducing, the action scenes were thrilling (McKinnon needs her own solo action franchise), I laughed quite a bit and even teared up a little at the end. The CGI, which I didn't care for in the trailers (The disparity between the finished product and those trailers is a little shocking), worked really well with the 3D and had some spookily beautiful moments. The writing could have been sharper in places, but my major gripe was the claustrophobic letterbox format; I left my seat to find an usher because I thought there was a projection problem. Just NO to that in the sequels. Sum up: Fun, scary and satisfying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going into this movie I had heard poor reviews and such- mostly from crazed fan boys who are still clinging to ye olde Ghostbusters and don't want anything new, or some guys here or there that can't abide the Ghostbusters being women, basically morons are spreading word that it's terrible, when it's the opposite. I've seen ye olde Ghostbusters, and for the time when it was made it was great, but this new rendition of the Ghostbusters blew it out of the water. it has a great plot, somewhat better than that of the old Ghostbusters with a story that felt very grounded in society as it is now. It has great characters, who were impressively written, and had me laughing out loud the entire movie. Kate McKinnon was a particular stand out. Her portrayal as the experimental physicist / tech genius Jillian Holtzmann who was quirky, intelligent and badass all at the same time was brilliant and had me loving every scene she was in. The humour in the movie is very akin to that of the original Ghostbusters, though modernised, and with the cast including members from Saturday Night Live the hilarity was to be expected, just somehow it exceeded my expectations.Out of the many movies I've watched this year, which include a list of all the superhero movies that have come out so far, and a few movies like 'Now You See Me 2' and others like 'How To be single', this was more enjoyable, I plan on re-watching it next week.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suck it, haters. This movie was a stitch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So instead of crying in my basement all butt-hurt about my shattered childhood while mom makes me a PBJ with the crusts cut off, I'm going to talk about Ghostbusters: Answer the Call.I'm a child of the 80's. I remember the original Ghostbusters. This reboot was not only respectful of the original film, but it was a fun, new take on the property. What was better than the original was the script, even giving a nod to the neckbeards winging on YouTube (must have been done during pick-up's which was a nice middle finger to haters). The story felt more organic, less forced.; and these characters were also a lot more charming than the original cast. In the original, Bill Murray was funny but came across less as a scientist and more of a con-artist. In the reboot, I could take the scientists more seriously.Then we get to the God of Thunder himself, Chris Hemsworth. I am convinced he was improving most of his performance, and it was comedy gold. Instead of the awkward Rick Morains nerd, we get the rather dimwitted Kevin (Hemsworth). He is delightful in the film, and he looks like he's having a ball making fun of himself.If you don't want to see the movie, don't. Hang on to the '84 original. If you want to have a bit of fun for an evening, go see Ghostbusters: Answer the Call. I loved the hell out of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ghostbusters (PG-13) - The ladies step up and do a very good job</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no denying, Ghostbusters from 1984 is a beloved horror- comedy classic. When we look back on it, the casting of Aykroyd, Murray, Ramis, Hudson, Weaver, Moranis, Potts, and Atherton was golden, and we had never seen such a mix of action, effects and humor at that level before. The sequel was a disappointing follow-up and, despite years of talk and false starts, a third film never came to fruition.When it was first announced that the Ghostbusters franchise was being revived with some of the funniest ladies in show business in the leads, the internet exploded with negativity. The first trailer didn't help much, and many saw no reason to sully their fond memories of the original with a reboot.However, the new Ghostbusters, while familiar in purpose and imagery, is not just a retelling of the first movie. In fact, outside of some of the music, a few fun but unnecessary cameos, and a couple of brief vignettes, this new movie does an admirable job telling a different story and standing on its own merits.When Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) discovers that her tenure at Columbia is threatened by the resurgence of a book on the paranormal she co-wrote years before, she seeks out her former partner Abby Yates (a very PG-rated Melissa McCarthy), who has continued to pursue the paranormal in more practical terms. Teaming with the brilliant but cra-cra Jillian Holtzmann (a hysterical Kate McKimmon), Yates has developing equipment to prove the existence of ghosts and ghoulies.A close encounter at a haunted house and a YouTube video get Erin fired, but provides the motivation needed to create a headquarters where the three (and soon, four) can develop ways to capture and contain ectoplasmic beings. The ladies are joined by Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones), an MTA worker who has her own close encounter, and hire beefcake Kevin (Chris Hemsworth), who is the absolute stupidest receptionist ever depicted on film.The team soon discovers that someone is intentionally drawing out supernatural entities, with an eye towards creating an apocalypse in New York. However, Homeland Security and the mayor's office are already aware that something strange is going on in the neighborhood, and want the Ghostbusters to stop their work before they make things worse. Instead, armed with effective but dangerous weapons, the brave quartet puts their lives on the line to save the city and mankind.Personally, I had a blast with Ghostbusters. I found the sight and verbal gags throughout the film to be extremely fun, in some cases funnier than the original film. I was touched by the quick but sweet callback to Harold Ramis. There were a couple of spots that dragged a little, but not terribly so. Some may feel a bit overwhelmed by the effects in the final third of the films, but I had a good time with them. The cast was great, no argument there, and I would really enjoy seeing a follow-up (they start to lay the groundwork in an after-credits scene, so stick around to the very end.)I feel Ghostbusters does the franchise proud, and give it 4 out of 5. I am looking forward to seeing it again soon.Parents, a few notes for you: Language is mild for a PG-13 film: one use of b**ches, one use of s**t, and I heard a** three times. There is a crude remark about the origin of a bodily sound, and a very brief discussion about a busty ghost logo. There is a scene with about a half-dozen creative ways of shooting the bird. There are about three scary-ish, "jump" scenes - the first opens the film and is a notch- up from the library scene in the original. The second is Patty's encounter with a ghost in the subway, and the third involves Abby locking herself in the bathroom when she hears strange noises. The rest of that scene has been shown in trailers and commercials. Considering this director's usual fare, Ghostbusters is almost PG- 13-lite - the original actually had more racy stuff in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My curiosity got the better of me and after months of complainig i finally caved and went to see this and i'm so glad i did.No Sony aren't paying me to say this,a shame as i've had to admit to being wrong to quite a few people.It isn't perfect mind you,after a cracking pre titles scene the next 15 to 20 minutes are awful,all the fart and poop gags are nicely all put together so i can skip them when i get the DVD,but after the girls see their first ghost things get better.There's some great stuff we didn't see in the trailers and some lame bits that actually weren't in the film after all.Some of the humour falls flat,Holtzenn is weird and Kevin's way too dumb and yes a giant ghost does get shot between the legs although it doesn't spoil the scene too much.Patty is great,some of those lines should've been left on the cutting room floor and not in the trailer and McCarthy surprised me by toning it down a bit for this.Definatel a cut above most remakes and so much potential for an even better sequel.Never been so happy to be wrong,i'm a happy Ghostbusters fan again.</fullReview>

Dan, has always been a personal favorite to me in Ghost Busters, I loved him sense I was a kid! I can't wait for several more sequels can come out to show the women power that happens, its so great for us women. Dan also, he was just so perfectly white knight. The pale white skin the dirty ginger hair, oh god it was stunning. I can't wait to purchase this in Blu-ray and furiously masturbate to it. It's just seemed like something I would love to watch over and over again with my children, and especially Dan. Oh god, how I can't stop thinking about Dan. I've wanted to be with him ever sense I was a child I just can't think of anything else without him. My husband and I's marriage has been going down the drain, oh please Dan take me! Take me away I just want to be with you. Well, 10/10 would watch again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously, what the hell was all that hate about? I was disgusted by all the sexist backlash this film got before it was even released. But funnily enough it was all that controversy that made me want to see it.Those girls were actually very funny, particularly Melissa McCarthy and Leslie Jones, and I laughed out loud at at more than a few points. Although I have to say that Kate McKinnons character got a bit annoying at times, but that's a minor gripe.Chris Hemsworth's character was also very funny. A lot of hateful reviews seem to claim he was the only funny thing in a "man-hating movie", which is quite ironic considering the character is essentially a male version of the dumb blonde secretary stereotype next to the smart, funny, butt-kicking women. Considering he's not a comedian, he did a great job in that role and he was clearly having a great time there.But what do I think of it compared to the original? Both versions are very good films. This remake is a great movie in its own right, but it's almost a shame that it's a Ghostbusters film, because no matter how good it is, it will always be unfavourably compared to the original, not because of that small, but very vocal, sexist minority, but because it's a widely beloved classic and part of many peoples childhoods and they will be naturally very apprehensive about a remake, male or female.I personally would love to see more completely ORIGINAL films with funny, intelligent, butt-kicking women in it, then that would prove those sexists to be completely wrong. Because this film was pretty much guaranteed since day one to make a lot of money and being a remake I would imagine some people perceiving it as riding in on the coattails of an already successful franchise, which probably didn't do it any favours in terms of public perception, regardless of gender.So, verdict: A very funny and enjoyable film in it's own right. Even fans of the classic could enjoy it, so don't try and turn it into a classic vs remake or a male vs female war, because they're both very good films. Go see this this film and enjoy it for what it is, a fun movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whole family thoroughly enjoyed this admittedly very silly film :-D</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the first Ghostbusters movie. It was the first film I ever saw on a big screen in fact. I'm not a fan of re-makes generally, had it not been for the controversy, I doubt I'd have watched it at all (eg. I'll certainly never watch the remake of The Producers!) but I have a 12 year old daughter and love the fact that she actually gets to see others of her gender getting to be the heroes (representation matters) so we toddled off as a family to go see it in 3d. All three of us thoroughly, wholeheartedly enjoyed it. I'd even go so far as to say I had more fun watching this one than I did the first. The build up to the story was brilliant, with the whole trying to be a 'serious' scientist angle and the tenure on the table if only she can keep up the straight laced, academic behaviour. My partner wasn't too impressed with the cgi with some of it being particularly 'cartoony', though I'd thought that was deliberate. I'm clearly not a proper nerd, so I thought the 3d effects were AWESOME! The ghosts literally screeching out of the film right into our faces on occasion had myself and my daughter almost jumping out of our seats and clinging to each other, the 'vapours' pinging in and out from all angles only served to enhance the experience for us. Him indoors does prefer practical effects 'even when a bit rubbery' though. He still said it didn't detract from the excellent dialogue, interaction between the characters and their comedy timing. Those complaining about 'reverse sexism' (cos yeah - THAT's a thing) should watch one of, I don't know... ALL THE OTHER MOVIES that cater directly to them instead. Yes, a lot of the jokes are at the expense of the sort of screeching man baby that leaves dreadful reviews for films they've not even watched. Yes, the hot himbo secretary does directly parody the dumb blonde female secretary trope, right down to the boss being ickily lecherous over him (he STILL gets some of the best lines), if these clichés weren't so all pervasive in the first place, the parody would've been unnecessary. It's certainly not subtle - but IS brilliant fun. Is it highbrow? No. Is it a great way to laugh your socks off of an evening? For sure, hell yeah!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I honestly thought it was *alright*. Not great, not bad, just alright. I mean I don't have a problem with the gender swapping, and I was legitimately looking forward to this film after the first trailer. Shocking I know. Some of the jokes hit, and others were misses. An enjoyable romp. I could point out many of the little flaws, but in a film like this, it really wouldn't make a difference. Editing was a little choppy and amateurish. CGI was pretty distracting. Felt a bit rushed. I wouldn't see it again, but I enjoyed it while I was there. If there's anything this film made me wanna do is call the original Ghostbusters. I suggest you check it out, with an open mind. You might enjoy it. An enjoyably good 6/10 I would write more, but that pretty much sums up my thoughts. It was alright.</fullReview>

This is a reboot and not a remake but loved how they paid homage to the original with some cool twists. Watch closely for Easter eggs and cameos. It's hard to steal the scene from McCathy but now we see it can be done by Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon (2 of my favorites from SNL) Hemsworth was terrific too. There were even some scary scenes (but nothing to bad for the little ones). Great to see McCarthy in a PG- 13 movie. Director Paul Feig is always best paired with McCarthy. Overall an excellent cast deepen with real comedy chemistry and emotionally fleshed-out performances, particularly from McCarthy and Wiig.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen this movie but I just wanted to point out that even if it is a masterpiece (it may not be)it will always receive negative reviews from viewers because of the unwillingness to accept that a remake of an older movie that sports women as the leads instead of men could be a good thing. This isn't fair to the writers, actors and producers who put a lot of effort into the production of the movie and to be completely honest, this is when sites like IMDb, sites that put the members in control of the overall rating, just do not work. Please note that I myself, was a little bit annoyed at the fact that a remake of a classic, that I hold very dear, was being released... but I can accept that if a movie is good, then it deserves credit....and a final note to people who are yet to see this movie and are not sure if they should because it could ruin the original- Just go to see the movie, but go as if it has no relationship at all to the original "Ghostbusters". At least your reviews will be fair ones, and even if they are negative, they are based against your own criteria, and not by a bad attitude.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Im betting most of the reviews on here are from people who haven't seen this movie. Its a great watch and hilarious, the trailer surprisingly doesn't give away a lot and the movie is packed full of funny jokes. The 4 women really gel well together and Chris Hemsworth is comedy gold in this. The slight nods to the original movie are very well places and this int at all a Melissa MCarthy joke fest. Its well balanced, has a great story and guaranteed to make you laugh. Would definitely watch it again, this is coming from a teenage couple who regularly enjoy the movies. The sound track is brilliant, this isn't a reference to the new song too. They've done a very good job to mix in the old theme and bring an element of coolness to the girls.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a wonderful movie!Warm and great fun, that takes a much loved franchise and does its own thing while remaining true to the spirit of Ghostbusters. These are no mere female versions of Venkman, Stantz, Spengler and Zeddmore, they're very much brand new original characters who are just as likable and appealing - if not more so.Wiig and McCarthy form the heart of the movie but they are wonderfully generous in allowing their support plenty of moments to shine; Leslie Jones Patty is terrific and easily avoids the tokenism accusations that were always levelled at Ernie Hudson's Winston as her background working for the New York subway and knowledge of the city very much gives her her own unique set of skills and knowledge. Andy Garcia and Chris Hemsworth are also given scene stealing roles with plenty of laughs.But it is Kate McKinnon who absolutely steals the show; her engineer Holtzmann is an electrifying force of nature and utter randomness whether with dialogue or just reacting in the back of shot, she just fizzes with presence.Don't let those who have pre-judged this movie for their own agendas put you off, this is a great popcorn movie that leaves you with a grin on your face.

		<shortDescription>Does exactly what it was set out to do - entertain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really, really don't get all the hate that this movie is getting.I went in with preconceptions like most people, and during the first 10 minutes, these didn't seem to alleviate. But as the film went on, I got into it more and could see it for what it was - a fun, entertaining film.I think the casting was spot on. Kristen Wiig's awkwardness was done well, as was Melissa McCarthy's brashness. But for me, the stars of the movie were McKinnon and Hemsworth. They brought a real humour to the movie, and both in very different ways. Chris played the un- intelligent male secretary very well, and showed me a side of him I'd not seen before. McKinnon, I had not seen at all, and I thought she was brilliant. Her mannerisms, jokes and timing were spot on, and had me laughing on multiple occasions (let's not forget she's cute as hell, too). I also enjoyed Leslie Jones' character, again, adding good humour, I could tell from the scene in her subway booth she was going to be good.Is this movie perfect? No, not at all. The cameos were forced (Ozzy), and there was some dialogue and scenes which weren't great (I didn't really like the shooting in the crotch or buddy saving scenes), but I still think this film is solid, and entertaining. What more do you want from this film? The CGI was good, especially the big battle in times square. If you want to enjoy this movie, DO NOT go into the film even thinking about the original Ghostbusters movies. There is just no point. It is not the originals, and it is not trying to be, either.Go into this movie with the intentions of wanting to see a a fun and entertaining movie, and take it for what it is, and I have no doubt you will enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently saw the film at a cineplex near me. I am a fan of the originals and will admit my original misogyny when I heard they were recasting with women but after seeing the first two promos I was mildly swayed and decided to give the new film a chance. I admire the angle that this film was made at, they wanted to appease old fans whilst paving the way for future movies. I found the movie overall very funny with the funniest parts being throwaway lines and even found Chris Hemsworth very funny a lot of the time. I also rather enjoyed cameos from the various original cast of Ghostbusters in what appeared to be polar opposites to their original roles except from Annie Potts playing another loudmouth receptionist. Whilst I was disappointed that Rick Moranis didn't make a cameo (I thought he was dead) I am happy there was support from the original cast with Bill Murray and co. Overall I found the film to be very pleasing, consistently chuckle worthy and gave a nice nod to the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To my surprise the movie is better than the trailer, but not much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not as bad as it could have been. The first two acts are lightly entertaining and the characters / actors do as well as they can with the material. BUT, the final act is rubbish.By the inevitable action-lead final act the things that made the beginning watchable are totally abandoned and there's effectively no attempt to explain why the bad guy(s) are doing what they do, and zero pay-off. I don't think the writers could even be bothered to explain it. "You know, it's Ghostbusters, that's a good enough reason why there's ghosts flying around NY being creepy and a baddie set on making it happen. Maybe we'll say more in the sequel".I hate to admit it as I am the most cynical guy in the world and people who know me personally will vouch for that, but the trailer makes it look worse than it actually is. I think it's fair to say that 80% of the controversy there has been was caused by the direction they took for the trailer, deciding to fill it mostly with one-liners only when the movie had other effective-enough scenes in it that they could have used as well. On the subject of racism and sexism, there wasn't any more than any similar contemporary pop-corn movie, and again, the trailer may have given a false impression. I can honestly say that all parties involved have some responsibility for making a much bigger deal of those things than it really is; the critics (who probably have only seen the trailer) and its makers. Social media (and people who should know better than to use it) are an equally big culprit too.A fair amount of the jokes in it are smirk-inducing but not gut- busting, so shown out of the context of the movie they fall flat, they could have made a trailer that showed more of the lower-key drama that would have made for a much more intriguing enticement and thereby avoided all the bile that's been going around. So I reckon the massively negative opinion can be attributed to how they go about making trailers and publicity methods these days in general, which is an issue I have had with other movies in recent times too.Saying all that....the movie is not a classic by any measure, if you are a level-headed person you probably won't come out the theater feeling angry or ripped off, but also you are missing nothing important if you wait to see it by some cheaper method, or for free. It's average with a forgettable ending, like the majority of mass- consumption blockbusters these days. Over-all: 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great, modern summer comedy that does what it's meant to do and is an important addition to the sci-fi universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It saddens me deeply that this movie has been surrounded by such blind hate from people who refuse to let go of the old ghostbusters and act like this film is the most offensive thing on the planet. Produced by Dan Akroyd and with cameos from almost all of the living ghostbusters, had this film not been poisoned by overly sensitive people on the internet it would have been a hit.The four leads display a wide range of personalities, from the nervous Erin (wiig) to the committed believer (Abbie) to the weird and quirky Holtzmann (Mckinnon) and the hilarious Patti (Jones) these are a set of 4 female characters that - unlike many movies we see - are focused on a scientific goal and not once do they have sex with someone (shock horror!).If you are reading this and do not understand why this is important then I doubt I will convince you by the end of this review, but I would be grateful if you were to listen to my opinion. Girls do not see this. This is not something that happens often, and it's important for women to see this.Special mention goes to McKinnon's character the engineer Gillian Holtzmann, who is not only strange, intelligent, gloriously weird and dressed like a post apocalyptic mad max-exque lesbian, but participates in a fight scene that made me understand why guys like action movies. Not once had I engaged with a fight scene the way I did watching a normal woman absolutely kick arse in one and that's the truth. (Also the gun-licking may have been a minor bisexual awakening)The humour of the movie matches a modern equivalent of the old ghostbusters, following the path of casting many Saturday night live alum, you can tell that many of the funny moments were improvised by the cast. Another special mention goes to Chris Hemsworth for his comedic delivery as the hilariously inept secretary Kevin, who covers his eyes when he hears loud noises. The rest of the humour is a combination of witty back and fourth, loud observational and sometimes just plain gross (it's a movie that involves sliming what does one expect) with a classic Paul Feig spin. To conclude, ghostbusters was a well done, funny, and groundbreaking movie that is absolutely not the horrid flop the internet wanted it to be. I would highly recommend it, in the large theatre I was in, I heard roaring laughter at every turn so do not listen to these internet commenters. Real people in the real world loved it, and I'm sure you will too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's an hilarious moment in the new Ghostbusters movie when the all woman team are presented with suggestions for a new corporate logo by 'Kevin' their himbo receptionist. The first is a female ghost with a frilly skirt and large breasts. The design doesn't meet with approval, so Kevin suggests that he could make the breasts larger. The gag is typical of the knowing, self-referential humour of this new movie which even pokes fun at internet reaction to the news that this remake would have an all female central cast. Only the most glum at heart could nay-say this remake of the now 30- year-old original. Ghostbusters movie. A smart comedy adventure, it revamps the original movie and has its own feel good mood that left the audience that I saw it with in fits of laughter. Ghostbusters hooks you in with some nice one liners - a haunted house from old New York is said to come with an authentic anti-Irish fence The central cast comprising Melissa McCarthy,Kristen Wiig, Leslie Jones and Kate McKinno spark off each other and keep the action bouncing along. The plot is sort of new and although the central villain, a hapless janitor, lacks the interest of the originals geek and Gate-Keeper pairing of Rick Moranis and Sigorney Weaver, the film holds the attention with fun references to the original - the new team can't afford the rent on the fire station HQ of the original team so have to settle on rooms above a Chinese take-away: cue running Wan Ton Soup gags. Some commentators have found the film restrained but if that means there are less fart jokes then so much the better. There is a point where action takes over from humour - a Thrilleresque dance routine involving the Mayor and the emergency services is cut and moved to the closing credits presumably to better feature the accompanying promotional song and not bring the climax to a jarring halt but it seems like a waste of a spectularish set piece. The cast have taken misogynistic criticisms with surprisingly good humour. And now the film's actually on release, they are gaining a better press. This is the feel good movie of this Summer go see it and prove you ain't afraid of no girls!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fairly enjoyable popcorn flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ghostbusters is directed by Paul Feig and stars Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, Kristen Wiig, Leslie Jones &amp; Chris Hemsworth.Following a mysterious ghost invasion in Manhattan, a pair of paranormal enthusiasts, a subway worker and a nuclear engineer band together to stop the otherworldly threat from causing chaos across the city.After many years of waiting, the Ghostbusters franchise returns with a new set of heroes and a colourful special effects palette that provides exciting visual eye-candy along with an almost perfectly and tightly wrapped script. Cast members McCarthy, McKinnon and Wiig bounce off each other wonderfully and deliver some amusing remarks to certain scenarios throughout, especially with Hemsworth's witty and utterly useless persona, which is hilarious. Unfortunately, the writing for Jones' character wasn't so satisfying. A lot of the lines fell flat and ultimately sank underneath the energetic performances by the aforementioned.Now, although I haven't always been a fan of Feig's work, I admire him for taking on such a huge project. I believe he has done an admittedly average job with the direction and writing, but most of the critical reception and fan backlash, while overwhelmingly ludicrous, is an unfair representation of what is shown in this movie. Coming to the realisation that comedy and target audiences alike can change over the years, is something that will give you a fair advantage over the other viewers heading into this world. I genuinely believe, like any movie, that everyone should watch for themselves before shooting angry comments at the filmmakers or the people that enjoy the work. This is one of the reasons I bought a ticket to see this movie.The other reason was the special effects. After watching the trailers, I noticed how vibrant and diverse the visual effects were. This is one of the stronger points that really hold the experience up, it's consistently colourful and fun to watch. I'd like to see it in 3D and judge how this contrasts over the two formats, maybe making a difference to the overall enjoyment of the movie.While these comments make it seem like I'm hugely impressed, or that it's a high-flyer, there were certainly a few sections that were disappointing. Firstly, the villain wasn't very good. He felt forced and extremely obvious from the beginning to end. I'm not sure whether this is due to the writing of the character, or the actor Neil Casey, but I didn't like it. Secondly, the 'finale' section during the last 20 or 30 minutes of the feature felt loose and lacked in the comedy from the previous hour and 20 minutes. It seemed very lazy and didn't make any sense, feeling anti-climatic, which is not the reaction you should get from a finale. If this was improved upon, it has the potential to be a brilliant end to this story. Finally, and most surprisingly, the cameos were poor in contrast to everything great about this movie.Music by Theodore Shapiro is sparse and compositionally simple with mostly predictable directions in string movements, along with the horror/mystery flick genre that was expected. There aren't many cues or themes that jump out at you, and whilst that's usually not a bad thing, I felt it lacked from the overall experience. There is, however, a lot of songs by various artists that are thrown in throughout. None of these were pleasing to my ears and I felt could they have been removed without any deterioration to the quality of the movie.The production, special effects &amp; set design teams along with the art department have done a wonderful job with their time. Most notably, the new Ecto-1 is amazing to look at. Every angle or scene this vehicle features in is a blast to watch. I imagine fans will be looking to buy replicas or even construct full-size functional versions to bring to events in the future.By this point you're probably still debating whether you should bother buying a ticket to see this movie. Maybe you're still not convinced. Or you don't want to upset the butt-hurt any more than they already are. To that, I'd tell you to just go for it. Do it in secret if you must. I simply think everyone should form their own opinion before calling people out.In retrospect, it's a fairly enjoyable flick that put a smile on my face and took me out of the real world for a couple hours. There are a few scenes I thought were out of place and fell flat in the comedy aspect, but I really didn't have a terrible time watching it. Maybe all this backlash served as an expectation that could be easily beaten? Who knows, but I liked it. A personal highlight for me was McKinnon's performance as Jillian Holtzmann, which was great. I'd not seen her in much before this so it was a nice introduction to her work. I thought she came across genuine and seemed excited and pleased to be a part of the franchise. All of her action sequences (especially in the finale) were handled well and came out to be some of the best parts of the experience.My verdict; Ghostbusters is a fun, energetic and visually awesome take on the franchise and I'd happily sit through it again. A sequel, though seemingly doubtful, wouldn't be so bad in my books. Don't take it too seriously.Ghostbusters, 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ghostbusters(2016) is a very enjoyable movie which both pays homage to the original series in a very successful way, but is also able to develop a whole new universe and entirely new and engaging characters.The 4 new Ghostbusters are all female(which is okay) and are able to connect with each other and this new audience. With all the backlash from this film i still didn't doubt the abilities of Paul Feig as a director. Even know the trailer wasn't hilarious his comedic past in movies like Bridesmaids and Spy couldn't make me doubt the direction this film was going in, even though all the jokes are either hilarious or bland....But still its not as good as the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's sad that I can't review this film without the context of the preceding "controversy" surrounding its release. Where have all these 'die hard' ghostbusters fans come from? The original was great, sure, but let's be honest, for most of us it's a very enjoyable 'spooky comedy' rather than a life changing holy grail of cinema. So the overstated enthusiasm for the original at the time of writing is fairly exhausting.I'll keep it short.The film 2016 was impressively consistently funny, as evidenced by the numerous collective belly laughs in the cinema I attended. There were some misses too, much in the way an episode of, say, Family Guy has hits and misses, but the laughs outweighed the troughs. Actually, in terms of the audience's reactions to the jokes, I'd go as far as saying it was more consistently funny than your average episode of Family Guy (which has loads of misses all the time). Obviously the humour and style is different, so don't take that comparison as an absolute. But Ghostbusters 2016 was very funny in places.The film triumphed over the pre-release criticisms that this was pandering to feminism. The issue didn't cross my mind at all. The characters and the actors were enjoyable. There was a decent explanation to all the ghostbusters' reasons for being part of the team. You'd have to enter the cinema wanting to be annoyed at this for it to actually be an issue. I'm a 28 year old male, by the way, as ridiculous as it is for me to confirm that.The film isn't great though. It starts strong and, somewhere mid-way, begins to approach its climax clumsily. Things go from 'investigations' to 'total apocalypse' very quickly and get resolved equally quickly. Also, all the throwbacks to the original end up feeling forced and a bit awkward. It would be better without the cameos. The failings of this film are not linked to its pre-release criticisms.If you want to have some fun, like you would when going to see any comedy, then this is worth your time. If you have low expectations, give it a chance and you will probably enjoy yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Paul Fieg teams up yet again with Melissa McCarthy and a Saturday Night Live line up cast which follows trend of the original 1984 cult classic. Being a female reboot, you try to figure out who's respectably who; is McCarthy Ramis and Wiig Murray? Each character having similarities while still oozing something new. The person who stole the show was SNL regular and TV comedy personality, Kate McKinnon who resembles Ackroyd's Ray, only a little more crazier and somewhat crankier to full comedy effect. Another SNL regular joins the team, the giant Leslie Jones who I reckon would make a great celebrity death match for Game of Thrones Gwendoline Christie. Andy Garcia plays the mayor but is nothing like David Marguiles' mayor from the first. And Chris Hemsworth's Kevin as an answer for Annie Potts' Janine, playing a dumber than dumb partially blind and deaf receptionist. I think they actually doped him up before takes. Neil Casey, yup, another writer from Saturday Night Live, plays the bad guy nut job who's going around waking all the spooks up. I think I preferred it when Gozer came to town. It's a very similar story, with some interesting tweaks for background paying respect to the originals. The old famous Hook &amp; Ladder Company #8 building makes an appearance, along with Ecto1 (though missing the annoying yet lovable siren) Slimer and his nasty appetite and the usual proton-packs with upgrades. The Stay Puff Marshmellow Man gets a facelift and the cameos are brilliantly placed but no Moranis.Theodore Shapiro does the score but gets sounded out by the soundtrack, which is actually a lack of and its been reported Ray Parker Jr. isn't happy with Missy Elliot and Fall Out Boy's rehash version. There's no Mick Smiley's Magic or Laura Branigan's Hot Tonight. Same premise as the original, possibly playing to fresh fans, this might do what the '84 classic did for us oldies, (middle-aged) and should it matter if it's an all female cast? It's funny with some very good moments but unfortunately there's plenty of mediocre comedy that just doesn't hit home. It's a little longer than the original and it does feel it in parts and the effects are what you would expect, they're good but nothing really mind-blowing that we haven't already seen before. Seeing a lot of hate, and low scores and to be honest, being apprehensive and a big fan of the originals, it's a good reboot, its a carbon copy yes, but how else would anyone expect to make a reboot and the fact the film pays so much respect to the originals and especially with the cameos I find it hard to hate it. Hater's gonna hate and they need to let go. It's more than 30 years on and yes, I was around when the original came out, so come on, it's a not a bad fresh start to the franchise. As Bill Murray might say "yes, it's true, they have no dick." Running Time: 7 The Cast: 8 Performance: 7 Direction: 8 Story: 6 Script: 6 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 5 Job Description: 6 The Extra Bonus Points: 5 for the nice little touches, nods and cameos paying respect to the originals. 66% 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ignore the dull troll remarks. Yes, it differs hugely from the original made some 30 years ago, and yes it does indeed have a predominantly male cast. unapoligetically bold in its difference, whether in its more modern approach to SNL cast treatment, or production design elements - it holds strong narrative parallels to the original, yet embarks on a very different endgame, albeit a lighter tone throughout.It is not a third Ghostbusters movie, nor a rehash which happens to have women in it. Its totally on its own, in a good way. The concept of Ghostbusters and the generations it has inspired as an idea is not owned by us children of the 80's anymore... And this is the product of a different era of comedy (love it or hate it), and a well refined one. I look forward to the sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ghostbusters 2016 is fun. It is NOT a sequel to the original, nor does it carry the same tone the majority of the time but it shouldn't be expected to. And it proves pretty early on that it doesn't need to. As a huge fan of the series, I breathed a sigh of relief and wore a giant grin about 20 minutes in when Erin, Abby and Holtzmann celebrated their first ghost sighting with so much passion because I shared that excitement. This film was going to be good and it was.It's not without it's fault; some jokes fall a little flat here and there and the villain doesn't really get enough screen-time. At it's worst it feels like a Ghostbusters fan film but that's nothing to be ashamed of because it is. Positively brimming with love for the series, Ghostbusters 2016 pays homage (and parody) to it's history maybe a little too much but it ain't afraid to do things differently. The characters have a surprising level of depth to them, the story is logical and well-paced and the whole film is gorgeously colourful (interesting, considering the ghost are far more menacing).Ghostbusters 2016 is refreshing and exciting and I'm glad to say I enjoyed it thoroughly. Perhaps people on the internet need to shake it off and try enjoying something once in a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ghostbusters is colourful, extremely fun, and very funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fans rejoice! The new Ghostbusters movie is not, in fact, the childhood crushing disaster that some feared after less than seller trailers, but a colourful, extremely fun, very funny romp of a re- take on a classic. One that spends just the right amount of time paying sometimes cheeky, but always respectful homage to the original (with fantastic cameos from all of the living original cast) without being a slave to it. It cheerfully moves with its own style and its own brand of humour, which is consistently delightful thanks to the very genuine chemistry of the four leads. Each character is distinctive and quirky and the ghosts are purposefully stylised in a way that lends itself well to the bombastic tone of the movie. There are gadgets and techie jargon to satisfy the nerdiest of fans, and a surprising amount of scares.Of my few complaints, one would be that the villain is noticeably under-developed in a way that is detrimental to the plot. While this complaint could also be levied at the original too, it feels more noticeable here. This also creates pacing issues which are problem from act 2 onwards and the emotional climax of the movie, as well as the weight the stakes hold for the Ghostbusters personally, suffer for it. But these problems are pretty secondary when you're laughing so hard. Ghostbusters is nothing like a cynical cash grab, with Feig and his cast's want to entertain their audience evident in every frame.A quick note on the biased mess this page has become thanks to an unfortunate few: As you can probably tell from the paranoid tone of many of these reviews, they don't seem particularly balanced or fair. This would be because they aren't. There has been a concerted effort from people who are angry this movie exists and is reviewing well to bombard this place due to its more open nature. It's amusing that there is a conspiracy theory among these people that there is foul play from Sony with this movie reviewing so positively among professional critics, when in fact there are organised downvote campaigns from people who have yet to actually SEE the movie! So no, you don't need to take these people seriously. As you can see from their paranoid claims that Sony are secretly paying-off critics to give this movie positive reviews (a technique they've apparently forgotten to utilise for any of their other more expensive movies, which have been panned critically this year), these are just the last trashing of a small but vocal group of adult children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did not Ruin my Childhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, a huge thank you to Paul Feig. You did not ruin my childhood and in the process, made a great film, I have had time to process and am ready to post. This weekend I attended the red carpet premier of Ghostbusters. My impressions are below.The movie delivered for me and I really enjoyed it. It was not a rip off of the original as the characters had their own development and style. They were busting ghosts but with a different purpose and with a distinct protagonist that is different from the original with a different purpose. It worked well. The first 10 min were the only tough point for me but only because the movie had to start and find its stride. I saw it in 3D and it really was awesome. The 3D was not just an afterthought. It really added to the film and made me feel a part of it. The audience I was with were all hardcore ghost heads and fellow busters. The mood during and after the showing was positive and energized. I heard lots of laughter and support. None of the people I talked to or were there with booed or had a negative reaction. Most can't wait to see it again. My biggest complaint is that I have to wait until Thursday to see it again. Great time was had by all! Finally, some will hate no matter what. I went to this film expecting to be let down. (Sorry Paul) I was in fact pleasantly surprised. I loved the film. I can not say it enough. If you honestly give it a chance, you will enjoy it. I know this film will grow a next generation of busters!</fullReview>

Cameos from original cast; the main leads were all great.Melissa McCarthy, who I love, was a bit more restrained than normal, and played well off Kristen wieg. Loved Chris Hemsworth as the dumb blonde secretary. Ending was a bit weak but these type of films usually are. Stay for the credits too.

		<fullReview>For starters, I just thought I'd clarify that I'm not sponsored by Sony. I spent $16.50 to see this film, and I'm not making any of that back by reviewing it positively. Ghostbusters (2016) is an uplifting change to a franchise that has been mediocre at best for the last few years. The original is fine, yes, but this film was a blast.It's wonderful. This isn't a gender thing. It's a movie thing. I maintain that most of these jokes would land fine with an all-male cast.It's witty, charming, and just plain neat.We're in New York. It's 2016. Erin (Kristen Wiig), a scientist, realises that her ghost-hunting book (written by herself and her friend Abby (Melissa Mccarthy)), has been released onto the internet by Abby herself. Afraid that this fantastical book will ruin her reputation, Erin hunts down Abby, and her colleague Jillian (Kate McKinnon) who are paranormal scientists. Instead of stopping the sales of the book, the three women end up hunting ghosts.They are soon joined by Kevin (Chris Hemsworth), and Patty (Leslie Jones), as they work to stop the evil machinations of a guy who wants to bring about the end of the world.I wasn't expecting much, re the terrible trailers, but the casting and characterisation is wonderful. The four female leads (Wiig, Mccarthy, McKinnon and Jones) have an irresistible chemistry that translates well on screen. I'd like to make a special mention for McKinnon's Jillian Holtzmann. She's an absolute scene-stealer, zany and delightful to watch, as well as openly flirting with literally everyone on screen.I genuinely found parts of this film scary. There is a lot of camp and comedy, but there's a couple of bits that are somewhat harrowing. Some of the ghosts are creepy-looking, and although we as an audience know there's no risk to any of the main characters, it's still a bit scary. I like that. The balance of horror and comedy is very palatable. It doesn't stray into territory that is too dark or unforgiving, but horror does help the narrative. The pacing of this film is good, too. It's just under two hours long but the time flew by.There are moments where the continuity seems a bit iffy, and the ghosts aren't uber-realistic looking. They're more resemblant of mid-2000s Scooby Doo-itis, but that's okay! Let's be frank, we're not looking for a Ghostbusters movie to be gritty. It's a comedy- horror, not any sort of Paranormal Activity nonsense.To those of you who aren't going to see this movie because of blind attachment to the original, consider this. This remake isn't going to stop your original film existing. You can continue to own your copy of the original while supporting the new.Ghostbusters is joyous, funny, and likable. I mean, if there was ever an invasion of ghosts I'd trust these women to save us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got to see this film last Monday and tbh I was quite hesitant going in on how it would be.I am a big fan of both original films and the old 80's toon, that aside I found this film quite enjoyable its no way going to be a Shakespearean masterpiece so if that is what your expecting you should leave that thought at the door.I know a lot of people have criticized this film for its lack of practical effects but I though the initial Ghosts that appear in the film where well done. there is a few scenes later on that have many appear on screen so they tend to be not too distinctive.but tbh thinking back to the originals you didn't see that many on screen at the same time also.I will admit I was not impressed with Chris Hemsworths character Kevin I felt he was just to over the top for comic relief as the other Characters did a good job of keeping the humor going throughout.The main villain of the movie was interesting to say the least with out giving away any spoilers.All in all I found this movie to be very enjoyable and it shouldn't be dismissed just because it isn't a continuation of the original films.</fullReview>

The CGI was fine - obviously not going to be scarily realistic ghosts as its going for the family feel rather than thriller.Don't understand the hate this film is getting. I would never compare it to the original as I don't feel it is meant to be a continuation of it, more of paying a slight nod of homage to it whilst standing on its own.

		<shortDescription>Not a review of the movie, but a review of the people who have thus far left reviews before the film has been released.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't help but feel like the vast majority of you "reviewers" were never going to like this movie no matter what. These reviews seem to contain excessive hyperbole, usually a huge red flag when it comes to separating legitimate reviews from people trying to get attention/laughs/likes/whatnot. Furthermore, these reviews seem to call this movie sexist for portraying most of the male characters as intellectually inferior. Now, remember, I haven't seen the movie. But I am not reviewing the movie. I am reviewing you. This is a sitcom trope that has existed for years, yet you only seem to have a problem with it now that a film you love has been remade not to your exact vision. On that note, you have reacted with the kind of vitriol that would be appropriate if there was some kind of law that said if a movie is remade, you can't watch the original any more. But no such law exists. The original "Ghostbusters" will always exist, and if you just want that again, it's on Netflix. And to those of you complaining about women putting female characters in roles typically occupied by men and stealing inspiration from their young sons, I say what about their daughters? Don't they deserve inspiration as well? If you disagree, you must have thought it was so sad in "Mad Max: Fury Road" when Immortan Joe's doctor decided not to save one of the dying wives, but rather cut her open and kill her to remove her unborn child on the off chance that it would be a male. Not because a woman was killed, but that the kid did end up being a boy. In summation, if you fall under any of these complaints, you have no business reviewing movies. If you avoided all of these and just simply didn't find the film funny, then you're good. But chances are if you left the film a review of 3 stars or less, you are guilty. When normal, well-adjusted adults don't find a movie funny, they don't go on tirades. So think before you speak and please actually see the movie before saying anything. Lastly, I left this movie a 10/10 because I can't help but feel like a certain bias has existed in the ratings thus far, and because the movie doesn't open until tomorrow (this is being written on July 14th, 2016) I felt it proper to restore some balance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An optimistic throwback film for a cynical world...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First up, the question on everyone's minds (no, not where Elvis is and how he's doing) - is it as good or better than the original? The answer is no, but not much is. Ghostbusters is a fun, energy- filled film that, while it doesn't capture the lightning in a bottle of the original 1984 film, does have a personality and energy all its own. Rather than replace or recast the original four characters, Feig's Ghostbusters opts to go in its own direction while also giving winks, nods, and even proton blasts to the gut in references to the original film. The cast is wonderful with Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones being the stand-outs. Production design and visual effects are absolutely incredible showing what a Ghostbusters film in 2016 can and should look like to perfection. The ghost encounters are creepy, the combination of visual and practical effects selling the illusions quite well. Theodore Shapiro's score is also a whole lot of fun, helping balance the creepy with the heroic. The film is not without flaws, the third act happens rather quickly and you can't help but wonder if a few threads to help get you there were left on the cutting room floor. The visual spectacle takes a front seat and the comedy and tension get a little left behind, but the action in the third act is so kinetic and fun eye candy, you don't really mind. This could have easily been a cynical cash-in on intellectual property, but instead is a reverent, well-intentioned and sweet film that does what comedy does best: play absurd situations with complete sincerity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I start, I should state: I'm a big fan of Kate McKinnon and Kristen Wiig (as well as the bulk of the primary cast) and a fan of the original movie so I feel like I had some preconceptions about the movie before I saw it. I should also say, I'm a Redditor (with measly karma) who was dumbfounded by the blind aggression that the first trailer seemed to attract. In my view, it was cowards, threatened by women, who use the cloak of anonymity that comes with being a Troll, to say sexist things under the guise of artistic critiquing. *mic drop*With that out of the way, my review of the film is pretty simple, I loved it. The acting was great, it was well written, directed and produced. The laughter barely stopped in the cinema we were in. No one walked out or demanded their money back for the simple fact that this is a good movie.A few highlights were: Chris Hemsworth, tastefully done cameos, the new weapons - damn they were cool, Kate McKinnon's fire dance and Chris Hemsworth.I really wish that the negative people giving these fake reviews would go out and see the movie, even if you go on "Cheap Tuesday" or whenever the tickets are cheapest. It will be worth it, just go in there knowing that this is a reboot of a movie made 32 years ago (by my count, we're almost up to three different lots of Spiderman movies in less time than that) and deserves to be watched with a fresh palette. Worth it just for Chris Hemsworth.YoursNot Chris Hemsworth</fullReview>

Or some combination thereof. Let's face it: there's no reason to give this movie a 1/10 that isn't sexist. There's no rating system in which that rating is justified and reasonable. There just isn't.

		<fullReview>Since the movie did not have the best reviews i was not sure if i wanted to go and watch it in theater. It's a shame it didn't get better reviews.I am so glad that my sister dragged me to watch this movie because i loved it!!! It was hilarious.This is the type of movie that I can definitely watch over and over again and still not get tired of.The women acted really well and had me laughing throughout the movie.Most importantly, the movie captured me right from the beginning. I would recommend this movie to my friends and family for sure.So don't worry and go to the theater for this one, I am certain you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Believe The Haters!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly let me preface this by saying I'm a massive Ghostbusters fan, I grew up watching the originals... Even the second one! I still watch them now, I went to see the original at the cinema a few years ago on its anniversary release. I have my own Proton Pack, I have my own Ghostbuster jumpsuit, and I've worn it in public! I'm a true, hardcore, die hard fan......Ever since it was announced a couple of years back this movie has faced so much negativity, been completely destroyed by people on the internet, the trailers have been slammed and I know that this movie will flop because of such negativity, it already has a score of 4/10 on IMDb and that is a massive shame because......... IT IS ACTUALLY GOOD!!!I had always said I would give it a chance, and I did and I'm not disappointed! Lets start with the story: It follows a similar path of the originals, scientists working on their theories about the paranormal come together and recruit a fourth member who is a bit more streetwise. They start doing their jobs as the Ghostbusters; honing their skills as they go and working on their tech, the mayor and his office get involved, bit of a smear campaign, but it all goes to hell in the end and they step up and earn their stripes.The new cast work well, they're all women who have proved themselves on the comedic stage in Hollywood and they gel really well together. Kirsten Wiig delivers her uncomfortable in her own skin act and I'm sure that's why she was cast, the real stand out is however is Kate McKinnon who I'm sure will come out as the fans favourite. Chris Hemsworth adds some silly humour but still has an important part to play in the story.Is the humour as sophisticated as the originals? Probably not being honest, but that's not to say it isn't funny, the humour is just different, drawn from modern pop culture and is slightly feminine in nature with a bit of the old "kids will laugh but the adults will really get it" thrown in. I'm not going to lie, there were a few moments where I kind of rolled my eyes and did a bit of a WTF, but so what!? The special effects are top notch, but haven't departed too far from the cartoonish feel of the originals anyone who says anything else is tripping!The movie kept me entertained for the full duration, there were even some moments that left me surprised by their brilliance and there is plenty of fan service to be enjoyed including some familiar faces thrown in to the mix as cameos, but enough said about that.I'm not going to go into things like cinematography or directorial stuff because I'm not going to be that guy who pretends to know what he's talking about, when actually I haven't got an effing clue.... we all know one. Suffice to say that the film looks amazing!I really enjoyed it, but I feel its such a shame for this movie as I think its destined to fail, its been a real victim of the internet and it shouldn't be. it may have been the film that no one wanted, it may have been the film we didn't need, but that's not to say it isn't a solid, enjoyable and entertaining piece of cinema. Haters are gonna hate! I urge people to see it, give it a chance, throw away your preconceived notions and hostility, and watch with an open mind, I don't think you'll be disappointed.... and stay after the credits!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone complaining about this movie has obviously not even watched it. Don't let your ego get in the way... this is amazing.It's obviously hysterical. I loved Ghostbusters as a little kid. My inner 7 year old girl is so thrilled this movie exists now. FINALLY a female fronted, sci-fi themed movie!!I'm reading the reviews and cracking up at how many people are intentionally writing bad reviews just because it's female based, calling it man-hating, and a rip off. What is wrong with you people?! Dan Aykroyd is the executive producer. Why would anyone think he would let the franchise flop? He's overseeing it for crying out loud!Take your kids. Let your daughters feel like they can do anything they want in life. Enjoy the movie without listening to all of those internet bullies out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trailers don't do it justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a massive fan of the original films. They were a big part of my childhood, which is the case for a lot of people. When I discovered this was a reboot I was, needless to say, disappointed, angry and upset. That was just me being a complete fanboy. I finally accepted this and eagerly awaited the release of the first trailer. Like so many others I was gobsmacked at how shockingly bad the trailer was. It was like an SNL spoof. The pacing was all wrong. Up until seeing the film on its first day of release, I was still very much 50/50. Who wouldn't be after watching THAT trailer? I saw the first showing at a local cinema because I couldn't handle the anticipation.I'm so glad I was pleasantly surprised. What a relief! The film exceeded my expectations. Within the first 5 minutes it felt like a Ghostbusters film. It was fresh, but familiar, in terms of pace and tone. I was worried this was going to be the Melissa McCarthy show, which works for other films. Each character had equal prominence and was great in its own way. Together they had excellent chemistry and were believable as ghostbusters. Nearly every line was funny and there were so many little quips that were easy to miss. I loved the storyline and the nods to the originals, including the cameos, were a lovely touch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I get that a lot of the criticism (besides the VERY obvious 'I haven't seen the movie but I'm going to say that it sucks because it triggers my personal issues" type "criticism") is that it won't compare to the original. And I have to say, I re-watched the original and it just was not as good as I remembered it. I think sentimentality skews your perception quite a bit. My opinion is that this movie really is about as good as the original, it's just that the original gets more of a pass for being... well, original. So with that, I think this reboot had some strikes against it from the get- go. (As well as the aforementioned weird vendetta stuff that somehow made this goofy movie into a supposed feminist conspiracy. Dang, I must admit the entertainment of that was probably the best advertisement any movie could ask for.) That aside, take this movie as what it's meant to be -- it's just a simple, good time. The story is not original. It's not cerebral, "Royal Tenenbaums" type stuff. It's not an Oscar Wilde- inspired parody. It's an unpretentious fun summer movie you can see with the family. Yes, there were a few jokes that seemed juvenile (just like the original) and some that missed, but all in all I'd say you will have fun and smile a lot,and the characters are ADORABLE. I gotta wonder what all the negative fuss was about. hmmm..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I ain't afraid of no remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard not to review the Ghostbusters reboot without commenting on the animosity that the marketing for the movie has received before its release. I totally accept that it's a tough job to effectively remake a classic film that's beloved by so many people (including myself) but I went into the cinema on opening night with an open mind and reasonably neutral expectations.The film is essentially a modern remake/reboot of the original 1980's comedy classic, only this time the lead cast are all female. It's really refreshing to see an almost completely female driven Hollywood blockbuster with varied, interesting, likable and often very funny women. The chemistry between the four leads is palpable but Kate McKinnon steals the show as kooky and ingenious scientist Jillian Holtzmann. I was, however, disappointed to see that the feminism in the film has gone so far as to have all male characters as either completely stupid or evil. Chris Hemsworth plays a male version of the stereotypical blond bimbo. He's actually often very funny and clearly looks like he enjoyed every minute filming his part. However, I would have welcomed at least one intelligent and rounded male character.Technically, the 3D effects are excellent with some clever use of letter-boxing; the visual effects are adequate and the score and soundtrack is lively with perhaps an excessive use of covers of the original Ghostbusters theme song.I had a lot of fun with Ghostbusters, the laughs come fast enough and the cast chemistry holds proceedings together. There's a dip in pace in the middle act due to the thin plot but things pick up again quickly for a rousing finale. I know many of you will have a concern that this movie will destroy a classic. Honestly, it won't. It's not exceptional but it's lots of fun and worthy of your time.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A few things I would like to point out:- literally every other movie review site has this movie at LEAST above a 50%, the only reason this site doesn't is because for some reason, everyone who hates the movie is flocking here.- Honestly this movie is more of a 8/10 for me but I'm giving it 10/10 because I'm fairly certain half these 1/10 people didn't even go to see the movie, considering how mad they were about it ruining the franchise simply by existing. Why would you pay money to see something you've hated from day 1?- The leads are fantastic, and I feel that there were several instances where they were held back by the script, but it's still enjoyable.- THIS IS NOT A REMAKE, IT IS A REBOOT</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rebooted with an all female lead cast, Ghostbusters is a remake of the 1984 original and is about a group of scientists who believe in ghosts and use their intellect to stop someone from unleashing the paranormal world upon the human world. Now we all saw the trailers, we all saw that dislike ratio (the most disliked trailer on YouTube) and we all saw the negative comments. I can't lie, I did walk into this film hoping it was going to be bad...but it wasn't. Not only was it good, it was actually the most fun I've had this whole summer season of blockbusters. Straight up this is a great cast, the Ghostbusting team have such great chemistry (especially Kristen Wiig, who I am a massive fan of, and Kate McKinnon), Chris Hemsworth was surprisingly funny and even the many cameos from the original. Speaking of cameos, there are a lot of easter eggs in this film that link to the original which many fans will enjoy. I've now come to realise anything director Paul Feig (Bridesmaids and Spy) does, it's just going to be great. The direction was great, the script was funny and the characters had depth. The visuals for the paranormal entities looked superb and the effects for the proton guns looked very similar to the original, which was a nice touch. The villain in the film was underdeveloped and weak but this is only a minor setback. Overall, this is a solid entertaining reboot with a great cast and a funny script that will delight newcomers and fans alike.- Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And it's good. I went into this not expecting much and was totally thrown off my guard. The movie was actually quite enjoyable. The humor, which in some very brief moments felt a little much, was very balanced with the story and the creepiness of the ghosts. Anyone who judges this movie based on what they think they know or what they saw just in trailers will really miss out on a good movie. It was a lot of fun, the story was actually good and the little bit of fan service and self deprecating humor were well placed. It is definitely worth checking out. I will also add that I think the 3D for this is worth the extra money and that theme song everyone was so enraged about is only in the movie itself for less than a minute total.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got to see an early screening last night and I AM HAPPY. I walked out of that theater absolutely swooning with love for those women and their characters, and with my stomach and face hurting from laughing and smiling. Of course it's not a perfect movie; what is? But I'm dizzy with joy that something so fun and funny and showcasing so many talented, amazing women (Leslie Jones was the highlight of the movie, in my opinion). It made me laugh, it spooked me a little (the ghosts were downright creepy!), and it made me care about the characters. It paid tribute to the originals without just being a direct rehash - it was a love letter. Yes, Hollywood, please keep making movies that are about more than just straight white guys. There are other people out there, and they deserve to have stories about them, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The last time I laughed this much at the theater was while watching Ted part 1. The jokes are razor sharp and quick witted, and they deliver. Kristen Wig is hilarious in this and Leslee Jones brings the house down with a few of her one-liners. Chris Hemsworth shows that he has a great sense of comedic timing, I hope he sheds Thor for more roles like this. The story is somewhat familiar to viewers of the original film. but there are enough new twists to keep your attention rapt. The special effects really help capture the mood in the movie, and some are hair- raising spooky.A wonderful summer movie that brings the fun, the funny, and the entertainment. Go see this: you will leave the theater with a sore face from having a smile stretched across it for 2 hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a female reboot of the original and it does what it says on the tin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin a review for this film with 'I don't hate this film because it's got women in it' is the sexist's equivalent to 'I'm not racist but'. Does this film deserve the 10 stars I'm giving it? Probably not. But does it deserve the barrage of 1 stars it's receiving from hundreds of aggressive men? Absolutely not, so I'll stand by my 10 stars in the hopes of evening the playing field; fight aggressive hatred with aggressive love. The film is funny; it's easy to watch, it's enjoyable, and it's very much in the same vain as the original. It's respectful of the original, and it's nods to it (though overt) are pleasant. None of the original cast needed to appear in the reboot for financial reasons, they had cameos because they wanted to and have faith in it. The pedestal the original movie had been placed upon is excessive and damaging; it was a good and enjoyable film but it was by no means the definitive piece of art it is hailed as by many basement dwellers. It was funny, easy to watch, and enjoyable. Which just so happens to be the same qualities as the reboot possesses. The cast work well, they act well, and they mesh well together. Chris Hemsworth's character is far more naturally funny than I originally thought he would be, and the characterisation of the women, though falling into a variety of well-used tropes, is interesting to watch. If the reboot had the same plot, the same villain, the same special effects, the same writing, and the same director, but four male leads, the vast majority of the poor reviews and insults thrown at the movie would not be present. If you keep obsessively and aggressively telling yourself you don't hate the film because of the female cast then you need to take a step back and recognise that these leading ladies aren't the problem here: you are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ghostbusters (new remix) spoiler free review:The perfect tribute to the Old Ghostbusters!Still an original storyline with just the right amount of old happenings. All the ladies were fantastic!The cameos were spot on minus one; and one didn't get enough screen time (in the opinion of some; not necessarily mine). One cameo was shown on TV in an ad spot or sneak preview, and some felt like that was the best of the bunch. Others felt like it wasn't enough of a cameo for the old Ghostbusters actors; I felt like they were all perfect as the movie wasn't about them anymore; it was a reboot. You can't have a reboot with too much screen time taken by the old actors.Some feel that the amount of jokes got tiresome, and that they were trying to hard to fit the jokes all in. Again, not necessarily my opinion.Chris Hemsworth is the most badass dumb handsome secretary I've ever seen. I would like to keep that pretty face around my office too ;)Edited to add: after sleeping on it, I was very happy to realize that there is no sexism towards women in this movie! No being told 'you're women, you can't fight ghosts!' Only: 'you're a scientist...you can't believe in ghosts!'I anticipate this being extremely popular this weekend once reviews are out! And will be going to see it again.I felt the IMAX 3D version is a must to see it, and added to it for sure! Spend that extra money for this film!My rating: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The anti-feminist one star reviews on here BEFORE THE FILM OPENED are just sad and pathetic. I'm 35 and love the original Ghostbusters movies and I loved this reboot too.No it will never match up to the Ackroyd/Murray films but on its own terms its very, very funny, creepy in places, great new characters and it's FUN. You will not see a more fun movie this year.The basic premise is that a sad loner who hates women (sound familiar?) tries to raise ghosts in New York to bring about the apocalypse. Struggling scientist Kristen Wiig gets fired from her prestigious job on the eve of a promotion and finds herself investigating a haunting with her old pal Melissa McCarthy. Tagging along for the ride is genius/nutjob engineer Kate McKinnon and wise- cracking subway worker Leslie Jones. Together they must foil said nerd's plan while trying to train hopeless man-bimbo receptionist Chris Hemsworth (who gets some of the biggest laughs in the movie).The plot is ABC but the real joy comes from the interaction with the characters; some of the funniest stuff since Paul Feig's last movie Spy (and Bridesmaids). There are numerous - though sadly brief - cameos from the old cast and plenty of cool new gadgets. My only real qualm was the overly CGI climax but even that was entertaining as hell. Highly recommended. When that opening Ghostbusters beat kicks in it makes you feel 10 years old again :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is really sad that in 2016 there is still people hating all over the internet only because is a team of 4 women. If you are a parent go watch this movie with your kids, show them some gender equality and that woman can also be heroes and strong. Critics already love it. What top critics say: The freewheeling and funny solidarity of the four leads win out in the end, even if Feig shows more timidity than he did in Bridesmaids, The Heat or Spy. Crucial to the fun: McKinnon, who steals the movie with her mad-scientist grin, eyes that gleam like a laser pointer and unexpected random weirdness. Jones, McCarthy, McKinnon, and Wiig are so good together - and in ways that are distinctively theirs and not recycled from the past - that their message of not giving a damn resonates better than the movie's underwhelming climax.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Are you afraid of ghosts? I suppose most people would be, but lately it seems that people are much more afraid of reboots, less like reboots and more like big hobnailed boots stomping over beloved memories. 'Ghostbusters' main mistake was a rather unfunny first trailer that suggested that Paul Feig and Melissa McCarthy's team up magic had finally spluttered out. The second trailer was much better, but once the naysayers had grabbed on to the first they were NOT letting go, no siree! So the good news for Feig fans is that 'Ghostbusters' in 2016 is almost as enjoyable as the original. A definite reboot and not a sequel, it nonetheless acknowledges the original with some nice touches and a few well placed cameos that serve to pass the baton. Everyone was well aware that they had some pretty huge shows to fill, and obviously put a lot of work in, with the end result a well acted, well written and technically impressive whole.Our four Ghostbusters are equipped with the scariest things known to misogynist muppets ? female genitalia! They also come equipped with four actual personalities that are very well realized by the actresses concerned. Standout is Kate McKinnon, who seems to be channelling Tank Girl (wait for THAT to be offered very soon) as a very quirky genius, her marvellous face lighting up the screen as the characters weirdness is allowed to play around on it. Melissa McCarthy is quite restrained compared to her other roles with Feig but does her usual stand up job, with Kristen Wiig the sensible one who seems to have been possessed by Jennifer Aniston. Leslie Jones plays the only non scientist in the crew, but comes armed with a prodigious knowledge of New York and a bagful of sass. The icing on top is Chris Hemsworth, who plays their thick as a donut receptionist, showing a nice talent for comedy whilst he does it.The special effects are what you'd expect from a big budget film today, and the ghosts all look terrific. There's a return for a couple of non human characters that will delight some, and may even bring smiles from the grumpy gits. Children will certainly have a few scares (as in the original), and the script allows for jumps and laughs equally well. Much like the original it has an action finale that by necessity ramps down the humour but even so gives you plenty to cheer for and chuckle at.So 'Ghostbusters' is a really good film. There: I said it. I'm happy to slate a film if I don't like it (I walked out of the godawful new Ice Age film last week) but for most of this I had a goofy smile on my face and gave a few decent belly laughs. The female switch doesn't matter one jot, it only allows you to see four awesome actresses rather than actors. It's wonderful that once again bustin' makes me feel goooood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is fun! The four leads do some amazing work and there is some true emotion behind all the comedy. The creative minds behind this film obviously love and respect the original and this shines through in some of the more 'fan-servicey' moments. The villain is not incredibly developed but he is still highly interesting, especially when you consider the fact that he begins as a human and becomes a ghost (a twist on the other Ghostbuster baddies, who begin as ghosts and posses people/find human followers). Paul Fieg makes sure that all four women shine together, making their friendship a pivotal part of the narrative. In fact, by the end of the movie, they feel more like a family than a group of co- workers. And seeing them fire up the proton packs for the first time, truly made me feel warm inside. This film is nostalgic yet fresh, funny yet heart felt and a true summer flick. I highly recommend it! Also Chris Hemsworth is amazing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great response to misogyny out there.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is more of a response to all of those who are "reviewing" it without seeing it and giving it low grades just because they are upset because of an all-female cast.That's why I am giving this a 10. Because it have already served it's purpose, outing the misogyny, not only in the movie business, but in the society as a whole.I would recommend everyone to actually watch the movie, instead of just giving in to the fedora clad MRA-hate out there, that constantly oppresses any form of change towards an egalitarian society.You're welcome!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Look people, it's not a bad movie. Everyone is complaining how it "won't be as good as the original", and let's be honest: it wasn't. BUT, it was a good movie. No one can deny that. It doesn't live up to the original but if you think that it's a bad movie you better keep it to yourself. The main thing is that the original cast were the funniest, and most loved people in the movie business in the 80s. These are theoretically the same people, but they are females. What's the big deal? They are as funny and loved as the original Ghostbusters. I recommend to all you haters to go see it and watch it as if there was never an original Ghostbusters and maybe you can enjoy it more. There's no guarantee that you will love it, but if you get out of your head that it's a bad movie, then maybe you can enjoy it the way it deserves to be enjoyed. But hey, haters gonna hate. :?|</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly I have to say.......I was dreading this movie but I thought I would give it the benefit of doubt. The result? WOW, I was really surprised! The trailers really did it no justice whatsoever. They were shocking in fact. Today I walked into the cinema with an open mind. What happened for the next 2 hours? I laughed! MY GOD did I laugh. This was brilliant. The characters were brilliant. Kate McKinnon was beyond quirky. She really made it for me. The rest of the cast (including the cameos) were all great but Kate really knocked the ball out of the court. Okay, so the special effects could have been more dark, more scary but some scenes I felt certainly portrayed a disturbing side which at the same time were visually joyful to watch. This really felt like a ghostbusters movie. All the throwbacks gave me the feeling of nostalgia, not directly connected to the original but it works in its own way. It's a really worthy reboot that deserves all the best reviews it can get. Why? Because you WILL leave the cinema with a HUGE smile on your face. Yes I would have liked to see a continuation of the original but I would rather have this than have nothing at all because none of the cast would get together to make a handover movie that they were all 100% pleased with. It could have worked. It still could. It just wasn't meant to be right now, then this gem came along. Forever Ghostbusters will remain a favourite of mine. This here is something else. It's a new reboot in its own right and it will please a few old and an entirely new audience. Go see this and make up your own mind but I think it deserves its 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ghostbusters 2: a Classic Romp for the girls (and boys too!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, I never review movies. I feel it is out of my place to do so. but this picture truly touched me, and brought my inner child back out once again. Some may complain about the female heavy cast, but I say neigh, your ignorance will only cost you a few hours of prime entertainment courtesy of Mr. Paul Feig, Ian Hemsworth, Target lady from Snl and Melissa McCarthy. Grab some p-corn and hit the theater lines, cause baby, you're about to have one heck of a busting' time. First, for all the man-children out there, hating on a movie you haven't seen, go back to watching Adam Sandler! Now for a quick synopsis, warning spoilers aplenty await you!++SPOILER SECTION++ So here's the synopsis. We start out in Italy oddly enough, back in 1944. A group of greasy old men (Much like you haters!) rally up some soldiers and other workers to get ready for a big vacation. They then kidnap some young men and women, and strip them and bring them to a giant palace. A few fascists gloat about their lifestyles, and some prostitutes tell obscene tales of sexual abuse and horror, leading to the sexual abuse of the kidnapped children. By the end, the Fascists murder the children in a bloody backyard torture session, while some of the recruited soldiers dance. It truly lives up in every way to the original, and I really think the crew deserves some props for the excellent work they put in. Don't listen to those that can't accept change, and make sure you bring the whole kit and caboodle to see the Ghostbusters movie. I think its in 3D in some limited locations. Overall, I'd have to give this movie a ten out of ten, it's definitely good enough, but also to spite the haters ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prior to watching this flick, I was a big fan of Paul Feig his previous work. Feig, a Jew like myself and I are very similar. We both want more female empowerment in the media, and less straight white males roaming this planet.As a Jew, I can appreciate the message this motion picture is trying to send. More women need to stand up to the oppression and white men need to be humiliated, just like myself, who often goes to white guilt conventions. My good friend, David Goldstein, first introduced me to the idea a few years back and it's transformed my entire life since.I had a great time watching this with my wife's son. Hope there will be a sequel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another hugely funny film from Paul Feig and his crew</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm delighted to say that I loved this film. I may not have the same nostalgic adoration for the original Ghostbusters as so many people, but I was so glad that I could enjoy this as an individual movie, one that proves that Paul Feig and his crew can do almost no wrong, thanks to a hilarious script and great performances throughout.That's the one thing that I want to emphasise about this film: it's more a Paul Feig comedy than a Ghostbusters remake. For over an hour, this film diverts hugely from the 1984 movie, focusing far more on its own characters than simply copying the original beat- for-beat. Also, as a Paul Feig movie, it's absolutely hilarious from start to finish.It might not have the same raunchy humour as Spy and Bridesmaids, but there are still so many laughs throughout Ghostbusters. Given the poor trailers ahead of the film, I expected the impressively funny start to wear off, but I was hugely surprised to find that I was laughing a good few times every minute for about three quarters of this movie, and so was everyone else in the cinema.The comedy in this film is absolutely excellent, without a doubt, and the writers did a fantastic job to make a PG-13 blockbuster so consistently funny. However, the biggest reason why I found this film so hilarious was definitely the performances.Living up to their predecessors fantastically, the lead actresses Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy and Leslie Jones were all very entertaining. However, the real stand-outs from this movie are Chris Hemsworth and Kate McKinnon.Hemsworth, in a relatively small and simple role, is absolutely hilarious every time he's on screen. It's a performance that goes way beyond the bounds of anything he's done before, but he makes what would normally be a pretty repetitive role, playing the brain- dead receptionist, hugely funny, adding an extra level of humour to the film beyond the four leading ladies.But the person who was even funnier than Hemsworth was Kate McKinnon. Throughout the film, I'm certain that she accounted for 90% of the biggest laughs, even having me in tears laughing so hard at one moment. She plays Holtzmann, the bizarre but brilliant scientist, to absolute perfection, with an on-point balance between purely bizarre humour and side-splitting physical comedy, making her the brightest spot at the centre of this hugely funny movie.However, I do have one clear flaw with Ghostbusters: its story. Whilst the comedy was consistently hilarious from start to finish, when the film strays more into action/blockbuster territory, it feels a little two-dimensional and predictable. The action and sci- fi is certainly something the original did far better, and when this film tries to emulate it, it's too much like a retreading of the original, which was disappointing to see.Overall, however, I couldn't help loving this film. Yes, its story may be too similar to the original, but the rest of this film is an example of how to remake a movie. It introduces new characters that take the film in a different direction, and give it its own identity, as a fantastically funny movie with some of the best comedic performances in recent years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite the awful marketing, it ended up feeling like a Ghostbusters film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am actually amazed at how many people see the 1984 original as one of the best movies of all-time. It's a good fun film with a few laughs, nothing more. In fact, the sequel is probably as the good as its predecessor in my opinion.As for this re-make, many of you know that the build-up and marketing for this film has gone pretty bad to say the least. With every trailer and TV spot not showing much promise and new theme song being ripped to shreds. A lot of people are giving this film so much hate, that they are not even going to see it and give it a chance.I will have to agree that I have not liked what I have seen either. The main things is the comedy, the gags did not make me laugh at all and had me shaking my head. Some of the casting did not give me much promise. When I say casting, I do not mean because they are female. That being said, I went into the screening with an open mind like I do with all my films. And you know what, it was all right.The opening scene brings in you in nicely and gives the film some promise. The early character development is pretty solid and I was found the characters believable in their aims and what they wanting out of this. It moves a long nicely, even with some bits not quite working. I remained keen to see how the film would end and it was a pleasant final act.The main thing going into what is a comedy, is to see whether it will make you laugh. For me, I laughed I would say fairly steadily throughout the film. Yes, some gags did not work, but some did. Thankfully the ones that didn't, did not make me shake my head in disgust. It just did not work for me. The good stuff did make me chuckle, and I was surprised at the amount of movie references it made which pleased me.The writing is probably its strongest positive. It is sharp, it's witty at times and there is a lot of nice science tech talk like I remember the original Ghostbusters having, which I was not expecting.The performances were pretty solid from every department and the chemistry worked fairly well. Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig might not have been stand-outs, but they were certainly solid leads. McCarthy toned down the McCarthy most people associate with her, and we get a good team leader. Kate McKinnon might not have totally fulfilled my hopes from what I saw of her in the trailer. But I still was entertained by her character. She does get a bit over-the-top. But it was a pretty transition from her works on TV. From what I can tell, it is a pretty hard skill to move from TV into film. Everything about Leslie Jones in the trailer was all one note and very annoying, and I did not think she would go anywhere. Amazingly, she is not annoying. Yes, there are moments that would have liked to get rid of. But I thought she felt like a valuable part of the team. I never thought I would actually type that about Leslie Jones.Chris Hemsworth was really funny in it. He definitely has the best gags. They were so silly and random and yet very clever and well delivered. Some are just silly, went too far and did not work. But the majority of them were great. I must mention that there is a lot of cameos in this, and in more ways than one. There are cameos of actors/characters from the original, references to quotes from the film. Some worked well, some didn't, and some were just truly awful. Even at times, they looked forced and it made the film's pace slow down. It is almost as if the studio told them to put one in every 15 minutes. I don't mind there being cameos. However, if they had toned that down a bit, they might have made the film stand alone by itself.But thankfully, it is by far not the worst thing I have seen this year. The story was perfectly fine and felt like a Ghostbusters film. It was well developed, you knew exactly what was going on and it made me interested to see how it would conclude. To those many haters that are boycotting it. Go and see it as it is a solid film, and with it being released in a summer where the big budget films have not lived up to anything, it is certainly one of the more memorable ones.One thing that I certainly was not expecting was how they constructed the end credits. In fact, this could be a landmark moment for how big budget films conduct their credits. Most do fancy graphics for the first portion of the credits, and then the rest is just a black background and rolling text. Ghostbusters managed to make the whole credits segment worth watching. From a visual standpoint, it did something really interesting with the credits, that I hope a lot of future blockbuster films take on board.Speaking of credits, there is a post-credits scene. It is certainly interesting. But I think it is gone down the route of many re-makes, which was a shame. However, I will be intrigued to see where they go with it.Rating: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy successor, give it a chance!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me lay the ground clear: I really enjoyed the first two Ghostbusters films and hated all the marketing for this film, and dreaded its existence for some time. I confess I only saw this film because I received free tickets to the premiere. I went in with zero expectations and came out very pleasantly surprised. The new Ghostbusters is pretty damn good. It's (fairly) consistently funny, in unique and inventive ways, and showcases a host of impressive effects. What's great about the film is the writing. Paul Feig is a real natural at comedy, and once more he directs a script layered with witty dialogue. Of course, these are matched by excellent comedic performances. McCarthy does her usual shtick well enough, Kate McKinnon is slightly underused, but is absolutely hilarious, and even Leslie Jones, while a tad one note, proves nonetheless endearing. Kristen Wiig is probably the blandest of the four, yet plays a good straight (wo)man. The real surprise is Chris Hemsworth, who I honestly thought would be terrible in this, from marketing and trailers, but stole all of the best lines as an incredibly daft receptionist. Aside from providing a bit of kibble for gender role reversal, his performance reminded me of Brad Pitt in Burn After Reading, an attractive leading man who totally mocks himself in a comedy role, and it's similarly hilarious. In all, these characters and performances ensure the movie passes it's run time enjoyably. The negatives revolve around a plot that seems to short change a villain to only a few scenes, and culminate in a climax that seemed overlong, albeit capped off by an incredible vortex scene, you'll know it when you see it. Yet even if the plot is lacking in its mechanics somewhat, the movie never takes itself seriously enough (a la Tarzan or Batman vs Superman) for you to really mind. It knows its ridiculous. Another plus is the 3D, which was legitimately well done, a rarity for the medium. To be honest, misogyny debates aside, the marketing for this film was abnormally lacking, it's baffling to me how they reduced a film packed with funny gags to a trailer that was so cringe, but I implore you, if you love the first films, give this flick a chance, I'm sure it'll surprise a lot of people as it did me. Don't hate this movie for the sake of it, especially as I see this thing has a rating of 4.2, that's just plain unfair. If you go looking for fun, undemanding entertainment, that's exactly what you'll get, made with intelligence, wit and verve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nostalgia glasses off, spectre-tacular fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of varied personalities form a paranormal company in order to catch ghosts and save New York City.Based on Ivan Reitman "Ghost Busters" written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis without drawing any comparisons to the 1984 classic, Ghostbusters 2016 is 116m 28s of stylish sleek fun. Ghostbusters writers Katie Dippold and Paul Feig interestingly bring the team together with clean cut modern cinematic swagger. Feig, director of 2015's Spy, turns his hand effortlessly to an effects driven comedy friendship rework.With a Disney Haunted Mansion-like opening with a genuine jump scare, to animated mannequins and joy riding ghosts (including Slimer), there's plenty of ectoplasm on display (that appears to follow) the excellent cast, especially Kristen Wiig's Gilbert. Haunted by a paranormal encounter as a child, Gilbert who's co- written ghost book loses her job when a ghost encounter video goes viral. Wiig along with kooky hot engineer Holtzmann played by Kate McKinnon light up the screen (no pun intended) and soup loving Melissa McCarthy's Abby Yates and Leslie Jones' subway worker Tolan provide the comedy backbone.While the scripted comedy doesn't go for subtle wit, with some physical gags its mostly more on the nose comedy, infused with pop culture references, including Ghost and The Exorcist to name a few, it genuinely has its laugh out loud moments, Feig even throws in a fart joke for good measure. There's lots of chuckles to be had, many come from Gilbert's and Yates former, later rekindled friendship. Feig offers excellent set-ups and set pieces as proton packed armed they go about busting spooks in a rock concert (where Ozzy Osbourne cameos), the city street and subway at one point using some new toys. There are many memorable moments, a scene where they run some tests like Peter Parker trying out his web, along with a moment where Holtzmann goes all Clint Eastwood western to name a few. McCarthy and Jones' comedy timing is impeccable, with smart Wiig and wacky genius McKinnon bouncing off wonderfully - firmly stamping their mark. But overtly focal Chris Hemsworth sends his persona up somewhat as dim witted eye candy Kevin and steals many of the best moments.As the team discover there's a disturbed bell boy Rowan North (Neil Casey) amplifying paranormal activity in New York, during a carnival of phantoms we get to see the Marshmallow Man in balloon form and a pilgrim ghost take on the team. If anything the excellent CGI spirits on occasion are more spectral beings rather than the departed traditional dead, there's a giant Gremlin-like flying creature and holographic like ghouls trapped in mirrors. Ghostbusters moves along at breakneck speed, and while the main bad guy may lack weight and grit thankfully this is counteracted by the genuine likable and watchable main cast.While the CGI may lack that Indiana Jones/Poltergeist 80's optical feel. The colourful ghost effects on display - reminiscent of Beetle Juice and akin to the original second outing, along with the Ghostbuster (universe) cartoons, comics etc. have a charm of their own. At one time their Ghostbuster logo literally appears animated when Rowan mocks the team prior to him trying to destroy the city in a vortex, which lucky for the insurance company leaves little, if any mess. There are some fridge logic moments, why build a containment unit instead of zapping them into slimy gloop, unless it's to study, either way I'm sure Ghostbusters aficionados will be able to explain.There's an array of welcomed cameos for series fans from the likes of Ernie Hudson, as the undertaker Bill and uncle of Tolan, to Bill Murray, in a surprising extended cameo as Martin Heiss, who accuses the Ghostbusters of being fraudsters. Dan Aykroyd, has an excellent brief appearance as the all knowing cab driver. Even Annie Potts appears as a hotel desk clerk, snapping the crowning, "What do you want?" Andy Garcia shows up as the Teflon Mayor and humorously loses it when he is compared to the Mayor in Jaws. While Charles Dance's small role is fittingly cast as Gilbert's uptight University Dean.Feig offers along with the familiar theme tune supernatural hijinks and enough jump scare frights to give the youngsters the heebie jeebies. Dedicated to Harold Ramis, stick around for some end credit antics plus a post credit scene where Sigourney Weaver briefly appears as Holtzmann's mentor Rebecca Gorin and the team discovers the name Zuul for the fist time, setting it up for a sequel.Overall, with the controversial backlash and odd marketing now in the grave, as with any kind of rework comparisons will be made, taking my nostalgia glasses off, as a film in its own right, it's spectre- tacular fun and comes recommend.</fullReview>
