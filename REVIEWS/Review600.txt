		<shortDescription>Why we go the movies...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What an incredibly brave and honest look at relationships. I've have never seen a film so precisely and brilliantly capture this kind of emotion and transfer it to the screen the way Before Sunrise does. What a crime that neither Ethan Hawke or Julie Delpy was nominated for any major acting awards, actually screw that! What a crime it was that they didn't both sweep every major acting award altogether and that Richard Linklater didn't get any recognition for the screenwriting or brilliant directing of his wonderful actors! Loved the ending (as much as it pained me at the same time), loved how after it all they go back and show every location that the couple shared together. Loved how the dialogue never wavers, never addressing the relationship directly but allows us to indirectly see a geniune bond forming through the body language, facial expressions, and the dialogue, ooooohhh the dialogue. Every bit of it plucked right from those top ten late night conversations we've all had with close friends whether it was serious or in jest. And respect to Linklater for keepin it real, the movie was rated R cause of a couple minor swear words? Could of easily been removed without really desecrating the film but he keeps it in anyways. Screw you hollywood, your 'romantic comedies', your Freddie Prinze Jr.'s, your 'take the glasses off the girl and now she's pretty' movies. This is real romance! This is what I come to the movies for, to think, to be provoked and to be swept away by the magic that only cinema can provide. Before Sunrise has single-handedly reminded me about why I goto the movies......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the most sincere and touching boy-meets-girl movies ever made. While "Rebel Without a Cause" and "Say Anything" deliver nice portrayals, this movies strips down useless subplots and Hollywood divergences. This movie focuses purely on watching the budding of a beautiful romance. You never doubt for a second that the film will lead towards the romantic pairing of these two people. You almost immediately sense the synergy and the chemistry between Jesse and Celine, and it is simply pure joy to watch them find it. This movie is mostly all dialogue -based. But, every conversation between these too is greatly intriguing. What makes this pairing so romantic is how real it is. How in all that conversation, while often having no real bearing on anything critical, you can sense the nuances as these two become more fond and trusting of each other. This is exactly they way you would dream that you meet that special someone. And what makes it so true is that it is not even too fantastic to believe. This could be what would happen if you had been confident enough to strike up a conversation with that person you noticed somewhere random. And what puts the icing on this film is the magnificent backdrop of Vienna in which this film takes place. It just adds to the feeling of romantic nirvana that the film suggests. And no matter how many times I watch this film, I don't think I will ever tire of that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beauty is the simplicity of magnificent human emotion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Before Sunrise' is not a film to be scrutinised, nor studied. The absolute beauty of it lies in its perfection as a simple love story - of two lives suddenly thrown together in the midst of reality, and the ensuing night of simple love that follows. Every individual at some time in life dreams of the connection that is portrayed in this film between Jesse and Celine, and few ever find it. 'Before Sunrise' simply and elegantly demonstrates how the most fundamental passions of human emotion can envelope two complete strangers. The beauty of this film is that the story is the most important element. The ending is both provocative and emotional - scenes of the night previously seen in darkness are now portrayed in lonely daylight as the sun rises and the story closes on these two characters.I saw this film by accident one night late on television. I have never forgotten it. So well is it made that the audience never question if this could ever really happen in life, reality being so absolutely characterised in it.'Before Sunrise' is simply the story of two strangers bound in Vienna's lonely night splendour - one night of love in all its glory, one superb piece of film making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Casablanca for the 1990's - pure cinematic gold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Sunrise is romance for the slacker generation. Richard Linklater's romantic drama is an offbeat telling of a dream come true for most people. The film depicts romance in all it's glory, but without any of the pitfalls that befall most couples; and in short the film is about two people that have a relationship that's as close to perfection as relationships will ever come to - with just one problem, the problem of time. While most relationships wind down with time, this one keeps going strong throughout and time itself is the only thing that wears out. Before Sunrise is certainly not the typical sentimental 'Hollywood romance', which is another aspect that puts this film leagues ahead of the pretenders. The story follows two people, Jesse; an American and Celine; a French girl that meet on a train into Vienna. They instantly connect, and after telling her his awful idea for a television show and almost getting off the train, Jesse asks Celine to join him for the day in the picturesque city of Vienna...Before Sunrise works principally for two reasons - realistic acting and an immense script that builds the characters through their thoughts and feelings and thus allows us to get to know them as we do the people in real life. This allows the characters to be free, and it's easy to believe that these are real people and not just actors working from a script. This also allows us to feel for the characters for who they are, and not merely because they're the protagonists. This kind of realism is hard to capture as, at the end of the day, we as the audience know that they're watching a film and not observing real life; but Before Sunrise represents one of the truest to life exhibitions of realism ever to be seen on screen. A truly great script cannot work on it's own, and needs great actors to deliver it to an extent that does it justice, and although I'm not a fan of either Julie Deply or Ethan Hawke; on viewing this film, there is nothing you can do but give them both respect. I don't know whether they were in character or just playing themselves, but when a film is this good; it hardly matters.In a film like this, it is the writing that's the most important thing, and contained within the script are several observations about life, most of which I personally could relate to. This represents what Richard Linklater has achieved with this script as not only does it create and build the characters, but it also manages to expose what true love is, along with several other aspects of life. The fact that not all the anecdotes are relatable to me personally again represents the brilliance of writing. Everyone is different, and so different parts of the script will appeal to different people. There could be certain aspects about one person that one person loves and another hates; and that's the case with the musings in this script. Adding to the beauty of the film is the city of Vienna. The city itself isn't really important to the film as this is a story that could have taken place just about anywhere - but it makes for some lovely visuals and the upbeat, energetic romance that blossoms throughout the movie is matched by the beauty of the location.Before Sunrise is simultaneously beautiful and captivating. Richard Linklater has created something that is rare in the world of cinema; a film that captures the beauty of life without ever going over the top or being overly sentimental. Before Sunrise is what it is. And what it is, is pure cinematic brilliance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I want Céline and Jessie go further in their relationship, I want to tell them that they were made for each other, that in a lot of moment in the film we want they to die for each other. Their story is what we ever wanted and probably most of us never reached. This is about love but not stupid things like in "notting hills" or those kind of movie. This is life and i did believe in them, i did believe they were falling... This was so clever and touching. I have just finished to view it a minute ago and i m still there... I want to go to Vienna. I want to see them as soon as possible again.I have to say i was now becoming misanthropist and felt like if love was just a fake, a concept, but with this movie i realized that maybe somewhere, somehow and some when, something could really happen.I'm french and didn't know very well July Delpy despite Kieslowski "three colors : white"... Now i have to see her other works because she looks like an angel and got a perfect acting.i saw "before sunset" (the sequel in Paris) a few days before i saw "before sunrise" and their is no matter. They are both masterpieces. proof that you don't need to impress the eyes with technology to get pure feelings. I'm sorry for my English which i m trying to best.Franck in France</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfect Chemistry, In One of the Most Beautiful Romances I Have Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While traveling by train through Europe, the American Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and the French Celine (Julie Delpy) meet each other and decide to spend the night together in Austria. On the next morning, Jesse returns to United States of America, and Celine to Paris. "Before Sunrise" is one of my favorite romances, indeed one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever seen. It is a low budget movie with a very simple and real storyline, but the chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is perfect, and the dialogs are stunning. The direction is amazing, transmitting the feelings of Celine and Jesse to the viewer. I have just completed my review number 1,000 in IMDb, and I choose "Before Sunrise" for this significant number because it is a very special film for me. I cannot understand why this movie was not nominated to the Oscar, with such a magnificent screenplay, direction and performances. Yesterday I have probably watched this movie for the third or fourth time, and I still love it. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "Antes do Amanhecer" ("Before Sunrise")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Before Sunrise" is a wonderful love story and has to be among my Top 5 favorite movies ever. Dialog and acting are great. I love the characters and their ideas and thoughts. Of course, the romantic Vienna, introduced in the movie does not exist (you won't find a poet sitting by the river in the middle of the night) and it isn't possible to get to all the places in only one night, either (especially if you're a stranger and it's your first night in Vienna). But that's not the point. The relationship of the two characters is much more important and this part of the story is not at all unrealistic. Although, nothing ever really happens, the movie never gets boring. The ending is genuinely sad without being "Titanic" or something. Even if you don't like love stories you should watch this film! I'm a little skeptic about the sequel that is going to be released in summer. The first part is perfect as it is, in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of the 1990s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had never heard of this film before a couple of weeks ago, but its concept interested me when I heard it: an American man meets a European woman on his last night in Europe and they spend the night together talking. It sparked my interest, but I never expected it to be this great. Before Sunrise is a masterpiece, and it's also one of the most romantic films on record. To my surprise, it completely lacked the cynicism of the 1990s. It's impossible to really talk too much about it, since there is no real plot, so to speak (although there are plenty of thoroughly interesting things you could talk about; it is sort of like My Dinner With Andre, where there is a conversation, but it's not JUST the conversation that matters), but let me just say, see it.

Ethan Hawke (Jesse) "Tape" '01 and Julie Delpy (Celine) "ER" 94 TV Series (Nicole). This gal and guy, will warm your very heart and soul and make you think deeply into your past relationships and how you really wish you had followed your hearts strings with a guy or gal you deep down loved and lost track of over the years. Jesse and Celine have great conversation, and deep eye contact with a great magnetic explosion between the two of them. I am looking forward to the SEQUEL to this film in 2004 and if you have viewed this film, you will feel the same way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>blah blah blah</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me give you a quick synopsis of this movie. Ethan Hawke: "Blah blah blah blah blah." Judy Delpy (with French accent): "Blah blah blah blah blah." Actually, thats a little more interesting and doesn't take an hour and a half of your life, which you will wish you had spent doing something more interesting, like staring at the floor! Some of the shots of Vienna are nice, though it is too bad that the two self-involved, dull people keep getting in the way of them. If you like really boring vague conversations and listening to pretentious people try to be profound about life, love, etc., then you might like this movie. Otherwise you'll vomit on yourself (and maybe your girlfriend next to you, who is forcing you to watch it, and after you clean that up you'll break up with her, because you realize that she is also long-winded, vague, and pretentious, so the movie actually did some good by opening your eyes to that.) I kept waiting for the ax murderer to chop them up or aliens to kidnap them, anything to get them to shut up, but alas it never happened. Too bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Am I the only one?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Am I the only person that found this movie incredibly tedious, pretentious and badly acted? Did I mention boring? It took me 3 installments to get through this. My mind kept wandering to thoughts like "Why is Ethan Hawke's hair so greasy" and Julie Delpy's teeth being disturbing. Not good signs.Whoever said Ethan Hawke (was it Mrskunk?) had 2 expressions was exactly right. Most of the time he smirked. And the dialogue! Were we supposed to find it interesting? Amusing? To me, it was the musings of immature adults, and why were their musings any more interesting than yours or mine? Maybe that was the point - maybe the director was parodying the self-importance of teenagers and those slightly older. Was there any insight at all in all that talking? I couldn't find any. Not one single insight. Did you happen to notice that the whole time they talked about themselves? I include their philosophical comments, because they are about their own philosophy, not anyone else's. As far as they (and those of us who were trapped in their universe) were concerned the world did not exist. They wouldn't notice anything happening outside themselves. Could you ask for a better example of solipsism?I can't believe people think this is one of the greatest films ever made, a great romance, etc. If you want to see a great romance, rent "Notorious" or "Live Flesh" or, I could go on and on. Just like the movie. But I won't.I fear that this is a case of the "Emperor's New Clothes." Some critics called it a great film, so others jump on the bandwagon to show that they too have good taste.Believe me, this is not great filmmaking and this is not a great film. It's just an extremely boring film.You were warned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Annoying frat boy hits on French girl. For 12 hours. But the worst part is that the French girl goes along with it. For 12 hours. And we are forced to go along with it. For 2 hours. This is the kind of movie that makes you want to smack someone.Perhaps it wouldn't have been so bad if there had been some sort of chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. I mean, after all, even annoying frat boys can fall in love. But no. The two are so incompatibly different that, despite what the script says, none of the flirtations are believable. I imagine the minute the director yelled "cut", Julie would spin around and head straight for her trailer. Ethan would go soak his head. The problem is that the director never yells "cut". Instead we are subjected to watching the awkward, contrived and stiff ramblings of these two people who have nothing in common except for the script.I saw what the director was trying to do. He was trying to capture the poetry of life through long, continuous shots and mundane dialogue. He was trying to show us how wonderful the simplicity of everyday life can be. But there is nothing artistic or poetic about the shots, the dialogue or the emotion on screen. The whole thing feels like an awkward date you just cant wait to ditch."Before Sunrise" is like "When Harry Met Sally", except without the humour, the charm, the witty style, the plot or the music. In essence, there is no reason to watch this movie. If you do watch this movie, make sure you're not sitting near anyone or you might get smacked.Before sunrise? Heh, I think I'll sleep in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely tedious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems I am in the minority here but I found this movie over-calmingly tedious. It's starts well, the meeting on the train and the intriguing possibility of what may happen when two strangers meet by chance is alluring but once they start wandering around Vienna it's when it starts to get boring. The dialogue is just the kind of naive, wistful, cod-philosophical nonsense that young couples on their first date come up with to impress the other partner. Fine if you are trying to get laid but it makes for rather irritating viewing. After a while I was more interested in the scenery than what was going on with the main characters. By the end I just wished they'd shut up and get on the damn train! It's not that I don't have a romantic streak or appreciate dialogue based movies, there are many good examples of this type of film, it's just that I expect not to almost fall asleep during it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are many people in our lives that we meet only once in our lifetime, but for some reason or another we remember those persons for the rest of our lives. These once in a lifetime friendships occur between people with long distances between and there are always some natural reasons for why we don't meet these people anymore. We don't always even know their names, as we are never presented to each other, and sometimes we even forget to ask what their names are. It's funny how common humanity makes occasional friends and we like to keep it as such, because reuniting might spoil fond memories, or we don't know do they. We are too afraid to check that out.The movie 'Before Sunrise' just caught me watching it. I never had intention to watch it through, but because the discussion between the couple seemed interesting, I gave a look for the rest of the film. I didn't know what to expect from it, but nor did the young couple. They had time to discuss with each other until the sunrise and anything could happen before they had to separate. I believe this film has had good reviews because the situation is something that everybody on this planet has at least once or twice lived through. It makes us all think about all those people we have met only once in our lives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i watched this movie 10 years ago. and have watched it on video an average of once a year since. it's the type of movie that's timeless, because the themes are universal, yet the stories and conversation are so personal. it's also one of the very few movies that capture you from frame one til the credits roll, despite the fact that there are, really, just two (very involving) characters. this owes a lot to the engaging acting by hawke and delpy, who make us believe that they are actually jesse and celine. this is also the first movie i saw that mentioned reality TV, and now, the phenomenon is rampant! i love the way this movie just envelops the audience in its space, and makes you think, however jaded you may be, that you are one of those characters. it also made me want to ride the train around Europe! i have not met anyone who has not been able to relate to this movie. maybe that speaks about myself, my friends, or just the sheer genius of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is intelligent. That is, more than most other movies, it transcends the least common denominator - stupid people will probably not appreciate it. The story also relies heavily on dialogue. It has some parallels to Lost in Translation, although Before Sunrise is much brighter, somehow less abstract, and simply a lot better.The script, the characters and even the slightly surreal atmosphere feel totally realistic. The actors play absolutely brilliantly. Rarely have I seen a movie where the script and the acting has melted this perfectly together.The dialogue moves into very personal issues, with the risk of becoming a little over the top. It does, however, stay on the right side almost all the time, although I found a few moments a little awkward and embarrassing. Balancing on this fine line demands outrageously talented actors. Sometimes, it yields great results, and overall this movie is simply stupendous! Only very, very rarely is "love" in films depicted in a way that I find trustworthy and realistic. Every time that is achieved, the result is fantastic. I think the stunning and apparently timeless beauty of the female lead actress helped quite a bit in this respect. She still looks stunning in this film, 12 years after.This is simply a gem of a movie that you can't miss. One of the best movies I have seen from the 1990s!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sweet and charming, funny and poignant, plot less but meaningful, "Before Sunrise" (1995), the third movie of Richard Linklater, is dedicated to everyone who ever been in love, is in love, or never been in love but still dreams of it and hopes to find it. It is one of the very rare movies that is/should/will be equally interesting to teenagers, their parents and even grandparents. It seems a very simple little movie with no spectacular visual effects, car chases, or long and steamy sex scenes. Two young people in their early 20s, two college students (American tourist Ethan Hawke who is returning home after the summer in Europe and the French student Julie Delpy who goes to Paris to attend the classes in Sorbonne) meet on a train. They are attracted to each other instantly even before they start talking, they hop off the train in Vienna where they walk around exploring the city all night. They talk and fall in love. That's it, that's the movie. It could've been boring and silly but instead, it is a lovely, believable, clever, and moving romance that only gets better with each viewing (at least, for this viewer). High praise and my sincere gratitude go to the director and writers for delivering two charming characters, superb writing, always interesting and witty dialogs, two awesome performances, and the atmosphere of magic that falling in love is. Julie Delpy, who looks like a Botticelli's angel, is great in portraying smart, independent, and incredibly attractive young woman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is truly truly one of the best movies about love that I've ever seen. Closely followed by none other than "Before Sunset", which technically isn't another movie at all, since it's about the same two people and the same romance.This is "love" in the real world. OK, that's only if most people are as intelligent and eloquent as the leads in the movie. Reading the other reviews, it pleases me to know how so many other folks are crazy over dialog-based movies as well. And this is what makes "Before Sunrise" so good. The dialog is perfect. It's so real, so engaging and funny. It's hardly a surprise that Jesse and Celine fall in love, 'coz you fall in love with them at the very same time.My favorite scene is the one in the coffee shop, where they pretend to phone their best friends, with the other pretending to be said best friend. It's PERFECT. Brings you back to the very moment when you fell in love for the very first time in your life.I must say that if you have a choice, do watch "Before Sunrise" before watching "Before Sunset". If like me, you watched "Sunset" first, it's hard to shake off the feeling of pity and sadness for the two young lovers throughout the entire show.Once again, the greatest romantic movie in my books. Wonderful acting, excellent script, and beautiful locations. Young love, at it's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the kind of conversations we all have in reality, yet projected here in a purely cinematic fold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Sunrise has many remarkable things going on, almost too many to fit into one review like this, but it's suffice to say that it's one of the most observant character studies of the nineties, maybe even in all of contemporary cinema, to be observant not about love, per-say, so much as it's about a human connection. How does one fall in love at first sight? No one does, at least that's deep down the consensus that Linklater wants to show with his film. And *yet* there is the possibility of as intense a connection, of a bond that can form in those that are young and with many ideas that can be expressed articulately and with a breadth of cynicism and is somehow very tender and true at the same time. Linklater here gives us the story of Celine and Jessie, a French girl and an American boy who get off the same train heading to Vienna, and on the way there start to talking about things, at first arbitrary, then personal (Jessie seeing death for the first time in his great grandfather). Jessie persuades Celine to go along with him on a night out on the 'town', in Vienna, until his plane the next morning.Before Sunrise gives Jessie and Celine, in the midst of the gorgeous Vienna scenery and locales to go on and on about subjects that have a lot of importance, and in a sense is about the act of having conversations, of what it's like to watch people having one leading into another and another. Here it's often about relationships and commitments, as Jessie and Celine tell stories sometimes somewhat inconsequential, or seemingly so, and another that may tell a lot about their essential qualities. We hear confessions of desires for other loves, or what weren't really loves, of being part of a family or part of an upbringing that may or may not inform how you'll love your life, of what it means to believe or not believe in some religious form, or just to have some connection to any faith and the soul (I loved the bit about the quakers in the church), and sometimes laced with cynicism or skepticism. Jessie may be more responsible for that last part, but what's fascinating about the film is that it's never exactly cynical itself, just commenting upon cynicism that lays in the concerns of men and women at that age of their lives.Meanwhile, it's always great to see Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy in these roles, where they're not incessantly annoying in that 90s Generation-X mode, but are the kinds of people where if not in the central conceit of the film, which isn't a bad one at all but a necessary one, one might think to find walking along the streets of a city somewhere. The conceit is that of an old romantic picture ala Brief Encounter, only here intimacy is expressed in the central characters either between each other, where sweet asides are actually acceptable ("I have to tell you a secret", Jessie says, and then leans in for a kiss, ho-ho), or in the little moments that pop up with other people along the way. I loved the scene with the poet, where it's very cinematic a thing to suddenly find a random romantic bit player in the midst of a romantic picture with such beautiful words at his disposal, or with the palm reader and how the reactions from Jessie and Celine are that we might share, but really are seeing them do it first-hand. All the while Hawke and Delpy embody the roles interestingly- we can see how neuroses are being formed already for their adult lives- as it may lead off into the future...Featuring splendid cinematography and a script with an ear for natural wit and a true sense of what it means to have a moment of happiness, however self-contained, as it may lead into something more. Who's to say you can't suddenly be attached to someone, if only for less than 24 hours, and be that much more attached than a married couple? This is perhaps Linklater's thesis, but there's more to it than just that. It's a very dense film, and one that will have me calling back to it repeatedly. One scene especially, which is both cheesy and brilliant is when the two of them are talking 'on the phone' in front of each other mimicking their expositions might go to the other's friend.

		<shortDescription>The most overrated movie I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before anyone could accuse me of not liking this film because I'm not romantic let me tell you that I love romance. The more disgusting it is the more I like it. I liked the basic idea of two strangers falling in love in a nice Vienna scenery. But even beautiful Vienna couldn't save this movie. Well, American guy and French girl meet on a Budapest-Paris train (I'm not sure if there ever was a direct Budapest-Paris train, but whatever, there are direct Budapest-Vienna trains and that's pretty much enough for us). The boy convinces the girl to get off the train with him in Vienna and spend the rest of the day with him. Sounds sweet, right? From now on the movie is nothing but talking and talking and talking. Which wouldn't exactly be bad but in 9 scenes out of 10 they are talking so many deep-wannabe nonsense that made me have a slight nausea from about the 15th minute. I would have loved this movie much better with some likable, not-so-smart-ass characters. Maybe I will give a try to the sequel Before Sunset (God save me it's also an 8, I hope it's a much deserved 8). But before that I need some time to recover.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Richard Linklater's beautifully directed mixture of youthful romance and Paris travelogue is one of the 90's best thinking person's romantic movies. Julie Delpy turns in one of the decade's most engaging performances as the Parisian lass who spends a day with stranger-on-a-train Ethan Hawke. The dialogue (and there is oodles of it) is sometimes meandering and overly precious, but this portrait of two young wannabe-lovers making a romantic, intellectual, and spiritual connection to one another is full of wonderfully amusing, touching and insightful moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointment from an otherwise great director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disappointing to find that I don't like all of Richard Linklater's films. All of his others rock.I got the feeling from this that Celine could only have been interested in Jesse because of his looks, since he sure was a dead-end intellectual poser conversationally. The conversations real people have in such situations are more interesting and much more entertaining. If you buy this as "real", you haven't done much traveling. If you made lame attempts at conversation like this with a foreign girl who took an interest to you, she would run for cover and not think twice. At first Celine seems real enough, but since she seems to enjoy Jesse's inanity, you can only assume she must be as vacuous as him. And this premise that he didn't have enough money for a hotel or even a bottle of wine... Maybe if he didn't blow his money eating in the friggin' dining car on an Austrian train. If this was real life and real people, those two would have gone and seen the avant-garde play, their new-found Viennese actor friends would show them a great time afterwards, and then the couple would be invited to spend the night in someone's guest bedroom where Celine and Jesse would conjugate the French verb "baiser" all night long. The plot is unrealistic and painfully boring, and the dialogue makes you want to dope slap both of them. Julie Delpy, quit hanging out with twits just cuz their cute. Ethan Hawke, go home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First let me say that Before Sunrise, like all movies, is NOT a movie for all tastes. It appears some folks are less smart to acknowledge this fact, but it is remarkable to contemplate the kind of outright dislike this small harmless movie generates from some people. For me, like most folks here, Before Sunrise struck a deep chord in me, I was truly stunned, moved, inspired by it. This is a movie that ultimately benefits from more than one viewing. It creates some of the most awesomely unforgettable feelings and emotions you can possibly imagine. It is impossible to imagine this world without ever thinking about the kind of inspirational feelings I got from it.The movie works as a communion of two fragile souls that are starting to get to know each other. It is very intelligent and inspiring, not so much in how one conversation necessarily ties into the next or the significance of the topics of Jesse and Celine's discussions, but rather the little nuances, the perfectly articulate responses they provoke from each other. It captures an honest, romantic, yet fleeting human emotion that is starting to blossom in the awesomely sublime Viennese milieu; it convinces us that their evanescent relationship might be the greatest compliment in the world. And what happens after that night is open for debate, but I never doubt that they won't each other again.The facile comments by RockytheBear and the below user are hopeless examples of a doctrinaire dissenter unwilling to accept and respect those who love this movie.See it and it may change your way of life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Before Sunrise, you simply watch two people go on an overnight date. Yippie. I've been on plenty of dates to know how they work, so I certainly don't need to waste my time watching other people do it. The two characters in the movie have extended conversations broken up about every ten minutes to change the scenery and give you a chance to wake up. The conversations are mundane and often pointless. It's like watching a reality TV show, only without all the drama that makes it interesting.The acting is sub-par. Ethan Hawke was okay, though his character was extremely annoying. Julie Delpy, on the other hand, delivered her lines devoid of any emotion. Her way of attempting emotion was to simply stare out the window.This movie appeared to be made simply because the writer wanted other people to hear his ideas about life. This is fine, as many movies have been made for this purpose. However, the flaw here is that this is the only point to the movie. There isn't any connecting plot at all, just a series of conversations. The movie "Tape" (also w/ Ethan Hawke) is also just a series of conversations, though the only setting is one hotel room and the movie is actually just one really long scene. However, "Tape" actually is entertaining in that the conversations have a point and actually move the characters to some sort of resolution or change - this is where "Before Sunrise" fails.To sum up, if you have insomnia, this "film" is your cure. Or, if you're a hermit and you miss having conversations with people, then this will provide for a substitute to interacting with others...just don't plan to be entertained.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this after reading reviews for "Before Sunset" and got my hopes up for "Before Sunrise." However, the normally sexy Ethan Hawke was extremely annoying and did not have any chemistry with Julie Delpy. Delpy was interesting, beautiful, and smart. It didn't seem like she had any spark with Hawke's character, a naive, judgemental American tourist. Throughout the movie, Delpy seems to enjoy telling Hawke her various theories about life and such, but doesn't really seem interested in him romantically. He just comes off as a drooling adolescent. In this movie, chemistry would be the only way to pull this movie together, since its basically the two people trading ideas. Disappointing unless you're a die-hard fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very charming film... please be patient with it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw this movie in the theater when it came out in 1995 via a free advanced screening, I was totally enchanted and would have gladly paid to see it. I was sorry when I talked to many people afterwards who had also seen it and who were totally disappointed with it and how it ended. I, on the other hand, felt completely the opposite. I was totally satisfied with the outcome and everything else. People I talked to said there was too much talking! Plus they were unhappy because they felt that the ending left you wondering about the fate of the two characters. I found these observations to be absurd and to also be painful evidence of how the majority of the American movie-going public seems to have a tendency to want easy-to-follow stories in films with not too much complex and intelligent dialogue lest they get confused. They also like to be spoon-fed tidy endings--happy OR sad. This disgusts me. Nobody wants to be challenged anymore??? And as for the ending (and I don't want to be a spoiler), I am totally content because I know in my heart that these two characters WILL see each other again. It's all about your own personal faith in romance and destiny. It's a very personal film that doesn't speak to all people. But it certainly spoke to me. Give it a chance! Be patient with it! Richard Linklater has crafted a very lovely film with a beautiful story set against the beautiful background of the city of Vienna. Watching it makes you feel as if you yourself are strolling through the city streets along with the characters. As if you yourself were tripping through Europe on a Eurail pass. It's very intimate. Plus, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy do an exquisite job of bringing the complex script to life. They must have improvised during some parts and it works well. They have a great chemistry in their roles. Their awkwardness as strangers getting to know each other in the beginning is very believable and you can truly feel the romance and bonding develop between them as the movie progresses. I get the feeling that this was a very personal work for Mr. Linklater and I deeply respect him for getting this film made. It definitely touched me and I hope it touches others just as much. Bravo for romance!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Painfully Realistic Story of Young Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a chance encounter on the train, a young couple spends a single night strolling the streets of Vienna, discussing life and love. The primary reason to see "Before Sunrise," is to watch a young Julie Delpy deliver her lines. As "Celine," this sexy, brainy, soulful brown-eyed blond is sort of a cross between Brigitte Bardot and Joni Mitchell as they were in their mid-twenties. Risking overstatement, Celine is practically the ideal woman, unusually beautiful and very feminine while being natural, unpretentious, introspective, and selflessly loving. We can easily forgive that she is a bit eccentric and talks a blue streak, for her sincere, intelligent remarks are occasionally penetrating. Further, her varied expressions are nothing short of captivating and she speaks English with a French accent that is very endearing. If there is a fly in the ointment of this good movie, it would have to be her unkempt and disheveled costar. Ethan Hawke as "Jessie" comes off like a vaguely appealing slob, sort of a Maynard G. Krebs of the nineties. Attempting to appear detached and nonchalant, he sort of drags himself through certain shots. His pants fit poorly, his tee shirt is coming untucked, his wavy dark hair (his most attractive feature) needs a good washing, and someone really should have showed him how to properly trim his youthful goatee. Nevertheless, he is supposed to represent an unwashed youth on a two-week train ride around Europe, so the look he has cultivated is probably pretty genuine. His oft-cynical observations and wry sense of humor seem to impress the unapologetically romantic Celine, although she is occasionally disturbed by the extent of his alienation. When he finally admits to her that he is utterly sick of himself and likes being near her because he feels like a different person in her presence, we know he is getting somewhere. After blowing their collective funds on a series of cafes, bars, and silly diversions, they agree that because they may never see one another again, they should make the most of it. Jesse bums a bottle of red wine off a sentimental bartender so that he and his newfound lady love may repair to a local park in the middle of the night to lie on the grass, looking up at the moon and the stars and watching the sun come up. Given his boundless luck in the romance department, it is especially irksome when Jessie, as the very definition of a naive jerk, foolishly allows this wonderful young lady to slip from his grasp. He contents himself with a half-baked plan, quickly devised at the railroad station when he bids her adieu, to reunite at the same spot in half a year. When the appointed time comes, you just know this beautiful and unusual girl will be involved with another, perhaps even married and pregnant. For whatever reason, she probably won't show, while Jesse, who ends up working at Target or (if he's lucky) the local library, will go back to Vienna, desperate to see her again, only to wind up alone.Despite what for me was a very discouraging conclusion, "Before Sunrise" is a beautiful movie. I highly recommend both it and the sequel, "Before Sunset."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched this movie about 4 days ago. I am already forgetting a lot of what happens in the movie. In four weeks I will probably forget huge parts of the movie and in four months my only memory will be of Ethan Hawke's terrible performance. We are introduced to Ethan sporting some bad facial hair. So he meets this attractive girl and starts talking to her. He somehow manages to convince her to get off with him in Vienna. This came as a huge surprise for me due to the fact he plays a character that has the social skills of an ape! He tells her of his idea of watching a person for 24 hours on some cable TV programme. I think at this point Ethan is more of a Hannibal Lecter than Humphrey Bogart. So my theory of him being crazy was a little off but later on through the movie my theory of him being an annoying human being was spot on. So the film is trying to be artsy and romantic but it misses by a long way. We go through the motions of a couple who go on a 1st date and who have a great time. Constantly waiting for something exciting to happen but alas poor Ethan doesn't even get laid in the end. They don't exchange numbers and finally agree to meet in 6 months at the train station. So we are left wondering but not caring what would happen. So if there was genuine fans of this movie to would have to wait just 9 years to see the sequel. I'm on the edge of my seat!!!! Anyways they should have got each others emails and g chatted I hear its great fun!!! ;-)</fullReview>

I mean the pseudo intelligent American boy just could not shut his mouth all over the movie together with a french girl speaking English who could not shut it up either. The conversation after while was getting so boring that only good thing was the sightseeing of Vienna. They both tried so hard to be deep that it was actually shallow and unreal.

		<fullReview>'Before Sunrise' is an example of cinema at its purest, simplest and most sincere form. How can I start describing it? Shall I start with the dazzling locations? The beautiful score? The stupendous screenplay? The breathtaking dialogues? The vivacious cinematography? The terrific direction? The excellent performances? Linklater is clearly a very versatile director. The way he's put everything in this film together is outstanding. Even though I'm familiar with Europe, the way he portrays the locations makes me want to visit those places. Throughout the film we see Jesse and Celine walk through the streets of Vienna and Linklater wonderfully returns to the same places in the end and even though both the characters have left for their respective current destinations the one feels their essence as if walking down memory lane.The development of the bond between Celine and Jesse is shown in a very subtle form. We can easily see how they are falling in love by noticing the way they look at each other, the way they talk to each other and the way they touch each other. The dialogues are sheer magic. The exceptional combination of humour, philosophy, spontaneity and subtlety brings a uniqueness about its treatment and yet it feels fascinatingly familiar. A charismatic Ethan Hawke and luminous Julie Delpy deliver natural performances. There is a sizzling chemistry and it is very easy to lose sight of the fact that they were acting. I feel both these two extraordinary actors are criminally underrated.The soundtrack marvelously stays in tune with the film. The cinematography guides us through the city as we walk along with Celine and Jesse, participating as silent observers without them being aware.'Before Sunrise' is sublime poetry. It is a must have for my DVD collection and the soundtrack for my CD collection. I will surely be revisiting it many more times as I know there will be something new to discover during each viewing.</fullReview>

This is perhaps the films greatest strength, its ability to keep you draw into what is just the regular conversation of two people.

		<shortDescription>Gag them with a spoon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most difficult scenes in acting is when a fictitious character is to naturally recount an old memory. Often in dramatics, an actor tells of some old memory with just a hint of averted eyes and awkward facial expressions. It is difficult to act out the natural timing of facial expressions as a person taps their own memory. In real life, we all do this with ease with our true memories. But actors in a movie are dealing with make-believe, so there is nothing in their brains to be retrieved and it is very easy to see through the acting.From beginning to end, BEFORE SUNRISE is a movie with two main characters who do almost nothing but recount to each other happenings from their individual pasts. Unfortunately, the actors are not up to this difficult task.Apparently, most of these many strolls down memory lane are meant to end with some clever insight on humanity. About one in one hundred succeeds.There is no catchy music, no passion, and very little to maintain interest. The viewer's mind begins to ponder side items, such as the facial structure of the actors chosen for this movie. The lead actor and actress have the same nose and chin and eyes. They could be brother and sister. And the palm reader looked to be the mother of the lead actress.Last, the script has some unmissable glitches. The audience that was around me murmured much disapproval during the bar scene when the bar owner and the lead actor shake hands in a deal in which the bar owner would give the lead actor the mailing address to the bar so that the lead actor can later mail payment for wine given out. Just when we expect the address to be given, the lead actor walks away and he and the bar tender act as if the deal never happened.The characters learn about each other in an impractical backwards manner in terms of the since of mating. No digits are exchanged. No addresses or details, ever. Perhaps there is never enough time in BEFORE SUNRISE because the script gives highest priority to retelling of old memories -- old memories that are fake. Unsatisfying. Unentertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seen this many a time just to fall in love with it. It's easily one of the best romantic movies I have ever seen. Now romance need not be just physical but conversational, and this movie drives all way through in conversation between a couple, a pair. When I saw it first time my enthusiasm was only if the boy-girl be together or part. Once I saw if for first time, each time I was more in love with the conversation they had. The story, the plot is simple its a boy meets girl and we have got to see a romance budding like a blossoming flower that is gonna be so very beautiful the next dawn. Now, had the conversation be kiddish and childish as they happen in our marriage looks (typically Indian marriage looks) where the boy and girl as each other their interests, their likes and dislikes, this could have been a bore, the conversation is so very intriguing ranging from what pisses you off to how we dream our own world to be.It's all about Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) and what a day of a lifetime it was for them so it shall be for us, I promise for us if we care to watch such movies with a ear and a heart. Now, there are so many subdued underlying themes in this that can be found if we sit and just explore even a poem on milkshake seems to be saying something about a lifestyle. This movie is more about life than about anything else. It's a must watch for all those who just love the love we want to have or we are already having in our own lives. Just have time for this and get your ears for words seem like music all through.Just love it and will keep loving it. It's 5/5 for one of the best romances ever.</fullReview>

I like the thing about this movie that the very attraction of the romance depicted in this movie is the conversations, of how thoughtful they are. They don't have to be all in agreement all the time, but they can be resolved in recognition of the different perspectives if thinking. I like how Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy acted out here. They seem to connect nicely. Their performance can depict the needed amount of connection considering the sheer coincidence and serendipity involved in the togetherness.</fullReview>

Before Sunrise is such a masterpiece, very simple yet so sophisticated and one of the best romantic movies ever made - romcoms, scifiroms, noirroms and all those movies with romance as a subplot are categorized as pure romantic genre nowadays.What would you do with your girlfriend if you are given a day off! what would you talk about, where would you go to spend time! yea, its difficult, the world is no small compound to take her for a walk or tell her about stuff you want to, in a day. Well, the movie is all about two strangers finding something between them so soulful that they can spend only a day before they have to part ways.The movie voww, it is all like magic, the conversation, the walk and the night spent and the final departure which was so painful. Am not that fond of Ethan Hawke, but then its magic that works out when hes there with Julie Delpy. The final scene leaves a lump in your throat, so poignant when those places they visited are shown vacant in the end. The background score would only thicken your sore throat.A soulful Drama with nothing but pure romance, indeed one of the the best romantic movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie while browsing through channels and was lucky enough to catch the opening credits. This movie is not popcorn film nor is it funny or complex. Yet I have never seen a movie more Honest, truthful and real in my entire life. It may not be the best movie I ever seen but its up there with the best romance movies. I am not going into any major detail here but frankly there not much MAJOR detail to discuss actually. The entire movie is about a man who meets a woman on train and after decide to spend the entire day since they enjoy just other company.Don't be let down; this is one of the finest movies ever written from the characters to the confrontations everything acted perfectly and genuinely. Directed well with a beautiful ending. This movie may not be everyone's favorite but I recommend watching this you're your girlfriend/wife or Absolutely alone without interruptions. This Film will move you and teach you that life is meant for living and not writing movie reviews on the internet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Movie Not Married</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the memory of this is better than the movie itself.I recently saw the sequel. It was one of the most delicate and perfect things I know so far as that shell of romance which is outside of intimacy. That was because ? I think ? of the actors and and the lines they contributed. It makes the timing natural. It doesn't take geniuses for this because the two characters are acting and playing natural acting is easier than playing natural life.But a huge part of what made that work was the memory of this. So I went back and watched it. Its nice, I suppose, but far, far worse than "Before Sunset." It seems just like all the other Linklater movies: thin, effete, words with no edge. Corners with no walls.Delpy is radiant, of course, having just been through the school of Kieslowski. I think you'll just have to sit through this, probing it, looking for something that sticks and not finding it. You'll have to do this so that you can remember it sweetly. The memory matters, at least it did for me. I guess I was remembering the movie I wish it were, about the perfection never achieved.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Along with one other film, this film and its sequel have moved me more than any others. Many great comments have been posted here. I would add that repeated viewings of the film reveal to me that it's only Jesse who's ambivalent about turning the night into something lasting. He's from a divorce background and seems to want to keep an image of himself as a footloose kid. You can see it in the way he walks away jauntily and youthfully from the train station after they part. It's not so much a "guy thing" as personal psychology. Celine is from a happy home and has no ambivalence--she wants them to be together and stay together. It's almost too painful that they lose each other for nine years, and that Jesse comes back six months later but doesn't find her there. The film superbly uses imagery and music to evoke the deeply sacred nature of the love that they find. Yes it is "romantic," but also realistic--sometimes people do meet who are wonderful matches for each other. In their youth and relative innocence and inexperience, they're swept into something mighty and profound. The film's exceptional blend of rapture and pain comes from the suspense of not knowing if they (Jesse) will be smart enough to make sure they hold onto this connection. Of course, this is what makes the ending of Sunset such an overpowering relief--at the very least they'll remain in touch and know where each other is. I think we're dealing here with rare works of art because of the balance and blending between the finest of detail on the surface and the deepest of profundity and poignancy in the background. After the predawn love in the park, we see the mundane, sun-drenched city, hear the harpsichord and the church bells, see them sitting at the base of the statue with her resting her head in his lap--all superb, beautiful, and exceptionally moving.It's a great moment when they're having "the conversation" about whether they'll stay in each other's lives, and they seem to reach a sad conclusion, and then the Strauss waltz starts playing in the background. This is "risky" and would be sentimental in a less-great movie. In this movie it works wonderfully. It's also wonderful that so soon after they meet, they start talking about death and visit a cemetery. This is because they both sense, intuitively, that they've met a person who deeply resonates for them, someone with whom they can talk about anything--they comprehend all of life and even death for each other. Watch the film more and you start to see how metaphysical it is. They sit in the church, they hear the church bells in the morning, they talk of the afterlife, birth, reincarnation, and all the metaphysical questions. They are "everything" to each other. In other words, simply and prosaically, they're people who could be life-partners and be happy with each other, with all that entails. Such things happen, after all. They almost lose all of it, but by the end of Sunset have regained at least part of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most realistic looking romance movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER WARNING:the following review might contain information that readers could interpret to be a spoiler, although the ending is not revealed of course.This is unquestionably the greatest love-story ever made, a movie without action, entirely dedicated to the development of a love between 2 students from USA and France during their 13 hours in Vienna, walking and talking. According to another Internet film-review site this is the best "remake" of the classic movie "Roman holiday" and any further attempts for remakes could not be better.The only things that interrupt their talks are very short meetings with people in the streets, but luckily these are very short, as they do not contribute much interesting to the film.I liked the parts where people speak German to eachother, not those that speak English to our couple. It doesn't seem realistic, compared to the rest of the film. The greatest merit of this film is that they talk like in reality.We start to believe we are with them as friends.Also the photography and editing (long shots) contribute to this feeling. A lot, if not all other romance-movies are made accordingto the same predictable story-line: people meet, get attracted, but always there's some dramatical event upsetting their relationship before everything ends well. Fine examples of other films filmed in Europe are "French kiss", "Only you" (1994) and "Romance on the Orient Express". But "Before Sunrise" positively differs from these in that the story-line is far more realistic and it doesn't look like a promotionfilm for these countries like these others. Actually we get to see little of the largest tourist attractions of Vienna. This film entirely depends on the chemistry between the 2 actors and they play their most realistic roles. Ethan Hawke's role compares with "Great expectations" in which he also falls in love with a woman who seems to be beyond his reach (played by Gwyneth Paltrow there).Celine seems to be the more mature and intellectual person of the two. The story is highly gentle, passionate but without music so it's not as immediately evident that something great is happening here between these two.The topics of their talks match with the locations. The film looks realistic but when watched closer one would notice several facts that show that this is still a story that could not have taken place this way in reality. The director (who is the co-writer) makes them travel all over Vienna in a way a normal couple could or would never do and there are some factual errors.Just to mention a few (you can easily spot more): when they arrive at the station the clock shows it's 8.30, yet they meet 2 men who tell them the museums are closing.Celine says in the train that she is terrified of flying yet she has studied in Los Angeles. The church where they go is not open in the evening, but THEY get in. They travel a total of some 35 miles if you calculate the distances between each of the locations and they travel twice a few miles south after a visit to the centre. Also strange is that they only once talk about something they see during their walks, as if Linklater didn't know where he would film this story when he wrote it or he wanted us only to concentrate on the story. Remarkable is their tendency to compromise and reach an agreement on a subject. There's no big conflict, just the mutual acceptance of eachother and their vulnerabilities. This also doesn't seem terribly realistic to me when you see how different their background and characters actually are and given the fact that they only have 13 hours (so why would 2 people try so much to do what it normally takes to develop a relationship?).But what IS believable is that they at first hide certain things and then change their stories when they see they can let go all fear For me the best parts are at the pinballmachine,as you can see this was partly improvised (you can't write a script in which you know how the balls will roll) and the narrow alley where Celine says my favourite line "If there's any kind of magic in this world it must be in the attempt of understanding someone sharing something". This also explains the above-mentioned willingness to compromise. The end is not very believable and in contradiction with the maturity they have in the whole film. I don't think many people would do what they do at the end. This film tries hard to be realistic and unrealistic at the same time. Nevertheless it is a film I keep watching over and over again as there are no others with such depth in the talks and such sympathetic characters. My only objection against the characters is the profanity Celine has in her talking (but just 3 times).Quite strange,you'd expect that more of this American man, but he is more thoughtful in his use of words.This rates 10/10 for me because of how addicted I get to watch this film again and again and my longing to see the places where they walked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very simple story, a dialogue between two complete strangers is the central theme of this story. The characters are very intelligently portrayed, and the topics of their discussion are so common, that you can sense the reality aspect of it very strongly.Never in the movie you get the feeling of it being a movie, it simply flows. The last effect of showing a contrast between the previous evenings places and how they are now empty is exceptional.This movie was an accidental watch for me on HBO. I highly recommend it to anyone who can listen patiently, and is bored by the constant action-and-high drama english movies.A must watch in my humble opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I don't think I could ever get tired of it or not be moved by some part of it. The story is so simple, but I've never seen or heard of another movie like it -- a document of two people meeting on a train in Europe, deciding to spend the day with each other and falling in love. There's a line in the movie which goes:I believe if there's any kind of God, it wouldn't be in any of us. Not you, or me... but just this little space in between. If there's any kind of magic in this world, it must be in the attempt of understanding someone, sharing something. I know, its almost impossible to succeed, but... who cares, really? The answer must be in the attempt.The movie is filled with intelligent lines like this between two intelligent, likable, complicated, confused people, just contemplating life and each other, which just hit me with their truth and beauty. It sounds cornball, I know. Ultimately, Before Sunrise may be nothing if not a test of how sappily romantic you are. But I think objectively it succeeds because it walks the line so artfully between realism and romanticism, and I think you have to be a little bit of both to like it: knowing how unlikely it is for a stranger on a train to change your life, but allowing for the possibility, and rooting for people who take it when it comes.There's a voyeuristic element to the film, like My Dinner With Andres, or a documentary, where you're just listening to people talking, and it wouldn't be anything worth mentioning if it weren't so beautifully written, and completely believable. I normally don't like Ethan Hawke, but he's very good in this. And if you're a red-blooded male, you have no choice but to fall in love with Julie Delpy. A must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a wonderful film; warm, sincere and beautifully made with moments and images that stay with you long after the perfect ending.It was recommended to me by an old university mate who labelled it his favourite film ever and who insisted that I watched it too as it would 'make me cry, change my life and make me happy.' I was instantly intrigued and he was absolutely right! I've since watched it, bought it and included Vienna in a month's inter-railing around Europe. I could go on and on about so many of the scenes and how perfectly Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy capture the wonder and excitement which comes with the unexpected meeting of someone who touches you and steals your heart. Someone with whom the simple act of getting to know them becomes something magical and with whom a day spent chatting and sight-seeing can become other-worldly and never to be forgotten. Timeless and universal insecurities, emotions and moments are naturally and effortlessly portrayed by the leads between whom there is a tangible chemistry which is a joy to watch. I could watch this film over and over again. There is always something to savour as you immerse yourself totally in this captivating love story. Thank you Richard Linklater for this different and romantic film - and thank you to my friend for the recommendation xxx</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this film. I love it to pieces. I saw it on a movie theater some 4 years ago, and I have never quite forgotten it. Whenever I see an elderly couple, I am reminded of one of the first lines of the film: "When people grow up, men lose hearing on the high tones, and women lose hearing in the low end. That's why it's so difficult to get along". Simplistic? Maybe. Beautiful? Beyond any shadow of a doubt.The idea of a night in Vienna with someone you just met, falling in love and waking up to a very different reality is so full of hope and sadness. The characters know that everything will be over at sunrise, and yet they risk having a heartbreak, rather focusing on having the best night of their lives. This valiant approach makes the movie so much harder to take at the ending, when reality strikes and tears flow from my eyes.Movies should always be THIS good.</fullReview>

I must admit many of Hawke's roles are pretty bad, while here he is pretty believable as a character, the rest of the film lacks in interest, creativity, and emotional attachment for him and Delpy. From the first 15 minutes of the film I can't wait for it to be over as their dialog is 'extremely' drawn out and monotonous; trust me, you 'will' lose interest in this film, unless you are the type who enjoys people complain and give you 'their' theories on life for 2 hours straight.

		<shortDescription>A romantic masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Sunrise is for sure one of the most important romances in the history of film. The Richard Linklater movie not only surpasses the expectation of its cheesy poster, the cliché tag line or the absurd simplicity of its premise ("A young man and woman meet on a train in Europe, and wind up spending one evening together in Vienna", on IMDb), but actually does something remarkable: makes the audience believe in those people. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy star, and their performances make Jesse and Celine two of the most fleshed-out, three dimensional characters I've ever seen on film. Nowadays, we are used to the Nicholas Sparks formula, in which characters are defined only by one or two particular traits in their personality, and the way they act and speak and show their feelings is clearly dictated by the story. In Before Sunrise, the characters are the story and for that, they dictate the shortcomings of it, which makes for a much more pleasant watching experience, and one that feels a lot more genuine. Even the most "movie moments", like when the couple first meet on the train and Jesse asks Celine if she wants to join him on a tour across the Austrian city, are handled with a superb sincerity and spontaneity thanks to Linklater's minimal character-driven direction, Hawke' and Delpy's excellent performances and their chemistry with one another, which honestly made me think they were married in real life, and, of course, the magnificent screenplay by Kim Krizan and Linklater himself, that basically turns this run-of- the-mill romance into one masterpiece, taking its simple premise and turning it on its head, and just making something beautiful, something full of heart and, most of all, something unique.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Minimalistic Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am amazed by this movie. That is surprising considering the fact that there is not much that occurs in this movie apart from talking. Before Sunrise is a romantic movie in which two people meet in a train and decide to spend a day together despite the fact that they just met and are unlikely to see each other ever again. The performances from Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is real and not exaggerated like we see in a lot of movies. The entire film seems like it is taken from our lives and we can totally relate to the characters and the circumstances that they are in. The movie is filled with wonderful ideas about life and the meaning of it. Richard Linklater must be praised for making a movie like this and I would love to see movies that are similar. A good screenplay is the cornerstone of any great movie and Before Sunrise is no exception. An interesting aspect of this movie is that the entire film takes place in a 24-hour time span. This movie must be seen if you like sensible movies and a realistic story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie that unveils philosophy of life, love and much more....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my friends suggested me to see this movie. He told me, 'this is an underrated movie, but I'm sure you gonna love it'. I wasn't expecting this movie would turn out to be my all time favorite English movie. I had to rate it a 10/10 (which is a rare in my watch-list, I have given 10/10 to only two movies among almost 700 movies). I love those movies which features philosophy of life, good background music, great cinematography etc.The movie portrays a day of two strangers' conversation. It started suddenly in a train and the conversation went on and on. The conversation turned to be the philosophies of two lives. The movie highlights the beautiful nature and night life of Vienna, Austria. There are tons of beautiful, memorable scenes which I would love to mention. The morning scene after the protagonists made out, the calm tone the director used, I don't no what magic he used, I could feel the exact morning freshness. The scene when they listened to Kath bloom's 'come here' inside a listening booth, that scene was one of my all time favorite movie scenes. Apart from that, there was train conversation, bus conversation, some random people's appearance and some other memorable scenes which will stay in my heart forever. I refer this film as a pure cinematic beauty. Great to see this movie finally made it to the top 250 list of IMDb.(This part I will mention in all the reviews in this movie series) The most unique part of the movie is that this movie is actually a part of the best trilogy I have ever seen. Each movie of the trilogy released exactly in a 9 years gap and contains nothing but conversation between two characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinematic beauty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just felt compelled to share my thoughts on the last 15 minutes of this beautiful film, i feel that it encompasses everything that cinema should be. I'm 28 and admittedly i had never heard of these films before for whatever reason but now I'm glad as it meant that i could watch all three in a row last night. Watching the second and third just made the first one even better and going back to my original point i feel that the last 15 minutes and especially when the director shows all the places they visited together the next morning was really cinematic beauty at its peak. It made me quite emotional realising that beautiful things happen everyday in all kinds of places, and when the moment is gone, it is gone forever. Beautiful memories that only the parks, bridges, and historic monuments of our wonderful cities get to witness over the years, when we all die and the beautiful moments we had are forgotten, these places will continue to witness them in different forms. I thought it was a very moving end to an exceptionally well made piece of art, i really feel like I'm doing it a disservice to call it a film as it felt so real. Those feelings coupled with the realisation of how life is changing dramatically from year to year, from them not having any details to give to each other, no mobile, no Facebook, to the third instalment where they are talking about jesse's son keeping in touch with a girl he met on Facebook when he gets back (sorry to reference another film) it just made for a really moving piece of filmmaking. Well done Linklater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most beautiful films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolutely sublime. All I could think while watching the film was, "This is wonderful." I had extremely high expectations for the film. It not only met them but it far surpassed them at every turn. The writing is beautiful. The dialogue is so natural and realistic that it seems like we are following a day in the lives of two real people. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are fantastic as Jesse and Céline. Their performances and their phenomenal chemistry are both note perfect. I have always been a big fan of Hawke and I think that he is one of the most underrated actors of his generation but I had never seen Delpy in a film and, like everything else in the film, she blew me away.At several points during the film, Jesse and Céline discuss the fact that they are in their own world and it is as if time has stopped while they are ambling through Vienna. This is emphasised by the fact that none of the other characters in the film receive names and none of them appear for more than two or three minutes. It is as if they are shadows. Interestingly, neither Jesse nor Céline receive surnames. I adored the fact that they left it ambiguous as to whether they had sex.The film was largely based on the director and co-writer Richard Linklater's similar experience with a woman named Amy Lehrhaupt in Philadelphia in 1989. He never saw her again and only found out in 2010 that she had been killed in a motorbike accident in 1994. It also draws inspiration from "Ulysses" (most notably the fact that the film involves travelling through a city on 16 June), "My Dinner with Andre" and perhaps from the 1945 film "The Clock" starring Judy Garland and Robert Walker. I saw this film for the first time yesterday but it has already become my eleventh favourite film of all time. Just fabulous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasantly surprised! Highly recommended</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With so many previous reviews already published about this absolute *gem* of a movie from 1995, I will keep my own comments purposefully short.I must confess that I had effectively ignored this film (and also it's two sequels) for many years, having made the classic mistake of "Judging a book by it's cover". Based on the title(s) and personnel involved, I had filed Before Sunrise as a sugar-sweet "Romantic Comedy" - and with not being a fan of such genres, chose to not bother with watching it. Big mistake!Of course, over the course of the film's (short) duration, there *is* romance and also some comedic scenes and lines of dialogue. However, both are handled in such an expert, "low-key"/subtle manner by the cast, director and cinematographer that at no point did this film annoy me (when again I must concede I felt for certain that it would...).Another reason for previously giving this one a miss was Richard Linklater - a director who I have not encountered often, but I could recall struggling with the likes of "Waking Life" - and "Tape" in particular (I film that I should perhaps now revisit... but at the time felt highly irritated by - sorry, Richard...).Having now taken the plunge and watched all three of the "Before..." trilogy, I cannot recommend them highly enough! I think overall I would say the first part/"chapter" is my favourite - but all three proved to be highly entertaining - mostly as a direct result of the amazing on-screen chemistry between Delpy and Hawke (quite how those two are not a real-life couple is beyond me - so natural are the performances that they give.In fact, at times I almost felt like a voyeur (of sorts) - hanging out with the couple as they meander the streets of Paris (without them being aware)! This is again due to Linklater's superb direction and "up close" involvement you end up having in each and every scene.Sorry for the ramble.. but I suppose the two main points I would like to end on would be:1) Never EVER judge a book (or in this case *film*) by it's cover - and:2) If (like me) you have previously avoided this series of films, GIVE THEM A TRY. I will be very surprised if you dislike them.Nine Out Of Ten.-John</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's nothing to it, yet there is so much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is cinema in its most simplified and most raw form. Before Sunrise is what you get when you strip away all of the flash, all the flare, and all the cluttering visual elements of a story and instead simply turn on the camera and allow two actors to be together and tell a story completely driven by poignant dialogue. Before Sunrise stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy as Jesse and Celine, respectively. Jesse, an American traveling Europe for his own vague reasons, meets Celine, a French girl, on a train on the way to Vienna. The two immediately strike up conversation and wind up taking a spontaneous trip through Vienna together, where they slowly fall in love, despite their inevitable split the next day when they both must return to their respective home countries. It's a beautifully told tale of blossoming love, while tragedy looms in the background.Richard Linklater loves telling stories in unconventionally unique ways, and Before Sunrise is one of his earliest and most successful attempts at unique storytelling. Of course, the film's uniqueness stems from its simplicity. I feel like if you go into this movie expecting any more than talking you are doomed to hate it. But, if you go into it expecting rich dialogue and textured characters contemplating life, love, and the universe, you are bound to really enjoy this film.There really isn't a whole lot to say about this lovely little film, because all of its charm and beauty stems from its simplicity. There is so little to this movie, and yet so much to enjoy as you fall in love with these characters, subsequently just falling in love with the whole idea of love, because Hawke and Delpy make it look like such a naturally magnificent thing. You have here a film that essentially goes nowhere (it all does take place in one city in one night), yet takes you on such a journey into the psyche and the dynamics of these two fascinating characters who, along the way, meet a whole cast of other interesting and eccentric individuals who move the story along.If anything is wrong with this movie it's that you can see the slight inexperience in Linklater's writing, something he has obviously overcome because he has made a slew of other fantastic films since making what is only his third feature film. The script, albeit very well written, does walk the line between superficial and profound at times. And yet the conceited ideals our protagonists exude coincide with the youthful ignorance this film beautifully portrays in its characters.This film captures the spirit of its characters, and draws you into accepting all of the decisions which, in retrospect, might have been foolish. A girl getting off a train with a stranger she just met to visit a town she's never been to seems like a bad idea if you ask me, but Before Sunrise convinces us so genuinely that love is real and will conquer all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully done, Must watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I (tragically) had never heard about the "before" trilogy up until this week, so we watched "Before Sunrise" yesterday. Clearly, then, this review is within the spectrum of the first movie alone, free of paradigms encompassing the scope of the entire trilogy. Truly romantic, though not filled with Hollywoodian cliché. Very Engaging, despite absence of plot twist intricacies, no external characters and the focus on casual dialogues. Tragic, but far from being over-dramaticThis film does not follow a well-labeled confrontation-climax-resolution narrative arc usually present in most romantic movies in the form of falling-fighting-reconciling. The story line is very simple. Even though Vienna sets an idyllic background to the plot, I'd argue that the magic rests on the incredible acting of both actors and the genuinity of their conversations and engagement. I felt the production made sure to make both leads look as ordinary as possible. The romance is never about feet-sweeping attraction or, as mentioned in the movie, "romantic projections" that tend to be platonic and unrealistic. It is a simple getting-to-know-you that slowly and tastefully develops into romance, aided by circumstantial factors but never exaggerated, focusing more on their interactions than character development. The tragedy is deep and emotional in nature, perfectly set up, without any slow-motion-running-free-tears scenes with super dramatic soundtrack. It is just so simple and real that it immerses you in a surreal-dream-like night in Vienna that brings back the sweet thrill of meeting your loved one in slightly awkward fashion. No white-horse prince or dashing cheerleader, just that weird person you happened to fall in love with.I believe this is a movie for various tastes. I balk to say, and dread the though of labeling it as such, but this film could easily make it into a chick-flick night. The cult public would highly appreciate the alternative techniques used in the film-making. And even those who don't really dig romantic movies could find themselves lost in a reverie about meeting a special one in a train to Vienna (or taking a trip to Europe with their companion, for that matter).Thumbs up to its cleanliness. The only thing that could worry a parent is the language (that I classify as mild, not strong). Most traditional families could play this on a family night no problem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best romantic couples in film history in one of the most underrated films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know how most romantic films out there are more concerned about the destination of the central couple's romance (whether or not they get married, ditch their ex, etc.) than the actual connection that they share? In writer-director Richard Linklater's irresistible 1995 romantic drama "Before Sunrise", a highly refreshing approach is taken with the central romance between the couple that we follow. Rather than focus on the destination of the romance, the film instead focuses on the connection that blossoms between these two characters and lets them just enjoy their time together peacefully. Now some of you might think that this method of romantic storytelling is a recipe for guaranteed boredom, and in less confident hands, it might be. But the irony here is not only is this romance just as exciting as such romantic stories as "Casablanca" (1942) and "Gone with the Wind" (1939), it also even surpasses them. Before I explain further what this film does differently from 95% of the other romantic comedies and dramas combined, let's recap the basic plot behind it. A young American named Jesse (Ethan Hawke) meets a pretty French woman named Celine (Julie Delpy) on a train headed towards Vienna and strikes up a conversation with her. The two enjoy each other's company so much that Jesse invites Celine to join him in roaming around Vienna before his flight back to the U.S. the next day. In any other film, a scene consisting of a man asking a woman to tag along with him admittedly wouldn't warrant any special comments. This film, on the other hand, is one rare exception. I love it when Jesse asks Celine to think ahead 10-20 years to a marriage that may not be special and that she's got nothing to lose by going with him now and leaving whenever she wants. On an acting level and on a writing level, this scene is just one example of how real, natural, intimate, sweet and thoughtful this whole picture is. The rest of the film, as far as the plot is concerned, consists of just Jesse and Celine roaming about Vienna walking and talking and having a good time while they can. But once again, what makes "Before Sunrise" such an excellent film is that it takes a risky approach with telling its love story and executes it in a believable and genuine way. By not having any forced conflicts in its narrative such as another romantic interest, a misunderstanding, a harmful secret that one of them is keeping, or any distracting plot points of the sort, it feels non- formulaic. By allowing the two characters to talk about anything they like, whether it's about their past relationships or even their views on life, we get to know more about these two and are able to relate to them more than couples in other films. And by having a handful of shots that last more than a couple minutes, one obtains a sense of reality from it as well as an appreciation of what the actors have to accomplish with their roles. While we're talking about actors, let's further dissect the quality of the performances by Hawke and Delpy as well as the requirements of their roles. Both actors are left with the challenging task of carrying the whole picture without any major side characters or side story lines to reduce their heavy-lifting. These actors must also add enough charm and likability to their characters so that we'll be engaged in any conversations and experiences that they have no matter what. These two tasks alone are simple to describe, but significantly strenuous to execute. Very few actors have the capability to pull off such tasks due to the fact that screen romances have rarely been filmed this way. However, Hawke and Delpy prove that they're up for the challenge and most importantly they succeed. What's perhaps even more miraculous is that Hawke and Delpy bring to life one of the very best screen couples in motion picture history, one of the top five easily. Everything you could possibly want to be able to love a couple together is present here with Jesse and Celine. Celine is playful, easygoing, adventurous and kind. Jesse is cool, confident, charming and classy. Together, they have genuine chemistry, a legitimate sense of humor, and in general are a great pleasure to watch. In addition to feeling like real people, you can tell that they are having the time of their life with each other. And I think that's the key to any great romance, sharing a strong passion for one another. It's the kind of passion that will even warm the heart of those who have already planned to be permanently single. I really wanted to see "Before Sunrise" for a long time ever since Siskel and Ebert gave a highly enthusiastic review for it and described it in a way that I knew it was going to be up my alley. It's my absolute pleasure to inform you that my high expectations for this film were miraculously met. The location where this film was set compliments the love story very well. I'm surprised that Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy aren't a couple in real-life since they make a fantastic couple here. The acting, the writing, and the directing are all exceptionally well done. This heavily underrated gem generated two equally well-received sequels titled "Before Sunset" (2004) and "Before Midnight" (2013). And all I can say is that my expectations for these follow-ups will be just as high as for this timeless treasure.</fullReview>

I have been trying to write this review for a while, but am lost for words to describe it.All I will say, is that is is one of those extremely rare films in life that triggers something inside each one of us with its honesty.It is beautiful and real, and captures the essence of the connection between two human beings, whatever we can call love. This is real love , pure love, in real. No rose-coloured lense, no airbrush, just beautiful reality.Throw away all the Hollywood cheese! THIS is real romance!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enthralling romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I discovered this film soon after its video release on a movie channel one early morning in my mid-teens. More of an action or comedy or action comedy type movie fan at that time, Before Sunrise planted the seeds of my incurable romanticism. My every viewing reaffirms a naturalistic charm that has not and will not wane. I do not go for naturalism invariably. For instance, John Cassavetes' A Woman Under the Influence. No thank you. Not my scene. But my what refreshing naturalism in this trilogy, even when to the point of awkwardness. A very big thanks to Richard Linklater for fleshing out this absolute gem of a film. Very wise of him too to co-write it with a woman, Kim Krizan. Though uncredited, it is worth noting that Delpy and Hawke each had a hand in rewriting this film with Linklater.Knowing from my own experience how easy it is to meet people on trains, I marvel at the thought of how many real life variations there have been and will be of this story. By a most auspicious concatenation of circumstances, Ethan Hawke's Jesse and Julie Delpy's Celine find themselves sitting across from one another on a train from Budapest. They get to talking and detrain in Vienna after some clever convincing from gumptious Jesse. He is to fly back to the US in the morning, while she can spare the time before continuing on home to Paris.They roam about the city together feeling as if in a mutual "dream world" removed from the ordinary flow of life, all the while engaged in a stream of consciousness dialogue that could lead one to construe them both as self-indulgent; however, that would be a fruitless interpretation. Voluble they may be, but they are sincerely striving for enlightenment individually and mutually. We are social creatures, and though they need not necessarily be romantic relationships, we only really know ourselves in relation to others. Before Sunrise is all about the exhilaration of really meeting and connecting with someone, an experience certainly heightened here by the sexual element. The listening booth scene strikes a deep chord with me in this regard: innocently stealing glances while playing Kath Bloom's "Come Here" (an excellent song choice), it is their first instance of sexual tension, and moreover, the body language is to be appreciated, as it will be throughout the trilogy.As for the other characters, the part-time actors (played by Karl Bruckschwaiger and Tex Rubinowitz) amuse as they describe their play translated as "Bring Me the Horns of Wilmington's Cow." Fortunately given a miss. I like the inclusion of the palm reader (played by Erni Mangold) who imparts her own intrapersonal/interpersonal advice. I especially like the street poet (played by Dominik Castell) whose poem ("Delusion Angel" written by David Jewell) likewise concerns a world out of one's control and the value of a real connection with someone. Both interactions present a sardonic Jesse complemented by a more trustful Celine.In the poignant final montage we look at now familiar locations minus the protagonists, and I for one get the sense of a strikingly indifferent universe. We have seen the "see you in six months" thing in Love Affair of 1939 and its 1957 remake An Affair to Remember (good films to my mind), but this trilogy makes a World Series winning grand slam home run of it. Too inexperienced to really grasp the rarity of their connection, they opt not to exchange contact information so as to avoid a fizzling out of the relationship. It begs for a sequel if ever a film did.For all the convoluted brilliance of Before Sunset and Before Midnight, those films ultimately capture the spirit of this one. Celine summed up the essence of Before Sunrise and the trilogy with these lines bettered by nothing in cinema: "You know, I believe if there's any kind of God, it wouldn't be in any of us, not you or me, but just this little space in between. If there's any kind of magic in this world, it must be in the attempt of understanding someone sharing something. I know, it's almost impossible to succeed but who cares really? The answer must be in the attempt."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jesse and Ceiline are brought together on a train when an old married couple have a very public fight in that way that only old married couples can manage. Two things become clear very quickly to the young couple - they have chemistry, and the time they can spend together is extremely limited. They set about making the most of mystical. magical, slightly unreal experience. They meander through Vienna, occasionally encountering some minor colourful characters, who despite being finely drawn, are always just a sideshow to the intense, fragile, painfully exposed musings of the young couple.Hawke and Delpy do a superb job of making an implausible situation seem all too natural and engrossing. Their dialogue could all too easily be self-absorbed and twee (My Blueberry Nights?), but here it is apt and at times incisive. "I fee like I am taking notes, waiting for my real life to begin," says Jese. Much of the success of the film is down to how the observations of the two characters resonate so closely with our own existential concerns.I made the mistake of watching Before Sunset before watching this. I wish I had encountered them chronologically. Both films are recommended, but only for those who like a slower pace, wry observation, and sheer, unadulterated romance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A charming and very engaging romance...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yesterday, I watched one of the best romance films I have ever seen (if not the best) Before Sunset, and as odd as I am I watched it before the original. Before Sunrise is a very charming and engaging romance, and along with Sunset fits in with the best and most engaging romance films I have ever seen.Maybe seeing Sunset first wasn't a good choice because he timeline is screwed. I know what's going to happen after this one, and I take in their events very differently. But it is still a very engaging work. Unlike Sunset, Sunrise takes the more known approach to romances. It's incredible how much the same sort of characteristics shine through here as in Sunset. If I had to choose I would choose Sunset because I did find he dialogue in that one better and execution of it more refreshing. It's definitely hard for me to separate them now, because together they make for a pair of a story that I will probably never forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple romance executed perfectly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nothing happens in "Before Sunrise." Two strangers, an American and a French woman, meet on a train and spend an evening together in Vienna -- end of story. Few combinations of script, director and talent could pull this off as a good movie, but Richard Linklater and stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy find a way. Filmmaking has never been this simplistic or difficult. You couldn't devise a film with a more generic premise, which is to say that you couldn't make it any harder on yourself as a filmmaker to make something from seemingly nothing. The characters have to not just be likable, but lovable, the romance has to suck us in and the dialogue has to shoulder the entire workload. Yet that's exactly what "Before Sunrise" does. The ceiling for the film is pretty low, but it presses right up against it.Maybe the best part about the characters of Jesse and Celine is that they're pretty normal- looking. They're both attractive, but subtly so, which is where Linklater's film and typical Hollywood fare differ. There's a layer of implicit sincerity there that we don't get from most love stories where beautiful people do things we could only fantasize about it on our best days. Jesse and Celine's connection is built on a natural chemistry and everything might conveniently "work," but it feels real and natural.Hawke and Delpy sell us hard on being normal people. The discussions they're provided in Linklater and Kim Krizan's script helps this along nicely, but the moments they share, whether nervous and tentative, tender or humorous are felt on all levels. What's written is never good enough in a romance, but how the actors convince us of the truth to their words with body language and communicating a multitude of signals both to each other and to the camera. Their romance feels like the romance we not only want to have, but unlike Hollywood, we also feel like we can attain. That's what sets "Sunrise" apart.Hard to imagine how this film came from the same mind as the man behind "Slackers" and "Dazed and Confused." All good films, but the focus on two characters here makes the difference. The real strength of the script here lies in the creation of complex character backstory without the use of expository writing or flashbacks. By the end of the film, you know exactly the kind of people the two of them are, even though you've only seen it through their interactions with each other. "Before Sunrise" should definitely be considered the benchmark for romance films. Literally no events occur in this film yet it stays interesting through lively and sincere conversation from two actors that have a knack for realism. Hundreds of films have and will be done better in the romance genre, but the structural bones of "Before Sunrise" are the most immaculate around. Even if a film doesn't put you on edge or do something special, you have to be able to recognize great intangibles and there's no arguing with those of "Sunrise."~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most realistic romantic film I've watched</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Before Sunrise" is the most realistic romantic film I've watched, and it's thought-provoking beyond the pseudo-intellectual dialog. This is not a typical Hollywood romance. The characters do not live happily ever-after and they are surprisingly mature for their age (early 20s) about the nature of couple relationships and love.Have you ever wondered why at the end of most romantic comedies the screen fades to black? Because after that, there story ceases to be interesting. And the life of the couple starts on the slow path toward routine and comfort and apathy. One notable exception from that pattern is The Graduate: after the protagonists are reunited and elope on a bus, before the fade to black, the expression on their faces reads "Now what?"Indeed, "Before Sunrise" is one of the very few films who looks at long-term relationships though a realistic, even if cold, lens. "I kind of see this all love as this, escape for two people who don't know how to be alone." You might not like this if you're still in the infancy of your emotional development. "Jesse: Why do you think everybody thinks relationships are supposed to last forever anyway? Celine: Yeah, why. It's stupid." You'll like it and identify with it if you've been through things (or if you've read about them - see Laura Kipnis' book Against Love).Yet the characters are not jaded, so the romantic in your will rejoice as much as the cynic: "Listen, if somebody gave me the choice right now, of to never see you again or to marry you, I would marry you."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before Sunrise is a simple movie with a simple story about a young couple from USA and France who meet and fall in love with each other in Vienna, but just for one night, because the next day they separate and go their own way. I'm not a big fan of romantic movies but I was really satisfied with this movie, it's so simple, realistic, cute and sad at the same time. The chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is really convincing, the dialogs are intelligent and talking mostly about different views about the world, reality and, of course, the mysteries of love. Before Sunrise is one of those movies which will brought together even the viewers who are not big fans of movie romances. The only thing that bothered me was that the kiss between two main characters came too soon and their goodbye at the end of the movie could be much more sad. But overall Before Sunrise is really cute romance for everyone, who believe in the unwritten rules of love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest love story on screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this is the greatest love story on screen. Why? Well... because it's real? What I'm trying to say is that this is not one of those fantasy love stories with overreactions and incredible scenes like in the spectacular "Titanic". It's just a bit of realistic romance.The acting was so great that even a guy like me has been so profoundly touched by this movie that I almost cried at the end (I'm not joking!!!). Fabulous performance! It's the type of movie that makes you identify yourself with the same gender character towards the opposite gender character. Celine was so lovable that I must admit I had a crush on her the first time I saw the movie. I felt like being Jesse and holding her in my arms.The most romantic moment is when they "photograph" each other in the morning they have to say goodbye. It's pure love without sexuality (even if they talk a lot about it) because their feelings are not sexual at all.It's so foolish they don't exchange phone numbers and addresses and make such an unpractical deal to meet again at the station after 6 months. It's so stupid they don't acknowledge what they lose if they say goodbye. It's so sad they don't get together forever...Definitely 10 out of 10 for the story, for the directing and of course for the perfect acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a breath of fresh air. Watching this film makes me wonder why i put myself through watching so many empty, soulless blockbusters. Watching Before Sunrise is a great experience. You feel for the characters, you understand their awkwardness,their joy and their discovery. It's so familiar to so many of us, you also feel their pain and their melancholy toward the end and ultimately, its irresistibly romantic. From a story or narrative point of view, there is nothing, this is all about the human beings in the film and it's all the better for it. Credit must go to Richard Linkater for his unfussy direction, that just allows to film to breathe,unwind and gradually stretch it's legs. I loved Before Sunrise, and i can't wait to catch up with the characters nine years later in the 2004 sequel, Before Sunset.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A short poetic love story of strangers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two wonderful actors - Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy - play young students who meet on a train in Europe and decide to get off at Vienna to spend the next 24 hours together. This is basically a road film but it develops like a one of those garden variety 24-hour real-life documentary. It could have been a cliche love story. Instead it brings out the culmination of subtlety and inspirational love story largely thanks to great plot and outstanding selection of actors. The film is depicting a process of two young people with different backgrounds gradually understanding and falling for each other: Ethan Hawke as a bit self-absorbed American student visiting a possible girlfriend in Spain only to leave broken-hearted and Julie Delpy as a French student with rather political point of view on world affair - she resents the situation in former Yugo-slavia in the early scene. The two get closer as they walk through streets of Vienna encountering kind strangers in the city.Not distracted by strong supporting actings is what makes this love story engrossing and very focused and an ultimate flirting, you'd call it if you are a cynic, becomes a poetic love story by sometimes serious discussions on life and love and the beautiful city of Vienna.I'd say this film is the best romantic road film of the 90s. If you liked this one, you'd probably love 'The Surething' which in my opinion is the best romance film of the 80s. I strongly recommend both films if you are a romantic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is regarded as the bible of love, showing us the magic of strong connection with strangers. The episode that two main characters pretended to make a telephone is quite moving.I would like to catalog this kind of relationship as soul mate. Actually everyone might cherish this kind of relationship as after over 20 years of independent life from each other, the couple is still able to understand each other and exchange other perspectives to each other without prejudice, which is quite of magic feeling. The couple talk about their religion, there views about the way people live in, their unique memory of adolescent period instead of talking about gossip. It seems like they can talk for days without interruption, and silence turns into romantic scene rather than awkward. Drop out the stress of daily life and marriage, the life of them seems to be of every possible and a real adventure to them, they just like branch and river, you carry me, i carry you.The movie really encourage me of never cease reading, traveling, willing to understand other people, and most importantly, the fate of believing in true life, the magic connection between human beings. Quote from my favorite movie Dead poets society, Robin Williams," we write and read poetry not because it's cute, because we are human beings , and human beings are full of passion". Wish everyone good luck!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story could not be more simplistic. An American Male meets a French Female on a train and asks her to spend the evening with him in Vienna. What is not simplistic is the wonderful characters, and exceptional dialogue in Linklater's film. It is obvious that Jesse (Hawke) and Celine (Delpy) have a connection after their first conversation. As their day progresses their connection to each other deepens as does our connection with them. Before Sunrise is so special because we are not manipulated into connecting with them through tragedy, or violence, or sex. We connect with them as we do with people in everyday life, through the life experiences they share with us little by little as our relationship grows. This is true intimacy and is beautifully achieved here. The intimate, personal moments that Jesse and Celine share throughout the film are sprinkled amidst a plethora of other conversations during their night together. They discuss everything from palm reading to dancing, the conversation is never boring and never unnecessary. They don't agree on everything and through that disagreement we we are invited further into their personalities as their connection grows. Jesse and Celine do interact with other characters in the course of the film. Linklater perfectly blends these interactions as well. The supporting characters add to the film without over powering the main characters. These characters are also just odd enough to further strengthen Jesse and Celine's connection as kindred spirits, without ever becoming caricatures. Before Sunrise is a beautiful film. It made me want to rush off to Europe and spend aimless evenings wandering around foreign cities looking for romance. I suppose I will have to settle for revisiting this film and these characters in the future</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They are both young and alone, and full of ideas about falling in love and growing old. Jesse has a rather pretentious idea for a 24/7 television broadcast of life as it is, but I am sure he is not just trying to be profound for the sake of getting laid (although in one instance, he cynically muses that a poet must have pre-composed that lovely verse, but changes tact almost straight away because of Celine). But he does edge closer in the tram, and fiddle with his hands and jacket, and in one little perfect moment, go to brush away a strand of her hair almost nonchalantly, but quickly pull out of it as she turns to him. At one point, he scoffs at the idea of such a chance meeting, of everyone always putting big romantic projections onto encounters, but changes his mind when he does this himself. Celine laughs at his idea, and pretends not to notice his advances, but pays closer attention to a sweet anecdote about a young boy learning about death and decides that he is interesting, and not just because of the red in his beard or his blue eyes. Most of this film is talking and talking and talking, and to some that is boring, but for the lovestruck pair it is precious time. Linklater shoots in fluid long takes that are quiet and unobtrusive, and the background of Vienna at night flies past them - this could take place in any city in the world, and their feelings would not change. He relies so heavily on the self-composed dialogue of Hawke and Delpy, and their body language which is a marvellous indication of their growing attraction. In one iconic scene in a music booth, they listen without a word, but their eyes nervously steal glances at and away from each other, and it is so perfectly reminiscent of young love, and how they both pretend not to be lingering in their gaze. In another, they tease and pry via a mock phone call, and reveal, whilst giggling, just how deeply they have fallen in love with each other (and it is so effective that every rom-com has used this device since).They bounce ideas back and forth, and these are conversations which broach great subjects - what the qualities of love are, if there is a god or not, the degree to which you should be frightened of death. The trio's script is so perfectly balanced. There are long winded stories that talk of deeply meaningful things; Jesse recalls a wedding tradition that has the bride and groom stare silently and longingly at each other, and in the aftermath, they too exchange this, though not for an hour (Celine looks away after a spell, perhaps sensing they are moving too fast). And then there are less profound moments; Jesse leans in as if to whisper something deep, and then goes for a kiss. Celine too mars a romantic moment overlooking the city by speaking quite plainly and straightforwardly about it, but instead of a tender touching of the lips they seem to swallow each other's mouths and be smother and squished together. And when they do the usual interrogations, their dialogue is so well written. It is defensive, as if they are in the midst of a perfect daydream but trying to awkwardly justify exactly why they are so easy to fall in love, why they should take a chance with each other, why they are not broken and beyond repair. The pinball machine is the perfect accessory to their passive aggressive reminiscing, and they each have a turn, and a story to tell. Of course, they have their differences, and it is not all airy- fairy. They have starkly different reactions to a palm reader, and here we see a portion of Celine that still believes in the magic that has all but disappeared in 2 decades time. And they both have differing opinions on religion, but seem to see a little magic in each other, and this encounter. This sparks a wonderful conflict at the end of the film. They have spend the entire night together, and against all odds, fallen in love. To get on that train and speak not another word would cement the night forever, to be cherished for all time. But they also cannot bear for it to be over; their almost animalistic final embrace is a testament to that. So they compromise, in the most foolish and lovestruck way imaginable; the fateful 6 months later meeting, no contact info, no room for post-phoning. And is is tragic, and then perfectly encapsulating of their brief love affair, because it becomes a hazy and beautiful moment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I mean from where i should start describing this movie. I was searching for some good cinema on IMDb to watch. I found this movie.Plot seemed interesting and i downloaded the movie.what makes this movie so beautiful so likable you cant understand until you experience it. they talk and talk and talk. they talk about every tiny special non-special things that happens in life.It is a good example of this phenomenon which happens to like everybody in their life time, if i had done this,if i had talked to that person,if i had gone there.It teaches us to do what makes you feel free. what makes you feel that you are living some life not living in some predefined guidelines.Both the leading actors are very natural.Movie's environment is super romantic. you will love it. Watch this movie for its honest writing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beautiful movie that captures such a rare but real connection between two people. It certainly puts your own relationship into context and makes you dream a little! The movie does not go over the top with romance, but there's certainly enough of it to make it special. The french accent will never cease to capture me. This movie can be watched by absolutely anyone, even the most manly of men. The only reason I awarded it 9 out of 10 and not 10 is because Ethan Hawke can, in my opinion, be a LITTLE bit cheesy at times, but it certainly didn't ruin anything! I'd give my left and right leg to swap positions with him! A must watch. Can't wait to see the sequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American tourist Jesse (Ethan Hawke) meets French student Celine (Julie Delpy) on the train. He talks her into getting off and walk around in Vienna. They walk the night away.I really love this movie when it first came out. There was no hint of the following sequels. It's just a great charming first date movie. The leads have great chemistry. They are both charming and lovely. This is a lot of first-date talk. It doesn't get tie down by artificial plot elements. There is nothing to drive the plot. There is no Holy Grail. There is no quest. There is no destination. There are just two people talking and trying to connect. It stops and starts. They meet two oddly funny Germans who invite them to their play. In a more conventional movie, they would actually go to this play. They forget to go and that's kind of the point. Their journey meanders without much direction. There are also great scenes of long continuous takes. Director Linklater just let the actors go on forever on the streetcar. The whole movie feels refreshing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simply brilliant snapshot of life at that age at that time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's rare that I give a film 10 out of 10. I am one to regularly give films harsh reviews (even supposedly good ones).This was simply captivating cinema and I'm strangely annoyed that I hadn't seen it sooner.It's not about the story. It's about the people in it. The acting is brilliantly natural and I couldn't help by look back at my times of my early 20s, where your eyes are opening to the realities of life and the world, holding onto optimism, coming to grips with the concept of love, dealing with disappointment and resentment, social awkwardness; and contemplating ones own mortality.These things form the basis of many conversations throughout the film as two travelers almost "suspend reality" while they fall in love over night, then grapple with it all ending at sunrise.It moved me deeply, but not in a depressing way. It simply stirred a lot of reflection on the past and the way we all were once upon a time. Best of all, it didn't fall into mushiness and become a sloppy Hollywood love film with a happy ending. It was deep, but totally realistic, well films, create scenic contrast and mesmerizing direction. I can't recommend this film enough and look forward to the sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The impact and idea of time and the power of human connection explored in one beautiful package</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The kind of connection the two lead characters in Before Sunrise merit is the kind of connection I've only managed to achieve a few times in my life; it's the connection with someone who is a complete stranger, but as soon as you meet him, your wall of protection and tact almost completely crumbles. You feel compelled to share personal information with this stranger, deep thoughts that no one other than you have pondered or heard, and talk until your throat is raw about everything you can think of in that given moment. Your become verbally diuretic, and after it's over, you're upset that the conversation has ended, but you've achieved a state of personal tranquility thanks to a release of all that was on your mind that you are at a sort of bliss. It's a strange thing to articulate, and those who have had that kind of connection know precisely what I'm talking about. To those who can't pinpoint that kind of connection (if you have to think hard about it, you've probably never had one), you're in for one soon.Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise, which kickstarted a trilogy that spanned the course of three separate decades and analyzed Linklater's favorite cinematic idea, time, is an ode to that kind of comfortable, life-affirming connection we all should experience. Linklater thankfully devotes an entire film to that kind of connection, making a film entirely focused on characters rather than the events, the location, or the supporting characters surrounding them. It's as if Linklater got fed up at watching interesting characters, their motivations and their potentials, in other films squandered so other, more trivial matters could be attended to. In Before Sunrise, he strips down everything to two central characters and their views on a variety of different issues, philosophical ideas, and past experiences.Those two characters are Jesse and Céline (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy), who, from the moment they meet on a train-car from Budapest heading to Vienna, they reveal personal details and personal opinions on love, romance, and just their general upbringings. When Jesse's stop at Vienna finally rolls around, he convinces Céline to hop off the train with him, to which she throws caution to the wind and obliges. The two divulge in a great deal of personal matters together; he is a romantic soul masquerading as a cynic after breaking up with his girlfriend, the whole reason he's in Vienna in the first place, and she has fallen before and is cautious about doing so again. The two, however, recognize their separate agendas and treat this night as their one and only encounter, leading them to get personal and loquacious with one-another while walking through the entire city.As stated, Linklater strips this film back a plethora of layers to simply being about these two characters. Linklater even limits pictorial distractions, as the two characters walking through the city of Vienna leaves for a great deal of possibility to stumble upon something distracting. That occurs, if I remember correctly, once in the film, and it's incorporated so well into the discussion and the flow that you're bound to miss it. It's no lie that Linklater has seriously found himself committed to making this project about this simple yet unbelievably affecting kind of connection, which, in this case, transcends personal bounds into becoming romantic, leading the characters to question how they feel and how they want to proceed.Hawke and Delpy, I feel, aren't doing much acting here; part of me feels they're conveying their own kind of presences to one another and that there's little effort required on their part to change who they are or become something they are not. The film also bears the necessary pacing element of being lax and carefree, never rushing these characters onto the next setup nor making them take detours for comedy's sake. This is Linklater driving the truck down a path that has many different routes and he chooses the most direct route, and simultaneously, the most beautiful and mystifying.Before Sunrise beautifully illustrates the power of human connection through two strong performers and a writer/director obsessed with the impact and idea of time and the realism and the aforementioned kind of connection. Here, he displays his affinity and talent for both through a film that is equal parts contemplative in a philosophical sense and also incredibly beautiful on a human scale. This is a romantic comedy for people who have grown sick and tired of falsified, picturesque romantic comedies and hunger for something genuine, real, and lasting, much like the impact of these characters' relationship with one another in the film.Starring: Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. Directed by: Richard Linklater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I pulled out this DVD the other day from our library with mixed feelings mainly cos it was a 1995 movie. Guess what? It became the most frank, blunt, yet the most romantic movie I've ever come across. The romantic spark brewing between Jesse and Celine is so natural, you might feel that it is you who are in it! It is so brutally honest!! I loved every bit of it, from the start to the very end, frozen to my couch. It is so intense and engaging. Linklater takes us continuously through a 105 minute journey with those two awesome characters without a flicker of boredom or monotony. He uses very trivial dialogues that are quite common to intelligent conversations of post-modernist societies, but installs a sweet romanticism within each scene. I am really at a loss to understand as to why he was not given the best Director award in that year. The movie commands an absolute smooth rhythm, flows effortless and renders serenity at its best. One of the best movie gems created in our time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walk, talk, romance in Europe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Sunrise is a minimalist film which features Ethan Hawke and Julia Delpy as two young characters walking and talking.The film starts off in a train whilst a German couple argue and the two couple tentatively talk, enjoy each other's company and make an emotional connection.Both characters share their perspectives on life and love. The film takes place over the course of one day and night as they see shows, view buildings and gardens, drink in cafés and bars and become romantically entangled. They reveal maybe a little too much about themselves as believe they will never see one another again. Hawke has a plane to catch before sunrise as he returns to the USA whilst Delpy is going to Paris.The film has a charm with its Continental European setting but its also easy to lose attention with all their talking. It does not quite fly for me although its a brave attempt by director and co-writer Richard Linklater to make a brave, innovative, independent romantic film.However the film is intriguing because it has spawned two sequels so far, so we do meet the couple in later stages of their lives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps I missed something. Too trite conversation and contrived chemistry. I did not for one moment believe these two we're falling in love, just acting like they were. Perhaps it was just the actors falling in love with their own performances.I rented this movie with then hopes that I'd be enthralled as so many others claimed to be, and the eventually move forward through the trilogy. Maybe I expect too much, but this seemed a shallow little movie. For perspective, I thought both Shrek and Moonstruck were wonderful love stories but thought the Titanic was hopelessly unappealing. I would be interested to know the general demographic for whom it held such broad appeal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Before Sunrise' is not a film to be scrutinised, nor studied. The absolute beauty of it lies in its perfection as a simple love story - of two lives suddenly thrown together in the midst of reality, and the ensuing night of simple love that follows. Every individual at some time in life dreams of the connection that is portrayed in this film between Jesse and Celine, and few ever find it. 'Before Sunrise' simply and elegantly demonstrates how the most fundamental passions of human emotion can envelope two complete strangers. The beauty of this film is that the story is the most important element. The ending is both provocative and emotional - scenes of the night previously seen in darkness are now portrayed in lonely daylight as the sun rises and the story closes on these two characters.I saw this film by accident one night late on television. I have never forgotten it. So well is it made that the audience never question if this could ever really happen in life, reality being so absolutely characterised in it.'Before Sunrise' is simply the story of two strangers bound in Vienna's lonely night splendour - one night of love in all its glory, one superb piece of film making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming and engaging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed and co-written by Richard Linklater, this is an unusual work with a minimal amount of plot, a minimum number of characters, and a short period of time but a good deal of dialogue and characterisation. Two strangers in their early 20s meet on a train and, on impulse, decide to spend a night walking round Vienna together. Some viewers will find this slow and inconsequential but I was charmed and engaged.The movie is made by its two young stars: Ethan Hawke as the American Jesse and Julie Delpy as the French Celine. The dialogue and the acting are both so naturalistic that we feel as if we're listening in to a real-life conversation and my favourite scene is when each character in turn pretends to be calling a friend and talks about the person they've just encountered. Jesse and Celine have never met before and will probably never meet again and yet, over the hours, they are powerfully drawn together as we are to them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen parts of this movie over the years and cant believe its age already. Finally sat down and watched it in its entirety and enjoyed it as capturing romance effectively. Julie Delpy who has a more difficult role due to her language background leads the story and the encounter really making the movie. This one of the only romances or dramas that effectively doesn't formula. Instead of there being a quarrel and make-up, the tension is built on the issue of time. In excellent quality blazing it's own path, the movie sticks with a real and believable outcome. Best conversation scene in the movie was the telephone calls and the character's divulging their attractions to one another. Good for a more originality in storyline and the director's choices to not cave to cliché. Recommended.</fullReview>

The film depicts romance in all it's glory, but without any of the pitfalls that befall most couples. In short the film is about two people that have a relationship that's as close to perfection as relationships will ever come to - with just one problem, the problem of time. For those who feel love is just a fake, a concept, this movie will make you realize that maybe somewhere, somehow and some when, something could really happen. Although, nothing ever really happens, the movie never gets boring. The ending is genuinely sad without being "Titanic" or something. Recommend this movie to everyone..!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very "nice" movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally got to see "Before Sunrise" on TV as I never succeeded in finding it at a video store. I was really intrigued as many friends, particularly female, described it as an outstanding work of art. Maybe I wasn't in the right mood or my expectations were too high but I didn't experience the movie as really exceptional. It's approach is the typical French style of never-ending philosophical comments on life in general but stripped of profound thinking and based on the concept of "badinage" which basically boils down to "just talking". Charming indeed but not unfamiliar to Europeans who at times have been saturated with "talk movies" (e.g. Bertrand Tavernier's "Un dimanche ? la campagne", Eric Rohmer's "Ma nuit chez Maud" etc.) It is often interesting indeed to hear how people reflect on the meaning of life and how they, in their quest for honesty, are often obliged to contradict their own relative insights as the game offers no certitudes: it was Nietzsche who stated that facts do not exist (this is certainly true for human interaction), only interpretations."Before Sunrise", however, although a very sweet movie does not dig very deep and the conversations therefore have that artificial flavor which is characteristic of so many French productions. Great acting, some memorable scenes and to me a very "nice" movie which I constantly watched with a feeling of "I have have seen and heard all this .. many times before" I am convinced however that the movie will undoubtedly appeal to most people who are still in their twenties or thirties.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before Sunrise is a movie so real you can taste it - and you'll want to over and over again. This is a film about two real, intelligent, attractive and sincere people who meet on a European train and agree to spend a night walking around Vienna together. What unfolds is a film so obviously important to both the actors and director, that captures the rare magic of two people falling in love.What makes this film special - aside from the beautiful shots of Vienna, and the superb acting of both Delpy and Hawke - is that it consists of a series of conversations that are interesting without being self-important. Both characters are imperfect, and have a believable mixture of realism and naivety. While the film may sound like a boring chick flick, it is anything but.Director Linklater manages to create a movie that allows viewers to feel like they are right there with Jesse and Celine, falling in love at the same time. By the time the movie ends, you won't be able to wait to rent "Before Sunset", the equally believable, moving sequel that was released nine years later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See this fantastic love story Before Sunrise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Minor Spoilers Ahead!!** I am a guy who generally shuns romantic movies, but I had always been intrigued by the simple premise of "Before Sunrise", a 1995 film about a man and a woman who fall in love literally overnight. I never got around to seeing it until recently, when I had to watch it before seeing this year's sequel, "Before Sunset" (not to be confused with the Pierce Brosnan/Salma Hayek pic "After the Sunset")."Before Sunrise" stars Ethan Hawke as Jesse, a twenty-something American wandering through Europe by train, and Julie Delpy as Celine, a twenty-something French woman returning to Paris from a relative's funeral. They meet by chance on a train and eventually decide to while the night away in Vienna together, before Jesse's flight departs in the morning. The couple wanders around the city, getting to know each other and themselves better as they go. If that sounds simple, it is. The only other characters are those whom Jesse and Celine happen to encounter along the way.With such a basic storyline, the film relies entirely on the work of Hawke and Delpy. Fortunately the two conjure up an open honesty rarely seen on screen. They never seem to be acting, and their interactions are consistently fresh, as though they had been through separate rehearsals before showing up to work together. Their dialogue is casual without being overly so, but is still cautious enough to be appropriate for the given stage of the relationship.Beyond the words, the gestures complement the relationship superbly as well. The way their eyes avoid each other at first. The multiple times Jesse reaches out to almost touch Celine before thinking the better of it. How Celine coyly seems to enjoy being the object of his affection, then later saying exactly that, how she likes his eyes on her. These physical actions reinforce the verbal communication and elevate the picture to the next level of excellence.In my mind, "Before Sunrise" portrays how falling love should be, except over a much longer period of time. There is a semi-awkward feeling-out stage, followed by sheer pleasure in the other's company, followed by the requisite bumps in the road, leading to an ultimately satisfying relationship. In less than two hours, "Before Sunrise" presents as realistic a portrayal of love and interpersonal relations as I can recall, a sort of ultra-compact "When Harry Met Sally..." filled with honest and open dialogue that is wonderfully free of melodrama. That absence will vex some, particularly those accustomed to the over-the-top romance of most American movies, but those with patience will experience a well-told story about human interaction.The film is not perfect, as certain third act decisions will send the approval of some through the roof, disappoint a few (me), and cause yet others to be wildly indifferent. This all depends on the personality of the viewer, as the final scenes will cause you to genuinely ponder what you want the characters to do, and what you would do under similar circumstances. Despite my selective antipathy, that's a sign of a good and effective film, one that causes people to take sides as they determine what should, would, and could occur."Before Sunrise" is a predecessor to recent critics' darlings like "Lost in Translation" and "Garden State", a film that uses self-exploratory conversation to advance the basic story. If you liked either of those films, you should appreciate this one, and if you liked this one, check out the sequel, which is now on DVD.Bottom Line: Eight of ten, which considering the subject matter, is high praise indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i almost didn't bother watching this film. while i like richard linklater, i certainly did not like "the newton boys", and i was sure that this was another studio produced clunker. but i gave it a shot for the heck of it. i am so glad i did. this is the most perfect movie i have ever seen. by far my favourite. it holds up even after about fifty viewings. it hits every single not exactly right. a few of my favourite scenes are the scene in the listening booth with the kath bloom song, the poet scene and his poem, and scene where they pretend to talk to their friends on the telephone. the ending is so wonderful and anti hollywood that i cannot believe they let rick get away with it. depending on your point of view, check out "waking life" to find out what happens to the couple after the movie. it could be real, or it could be a dream though, you'll never know... i wish more people knew about this flick!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is Before Sunrise my favorite film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Sunrise is my favorite film of all time. The main characters, Jesse and Celine, share their thoughts and emotions with sincerity. The film does a beautiful job of developing their characters and their relationship. The fleeting nature of life (and the resulting preciousness of transitory moments) is an underlying theme throughout the film, and it is woven in through so many creative media including conversation, poetry, music, art, and cinematography. There is also an element of magic or spirituality running beneath the surface that shines brightest in (as Celine describes) the little space between these two young people. I can't seem to get enough of this film, and it is sweet torture to wonder what happens next. If you love it too please e-mail me and we can try to figure out why we appreciate it so intensely while some people find it unremarkable.'Later'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You can feel the chemistry.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything about this movie is just wonderful. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy give two great performances and the chemistry between them seems so real. The movie is basically "walk and talk", but it doesn't get boring. Their conversations are interesting and the movie as a whole is very entertaining. Everything they say and all their actions and reactions seem so genuine. There are many great scenes, one in particular where Hawke convinces Delphy to get off the train with him, and another when the two are in a record listening booth, are just a couple. Overall the movie is very well made and I give it a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before Sunrise is with out doubt one of the best in this genre i have seen.It actually feels nice to watch such a movie filled with human emotions and it indeed raises your energy levels.At all point of the movie it was never boring not for a single moment.The director has got the best and the powerful actors Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy.With the entire movie revolving around just two characters it was very important to have the right actors in lead.Richard LInklater got that right. The director and the script writer have done a superb job. You know its not easy to move a story with two characters in it. All the conversations looks so natural.And it makes you feel like "hey i have been in that situation!".Through out the movie you will be swept off by the chemistry between them.Especially when Ethan asks Julie out in the train! wow! That was very natural.And typically his thoughts are like what every normal man will do. And it leaves everyone in a suspense in the end. All in all its more than just a movie! ART at is best form!! kudos!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not really feeling it.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think I've ever seen a romantic drama so devoid of....romance.The insipid dialogue dragged on and on and I never got the feeling that the characters felt anything more for one another than physical lust. How could ANYONE feel a mental spark with someone else based on such inane conversation? Every time Ethan Hawke opened his mouth and said something I couldn't help but think of what a douschebag his character was and marveled that any female would consider spending time with him as romantic.Truthfully, the time the two main characters spent together reminded me more of a few bad dates I've had with little chemistry rather of than two people falling in love. The only thing that was convincing was the actors' physical expressions, and I commend them for at least managing to deliver some sense of plausibility to this tale through their physical acting skills. When they weren't talking but were looking at each other or hugging each other, then I believed their was some love there. But again, that is the PHYSICAL, so I couldn't help but feel it was just hormonal lust at work. I certainly couldn't see their relationship going beyond 2 or 3 more dates.I think Linklater could've been a little more imaginative and romantic with the dialogue. I understand the need to not be sappy or clichéd, but c'mon, the thing with romance is that it NEEDS FANTASY and IMAGINATION, something the dialogue in this movie lacked. But the coolest part of the movie was the end when they revisited all the places they had hung out the night before, except this time the spots did not contain...them! Interesting look at how social relationships really add another dimension to physical spaces and locations.Strangely this movie did leave me with a strange feeling of unholiness, impurity, and debasement for any previous casual sexual encounters...Final Grade: C+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr Linklater, consider yourself redeemed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must first admit that one star is for the pleasant surprise this delight of a film produced after viewing it a month after surviving director Linklater's awful Waking Life, which was nail bitingly close to being the worst film I have ever witnessed. That said you must be warned, Before Sunrise is what I label a 'hit or miss' movie (no, not in the rhyming slang sense, tsk), in that the impact of the film will depend largely on the viewer, you will either love it or hate it. Also in the film not a lot happens, there is no real drama, conflict or action just 2 people who meet share a day together in Vienna and fall in love. It is a 'talky' film, it almost all dialogue, the dialogue will not always be easy to digest for everyone, I found the film to drag at points, but there are at least some things in here that I think everyone can relate to. What makes the film a success (to some, not all) is the way that this relationship unfolds, with sublime realism and tenderness. A very simple film on the surface it has intricacies that are open for the viewer to interpret in relation to their own lives and feelings.This story put me instantly in mind of Lost in Translation, except for the age gap, the other difference is we have no prior knowledge of the main characters when they meet. We have two young folk travelling home through Europe by train, Jesse, a typically sceptical American guy who has just split with his long distance girlfriend who he left behind in Madrid to go on a whirlwind tour of Europe and Celine, a young idealistic French student, a quiet daydreamer. After sitting opposite each other they get talking, initially about how relationships ware thin with time, which relates to the central theme of the film, and after some nervous stutters a chemistry begins to grow between them. This is pretty much how the film develops, the pair share each others views on the world around them, the after life and the little idiosyncrasies in American and European cultures as the train hurtles on. Not everyone will be able to cope with such a duologue based story, I took time adjusting but unlike Waking Life I managed to do so because the words were delivered by characters as conversation, not monologue by random folk, and it had a context which made the experience easier to relate to. Some of the discussions connected with me, others made me recoil. Some of the philosophising and conversation was elegant in a manner, such as the talk of visions of the dead other times it was grating like Jesse's awful TV idea, made me cringe. This is only to be expected when you are watching 2 characters talk for extended periods about a wide range of issues. Sure these are conversations you would rather engage in than watch but it is the context that really matters, this does not really take hold until later in the film. The characters were not the sort of people I would spend time with personally, they were sorta whiny youths who seem slightly rebellious and perhaps overly sure of the validity of their own views, however although I did not really relate to them (usually not a good thing) I began to enjoy the situation. This is the sort of situation you always hope will occur, you start a conversation with stranger and you get to know each other and find you have an instant connection. Watching these two connect just by talking, the most simple thing, was strangely captivating. I think because it is so believable a situation because the 2 actors who just play it like normal everyday folk having a chat, it made it easy to relate to.On the spur of the moment Jesse, who has to get off the train in Vienna, asks Celine to spend the day with him instead of continuing her journey. She accepts and off they go to talk some more against the backdrop of one of the world's most beautiful cities (after Edinburgh of course), the shots of Vienna really show it off accurately in all it's wonderfully intricate grandeur contrasting with that almost desolate, sleepy continental atmosphere. You start to see slight signs of conflict between the pair's views on life, Jesse dismisses the palm reader who pesters them and has a generally sceptical view on life while Celine (being European) has a very open mind about such things. These subtle differences seem to draw them closer together rather than push them apart, they gradually and visibly become more and more comfortable and relaxed with each other.The film does drag at times, especially in the section where they first get off the train, and it took it's time to work it's magic on me. As their evening wore on though I did finally begin to get absorbed, as I knew the two would soon have to part. That is the beauty of the film, in the fact that for the couple's time is very limited however this means that their relationship will not have the chance to be stretched and eroded by time. Time won't allow for them to grow tired of each others company as it is time itself that will simply dissipate, not their connection. They are able to let go before that bond grows old and fizzles out. That is what makes the film a success, you feel you have had an insight into something most people can only dream of occurring, yet one that is entirely possible if we have the will and desire to act on our instincts. As I said not a film for everyone but one that contains a rare hidden beauty for those that can connect and persevere with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before Sunset and Sunrise are Masterpieces and reviewed together here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Sunrise is one of those films you stumble across by accident, and it this unexpected confrontation with excellence that causes the audience to experience that shakabookoo moment; that Swift Spiritual Kick to the Head That Alters Your Reality Forever. Before Sunset is life, it is experience. Anyone that has ever met someone they "kind of like" and wanted to find out more about them will know what this film is about. This is missed opportunity, this is chance, this is the roll of the dice and the one that got away. In this film a guy meets a girl on a train, they talk about nonsense as is the norm, but instead of saying goodbye and obsessing about what might have been the guy takes the leap of faith and convinces the girl to spend the next 14 hours exploring Vienna with him. Already we see perfection; already this movie is a masterpiece. Is it Ethan Hawke's scruffy American backpacker Jesse that reels us in, or the sexy Celine played by Julie Delpy? I say "played by" but there is no "play" in this film, there is no performance or representation. In this film the actors achieve such a level that this is nothing other than the "real", the dialogue is of a couple exploring one another, the action is the terrified adolescent that hides in every adult, terrified of saying the wrong thing that may cause a loved one to disappear out of their life forever. The beauty of this enchanting film is how the actors communicate what is often unsaid, suggesting that they are about to say something, or make a joke, but think better of it. Vulnerable glances are exchanged; tentative gestures of affection are made. This is the truest representation of a couple meeting, and through conversation realising that they have met their soul mate, ever committed to film. It is heartbreaking to watch the impetuousness of youth dictate that the exchanging of phone numbers is a waste of time, for in youth we wrongly feel that their will be many that we connect with on such a spiritual level. The final moments of the film leave the audience perplexed, with an overwhelming desire to KNOW what happens next. It is a stroke of luck to come across this film after the sequel has been released, for to wait the nine years for Before Sunset to be released would be an exquisite form of torture. In the sequel we see the couple bump onto each other once more, and quite rightly we soon see that both carry scars from their original encounter. The memories of that one perfect night have been encased in crystal and romanticised, so that no future encounter would ever live up to that experience. There is but one option for these playthings of Cupid, they have to explore a complete relationship with one another. As each scene unfolds we look to our watch, counting down the time in which these obvious soul mates have to discover they are made for one another. Early on we feel safe, they are re-acquainting themselves with what once was, playing poker for lovers, in which cards are held close to their chest. But this cannot be maintained, and it is in Jesses company limo that we are truly dragged back into the narrative, fully committed to their relationship when Celine breaks down, screaming about the repercussions that evening had for her; when you have experienced that true connection with another person, everything else is dull in comparison. Again we check our watch, what will happen? Can we endure another departure as in Before Sunrise? The characters are now more mature and world weary; life is taking its toll. Now in their thirties they have an appreciation for each other that was lost in Venice. They have seen more of the world and realised no comparison can be made to that one night they shared together. Priorities are quickly re-arranged. What is life for? What is important? The sequel is snatched moments, fighting against a clock that continuously haunts them. Sometimes we scream for them to be truly honest with each other, to throw off their responsibilities and engulf themselves in their love, other times we fear that their lives will pull them apart, locked into an existence of wondering what could have been. The ending of Before Sunset is perfection, and should be held up as a pinnacle of film making. A scene that is so unexpected and yet so correct, that if your reaction is a cheer, a tear or a jeer, you will know in your heart that it was right, and sit looking at the screen analysing and exploring all of the "what ifs?" that the characters will now face. The true charm of the film is not what the characters are experiencing, but the level to which every viewer will project their own life onto the screen, contemplating whether they are with the right partner, or whether at some point in the past they should have spoke up, or allowed time for that special someone. The universal response on viewing this film will be a deep down, soul aching desire to watch yet another sequel in another nine years time. Any film that can haunt its audience in this way is deserving of its title of Masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honest and touching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Before Sunrise" is the story of two strangers - an American tourist (Ethan Hawke) and a French university student (Julie Delpy) who meet on a train to Vienna. Their fleeting time together evolves into romantic interest and they get off the train and spend a night together touring Vienna.The plot, however, says little about the essence of this gem of a movie. Because what we have here is one of the most true, honest looks at what happens when two strangers meet and connect - really connect - that has ever been captured on film.All too often, we talk to people we encounter without truly listening. We anticipate what they're going to say before they even say it, and we talk about superficialities just to fill the silence. What Hawke and Delpy manage to do in "Before Sunrise" is something altogether different. They really connect, in a way that is at once fleeting but incredibly deep and meaningful.What we're used to seeing in movies is a fast-paced plot and dialogue that carries a scene. In love stories, we rarely get to see why two characters fall in love, or what they actually talk about. Often movies skip over the happy scenes, showing characters strolling hand in hand with ice cream while a pop song plays on the soundtrack. We see them talking and laughing but we never know what it is that they are talking or laughing about. The subtle message is that it doesn't matter."Before Sunrise" tells us that it does matter. It matters more than anything. Because we see all the dialogue between these characters, including the awkward silences, the fillers, the so-called meaningless conversation that most other movies would skip over.There are some tangential characters that the two encounter, and there's some scenery (Vienna is of course the setting and it's a beautiful city) but all of that is peripheral; the movie focuses on the two characters and their interactions together. There is no formula here, no neat-as-a-bow happy endings. No, these are real people, sharing their views and thoughts and hopes and dreams. We never learn much about them in terms of biographical details. They don't share their resumes the way so many strangers do when they meet. No, theirs is a connection at a deeper level.This movie stayed with me because I felt it was so realistic and true-to-life. It's also a little sad; what does it really mean if you meet someone and connect like that and then maybe never see them again? What are we after if not a connection like that? But on the other hand, that's why it works so well. We see many instances where the two characters clash on views and outlooks and politics and philosophies, but because their time together is so fleeting, none of these things become issues. We get the sense that a long-term relationship between them would never work, but that the chance one day encounter is going to stay with them forever.In fact, though I'm told the sequel ("Before Sunset") is fantastic, I'm reluctant to see it. I prefer to see the ending as open, because it was so perfect in the context of the film."Before Sunrise" is an honest, touching, wonderfully acted film that is sure to captivate anyone who sees it. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great movie. I mean, really surprised me. I was expecting your typical predictable 'You've Got Mail' kind of movie, which I hate, because I had no idea what it was about or what to expect. Completely and utterly wrong, was I.The movie, set in Europe, which I can tell you from having been there enough times, was completely realistic, and the directing was extraordinary. One of the best directed films I've ever seen. I loved it for so many different reasons. 1. It was the kind of story that I can honestly imagine to come true and be real. 2. The directing was incredible, including cinematography 3. The acting was amazing, it really proved what a terrific actor Ethan Hawk is, and actress Julie Delpy is. I could list a ton of other reasons why I loved the film...but the list is just far too long.But if you like romance films, you'll certainly like this one... it brings a mistiness to your eye, and leaves you sad and anxious to find out what happens next.A 10 most definitely!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before Sunrise: 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Romance is basically dead in movies. We get romantic comedies, but those usually involve calling people the wrong name in bed. But epic romances a la Gone with the Wind are basically, um, gone with the wind. That is, before Richard Linklater came along. I'm not calling his Before Sunrise an epic romance by any means, but it's a nice, small romance that actually has believable characters in a believable circumstance. You can't really get that from a recent "romance". What Linklater (and co-writer Kim Krizan) create is an engaging love story that, unfortunately, has never heard of "too much of a good thing".Taking a train through Europe, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) starts talking with Celine (Julie Delpy). He convinces her to get off of the train in Vienna to spend his last European night with him. They wander around the town, talking about life, the universe, and everything, as the clock winds down, because Jesse has to catch a plane.Before Sunset, the sequel to Sunrise, has basically the same format. The conversations in both are very interesting and entertaining, but I'd say that Sunrise's conversations were more varied. Some were more interesting, some were less interesting, and some were mediocre. But it's the conversations that make both Befores such great movies. They let you get inside of the characters, realize what they're thinking and how much like real people they are. And not only is the dialogue entertaining, but it's thought-provoking and all natural. It all seems ad libbed, which it isn't, which finalizes the humanity and the true-to-life qualities of these people.But where the second one succeeded, the first one failed. The second came in at a quick 80 minutes, which was 80 minutes of dialogue shown in real time, creating a very intimate bond between the audience and the characters. In Sunrise, it's not in real time (which is okay, but not up to par with the sequel), which allowed unnecessary establishing shots to be put in. But what was the worst about this movie was its inability to end. Instead of doing something like the short 'n sweet 80 minutes of the second film, after 80 minutes is up, Sunrise isn't over yet! You've had enough of these characters and you want the movie to end (in a good way), but the movie keeps on chugging along. It goes on for 20 more minutes, and it doesn't even have a successful climax. That's the worst part of the film-it keeps on going and going, but it really overstays its welcome and becomes too repetitive towards the end. Obviously, you should see this movie before the sequel, but I think it's safe to say that Sunset is the better movie overall.My rating: 7/10Rated R for language.</fullReview>

It can be recommended only to freshman film students who keep journals dedicated to their poetry and pinings for their first sexual encounter.

I love how the movie shows that things which aren't supposed to happen can be really nice and important if they get a chance to happen. Another reason to like it is because of the nice places they go and ordinary scenarios they come across. At some point, the movie does encourage some genuine feeling which takes us to similar experiences we had and the dilemma and excitement at the same time. That is one best quality and reason to get so many stars. I mean the guy asks a girl to change her trip within an hour of meeting her......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Before Sunrise" is a film that is much, much better than it sounds on paper. It is mostly compromised of long takes of just these two characters, Jesse and Celine, who have just met on a train, talking. Just talking, about anything. Much of it on their various philosophies on life and about themselves. They are seemingly more honest to each other than to anyone else they know, such as in the fake phone call scene, and it shows in Ethan Hawke's and Julie Delpy's chemistry in this film, which is some of the best of any romance film ever. They both give fantastic performances, and they seem to completely inhabit their characters. It's possible that the film wouldn't work if it were any other two actors, and because they are so perfect for their roles, we end up believing every single word that they say, unlike many other romance films. This is a film that is very easy to get lost in, whether it's the fantastic and natural but revealing dialogue or the fantastic acting and chemistry between the leads or the long, long tracking shots in which the flow of the actors and their dialogue all come together so perfectly to pull us completely into their relationship. But we get so lost in the moment, as the characters do, that it's gone before we realize it, and we come to the harsh realization that their time together must come to an end for a long period of time. They say that they will meet on that exact day, six months from them, but we never really know. As we saw earlier they completely forgot about the play that they were asked to go to, and 6 months from now, sadly, who knows if they will remember to come? We also are hinted at the beginning of hard times to come when the film opens with an older foreign couple fighting and neither of the two main characters understand the language their speaking in, but it's also a metaphor for how they don't understand their struggles.

		<shortDescription>After watching it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "Before" trilogy is beautiful. I'm singling this one out because it's the starting point (despite not being my favourite, that honour would go to 'sunset'). Regardless whether watched as a trilogy or stood alone, this film explores young-adult relationships in such an honest way that you can't help falling in love with the characters.I found myself connecting with Celine (Julie Delpy) more than Hawke's Jesse, I almost found him insufferable at times. But this isn't because he was annoying or irrational or stupid, I simply found myself disagreeing with his point of view some of the time. And although this seems like some indictment on the quality of the film, this is far from the case. The film managed to suck me into the world so well that I questioned and pondered the points of views of the characters themselves rather than words of writers. And this couldn't, I believe, have been done without the master that is Linklater, able to craft these long takes of just talking; somehow keeping it captivating never letting my interest wane. The conversations were natural, almost seemingly improvised.The film is so honest, it lets the characters disagree, without superficially hyping up the drama, or putting a neat resolution on subtle disagreements. the awkward moments are on display just as much as the magical and romantic ones, and once again all without seeming artificial. I don't even see any point in describing the plot because that loses the element of spontaneity. But don't get me wrong the film isn't perfect, it has the occasional contrivances and maybe a more sentimental ending than I had hoped for, that is either helped or hindered by the awareness of a sequel. But do watch the sequel its even more interesting. But for now watch this, this film pure and beautiful film-making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Banal and contrived, yet intriguing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot throws a young couple together in a contrived situation with an arbitrarily short deadline, and we watch dutifully as the story (such as it is) trundles along to the inevitable conclusion ...... And yet, at the same time, there's something truly captivating in this tale. The passing scenery, the predictable story, the unlikely meeting and dissonance between the characters, the tedious, naive, pretentious drivel that passes for dialog, the cow act (yes, really) ... these are mere distractions, perhaps specifically and intentionally arranged to prevent us being totally swallowed up by the huge vortex consuming our two brave protagonists before our very eyes. Despite everything, despite everyone's best efforts, fleeting glimpses of reality, little gestures and entirely credible, honest, convincing reactions escape, giving the game away: turn out this is not a film after all, but a fly-on-the-wall documentary. We're mesmerised, and the vortex has us. This film is not for everyone but if you make it past the first 15 minutes, it's all downhill from there. Before you know it, you'll find yourself picked up and swept along on the same emotional roller- coaster that is taking the actors to places they hadn't anticipated going either.Just before the final credits roll, we're treated to a recap of the now empty scenery from key points in the film, reflecting on what we've just been through in the same way as the departing characters. Nice touch.Bottom line: well made, well acted, a captivating, romantic love story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The actors take hold as we follow ahead of an unfolding beautiful and spontanious poetic young love attraction.The camera captures the subtle nuances that we miss when we ourselves have been engaged in similar events. At times the film seems as if a memory, too good to be fiction, and also, too good to be true. This film captures what we at some point in our lives have taken for granted, and that is what it truly means to be young and in love. Before Sunset is A romantic adventure that is a startling piece of American cinema. We all should thank the director of such a treasure of a film, Mr. Richard Linklater, thank you...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this first part of the "Before" trilogy, we meet Jesse and Celine. They are both on the train, and both witness a German couple fighting. They decide to go to the lounge area, where they get to know each other better, and after a while, they get out of the train to go explore the city together.Before I start to review this movie let me say that I had very low expectation, but I got proved wrong. This movie is directed by the director who is called Richard Linklater. He has 'recently' directed the very good movie "Boyhood", which took 12 years to shoot.That movie was well directed, and so was this one. Linklater did a good job, again. The cinematography was good too, nothing very special or that stood out to me. The best part of the movie is the screenplay, but I am going to talk about that part in a bit. The set pieces were good too, even though there are all real. But that is all I have to say about the movie in this part of my review.Now lets movie on to the characters, and the actors of them. Here they did something special in my opinion. They only had two cast members. The other people you see in the movie just have a minor role, and are just extras. So this movie just focuses on two characters. A male and a female. Jesse and Celine. The first one I am going to talk about is Jesse. He was played by Ethan Hawke. Hawke has recently took on some very bad roles. *cough* Getaway *cough* but also some good ones like "Boyhood". He plays two totally different characters in both movies, but in both movies he is really good. In "Before Sunrise" I think that he portrayed the character of Jesse very good. The Jesse character was good too, but more on that in the paragraph of the screenplay. Now the female part was played by Julie Delpy. She played the love interest of Jesse, who is called as you could have probably guessed Celine. I hadn't seen any work of her before I watched this movie, and I think that that is going to change soon. She was very good. The accent made her sound cute, no that is a joke, for everyone who has seen the movie. But to get serious again, the accent gave something more to the character of Celine. This gave away that she was french etc. The chemistry between these characters is also something that drove this movie further. They had very good on screen chemistry. A scene where you can see this very good is the so called 'record-shop' scene. Here they get in this listening cabin, and there is no dialogue, for quiet a long time, but you do not bother, that there is none. Not because the dialogue is so bad in every scene that you get a little brake from it, no, the dialogue is very good actually. It's the acting, and emotion on their faces that move this scene. The extras were very good. The one that stayed with me the most was the one with the street poet. I particularly liked this scene because it showed a bit of Hawkes character, but also because it is a beautiful scene overall.The screenplay. This was like I have said earlier the best thing of the movie, and I wasn't kidding. It is a dialogue driven movie, and also a dialogue heavy movie. That's one of the things I was afraid of the they would screw up. But they didn't. Luckily. You often have these long conversations between the two characters, but you don't get bored of them. You get invested in them. There is this scene that I want to bring up. In this scene Jesse and Celine are sitting in some kind of bus, and they are asking each other questions to get to know each other. This scene is in particular good, because of the character development, but you also just get sucked into their conversations. Due to all of these dialogue scenes, you start to care for these characters, something that you don't see that often anymore in movies. "Good Will Hunting" (my favorite movie of all time) did this as well. But now the characters. these were, like I have said, very good. You get to know Jesse in small bits, first on the train, about his TV- sow idea, then on the bus about his shyness of his first love, and then you see that he really opens up for this girl, and he tells her about how his dad hated him. In combination of all of these aspects that I have just numbered, you really start to care for him. I cared less for Celine, but she was still a very good character. The conversations between Celine and Jesse also feel very real. So felt the actions they did. They looked like a normal couple.But overall I thought that this was a very good love story, between two very good characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching and different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in the beautiful city of Vienna, Before Sunrise is a beautiful love story of Jesse (Ethan Hawke), who is headed to Vienna and Celine (Julie Delpy), going to Paris, who meet in a train. After spending a short while talking, they decide to get off the train in Vienna and spend an evening together. But how long will they actually last? We see a good blend of feelings here, from the first conversation, sense of adventure, getting off the train, feel of being in a different world, and also dealing with good-byes.There isn't much of a story to the movie. But what truly captures the hearts is the long, pointless, yet deep-rooted talks and conversations between Jesse and Celine. Unlike most other Hollywood love stories, this couple falls for each other's soul, and not the bod. That is why about 95% of the movie is just talks between the two protagonists. The other 5% is the beauty of Vienna.Even with a few minor glitches in the shots (the views outside the train is different for both, Jesse and Celine, in one single scene, the direction of the train changes as they enter the lounge car...), Director Richard Linklater easily manages to make the surroundings co-operate with the theme of the film, and throughout the movie, the audience is kept engaged in a soothing, romantic feel due to the way shots are presented. Maybe the optimum use of the location to give emotions to the scenes is what won the director a Silver Berlin Bear as Best Director at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1995.Before Sunrise is every Indian girl's ideal movie, as there are no antagonists, or any 'Kabab Mein Haddis' (or anything, except Celine, Jesse, beautiful locations and amazing conversations, for that matter) Not many movies survive with only so much to offer, but this one does, with a good reaction from the people.Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy could be a little better in their facial reactions to each other's talking. But that is acutely negligible given that the viewer is more invested in the dialogues than in minutely observing their faces. There are no other characters taking more than 3 minutes of screen time and the whole movie revolves around the couple. Good direction and right timing are a plus point here.With some very good quote-worthy dialogues for word-lovers, the movie goes on to an 8 out of 10. Hats off to the production for pulling off such a wonderful movie with such great simplicity. Even without a story with many twists and turns, this simple plot ends up touching the hearts of the audience, for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A definitive statement on love in the modern world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1995, Richard Linklater released Before Sunrise, and every nine years since has released a sequel. While sharing certain characteristics, each film is unique and worthwhile in their own right, but taken as a whole, this trilogy is something truly special. Some say that they are the best films about love and romantic relationships ever made, and they just might be. The series follows Jesse and Celine through the years. Jesse is an American traveling through Europe when he meets a French girl who is on her way home to Paris. They get to talking and Linklater's camera follows their conversation throughout the rest of that single day as the two fall in love. And every nine years, we revisit the couple at a different stage of life. Because of the time between the films we get the unique experience of watching two characters age, retaining the core of their personality, but taking on greater complexity as the years pass. The first film is about embracing the moment and forging a genuine human connection. The second film, Before Sunset, is about the regret of missed opportunities and the need to be true to yourself. The third film, Before Midnight, is about the consequences of actually getting what you want. Each film utilizes long takes which pull the audience deeply into the dialogue heavy narrative, and the fantastic performances by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy belie the fact that they're actually acting. These magical films are not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Undoubtedly one of the most romantic movies of all time, Before Sunrise follows two strangers (Ethan Hawke's Jesse and Julie Delpy's Celine) as they meet on a train and immediately hit it off - with the film detailing the pair's subsequent walk through the streets of Venice. It's a simple premise that's executed to impressively engrossing effect by filmmaker Richard Linklater, as the director, working from a screenplay co written with Kim Krizan, kicks the proceedings off with a captivating meet-cute that's heightened by the palpable chemistry between Hawke and Delpy. The characters' utterly charming dynamic ensures that their conversations are, for the most part, far more compelling than one might'V anticipated, with Linklater and Krizan's script packed full of cogent observations about topics as varied as relationships, death, and religion. It goes without saying, of course, that Before Sunrise is at its best during its more blatantly romantic moments, with, in particular, Jesse and Celine's first kiss ranking high on the movie's list of swoon-worthy sequences.

Does it really matter?

		<shortDescription>A Trip In Vienna</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Sunrise is the start of a beautifully constructed trilogy that will make you feel very close to the story and its characters. Set in the Austrian capital Vienna, one gets to see a visceral beauty that only a more classic European city can give. The story follows Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Céline (Julie Delpy), who, after meeting on a train bound for Vienna, decide to spend the day in the city before Jesse has to leave the next day for his home in America. What follows next is a wonderful connection between these two people who seem to be very interested in finding out personal details from each other. First of all, when a movie tries to sell long conversations as a pivotal point in story and character development it needs a solid script and top actors to deliver this to the audience and in my view this is accomplished splendidly.Hawke and Delpy fit perfectly into their roles and it's no wonder they have contributed to the evolution of the characters in the 2 later installments in the trilogy. As for this first movie's screenplay, Rinchard Linklater and Kim Krizan succeed in presenting a convincing and thoughtful story that is wonderfully told through every word spoken by the leads. Aspects like cinematography and directing are also very well handled and only add to the movie's immense quality.At the end of the day, I look at Before Sunrise as an unique film that stands out as a quiet little movie in a time of loud blockbusters, and as much as I love some of those less artistic movies, I know that when I need a little peace, this is the perfect movie for me to invest in.Rating 9,5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I started to truly appreciate Before Sunrise after the third installment of this "series", Before Midnight, filmed two decades later. Without this dimension, knowing that there were two more movies with the same characters and in the same vein, Before Sunrise would have been just another art-house movie.We follow the protagonists that meet accidentally on the train. They seem to be the ideal Western combination, French female polyglot and American male with artistic tendencies. They spend a night together in Vienna and discover their own landmarks of the city.What sets apart this movie with from all other similar features is the dialog. The whole movie is more or less one lengthy conversation with all advantages and disadvantages such an approach might bring with itself. Yet, they touch all possible topics interesting to the people of their age, presumably early twenties. They range from abstract thought on life, arts and passage of time to reference of the civil war in the former Yugoslavia, raging couple of hundreds of kilometers away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Credit IMDb) American tourist Jesse and French student Celine meet by chance on the train from Budapest to Vienna. Sensing that they are developing a connection, Jesse asks Celine to spend the day with him in Vienna, and she agrees. Passing the time before his scheduled flight the next morning. How do two perfect strangers connect so intimately over the course of a single day? What is that special thing that bonds two people so strongly? As their bond turns to love, what will happen to them the next morning when Jesse flies away?I've seen this movie and the sequel, After Sunset. I have yet to see Before Midnight. This movie is one of the best romance films you will ever see, simply because it is brimming with crisp dialog and creativity. It also makes sure to avoid clichés. I actually dig chick flicks, even the predictable ones. I do love it when something spontaneous and creative comes along like this. Not sure if this will appeal to female teenagers, it might move a little too slow for them, I hope I'm wrong on that. But, adults will love this movie. Another reason this movie is dynamite is because of the performances from the two leads. These are two lost souls, pining for excitement in their lives. Watching them fall in love during one night was a real treat. It wasn't just thrown on screen to make you believe their in love, I felt it. I could feel their love. Ethan Hawke isn't a favorite of mine, but he excels in a big way here. He's charming, likable, vulnerable, and witty. I enjoyed the hell out of him. Julie Delpy is his match as the stubborn, but beautiful and caring love interest. Their chemistry is top-notch. Final Thoughts: Hawke and Delpy are essentially the whole show here and they are more than up to the task. Even people who don't like romance films should appreciate this one.

From start to finish, there is no definite story or plot present in the film but only conversations about random things or each other and in the end, this chitchat between them turned out to be the only thing that mattered most because it told us everything there is to know about the characters, their views on life &amp; love and even goes on to justify the existence of this story in the first place.Exquisitely directed by Richard Linklater, who came up with this story by taking a leaf out of his own life &amp; refined the screenplay to a great length to give it a completely natural &amp; instinctive appearance. The lush cinematography beautifully captures the dazzling locations of Vienna, the editing is brilliantly carried out and the performances by Ethan Hawke &amp; Julie Delpy as Jesse &amp; Céline respectively is the core ingredient which provides this absolutely devouring dish its very own heart &amp; soul. On an overall scale, Before Sunrise is one of the most intriguing, original &amp; heartwarming romantic dramas I've had the pleasure to watch. Each frame here is as magical as love itself, and that's coming from a guy who isn't even very fond of this genre in the first place. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

The emotions they share, the awkwardness, the infatuation...it's brilliantly dug up from the first scenes up to the end. I recommend viewers to watch the next 2 movies 'Before Sunrise' and 'Before Midnight' to get the full grasp on how we evolve in relationships seen through the eyes of director Richard Linklater.

		<shortDescription>Completes as one of the best romantic trilogy of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Before Midnight, Sunset, Sunrise are interrelated, it's best to put all 3 three together:Before Midnight (2013)The sequel to Before Sunset and Before Sunrise, the film is a continuation of the story of Jesse and Celine after a further nine years. They've decided to be together after their encounter in the Before Sunset and have kids.This time around, they're on the last few days of a family vacation with their kids in Greece. Jesse worries about his son's wellbeing from his previous failed marriage, which triggers a relationship assessment for the couple after all these years. Once again, the screenplay is written by both the actors themselves and it is astounding. Witty, intelligent, realistic, thought provoking and occasionally humorous, they talked about family issues, work, marriage, the obligations of parenthood, the complexity that lies in long-term commitments, insecurity, struggle of feminism. In the film, Celine's feminist ideas push her to behave in ways we've not seen her do before, many of the romanticism on her have faded away since the first film. Their lives have moved on since then, life is no longer hers alone and she has make some sacrifices for their relationship to work. Their heat argument near the end of the film reveals the hidden tensions in their relationship...the fears, resentments, insecurities, loneliness throughout the years and this reflects a lot of real-life married couple problems. A truly remarkable film that's fascinating to watch. Rating: 9/10Before Sunset (2004)The story of Jesse and Celine continues again after nine years (the film is also made nine years after the first one). They didn't managed to meet each other at the Vienna train station six months after the events of Before Sunrise. Jesse, couldn't forget their fateful encounter, decided to wrote a book about them. This allows Celine to find Jesse at a bookstore in France and their conversation continues again. The dialogue is superb, even more interesting and personal as his time around, they talked about their troubled love life, politics, environmental issues...Throughout the film, they started to show their imperfections, burdened by numerous responsibilities as they talk about the mistakes they made in life and the disappointments that comes with it. The effects of aging are noticeable from their faces. This film is definitely better than the first, because it provides a more unique, personal perspective. The characters have grown and matured throughout the years. From here, it's becoming apparent that these two characters are soul mates and they were meant for each other. Interestingly, the film's dialogue are both written by the actor and actress themselves. One can't help but to assume that the two leads may have actually shared some personal conversations during the making of the film.Rating: 8.5/10Before Sunrise (1995)The story is about a young guy, Jesse and a young girl, Celine randomly meet on a train in Europe and they're both decided to spend the whole night together, talking about life and love in Vienna. As they walk around Vienna the whole night and communicating with each other, sharing their personal life experiences, you can see a deep connection slowly formed between them. The two lead actors, Ethan and Julie, shared a perfect chemistry together on screen.The script for the film is magnificent as the dialogues managed to keep the audience engaged throughout the film.Their conversations about love provides a lot of insights about relationships.They share their views, thoughts, perspectives of anything...and as they speak, you feel that you started to know these characters as well. The film successfully captures the beauty of youthful love, two beautiful people meet in a romantic setting and attracted to each other.Rating: 8/10Overall: Linklater, together with Ethan and Julie, had crafted the one of the best romantic drama trilogy of all time.The films features an in- depth look into the characters, their life experiences and how it affects their love life...of being together.The films allow us to see one woman and one man changes over the course of time. Note: Keep in mind though, the films are dialogue driven and spend most of the time on the conversations between the leads, how they managed to find a connection between them, share their thoughts, views, perspectives, principles in life...If you find that two people communicating is not enjoyable, then it's not recommended to watch the trilogy.But it'll be incredibly rewarding if you do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is always with me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This little film turns out to be a big one. I watched it because of the reviews thinking I couldn't possibly enjoy a romance. But this film is much more than a romance. It's real and has stuck with me ever since.This is a film about youth and romance but avoids the sappy callowness and lack of realism I so frequently find in movies about young relationships.Both Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy provide excellent performances but it is Julie Delpy who stays with me. She is almost magnetic and I fall in love with her just as Jesse does. The script leaves a big question mark at the end and you wonder what are these two going to mean to one another down the road.There is a sequel "Before Sunset" that maintains the integrity of "Before Sunrise" and is satisfying in its treatment.I understand there has been another film about these two making this a trilogy and I want to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two complete strangers strike up a conversation on a train...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two complete strangers strike up a conversation on a train. The country is foreign to both of them, but they're from different cultures. She's French, he's American, they talk. And they continue to talk for the rest of the evening, having hopped off the train together, roaming around the city of Vienna. This is the premise of "Before Sunrise", the first part of Richard Linklater's "Before" series. It's a movie about everything and nothing ? there's no action, no events, but there's drama and comedy in the constant conversation that we are presented with. By the end of the 100 minute film, we feel like we know the two of them inside out. As basic premises go, this has the potential to be a long and very boring ordeal. But the conversation is witty and intellectual, and never feels boring because you feel like a third party sharing it with them.As they walk around Vienna, they meet various different characters. They ask some locals for things to do, meet a man who offers to write them a poem, are confronted with a palm reader at dinner. Each encounter tells us more about the two personalities that we're watching. Both are incredibly romantic, but Jesse has a cynical edge to his character (shown by his reaction to the palm reader). The love that the pair share for each other is clear from very early on, and since they know that this may be the only time they meet, everything moves quickly. They share deep secrets with each other (at one point by the means of hilarious fake phone calls to friends), and share a first kiss at the top of Vienna's ferris wheel. When the next day comes, they part ways, agreeing to meet again in 6 months in the same place. They don't share contact details, knowing that it will happen if it should. This leaves the viewer with one of the most beautiful and infuriating endings in film (but not, strangely, in this series) ? will they ever see each other again.The film would be nothing without the superb performances from Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, whose characters are both fascinating and likable. The script, partly written by them, is extremely sharp and funny, and Linklater's no direction is ever present. This is the birth of a style, very focused on conversation and long shots, which carries over to much of his later work. In all, "Before Sunrise" is never boring, and leaves you wanting even more. Which is lucky, because there are two sequels, both of which are equally fantastic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my project of watching IMDb's Top 250 list (of August 9 2013) I have come to number 246, which is "Before Sunrise" directed by Richard Linklater. Before I saw it I just thought it would be some dumb 90s romance flick, but my prediction was proved wrong. This movie was actually quiet enjoyable.American Jesse Wallace meets the French girl Céline on a train from Budapest. They have a great chat and come to like each other. Céline is on her way to Paris, while Jesse is going on a plane from Vienna back to the United States. When the train stops in Vienna he convinces her to spend the night with him in the city. Through the movie they have several interesting conversations about everything between heaven and earth and they are quiet interesting.Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy do a great job in their lead roles as Jesse and Céline. The movie is very beautiful too and does have some kind of special magic over it. I recommend it if you are in for a special treat. So overall it's a pretty good movie and I will give it 8 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love in its Simplest Form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recommended by a good friend, Before Sunrise is probably one of the most memorable romantic movies I have seen. There is nothing like it and its simplicity is, I think, what compelled people to love it.The movie, starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Deply, is about both young American Jesse and French Celine. They met in a train bound for Vienna and talked a little about each other. Each has no idea where their simple conversation would lead. Everything that happened on that day happened naturally, all unplanned. They spent the night in Vienna, walking around the city, visiting famous landmarks and talking, revealing details about themselves like they've been friends for quite some time.It's a no brainer to figure out that there is going to be more of Jesse's introduction/pep talk to Celine on the train. And while waiting for something out of the ordinary in the plot, I find myself enjoying the mundane things the film is showing. As I've said, it's the simplicity of the movie that draws its audience to finishing it and listening intently to the lines of the characters.Three things that I like about Before Sunrise are as follows:1. Good script. Not great but good. But that is the beauty of it, there are no filled with ripe wisdom lines that characters are throwing but the good script makes audience know who is the cynic and who is the romantic at heart but is careful at loving. The script even makes it worth waiting how the film is going to end.2. Good theme. This one is one of the things unmasked by number 1. Jesse and Celine have fallen into minor disagreements and I find myself comfortable with it. I don't even take sides, I just let it be. I enjoy the role of an observer. Point is, the characters are two young souls who are still in the process of knowing themselves and having been through experiences that may have torn them but they talk about it comfortably. Their self-discovery is a work in progress and their self- fulfillment could be a case-to-case basis but it's there.3. Sense of Wonder. Unlike some friends who were left hanging with the story's ending, I was basking in the sense of wonder. I actually find this part realistic. After knowing that a romance is brewing and realizing that the film's about to end, I enjoyed wondering what it is going to be for Jesse and Celine.Before Sunrise is no perfect movie but it will make you feel better about a lot of things: life, love, friends, family, and faith. If these things interest you, this one is for you. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvellous, unusually realistic, atypical of Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is about the accidental meeting of two mid-20s age college students: "Jesse" (Ethan Hawke) and "Celine" (Julie Delpy). He's returning from a disappointing visit to his girlfriend in Spain (she's in an international student program but has fallen in love with another student and dumped Jesse). He's near broke and on a train to Vienna from where he'll take his cheapest flight back to the USA.Celine's on the same train, returning to her home in Paris when they meet. Although French, she's studied in the USA and speaks excellent English. Jesse asks - and Celine agrees - to interrupt her trip to spend a few more hours together exploring Vienna before his plane leaves. Gradually, as they get to know each other, they become more deeply attached.As Roger Ebert said, "This sort of scenario has happened....millions of times. It has rarely happened in a nicer, sweeter, more gentle way.... (It's) so much like real life - like a documentary with an invisible camera." This is the first film (so far, of 3) by Linklater starring Delpy and Hawke, each filmed 9 years apart: "Before Sunset" (2004) &amp; "Before Midnight" (2013). While it'd be nice to see them in order, each one is so good, so unique and satisfying that it's more important to just see them. The series is about relationships: how do we get to know others and let others know us, how do we handle differences, conflicts? To what would a long term relationship with this person lead? - satisfaction? - disappointment? How much of which? How can we tell?This film's opening raises those questions by example: on the train ride, Celine's bothered by the loud conversation of a long married, middle-aged couple across the aisle from her: they argue so loudly (and obviously chronically) about? - whatever, everything - that Celine moves and finds herself across the aisle from Jesse. Their conversation starts - and where will this go? That's the gist of this marvelous, very unique movie.People who prefer car chases and explosions should avoid it--no action of that kind, whatsover; it's all just talk--but, for many of us, what exciting talk that keeps us wondering to where it will lead!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jessie and Celine meet on a train in Austria. After a brief conversation, Jessie asks her to get off the train with him in Vienna. "Jump ahead, ten, twenty years," he says. "You start to think about all those guys you've met in your life and what might have happened if you'd picked up with one of them, right? Well I'm one of those guys." Celine eventually agrees, and the night that follows is an unforgettable experience for both characters, despite the inevitability of their separation in only a few hours time.I love movies with simple concepts like this. That two complete strangers can forge such a deep connection based on a brief interaction is an intriguing thought. Think of all the people you pass on the street every day, yet know so little about. This movie is about what would happen if you actually had the balls to approach one of them. Before Sunrise is an optimistic start to Linklater's series, and one that is interesting to reflect on as you watch the following movies. Jessie and Celine's dialogue is hilarious and surprisingly profound. As a viewer, you truly believe that they share this powerful connection mentally. They touch on universal themes that couples all through time have discussed, yet do so in a completely original way that is fun to watch, and all the while you can feel the attraction building. In traditional Linklater style, Before Sunrise feels much like it is shot in real time. There are several takes that run several minutes long, but the conversation is so natural that even these long shots never become boring. This movie impressed me upon my first viewing, but it wasn't until Before Sunset that I truly fell in love with the story of this couple. I would recommend seeing both movies before you judge this one as just another fluffy love story. Re-watching this after seeing the second movie only deepened my feelings for Jessie and Celine?the subject matter is light, but the experience of following these two lost souls as they wander through Vienna is simply incredible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before the Cameras</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lucky me. A couple of months ago, I got to experience the entire BEFORE trilogy and not have to wait 18 years to reach the (possible) end.When Before Midnight was released in summer 2013, I had a full day of BEFORE movies and was pleasantly pleased.The first, Before Sunrise, is the only one I'd seen before. A long, long time ago. I really did like it back then, and with this second viewing, I still admired it and loved how it holds up today, 18-years-later. I absolutely loved the dialogue, the originality and especially the camera following these two strangers who were destined to be with each other.The movie starts with the unlikely pairing of an American on holiday in Europe who meets his instant attraction, a French student. Both are on a train, but with different stops and yet, he convinces her to debark with him in Vienna. For one solid day/evening/morning, they literally walk and talk and get to know each other. Of course, they fall in love ? so much so, that the "lust" they thought they knew was relevant at first, wasn't that at all. These two were meant to be together.It takes balls for Director and Writer Richard Linklater to pull off a 105 minute movie based solely on walking and talking and only truly starring two unknowns, but?he pulled it off. The dialogue was crisp, the connection and charisma was present and the originality of such a basic, yet deep, film was refreshing.People in real life only dream about this kind of chance encounter. This may be fantasy, but it's one that many, including myself, would yearn our whole lives for. If you don't get the sense of true love, true connection and true meaning upon the finale of this film, you might want to restart the film.I did laugh, I did admire and I did fall in love with these two. I even loved the ambiguous climax. This was a love story that you'd love to read in a great novel and cherish every moment.Finally, I loved the simplicity of this film. Kudos to Linklater for such a great experiment that worked. If there were no sequels, which are certainly very good on their own, I would be okay with how this movie can stand alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been aware of this film for quite some time having never seen it. Perhaps this is for the best for I was too young to understand the raw substance this film contained. Synopsis:Before Sunrise brings to life an experience between two human beings who find themselves connected to one another. With only a single day to themselves before heading back to their "lives" these two creatures engage in a dialogue about love, death, and life while enjoying the scenes of Vienna, Austria.Review:For a film that is virtually all dialogue, Before Sunrise holds up remarkably well. It's a great capture of human interaction contrasting other well-made dialogue films like: Glengarry Glen Ross and 12 Angry Men.The day that transpires between these two is entertaining, funny, and inspires one's own thoughts into the topics discussed between Celine and Jesse. It is not the typical love story. It's a love story where two people discuss their views on love and whether or not love itself even exists.A scene following the characters departing from a train to spend the day together reveals honest direction of dialogue between Jesse and Celine. While they had just met only a few hours before, they both confess to their feelings of awkwardness after their spontaneous decision to get to know each other. Honesty captured in this way is very nice to see. Instead of trying to correct this awkwardness, they acknowledge it and decide to take the moment wherever it leads. Astounding! What follows are healthy discussions and honest debates about the topics they address all while being vulnerable and having nothing to lose, except for their short time together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The start of a great romance trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a start of a realistic connecting romance movie from a trilogy. Now I saw "Before Sunset" before seeing this one. But wished I have saw this first, since it's the first movie in this "Before" trilogy. The story is about two people meeting and as they converse, they start to build a bond with each other. While also sightseeing and experience their time in Vienna for a evening. Again the conversations hit the mark, although this time it goes in a basic root direction. It's still interesting and intriguing, even if your one of those audiences that actually thought about some of the topics in the conversation. I am not quite sure how much is ad-lib or improvised but the direction is believable and realistic. Maybe it's because both the actor and actress put few of their own real life in put, such as how Ethan Hawke is really born and raised in Texas. The conversations is basically pseudo-intellectual and philosophical view points and questions. The chemistry and connection between the two lead characters is strong. This time Ethan Hawke's character Jesse is the pessimist and slightly not as likable. While the lead actress is a optimist and likable for this first installment. The dialogues or conversations touches upon life, death, religions, relationships, and love. So although it touches on the basics, it's still a immersive film. And I enjoyed it, maybe for it's realism and thought provoking effects. Even if some areas I could agree with while others not so much.7.8/10</fullReview>

But alas, a highly-acclaimed film has to be seen sometime. It's not a mind-blowing film, yet in a degree the best world I can describe this is; heartwarming, comforting... and very safe. The dialogues &amp; humanity in this film explicitly showing the humane emotions &amp; ambiguity among people. Yet the writer/director showed it in such a way that it is never provocative, edgy or pretentious. It is just good-old human emotion manifested in dialogues between 2 estranged lovebirds.It's never boring despite the continuous dialogues. This is a possibly a sign of human's penchant to voyeurism &amp; gossiping, but that's a bit too much for this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who'd have thunk back then, that this would spawn a trilogy? My guess is nobody. But the first movie was strong enough to have followers and believers in it. Apart from the setting and the two magnificent actors, we get treated to some wonderful dialog. Some great scenery as well and the one subject that rules most of our lives -&gt; Love.Represented not only by a male and female, but also two different cultures. But it still never feels like this is a cliché or tries to get some cheap shots in to make you laugh. This feels genuine and as viewers we can and should appreciate that. So while this is not necessary watching, you should take a look at this before ... watching the sequels!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before Sunrise, the first film in the trilogy by Richard Linklater, is a very powerful, thought-provoking film that I never thought would be good. This film has no action and is merely conversation, so how can this movie be so good? Well, this movie is about as close to reality as you can get. What happens in this movie could happen to anybody out there. Secondly, the script is tight and well-written. I really loved all these meaningful, philosophical conversations. I'm usually bored at mostly talk films, but the way I was grabbed into these conversations really means the movie worked.Linklater's film is about a French girl on her way back to school and an American guy heading to Vienna to take a flight home and how they started a connection with each other when they met on the train.The acting is about as good as you can get. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have great chemistry and the way they delivered the dialog is just special. There is no need for supporting characters because the focus is on these two characters and their meanings of life.Overall, this is a very special, powerful film. I honestly didn't want to see this movie since I thought it would be a stupid romantic comedy, but it is really not. It's a drama that's thoughtful, funny, poignant, and just very sweet. I honestly don't get this "R" rating because the dialog would be very meaningful for teens. For those who love cinema, this is a great movie to watch. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really romantic and beautiful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I like to feel his eyes on me when I look away."Before Sunrise is a brilliant film about a young man and a young woman who meet in a train and spend an entire night together sharing their views on life while they walk around the streets of Vienna. It might seem like a pretty simple film, but Richard Linklater managed to create a unique and special relationship between these two characters thanks to a great script and an incredible chemistry between the two lead performers. Linklater co-wrote the script with Kim Krizan and every single dialogue in this film felt completely real and authentic. This is a very special movie that might seem simplistic but is really complicated because it's difficult to maintain the audience's attention in a film where two characters are speaking to each other without anything actually happening. The real climax and suspense in this film is seeing how time is running out for these characters and knowing this is probably the only night they will get to share together. Anyone who has gone out alone with another couple knows that it can be very boring spending time with them, but you never feel this way about Jesse and Celine because their conversations are so interesting that one wouldn't mind spending time with them and just observing how they interact with each other. That is how I felt about this authentically romantic film.Jesse (Ethan Hawke) is a young American tourist in Europe who has been traveling across Europe in train. His next stop is Vienna where he will spend the night and take the morning plane back home. Celine (Julie Delpy), a young French woman is returning on the same train from visiting her grandmother. Jesse and Celine exchange glances and begin flirting with each other. When the train arrives at Vienna, Jesse convinces Celine to get off the train with him and spend the night sightseeing. She agrees and the film focuses its entire attention on the interaction they have with each other during that night before sunrise while they visit different spots in Vienna. They have some great and deep conversations about love, relationships, and life. They both know this will probably be their only night together, which is a shame because they share a really strong connection together.The film is so brutally honest and authentic that Before Sunrise has become a classic for romanticists everywhere and it inspired two more follow up films by director Linklater. Linklater first came to the attention with his film Slackers and later Dazed and Confused, but his Before trilogy will probably be what he will be remembered for. He has also directed completely different genre films like School of Rock and Bernie. My personal favorite of his is Bernie, but Before Sunrise comes in a close second. I'm all set for Before Sunset now and am thankful I didn't have to wait 9 years to see the resolution of this sweet couple's story. This is a bittersweet movie and it portrays love and relationships in such an authentic way that it stands out as one of the greatest examples of how a romantic film must be made. A few scenes stand out above the rest for me, like the scene where Celine and Jesse have an imaginary conversation with each other as if they were talking to their best friends about their adventure (some important plot points are explained here as to why Jesse was in the train and why Celine agreed to get off with him), and the scene where Jesse makes fun of Celine for believing in the fortune teller's words. There are some really touching and sweet conversations and Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy give great and memorable performances. Not only the dialogues worked, but the non-verbal conversation between them was outstanding. Before Sunrise is a must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Before trilogy is a unique piece of cinema that is one of the most enchanted stories I've ever seen, yet I've probably never seen a fictional depiction of love ever expressed so genuinely or realistically. Before Sunrise was not a Box Office smash by any means, being independently made as well, it's kind of shocking that it spawned two sequels. But this is one of the rare times in our society a sequel was put into production because the audience they spoke too wanted more for the intellectual stimulation and embracing romance. It reached to a section of fans and critics ate it up. Thankfully, the team came backing punching the audience more with each film."Stupid people talk about people, averagely smart people talk about things, intelligent people talk about ideas." This quote has always fascinated me and is held true in each of the Before movies. Topics discussed here is what people should be talking about, not the latest petty gossip in their circle of friends. The key to total connection in a relationship is the talking about the mysteries of the world, human nature, and one's personal beliefs; that's what all three Befores cover beautifully. The trilogy's most pure nature is a collection of conversations between two people developing a romantic relationship through what they learn about each other. The dialogue was so engrossing that the entire first hour flew by and I hadn't written a single note on my legal pad. A movie where practically nothing happens would sound like a bore in theory and could even be a disaster in the wrong hands, but here it captivates the viewer.Each conversation the couple has, I identified with their thoughts; they may have been ideas I had at one time, a conversation I actually had with someone else, or something I've never thought of before that makes total sense about love, life, and personal psyche. This is what a great love story should be. This is what a great movie should be. This is how a great movie representing the building of a romantic relationship should be. The truth is, love means different things to us at different stages of our lives and the different stages of a relationship change the mood of said relationship, which is why all three movies make sense and are necessary.After I concluded my time with this Before Sunrise I thought, there's no way it could get better than this. Before Sunrise isn't just an introduction to the trilogy, it's a elegant tale of how a romance is first realized. Practically the characters have just become functioning adults in the world and in your twenties, there's still so much one doesn't understand about the life. The naiveness is captured, but with an intoxicating courtship. The screenplay is wonderful, featuring some magically written conversations that transcend the viewer into the souls of the characters. The romance has the most zest of the three films. Rating: 9/10Grade: AWatching character dive head first into conversations about life has never been so mesmerizing as it is in the Before trilogy. Communication is something lacking in society today, the Before trilogy shows us how a successful relationship is built: through talking. Julie Delpy and John Hawkes are transform into their roles and especially knock their performances over the fence in the last two films. The collaboration between two leading actors and the director, Richard Linklater, writing the later films results in a tightly told story that unfolds without fault. One thing that marks these films different from most lack of cuts within a scene. Many scenes in the Before trilogy run un-interrupted for ten minutes or more. It's very hard thing to do, but it's done with natural grace. With Before Sunrise, Before Sunset, and Before Midnight we feel closer to life, love, and ourselves. The Before trilogy is like a flower, that grew by the seeds of life, and blossoms into love and happiness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different kind of film about love.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually when we're subjected to a film about love, we enter the film with a certain realm of expectation. We expect to see the two meet, fall in love, get into a fight and either reunite or not at the end. We've seen films recycle those motions time and time again, and that is what makes Before Sunrise such a compelling watch. This is no Nicholas Sparks adaptation. There is no Celine Dion song on its soundtrack. Its a film about love, through and through.The film begins on a train, when Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) meet each other while talking about fellow passengers that bothered them. After hitting it off on the train ride, Jesse convinces Celine to spend the entire day and night together before he boards a flight and they move on with their lives. They spend their time in Vienna, a city that works as a perfect setting for the love between these two characters.What is so compelling about this film is that it defies convention. This film at its core is about these two characters and how they spend what is probably one of the best days of their lives together. They wander around the town, from place to place, doing activity to activity while engaging in natural and insightful conversation. The conversations they have are a deep look into who these characters are and how well they work together.Richard Linklater's unique vision shines through in this project, as the camera follows them around as they wander a city completely foreign to them. It intensely focuses on the development of these two characters and it also documents a realistic connection between two human beings over the span of one day. It shows what can happen when you take a risk, and that love can bloom in any situation, when you don't expect it. Hawke and Delpy completely become these characters, and we hardly ever feel like we're watching a movie. We hope that we can go to Vienna and see Jesse and Celine walking around together.Before Sunrise is a terrific accomplishment with its minimalistic production. If it were book it would be a fascinating one because the characters are richly detailed, but they're brought to life by the actors through the way they look at each other and talk to each other and walk together and it makes for a touching and thoughtful experience. Jesse and Celine are two people to genuinely root for, and though I feel fulfilled in having watched it, I'd be upset if their story wasn't continued. Boy, its a good thing the film has spawned two sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very nice, plain, relaxing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a great fan of love stories, but this one is a real masterpiece. I have watched the Notebook(2005),and this one was more convincing than it. Nothing spectacular happens in this movie, but the plain believable story wins my vote.Though I saw this movie 2 decades form it release, the story doesn't feel old. Whole movie seems to be flawless and happening to be at one continuum through the night-time, which it was meant to be. The two characters are lovable and the whole story seems not to be forceful. The love between the characters seems very real and not the made up one and that's the fact that makes it a really great love story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rare Film of Riveting Conversation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have heard about this movie for a very long time, and I know it has a multitude of devoted fans. I do not exactly like watching romance movies so I did not really feel the need to watch this. However, with the coming release of the third installment this month, and all the fervid anticipation for it, I finally relented and watched this cult classic, "Before Sunrise."An American guy Jesse meets a French girl Celine on a train from Budapest to Paris, and hit if off, having a great conversation going between them. When Jesse had to get off at Vienna to catch a plane to the States early next morning, he suddenly asks Celine if she would join him in his last night in Europe so they can continue their talking. Celine impulsively agrees, and the two talk about life and love all night long, meeting some odd characters along the way, until the sunrise broke and they had to go their own ways, vowing to meet up again in that same train station after six months.I have to admit it was not too easy for me to get into it at the start. However, maybe the charm of Celine and Jesse, thanks to the very realistic performances of Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke, drew me in and got me listening to their endless stream of conversation. The refreshing spontaneity of Celine as portrayed by Delpy had me beguiled. She is completely believable as a girl Jesse fell completely in love at first sight with.Kudos to the script by Director Richard Linklater for the natural flow and glow of words and ideas that people can relate to, succeeding to rivet the attention of even the most jaded of viewers to a movie that is nothing else but conversation between two people. The final scene of goodbye at the train station was very effective as a cliffhanger of sorts. Now I know why people were so excited when "Before Sunset" was released in 2004, nine years after the first film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit that, on the face of it, this film really didn't have much going for it from my point of view. But, as usual, I went into it with a very open mind and found I was quite pleasantly surprised. I don't know it was because the film touched those parts of the human psyche that relate to the interaction of the sexes; but I did find their conversations quite enthralling at times whilst at the same time quite entertaining. I guess it's like eavesdropping on a conversation, you know it's wrong but you just can't help it. I thought it was well made, using Vienna very well without becoming a kind of travelogue. I guess it did its job because I'm keen to know what happens next!SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.7/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Pinnacle of Romance Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Sunrise is arguably the best romance film I have had the pleasure of watching. It's so real and charming that it's impossible not to like. It is fresh in the way it doesn't count on corny romance clichés or sappy-ness to show you the love between the two characters, you can literally feel it.Before Sunrise starts on a train headed to Vienna. On this train the two main characters Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) meet for the first time when Celine ends up sitting next to Jesse. From here they begin conversing and slowly but surely revealing personal details and intimate facts about one another which creates an undeniable connection.Julie Delpy plays Celine in such a way that makes it extremely easy to believe somebody could fall in love with her in one day by just listening to her talk and being in her presence. Ethan Hawke does the same thing for Jesse, maybe not to the same degree but it still works. The acting in this movie had to be great or else it would have been a train wreck because of the way the movie is based solely on personal connection between just two characters.Before Sunrise boasts scenes of pure emotional joy and real, true bliss. It also has a few laughs to keep it from being too serious. The movie as a whole touches your heart in a way that makes it so you cant imagine the characters ever parting ways and root for them with all your might. It sucks you in, it makes you love the characters, their relationship and just everything else about it. It does this by using it's no frills method of just using heart-to-heart conversations to put all the characters emotions and inner workings right out on the table. The writing and directing by Richard Linklater is pristine. This movie is the pinnacle of the romance genre and deserves to and should be seen by everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It had been a long time that I hadn't watched a movie that moved me so much. Before Sunrise is simply one of the best romance I've ever watched. Not being a fan of the genre, I appreciated that this story doesn't rely on romantic and dramatic clichés and really feels authentic, spontaneous and subtle. It also feels like every part of this movie has been thoroughly thought of and has a meaning: the intense eye contact, the awkward pauses, the arguments, even the locations in Vienna. The style is very simple and structured. Besides the amazing writing, the actors carry outstanding performances. I could just rewatch Before Sunrise over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take a tour you won't regret taking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something so endearing about "Before Sunrise". The story can be described in a single line and yet the film addresses immensely complex issues like parents, religion and love. It's a romance, an old-school one, shot, cut and acted with such uncanny skill that it feels like a piece out of your life.The story follows two people, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy), who meet on a train en route to Paris and decide to spend twenty-four hours walking around Vienna. In the time they spend together, they talk about all the things that made them what they are and what they could've become. When romanticizing a meeting between two strangers, one should be careful to avoid clichés or risk a film that slogs. Director Richard Linklater thankfully does avoid it, because the first meeting between the two protagonists is handled with great caution. A hesitant Celine is talked into accompanying Jesse around Vienna, which Jesse later remarks that 'the coolest thing about this evening was that it was never meant to be'. There are moments like these when you know how different this particular cinematic romance is, because it feels real. The first few conversations between the characters are slightly awkward because neither of them know if they've made the right choice. Linklater handles the awkwardness, the slight embarrassment and the excitement patiently, letting his characters evolve with time. There is a masterful scene in which Jesse and Celine get inside a listening booth wherein one looks at the other and looks away when the other tries to catch his gaze. As the time passes, the characters become more and more open with one another and the conversations turn personal. In a fantastic scene in a restaurant, the two characters feign telephonic conversations with their friends, talking about their encounter and, at the same time, being honest about their attraction to each other.Apart from the performances, the writing is impeccable. The colloquial conversations are enchanting in many ways, because they are ones which we have had with someone at some point in our lives. They are biting, honest and witty, and yet, they don't lead anywhere. It's just two people talking about their point of view on things like religion, love and life but there won't be a minute where you'll get bored of it.Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are both stellar in their respective roles. Cinematographer Lee Daniel beautifully captures the narrow alleys of Vienna and makes the city look like an inconspicuous character itself. Linklater, one of the major talents of the 90s, directs with peerless virtuosity, not letting the conversations drag on for too long and successfully have his protagonists emote the right emotions at the right time, a skill which is hard to perfect and here we have someone who has managed it wonderfully in his third directorial feature."Before Sunrise" is a different kind of romance, one which stays with you for a long time after it ends. It's a film to be watched because it very nearly manages to put into words some things which are otherwise impossible to do so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film with the most simplest of plots with a beautiful story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching this film I had always regarded The Godfather as my favorite film of all time. Since then, every film I have watched has not met the bar which had been set so very high? until Before Sunrise. Why is this the best film of all time? Because you will struggle to find another film like it. The plot is so straightforward; a boy is on a train to catch a flight which will head him back to America alongside a girl on the same train who is travelling back to France. They both meet in conversation and together, decide to spend the next 24 hours within the beautiful and gorgeous city of Vienna. Sounds like an easy and simple plot but what makes this film so enthralling and interesting is what happens in Vienna and the thoughts and feelings expressed by the two lead characters, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy who portray such outstanding and realistic performances which make you forget that they are just acting. This is a film which consists heavily of pure dialogue which may put off some people; however that is the beauty of the film. There are no explosions, car chases or action scenes but simply two people exploring each other inside a wonderful city debating about such topics such as Reincarnation, Death, Love and many more. The conversations are so real, so vivid and so dreamlike that it makes the film it own. It's almost as though they are in an alternate reality where their normal routine life is put to a hold and they escape inside a dream world. Towards the end where the night is over and the sun has risen, Ethan Hawke's character Jesse quotes that they have gone back into "real time" which shows that the moments they have shared and the collection of memories that they have made, are those which will last forever in their own little world and time. A classical romance which does well to stray away from the old cheesy and clichéd films of that genre, Before Sunrise is superbly filmed and wonderfully acted with rich, pure and realistic dialogue making it one of those rare films that shine with magnificence, a film that everyone has to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before Sunrise (1995) *** 1/2 (out of 4) American Jesse (Ethan Hawke) strikes up a conversation with the French Celine (Julie Delpy) on board a train and soon asks if she'd like to walk around Vienna for a day. Richard Linklater's film was a modest hit when it was released but overtime it's grown into a cult favorite and it's easy to see why. I enjoyed the film when I originally saw it theatrically but revisiting it all these years later makes me realize why it's so special. Obviously you've got the terrific screenplay but you've also got two of the most charming and real performances you're ever going to see. What's so amazing about this movie is that it really comes across as a documentary that has no screenplay and doesn't feature actors. The film really does seem like something from life that has an invisible camera just following around two people who just met and we see where the talking leads them. It's pretty incredible to think that this film works as well as it does because there's really nothing that happens here. The two people walk around talking and every once in a while they sit down somewhere and talk. It took a lot of courage for a film like this but in the end it really pays off. Both Hawke and Delpy turn in some of the best work of their careers and without their chemistry there would be no film. Again, this thing shouldn't have worked for so many reasons but the two stars are so flawless that you can't help but believe the relationship as it blooms. I really liked the way both of them got to make complete characters who aren't alike but they still enjoy their time together. Hawks was the real stand out here because he perfectly brings that charm and laid back coolness to the character. The screenplay gives the two a lot of different stories to tell and while not all of them are interesting, even the less interesting ones still seem like a real conversation you'd have. Throughout a lot of the film I think Linklater makes it so easy to follow because the viewer can see themselves having these same types of conversations with someone in their own lives. BEFORE SUNRISE is a cute little film that manages to be very charming and leaves a smile on your face as the closing credits start.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The reason why I like this movie and recommend is that it highlights the basic and the most important part of the relationship that according to me is everlasting and forever, is to be in a comfortable position and being able to carry out CONVERSATION to a person next to you and express yourself in an effortless manner??????..While traveling by train through Europe, the American Jesse Wallace (Ethan Hawke) and the French Celine (Julie Delpy) meet each other and decide to spend the evening together in Austria and go to their respective destinations as they don't have enough time after all. Jesse and Celine shared some great conversation, and deep eye contact with a great magnetic explosion with each other .On the next morning, Jesse returns to United States of America, and Celine to Paris. Its so wonderful to see in the movie that a guy and gal of early twenties being Conversing and sharing their views with each other and ultimately confessing their attraction towards each other .Ethan and Julie will warm your very heart and soul and make you think deeply into your past relationships and how you really wish you had followed your hearts strings with a guy or gal you deep down loved and lost track of over the years. The duologue's are realistic enough &amp; I still loved the line that HAWKE used to convince JULIE to spend the day with him in Vienna .If you haven't seen the film it is worthwhile just to hear this line and to discover what is the basic art of making any sensible romantic movie . My Rating ? 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>**Spoilers Two people who fall in love in Venice in less than 24 hours.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Sunrise written and directed by Richard Linklater follows two differing people Celine, played by Julie Delpy, and Jesse, played by Ethan Hawke. This is a tragic love story about 2 people who meet on the Eurrail in 1995 and spend one memorable night in Venice. We spend the better part of 101 minutes getting to know two characters who inevitably by sunrise must part ways. Celine, who lives in Paris is traveling back from Budapest from visiting her grandmother. Jesse, whom we find has come to Europe to see his now ex-girlfriend and after breaking up with her after 2 days in Madrid has traveled the Eurrail for almost 3 weeks. While on the train Jesse strikes up a conversation with Celine about a German couple arguing on their train. When they reach Jesse's destination of Venice, in which he has a flight out at 930am, he persuades Celine to get off the train and spend the evening with him in Venice. We feel the emotions of these two characters throughout this movie. Two people from two completely different backgrounds and parts of the world find each other and fall in love in the matter of a few hours. Mr. Linklater incorporates great dialogue shots throughout which we show the face of the person who is talking then exchanging camera shots to the person's response. You get a sense they are answering you. Much like his work in "Dazed and Confused." He also incorporates other ways of expressing the scene. While in one scene starting with an up-close shot of a record to showing Jesse flipping through said records. We continuously follow Jesse as he walks to Celine perusing separately. The two have a discussion on a record she finds and we watch them walk away and into a sound booth. Continuing this scene with a low-angle shot staring up at the two characters listening to a record. We sense the awkwardness while the couple exchange glances in the very tight setting. In my opinion though, the best scene is the end of the movie when we revisit almost every place this couple has been the night before. Getting a feeling of emptiness of a location that once held a sense of love and life. The soundtrack for this movie, while subtle holds a lot of character. Again in the scene of the listening booth the song playing has words that are those of a couple falling in love. We have them going into a club, with the low-key music playing overhead. We pay more attention though to the two playing pinball and the noises the machine makes while listening to their conversation on Celine and her former relationship and Jesse's conversation of his. We feel as though we ourselves are there at the bar with them waiting to play our round on the machine. While this movie is not conventionally popular, it does have a cult following. The movie is based off of a simple concept of two people simply walking around and visiting the beautiful city of Venus all the while falling in love. We follow in their footsteps and experience the same beauty and feelings Celine and Jesse do. Knowing that as in life all good things must come to an end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, but not great. Put off watching this because it looked a common-or- garden romantic drama. However the 8/10 average rating on IMDb made me think there is more to this than that. Turns out: not really.Is pretty much just another romantic drama. Better than most in that it has more depth of characters, has a fairly unique and beautiful setting, and direction and plot are more subtle and original than most. On the down side, some of the dialogue is incredibly pretentious, navel-gazing crap. Reasonably good performances from Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, even though I found Hawke's character a bit irritating.For a much better crafting of a theme of strangers who become close friends yet know they must soon part, never to see each other again, see Lost in Translation.</fullReview>

It's a masterpiece indeed, the way it starts in the beginning and ends at the same place, their endless conversations on very different topics (which actually are very unromantic in real ), people they met, places they went... everything gives more details about their characters sparing us from the cliché flashbacks . As the film progresses like the leads even you don't want the night to end. but After the Sunrise , when they reach the station to keep up with their rational adult vow - that scene is worth really touched me. its definitely the greatest romantic movie of 90's. do watch this once in a lifetime.</fullReview>

Also, the transiency of this encounter adds up to the dreamy atmosphere shaped by the beautiful setting and the unmistakable chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. Their performance was extremely natural and soulful that I actually caught myself smiling foolishly during a number of scenes. Do NOT miss it.

		<shortDescription>Noble, romantic and full of life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Still holding up nearly twenty years later, Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise is a mesmerizing film documenting a day in the life of two people with vastly different backgrounds who form some sort of connection on a train and explore that connection in Vienna. Though some plot contrivance is required for certain scenes to take place, this is more or less one of the most thoroughly realistic and relatable love stories ever put on celluloid.The key to this success lays of course in the dialog and the acting. At times it is hard to believe much of this was written, though by whom is a matter of contention. It has been reported that actors Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke contributed significantly to this screenplay though remained uncredited. Whoever did write this script clearly has insight and understanding into the human condition regarding feelings of isolation, loneliness, love, parental relationships and overall outlooks on life. Seeing this film nearly twenty years after its release, one cannot help but think about the countless films which have been influenced by its charm, grace and idealistic view of the possibility of connections people can make. It is a noble and enthralling work, an experience that certainly becomes richer and more understandable through multiple viewings. Even in this post-post-modern society we inhabit, which seems to become increasingly cynical and technologically obsessed, here is a film that acknowledges the romantic in all of us; a desire to remain innocent, in love and fully aware of one's deep connection with another human being, preferably of the opposite gender.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is oh-so-absolutely perfect. I'm usually a very critical person, but I have no suggestions on how this could have been filmed better. The two discuss their thoughts on love, life, death, and the future. These ideas, however, are not fully formed and are rather "scattered," which makes it all the more wonderful to watch. The movie gives you the opportunity to imagine events and continue their thoughts yourself. The movie is set in a perfect decade, when technology did not get in the way of daily life. Today, the man and the woman would've exchanged Facebook names and probably would've never spoke to one another again. It's great to see something set in a simpler time, where cellphones and electronics and social media and whatnot do not get in the way of real, face- to-face conversation. This movie is perfect to watch when you're looking for something to think about, something to make you appreciate the time you are given, or if you just want to watch a great love story. It is thought-provoking and heart-warming, and it leaves you with the opportunity to fill in the blanks of what could be. SPOILER BELOW (kinda)Probably what I love so much about it is that it is not a perfect love story. The two do not confess love to one another, rather they express their doubts about love and their future. They do not run away with one another, they do not marry. They say their hasty goodbyes and promise to meet again, to the viewer's delight. It leaves one wondering if their plans work out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw Before Sunset accidentally as i was surfing channels on TV. I was hooked to the screen 2 min into the movie. I then looked it up on IMDb and found it was a sequel to Before Sunrise and both had good ratings so i got them and saw them many times. Before Sunrise is a wonderful movie about two random persons making genuine interesting conversations throughout the movie roaming in Vienna. Both Celine and Jesse are smart people with their own philosophies of life. The viewer can connect with the natural chemistry between the two lead actors. The writing part of the movie is done very well. The conversations are made to look very real, yet very deep and thoughtful. The acting is natural too and so is the direction. Richard Linklater always chooses deep, thought provoking subjects in his movies. At the end of the movie you feel the pain of the pair departing. You would wish the pair had more time with each other. The sequel is like a gift to the fans. It is wonderful too. Now eagerly waiting for the 3rd installment.Its almost impossible to describe the essence of this movie to someone who has not seen it. Because one has to experience it. So if you have not seen it and if you like romantic, heart touching movies then go for it you will be delighted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Cinema's most believable romances!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Linklater's 'Before Sunrise' is an important film which released during the American Independent Film Renaissance of the 1990s; creating Cinema's one of the most believable romances.I have watched this movie over 5 times till now. People may ask why someone would want to watch two people just walking around and talking with each other, within the span of 24 hours? It's the content of the intellectual and honest conversations Jesse and Celine share, and how they achieve self-fulfillment and self-discovery through one another. The topics and opinions covered in their conversations keep you intrigued and amused throughout the movie. The attraction between them is not just pure lust; it's moreover on an intellectual level. It's the kind of connection we dream of, but we rarely achieve or let it slip away.Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy so skillfully and amazingly get into the shoes of these amazing characters; they have a sensational chemistry.Though the movie contains many memorable scenes of Jesse &amp; Celine conversing and exploring the beautiful city of Vienna, there are a few which stand out and make an impression. - The one in which the two of them play a song in a music shop. They stand and try to listen to the song silently, when sexual tension is clearly lingering between them. - The one in which a struggling street poet writes, and recites a beautiful &amp; moving poem with a word which Jesse &amp; Celine randomly gave him. - The climax scene where Jesse and Celine woefully depart and promise to meet each other again on a decided date.The movie is timeless!(If y'all like this movie, be sure to watch 'Before Sunset' too; which tells the story of Jesse &amp; Celine's meeting, 9 years after their first meet.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a romantic film for romantic idealists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Linklater's simple yet highly enjoyable film where the two main performers are the key to the films success. Before Sunrise is another one of Richard Linklater's experimental films where the dialogue and performances are the main focus and the usual filmic techniques (like multiple edits, shots and angles) are abandoned for a more free form and relaxing capture of what genuinely feels like a blossoming relationship.Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are two strangers who meet on a eurorail heading towards Vienna. An argument between a German couple provides the excuse/reason for Celine (Delpy) to sit adjacent to Jesse (Hawke). Jesse takes this opportunity to talk to Celine. They sit together and start a conversation where the spark of a budding relationship begins to form. When the train finally stops at Vienna, Jesse plans to get off whereas Celine is suppose to be heading on. Jesse decides to take a chance and invites Celine to spend a day in Vienna with him as he has no money for a hotel/accommodation. They both feel like they could talk for hours and didn't want the conversation to stop so Celine gets off on the same stop and we follow them, getting to know one another on the streets of Vienna.For those of you expecting anything dramatic in terms of action or dialogue you are watching the wrong film. It's just goes on from one conversation to another. It's set at a very leisurely pace as the two of them walk the streets of Vienna where they discuss things that come to mind. One scene has them being tracked through the streets in one continual shot which is marvellous done as both leads talk so naturally it feels like we are listening in on a private conversation, though what they talk about is not at all pompous or overly intellectual but of amusing observations, anecdotes and quirky ideas (like reincarnation and monkeys!)There is one particular scene in the music store where they stand in a booth and listen to some music, quickly glancing at one another hoping for the other not to catch them looking. It's all too cute, touching and refreshingly genuine. A romantic tale where a boy meets girl and actually talk to one another from past experience, ideals and opinions on everything no matter how insignificant, or obscure. It's these little things that gives this film it's beauty and enjoyment. As their relationship unfolds it becomes more and more naturalistic and believable. Can two strangers meet and fall in love in one night? For those of you who hold some romantic notion/ideal then the answer would be yes, but for those cynics out there, you will probably think this is all too convenient.Not a film which will be suited for those looking for something more than just two people discovering each others personality and a film where dialogue is the main driving force of the plot. The two leads are extremely likable and very easy on the eyes, with a completely believable and very genuine look at two people falling for one another and with the film finishing with both characters promising to come back and reconnect, the film is left for us to imagine whether their love can truly blossom such is the way of the spirit of the film, very invigorating, imaginative and joyful to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By the time the end credits of Before Sunrise roll off the screen, we would be left enthralled and absorbed by one of the great romance-dramas of the nineties. Written and directed by Richard Linklater, the Texas- born filmmaker who rose to prominence in the independent cinema circuit with films such as Slacker (1991) and Dazed and Confused (1993), Before Sunrise is his third feature film and a prequel to Before Sunset (2004), released nearly a decade later with the same actors reprising their unforgettable roles as Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy).Employing a narrative approach that has since become his trademark, Linklater sets a number of his films over the course of a single day. In Before Sunrise, he sets it in Vienna, where youngsters Jesse and Celine meet by chance on a train. Jesse is a hip and cool American who has to take a flight home the next morning, while Celine is a beautiful French woman who is starting classes next week back in France. Jesse asks Celine to accompany him until he takes his morning flight. Celine, who is pleasantly surprised by his spontaneous invitation, joins him as they explore the sights of Vienna and meet strange but friendly people.The entire film is literally just two persons staring and talking to each other but Linklater's poignant and perceptive script provide the film with a heightened sense of realism. The characters talk about everything from reincarnation to their first sexual feelings while playing verbal games with each other. The camera never leaves them, as if there is a voyeur observing them. The naturalistic acting and Linklater's occasional use of long takes give us that feeling of watching events unfolding in real-time. Coupled with the postcard backdrop of Vienna, it is like an ode to the spirit of romance that ironically is so often lacking in films about romance.We sense the characters' attraction to each other, and this is communicated to us in the most subtle of ways. In perhaps the film's most memorable scene, the couple nervously tries to avoid eye contact in an awkward situation listening to a record in a booth. In another scene in a moving tram, Jesse tries to secretly brush off a lock of hair from Celine, but when she looks up, he puts his hand away. Such is Linklater's observant eye and keen understanding of human nonverbal interaction that it is a joy to watch all these details at play.The bittersweet ending brings tears, but it is not as devastating as Lean's Brief Encounter (1945), which covers similar ground. Jesse and Celine have already regarded their departure from each other as inevitable. Even though we wish to see them spend another day, another week, or month together, or heck, even get married, we know that may not be the best for them in the long-term. This emotional polarization of our feelings is deftly handled by Linklater, whose free-spirited film remains resonant to a whole generation of Gen X youths looking for love. This is a must-watch!GRADE: A (9/10 or 4.5 stars)www.filmnomenon.blogspot.comAll rights reserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Purest romance movies out there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the theme of this movie is something to do with soul mates, as its two people with very different lives, cultures, beliefs maybe, who are still finding themselves, coincidentally meeting and instantaneously getting along better than most couples ever will. Where Nights of Cabiria shows the darkness of purity of heart in our world, Before Sunrise shows the light. Julie Delpy is wonderful and really overshadows Ethan Hawke as an actor, you really feel her performance, i'm not much for watching interviews but if i had to guess, i'd say that her personality matches her character in this movie. It's a nice sweet movie, probably one of the most romantic i have ever seen, a movie about taking a chance and a hope, a movie about being alive, a movie about young people finding what they have been looking for... unfortunately the movie does end ambiguously about whether they are able grasp it too. This movie has altered what i look for in a girl, and i'd recommend it to all but the short term attention span kids, not because its inappropriate, but because movies that focus on character development are rarely enjoyable for them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Linklater, the Manipulator of the Everyday Moment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Linklater is a great director, and great directors are able to show their style with success, allowing movies to still become what they want to be but with that special "touch" director's have. For Linklater, it's taking everyday moments and routine things and making them raw or magical. The fact that you can see something that could be so average in a different light means that he has indeed succeeded at what he planned on doing all along."Before Sunrise" is the third film I have seen from his repertoire. One could say he has even changed the romantic drama genre with this film. The relationship that develops between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is truly mesmerizing and one of a kind. The thing is, I can see where some people may dislike this film. It focuses solely on their character attributes and what their beliefs are. There is also heavy focus on dialog. It may also seem like a true slow-burn kind of film to many, but I think it paces itself rather well. It is a true testament to character development and the loving relationship we all wish to have; the reason why many of us go to the movies, adoring the celebrity folk on screen, wishing we could sometimes fall in love with the real-life versions of the characters they play. The performances that Hawke and Delpy turn in are memorable and you can't help but feel a part of their conversation as the movie goes on.Linklater's sequel "Before Sunset" does the entire story justice too. It is even more amazing how they made it work to such an open-ended conclusion to "Before Sunrise."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Today I watched my second moving movie of my life. Could you imagine how great a day it is for me? Some years ago, when I watched the movie "the Dead Poets Society" I was all WOW and I was like: This is how I am going to pass through all these confusion of teen years. This is all I need for now, all I can wish for. And you know, it did help me a lot. But I always thought I would never find another movie so close to my thoughts and my feelings, like it was made specially for me. And today, just about becoming officially a youth (my 20th birthday!), I watched "Before Sunrise" and I was all WOW again. It was everything a 20 year old could want from a movie: Long conversations about everything, from love to childhood memories, from sex to feminism and everything you have ever thought about. Well, not everything everything of course, but the important things, as long as a movie can contain! Every happening, moment by moment is so perfect and on the right place that you can just sit there and be busy sensing lots of fantastic feelings and thinking and letting that thankful smile spread on your face. You just enjoy. The creators know how to handle everything just perfect.One more thing: I now officially LOVE Ethan Hawke for starring in two most important movies of my life. And also he's really cute!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rarity: An Intelligent Love Story Without a Drop of Sap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Linklater isn't a household name the way other directors are like Stephen Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, and Woody Allen. Nonetheless, he's directed a number of very intriguing films over the last two decades, though what's rare about him (and perhaps is the reason why his name isn't quite as well known) is that almost no two of his films are alike. Those moviegoers who pay attention (like me) would notice that what connects all his films, from "Slacker" (1991) and "Dazed and Confused" (1993) to "A Scanner Darkly" (2006) and "Waking Life" (2001), is Linklater's knack for character developing by way of believable and profound dialogue. The words of these characters are not only well-written, but the actors playing them almost never sound as though they are actually acting when speaking them.That's why I was surprised that all of the words spoken by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy in "Before Sunrise" were actually written, and not by the two actors themselves. Hawke and Delpy are not playing themselves, either. Hawke is Jesse, an American tourist in his late 20's who is on a trip across Europe to find himself, if you will. On his way to Vienna, Austria, where he plans to take a plane back to the States the next day, he meets Celine (Delpy), a French student around his age who is on her way back to France on the same train. As Jesse is about to get off in Austria, he persuades Celine to accompany him through Vienna, and they get to know each other as they travel the city, and are well aware it will be their only night together, if not their last for a long time.The chemistry between Hawke and Delpy is incredible, and through very long shots of them talking, you never see them look at cue cards or try any trick to make them remember their lines. I felt as though I was eavesdropping on an actual conversation. Remarkably enough, Linklater and Kim Krizan wrote all their dialogue. There may have been moments of improvisation here and there, but the dialogue evenly flowed throughout the film regardless of the source.A good 90% of the film involved Hawke and Delpy talking, but by no means was the film boring for many reasons. First of all, the city of Vienna, where the film was shot on location, seemed to serve as a third character the same way Chicago did for "The Blues Brothers" (1980), or Idaho did for "Napoleon Dynamite" (2004). Somehow the places that Jesse and Celine spontaneously walked to were all interesting despite there being no panoramic shots (except at the end, in a unique montage showing the places where the two characters had gone). Regardless of Linklater's intentions of choosing Vienna as the film's location, the city held its own with its particular attributes that differentiated it from anywhere else in the world, let alone Europe.Second, the main characters were not only likable, but had that undeniable charisma that made their dialogue worth listening to. Each character also revealed enough about their background to keep audiences intrigued, and Linklater was wise not to cut to B-roll footage when these characters were telling their stories. Such a move would have insulted the intelligence of the audience, but other modern directors underestimate the attention spans of their intended audiences unfortunately.Third, throughout the film until its conclusion, I wondered if these characters would actually meet again, and in what circumstances. Of course, that question is officially answered in the sequel that would be released nine years later, "Before Sunset". Not taking that film into account, you want these characters to meet again, but you also know that they're making the most of time they know is limited. That level of intrigue is enough to sustain any attention span, and makes for one of the most unique romantic movies ever made (even still).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the smartest contemporary romantic flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are three types of Romance. First you have those with Sex and no Brains (Titanic is the best movie in this category) Then you have Brains but No sex. Third is no sex and no brains, a category which gives you rubbish like twilight. The best Romance films are those which fall into the second category. Most folks immediately name Gone with the Wind or Casablanca as the smartest romance, but how about something more contemporary for a change. Before Sunrise could rival either of these pictures as the most intelligent romance of the 20th century, and while it doesn't actually amount to much of a story, It gets the viewer involved emotionally and intellectually. Two folks meet on a train, an American boy going to Vienna and a French girl heading for Paris, they have a long talk over lunch, and in about five minutes they becomes friends. Before long the train arrives at Vienna station, but before getting off, the boy asks if this girl wants to spend the day with him touring the city. She agrees. They have the time of their life.Before Sunrise is pretty much all talk. The two discuss many things while they wander the cobblestone streets, but the most interesting thing they discuss is Romance. This is the brilliance of Richard Linklater's script. Not only is being brilliantly self reflexive, but in a way he is poking fun at the films in the other two categories of Romance. The two discuss how cheesy relationships can be. These are clearly not dumb people, and the film is clearly not a dumb, Hollywood formula driven piece. Ergo, do not miss this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Romantic Splendor....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to see a good romantic movie after a long time. This time i chose to go for Before Sunrise, after reading a review in a newspaper that it was a very good movie. And i was in for a really great time. This isn't just a romantic drama, mind you, it is one of the most meaningful movies i have ever watched (and that is very far few and between).Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy display a great chemistry in this romantic drama that highlights the glorious European splendor. The best part about this movie are the dialogs that holds true to so much that goes on in our life. Its great to see both of them arguing about daily life matters in such a way that u won't get bored no matter how many times you hear it. And, i'd like to end this review saying that, whenever i watch this movie, i always imagine that this is the way i'd like my romantic life to be. When you are going through this movie, the most probable thought that will be on your mind is that you'll be wishing that you and your girlfriend can experience such a beautiful night. But mind it, this movie isn't for everyone. Because if you are just impatient and plain lame (a fanboy expecting some fast paced action), then this isn't for you. But i definitely recommend it to everyone. This is by far one of the best "Romantic" and "Meaningful" movie i have watched in a long time.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Celine and Jesse Go Romancing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The simplest of all movie stories: boy meets girl. And it's done pretty simply in this incredibly affecting and joyous celebration of young love; but simple, in this case, is a pathway to greatness. Simple, in this case, means intense, focused, and rapturous.Celine (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) are on a train, sitting in the same car a few rows apart. Celine is reading book in French and Ethan an English-language one; they each gaze out at the passing countryside occasionally. A couple near Celine start arguing loudly in German; she moves and sits down near Jesse. A halting conversation starts up but quickly becomes comfortable as Jesse learns that Celine's English is near-perfect, and that each is alone. They have dinner in the dining car and engage in small talk and learn a little about each other: Celine is on her way back from Budapest to Paris where she's going to school; Jesse is on his way to Vienna to fly back to the USA after bumming around the continent for a couple of weeks. They both seem by turns shy and aggressive?the train pulls in to the Vienna station, and Jesse impulsively asks Celine to get off with him and spend the evening wandering around the city, as he doesn't have the money for a hotel room. After a little hesitation, she accepts.I don't know if Linklater or his lead actors/co-writers Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy were familiar with Jacques Rivette's 1974 Céline et Julie vont en bateau or not; I suspect that the director at least was. Like Rivette's film (the first half hour in particular), this is about two people wandering around a big and beautiful city, getting to know each other, and going off in unexpected directions, and like the earlier film this was co-written by the cast and heavily improvised. The obvious similarities pretty much end there ? Rivette's film develops into a relatively humorous and fanciful murder-mystery, its two female leads never developing a romantic relationship; Before Sunrise is a quite serious (though never "heavy") romance and the male/female dynamic is always in play. But the two also have in common a love of the city and of exploration, a sense of the city as adult playground that is surprisingly not all that common in cinema ? at least not in our suburban world today.I don't mean to suggest that this film is burdened with heavy European art-film tropes or that it is lacking in originality ? far from it in fact. For a film with such a simple storyline and some obvious points of reference both French and American (think several Judy Garland romances from the 40s in particular) this is anything but clichéd or dry; the growing joy of our two leads is palpable and their explorations all both real and ordinary ( watching street performers, eating and drinking in old cavernous bars and beautiful outdoor cafés, a palm reading, street performers, a walk through a cemetery) and fresh because of the commitment that Delpy and Hawke bring to playing characters that are certainly reflective of themselves. Celine is the relatively mature and articulate, politically minded intellectual ? Jesse the slightly more posturing and juvenile proto-philosopher whose ideas usually seem more scattered, but also perhaps the more original thinker. At various points each of them takes the initiative, carrying the budding romance forward; at various points each one retreats a little, though overall it seems that Jesse is (slightly) more pushy. There are certainly commentaries about the differences between Europe and America here, but only once does it seem over-the-top (a bar scene where an American couple rudely complain to each other about the service); generally this is a film about what we have in common, not what drives us apart.After the long and wonderful night, it's time for parting. Celine gets back on a train home; Jesse prepares to board his flight. They've made a connection, beyond a one night stand?they vacillate over whether to keep in contact, finally deciding on a scheme that comes straight out of An Affair to Remember and the childish romantic fantasies we've all had: in six months they'll meet again, at the same time, the same train station. You'll have to watch the equally wonderful Before Sunset to find out how that turns out.If there's a more feeling and wise film about two people meeting and falling in love, I'd like to see it. I've seen this three times and it's only improved on each viewing. As I said above, it's not "heavy", it's never overly philosophical or artsy, but it's not stupid either ? and given the state of American romantic comedy at the time (and since), that would be complement enough; but there's also just enough fantasy and whimsicality here (how is it that the two are so often totally alone and able to indulge in deep, uninterrupted conversations in well-lighted alleys, never disturbed; would the barman really give Jesse a bottle of wine on a promise of later payment, etc) to enliven the situations without taking away from their central truth. We can see plenty of differences between Celine and Jesse developing, but also enough commonalities and real attraction that we really wonder, and want to know, what's next between them. Not many Hollywood romantic comedies leave me wanting more (in a good way); this certainly did. For once, I'm glad there's a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect, in a category of its own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm the first to point out the negative things in great films, but to me this is not one, it is perfect, in great part because it doesn't feel like a film: it feels like an invisible camera filmed two random people meeting and separating and you almost feel a guilty pleasure in watching. This is and always will be my favorite film. Great directing, script, cinematography, music and acting.The romance of Sunrise to me is in the thing about connecting, about being able to talk about anything with this person from the very start, and in the idea of falling in love in such a short amount of time. Call it love at first conversation! Many beautiful things to comment on, so I'll just pick one: the most meaningful scene of Sunrise to me is at the end, when we are shown the places they had been the night before. Those shots of morning Vienna convey the intensity of the love that we feel between the characters in the sequel, Before Sunset. Jesse and Celine had only met the night before, they were trying to be rational the whole time, not making a fuss over their imminent separation, agreeing not to keep in touch by letter or phone because of the distance. They are being rational up to the final scene when they agree in a rush to meet six months later. It is the only scene where they admit to themselves and to each other the strength of the feelings they would probably only later acknowledge as love, at some point during the nine years before their second encounter. So the shots of the places where they'd been gain importance after the scene where they part having agreed to meet again, because we/them now see the city as a fundamental part/witness to their love.Nevertheless, as we see Vienna coming back to life under the morning sun, everything is normal to the unfeeling city, except to us they are not there anymore. It's like they had never been there, despite the fact that the city felt like an important ingredient in their story. The place has forgotten them, even though it was only a few hours after their separation. Vienna doesn't hold any memory of them, it's them who hold a memory of Vienna. Obvious of course, I mean you wouldn't expect a street named after every couple who fell in love in a city! but still very symbolically sad, because you tend to think of some places as eternal, and will store things for you that you yourself have lost, and all the more so because Jesse and Celine's encounter almost shouldn't have taken place, it was unplanned and improbable, fleetingly ephemeral.This is a film where nothing much happens, only great conversation and life-changing connection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite lovely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taking a simple premise (two twenty-something travelers, a French woman and an American man), director Linklater creates something lovely and magical in giving us "Before Sunrise". Floppy-haired Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and charming Celine meet on a train, and spontaneously decide to spend the night together exploring Vienna. They talk, fall in love, and talk some more. They then go their separate ways in the morning, but the joy is in the amazing experience they have just shared.Ever had a special moment with a person where you completely lose track of time and just spend hours in conversation, discovering someone and yet feeling you have known them all their lives? I have. While my experience was on a platonic level, and didn't involve wine, Vienna or Ethan Hawke, the moment is something you treasure and that's why "Before Sunrise" struck a real chord with me. Believe me, there is plenty to talk about when you're with the right person.Hawke is certainly not a great actor, but he is perfect for the role of Jesse. Delpy is charming and unaffected as Celine. While she is the more socially-conscious of the two, I was glad the film didn't deviate into some of the socio-political claptrap that really dogs some of the newer films. By the film's end, Celine goes off on her train and Jesse on the bus, and Linklater takes us back to all the places they have visited in a series of shots. His point? Vienna is lovely, but it's the people that inhabit the places that give it colour. And it's even better when shared with someone special.</fullReview>

I went home from boot camp to visit my family and I met this girl a friend of mine set me up. It was an amazing date and I have never forgotten Michelle. I haven't seen her since June 1991. When I saw this movie it really moved me and made me think of the lost opportunity I had with her.I don't think of this movie as a chick flick at all even though it emotionally stirred me. Ethan and Julias performances were so natural and real that I just could't believe that there was a script to it, I thought that the camera man was just following them around and recording their night. Wonderfully written, directed, and performed. Excellent all around. It's follow up, Before Sunset, amazing as well.</fullReview>

His best work was Dazed and Confused, but he also did great work on Waking Life and Before Sunset, in addition to this film. He is in the same league as Pedro Almodovar and Sam Raimi.Julie Delpy (Before Sunset, Europa Europa) was magnificent in this romantic film as someone who joins Ethan Hawke (Before Sunset, Training Day) on a 12 hour adventure in Vienna, Austria.I am still amazed that two people who just met can talk almost non-stop for 12 hours. I would have had to take a break and watch the play. But they do it and give a beautiful picture of two people who find and discover each other like few can.The mystical versus the cynical, it was a great exploration of the art of conversation.</fullReview>

After spending moments on a train with a beautiful French student, an inclined cocky young American utters these words in a proposition, which sees two people embark on an impulsive journey around Vienna, where romance slowly flourishes.I've seen Before Sunrise several times now, for the first time a year after its release, and years later when I revisited the film after buying it on DVD. Still years later, the film maintains it's independent glow, and beautifully eloquent dialogue. Jessie and Celine walk the streets of Vienna, visiting cafés, shops, and parks like a pair of tourists on an ignorant quest to discover the real Vienna as well as themselves. The two discuss situations, and exchange thoughts and ideas in an articulate skillful approach that accompanies their yearning to learn more about each other. The film works because the director clearly spent blood and tears painting such complex characters. Their discussions are so private and truthful you have to feel almost ashamed that we cant allow them share their moments on their own, and yet we feel so blessed that we are able to witness these situations. Before Sunrise is above all an honest perception of modern relationships and social interaction. It is a film that carefully expresses its need to believe in love, as it exists today through the eyes of two total strangers who derive from different worlds. This truly is one of director Richard Linklater's most personal films, and it adopts a very European independent style of film-making, which embodies everything that defines Linklater as one of the leading indie masters of our time. It raises questions through its ambiguity and forces the audience to question their own beliefs and approaches to our own unsettling need to find a connection with someone, just like the characters. There are clearly very few films like it, and it successfully raises the bar for which other contemporary drama/romance films will find it difficulty to reach within its depth, intelligence and warmth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovely tale of romantic love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie - a really inspiring, intelligent picture. No on-screen sex, no violence and very little swearing, this is a textbook example of a how to make a romantic movie.The simple story sees crazy but gentle American student Jesse (Ethan Hawke) met thoughtful, dreamy French girl Celine (Julie Delpy) on a train and they go on to spend the night in Vienna together, before Jesse has to catch a train in the morning.That's it. Okay, the pair of them encounter some interesting people on the way, including a palm reader, a pair of amateur actors and a poet but in the main it is all about them and how they connect with each other.The dialogue in this movie flows like a river, and it is all down to the touching chemistry between the two leads Delpy and Hawke, who connect and react to each other so fluidly it is difficult to believe what they're saying isn't real. Their dialogue is intelligent and they talk equal amounts of nonsense and truth at the same time. They have a great non-dialogue moment in a music shop, where they want to kiss each other but don't and the camera lingers on their mutual reactions.You would have to a have a heart of stone and a soul of lead not to fall in love with this movie, and let it re-energize your faith in love and life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you ever wonder how many people we meet in our lifetime? Not just the people whom we converse with, enjoy their company, absolutely loathe, and even the ones you wish you never knew. But the people we walk by, take a glance at, and stay on our path. What if by some chance you stopped and actually struck up a conversation with one of them? Where would it lead you? It could be a dead end conversation that last no more than 30 seconds. It could encourage a heated conversation, argument, or just spontaneous chatter going off in all directions.It could lead to a whirlwind romance that will change your life forever.A man and a woman meet on a train for the first time and without even exchanging each others names they decide to spend the day together. Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise is that time spent by Jesse and Celine in Vienna. A chance meeting that would alter their lives in such a drastic way.Jesse (Ethan Hawke) is finishing up his tour of Europe and is a day away from a flight back home to the states leaving from Vienna. On the train to the city, he sees Celine (Julie Delpy) who is returning to Paris from visiting her Grandmother. Once "chit-chat" develops into a heartfelt conversation, the two realize that this is more than what it seems. There is a vibration between them that is more than the train car.Jesse pops the question. Not "the question", but asking her if she would like to spend the day with him in Vienna. She thinks, and thinks, and grabs her things and the two walk off the train not knowing where they would end up going.These two complete strangers decide to break off from their paths and go off into uncharted territory. They don't even ask each others names until they have stepped off the train. Those words passed down from parent to child through the generations forbidding children to talk to strangers must have slipped passed these two. What is so radical and provocative is that they have no idea about the others background or intentions let alone their name. This train sequence could have been over dramatic and had the two linked somehow by a distant relative or were in the same high school and didn't even know it. Two different countries, one train car, two lives that would never be the same.Linklater showcases the beauty and seduction of Vienna using a number of angles and techniques depending on the area. Fountains, bridges, river ways, and even the train cars have a romantic essence about them. It is the perfect setting for two strangers to go gallivanting about for a day to get a taste of a new foreign city, but more importantly to build up an everlasting friendship.At first their day starts off awkward and almost turns into a big mistake. They overcome this through snappy and intelligent dialogue that isn't just about past memories of friendship and relationships. Linklater delves into the realm of how things work on a grander scale. God, dreams, love, and family all are thrown into perspective.Can a relationship last a day? No. It can take place in a day but it lasts a lifetime. Jesse and Celine are forever together no matter what continent they live on. Before Sunrise is the time they have together until their departure. One day can fill up a lifetime of memories. Are you willing to try?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simple romance at its best...not overdone at all!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's amazing how very few movies get it JUST RIGHT. This is a film which is completely dialogue driven, with not much movement at all.Jesse(Hawke) is an American who comes to Europe for a couple of days. He comes across Celine(Delpy) on a train to Vienna. She is supposed to get off at Paris but their chance meeting leads to the formation of a natural connection and conversation begins. Listening to them talk is the only thing you have to do in order to feel their chemistry. Trust me, it's done in such a casual and realistic manner, you actually begin to relate to their characters. Jesse asks her to get down at Vienna for the short time(around 24 hours think) he will be there before he catches his flight to America, so they can spend some time together and get to know each other better. Then that's how it all starts. They walk the beautiful streets of the town and talk, listen and understand each other. Their feelings are not rushed or exaggerated. Director Linklater has done a great job with portraying the two strangers, the gradual growth of feelings for each other, and their simple yet intellectual conversations. I liked the main characters a lot. Simply because they were ordinary people. (Celine looked really pretty, even with the messy hair, hehe.) This is definitely a great romance movie. The amount of dialogue shouldn't bore you, it's the very essence of the film. =)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can a movie which is entirely made up of a romantic dialog be interesting? Like you would never believe. This is how we depict our true love to be. The dialog is so real between the couple, it is as unhollywoodish as it gets. At the end of the movie I felt like I actually knew the two, their character weaknesses and strengths, their hopes and dreams, hell even their political agenda. I have never in another movie seen the depth of character shown in this one. Every facial expression dead on, every glimpse an Oscar performance. The scene in the music shop when they listen to the record, and look at each other, never catching one another's eye, unforgettable. The people they encounter (the hand reading woman, the poet beggar) just add to the flare and honesty of the movie. The directing is spotless, the cinematography brilliant, and yet, I would enjoy this movie even if I listened to it on the radio.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A night every guy dreams about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has to be seen to be believed. It is simply the most romantic movie ever made. Because it does not impose a tragic incident to enhance its romantic theme it puts An Affair to Remember to shame. I don't believe any guy wouldn't wish for a night like the one in this Flin. The characters, Jesse and Celine, are so real it's unnerving. This is a must see movie for anyone who still believes in romantic love. In contrast to most viewers who prefer the sequel Before Sunset to Before Sunrise, I prefer Before Sunrise for its hopeful dialogue, its beautiful scenery of Vienna, its great music, its enchanting episodes, and the youthful innocence of Celine and Jesse before life's realities set in in the years that follow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must-see movie about two people finding each other</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie I make people see. I ask them if they have, and if their answer is no, they have by the end of that day. I think Richard Linklater is a genius. To make a film that is basically just two characters exchanging dialogue and to make it work is fantastic. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy star as the main characters, Jesse and Celine and I think they both give outstanding performances. Their characters meet on a train and enjoy their conversation so much, they can't help but take a risk and get off the train together. They spend a day together in Vienna and within a day two strangers become forever linked. The movie ends on an ambiguous note. You're not sure as a viewer if they really "end up" together because Celine gets on her train. But, it's one of those movies that make you more hopeful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Believable and captivating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Admittedly I'm not a big sucker for romantic movies. However, as I recently became familiar with the works of Linklater through the mesmerizing rotoscope-animations of "Waking Life" and the film adaption of Philip K. Dick's "A Scanner Darkly", the first in which the main-characters of this piece appear, I decided to give "Before Sunrise" a shot.First and most importantly should be said, that this movie effortlessly manages to dodge every cliché-filled pitfall of your typical, superficial Hollywood-love-fest. As with most of Linklater's work, this movie is extremely driven by it's dialogue, here to the point where you, on few occasions, almost find it to much. Fortunately, Linklater has a rare ability to write characters and dialogue with an unusual feel of honesty and depth, which is really what keeps this movie as captivating as it is.And this is where "Before Sunrise" truly separates itself from all it's pretentious, dreamworld love-flick-imitators. Because, as the common love-flick tends to focus on a ridiculous plot, a highly unrealistic yet still very predictable storyline, all usually disguised well in silly humor and poor acting, which never really seems to try and connect with it's viewer on anything but a hollow, dream-world level. "Before Sunset" steers clear of all that, by simply telling a story of two people connecting, and delivered in a way that enables most viewers to reflect their own experiences in the story. Granted, the romance unfolding in this picture is of the rare kind, but every piece of it is believable and never attempts to be more than it is.Combined with some fine and credible performances by the two main characters and a director who almost constantly manages to balance the story and the atmosphere just right, so it never ever gets mushy or uninteresting, this is definitely one romance-movie that is worth the watch. It is not packed with big allusive incidents, nor does it pretend to preach any real deeper meanings, but it does provide a compelling story of two people connecting, and does so in a way that most people will be able to relate to on an emotional level, and be able to appreciate on an intellectual one for the very well-written story, dialogue and directing.Hopefully the sequel which is next on the list will be as rewarding.</fullReview>

By lots of conversation, two rulers show their sincerity each other with their pure emotion and feelings. Once upon a time, when the DVDs were published, at the very moment I go to bookshop to purchase one in order to save the value of love. Every time when i am free, I watch Before Sunrise for several times, learn how the way they do, and talk. Never will I ignore such a romantic film in my whole life, and it is worth buying and keeping it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was denied the brevity that might have sustained my wit. Summary: Remember "Brief Encounter"? English, black and white, maybe wartime, upper-class Leslie Howard + contemporary female icon? Strangers meet on a train and spend a day in each others company, maybe fall in love, but then do the decent thing = say goodbye? Well "Before Sunrise" is nothing like that at all, except in the most superficial details. It has a magic which, on the first 100 viewings, defies summary. It reminded me of so much. It might be capable of reminding all humans of their humanity.Evan Hawke and Julie Delpy should have resigned from movies after making this wonderful film - appearing in anything else must have felt like a betrayal. Still, I'm glad they did "Before Sunset" - which I'm still trying to get hold of - although I don't know if I'm ready for it yet. Am I ready for it yet? Gibbo-9</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought provoking conversations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a slow moving story. No action. No crazy suspense. No abrupt surprises. If you cannot stand to see a movie about two people just talking and walking, about a story that develops slowly till the very end and about lovey-dovey romance, don't waste your time and money. On the other hand, if you're into dialog, masterful story telling, thought provoking ideas and finding true love in the fabric of life then this is your movie. I recommend you watch this movie when you are most alert, though, because the pace, the music and the overall tone of the movie can put you in a woolgathering mood. It's truly fantastic. I really mean that.Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are annoying with their mannerisms at times but, thankfully, the chemistry between the two makes the acting very natural, warm and tender. They act and feel each other out from the very beginning, making you feel as an intruder.In their conversations there are excellent commentaries on many subjects that will provoke thought and conversation between you and your partner. I thought it was too deep and too diverse for such young characters but I may be underestimating their intelligence. Still it did not ruin the movie.The overall story is very simple which I think gives the movie it's charm and ultimately it's power.BOTTOM LINE: The movie's flow is slow. The dialog is fascinating. The story builds gently, systematically and substantive. The build up to the finale is satisfying and in the end rewarding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dreamy stroll through the urban landscapes of Vienna, and a well told classical romantic rendezvous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I managed to catch a late night double feature last night of "Before Sunrise" (1995) and "Before Sunset" (2004), and saw both films in a row, without really having the chance to catch my breath in between or ponder on the meaning of each film separately. After sleeping it over, I have to say that I largely prefer the former over the latter, and I shall explain why.Before Sunrise introduces us with then young actors, Ethan Hawke (Reality Bites, Dead Poets Society), only 25 at the time of the film's release; and Julie Delpy (the Three Colors trilogy), then 26 (although looking much younger). He is a promiscuous American writer, touring Europe after breaking up with his girlfriend; She is a young French student, on her way home to Paris. They meet on the Budapest-Vienna train and spontaneously decide to get off the train together. The two deeply spiritual and intellectual individuals than spend a whole night together walking the beautifully captured streets of Vienna, exchanging ideals and thoughts and gradually falling on love.The film has 1990's written all over it: back then, technology was leaping rapidly, the new millennium with all it's hopes and dreams was waiting just around the corner, and young adults like the ones depicted in the film were filled with love of life and passion for the future. The characters of Jesse (Hawke) and Celine (Delpy), with all their flaws and inconsistencies (Celine's accent, if by mistake or on purpose, was half American-half French, and it swinged from one spectrum to the other, breaking the character's credibility), were a mirror of the time. Watching the naive couple swallow life with such meaning and excitement, acting all clichéd and romantic yet managing to have the audience fall for them as well, is what really made this movie work for me. The fact that the director doesn't let you know if their relationship continues after the film or not makes it all even more worth while.All in all, Sunrise is a dreamy stroll through the urban landscapes of Vienna, a well told classical romantic rendezvous, and a film I will definitely return to for further insight sometime in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My watch came a little too late but am glad i watched both this and the sequel together...which makes me compliment the makers of this flick for giving such a pure and basic treatment to the idea of romanticism... and very marginally separating it from the idea of relationships! As a lot has been written about the movie already, it would just be appropriate to highlight few portions of the movie which i personally loved.I think the point where Jesse and Celine make phony phone calls to their respective friends was a very shrewd way of telling each other what they had meant to each other through a journey not even extending 24 hrs... the curiosity of two people who both think the other has made an infallible impact on the other has been very smartly dealt with...On the plot front , making a romantic story work on pure conversation is not an easy job to accomplish..I believe in romantic flicks of such flavor , the characters are not clearly designed even in the writer's and director's mind. What the actors bring out is what becomes of them .. right or wrong even the idea bearers would find it difficult to justify... to become the character, the life the actor gives has to go beyond instructions and the story...here both the actors do just the RIGHT job! Kudos..!!!and Before sunset is another feather which makes this one even more beautiful!</fullReview>

Although they met the first time, they talked like good friends. When the train stopped at Vienna, Jesse begged Celine to accompany him to have a tour on Vienna. Then the romantic story unfolded.At first they were cautious. The funniest scene was their listening to CD in music store. They peeked at each other, though their eyes did not contact. After in-depth conversation, they relationship became close. Then I saw the most romantic scene that they pretended to call their respective friend. Their deep love for each other was expressed completely by words.Love is a strange thing. When you really want it, it will not come as you wished. Love needs mutual understanding. Without it, love will not last long. Spiritual harmony is the most important for love.Excellent screenplay and performance resulted in huge success of the movie.One of the best romance movies. 9/10</fullReview>

I was not actually enchanted about this kind of script, since it continued to make me believe that it is just a movie. Still, I watched it! And I was amazed..."Before Sunrise" is one of the few films who dare to talk in a rather philosophical way, wondering about the fact that in the moment of our birth, we are sentenced to death, or that it is a middling idea that fact that a couple should rest together for eternity, or that, we, humans, can afford sometimes to live in fairy-tales. The ending was wonderfully chosen (we do not know if they will meet again in six months, at six o'clock, in Vienna's station) -in our optimism, we sincerely hope so.

		<shortDescription>Even Better after a Great Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bought the DVD of Before Sunset and saw it for the first time a week ago. Having saw it twice, I couldn't help but missing Before Sunrise, not because the sequel was not as great, but I felt that these two movies completed each other like no other sequels ever did, every time I finished watching one of them, I feel the need and yearning to see the other. So, I ended up spending the weeks watching both of them repeatedly, I will be quite embarrassed to mention how many times exactly. The most remarkable thing about Before Sunrise is how you feel the development of the feelings of their characters towards each other. It sounds so simple, the growing of the chemistry, I think other romantic films might think that they succeed to track the development, but to me - who doesn't believe in Nora Ephron - Before Sunrise is the first film to really gives the viewers chance to feel it. When I saw it for the first time, about 8 year ago when I was 20, I already liked it. But, I didn't rate it as a "great film", it still seemed to me like another thinking persons' feel good movie, Linklater was too smart to make it more realistic, it was 10 minutes too long, the characters was too well fabricated, I thought I liked it because it was like a dream and because I enjoyed their conversations, etc. etc.. But now, thanks to Before Sunset, I feel that's more to Before Sunrise than what I felt for it before. I saw the elements more clearly: Jesse, Celine, Vienna, their conversations, everything. How each of them are separated element by itself, and they have a chance to mix, the story is just a frame of time, I am no longer feel manipulated. And the freedom that every scene has, as well as its refusal to be overly efficient, how blind I was that those qualities didn't strike me as exceptional when I first saw it! Now, 8 year have passed, the more movies I've seen, the more I realize that many movies are just collections of ordered scenes that only exist for the sake of its ending, even movies like Pulp Fiction or Linklaters's own Slackers included. The Jesse and Celine tale avoid that, maybe Before Sunset is a better example in this case, but Before Sunrise is also one of few films that its ending is just a consequence of time, not a destination, every single scene has its own life. I don't know whether Linklater or anyone else had a sequel in mind when they made Before Sunrise, but to me, one of the most amazing things about these sequels are how these two films visually contrast each other. Before Sunrise which I think employs more static angels and brighter color schemes, seems to try to capture the smallest atoms of liveliness surrounding Jesse and Celine, the world is always full of hope whether or not the characters feel it. Meanwhile, I enter the vision of boredom as Jesse stuck talking to the journalists in Before Sunset, and Celine's first smile from behind the shelves are the most heartbreaking smile I've seen in a beginning of a film, and the many moving shots after that takes me to a place I don't know with a sadness in me, no matter how beautiful Paris is, and no matter how happy I am that they meet again. I'm sorry that I go on this long with my limited English, Before Sunrise is already an extraordinary film without me pouring my scattered thoughts, and it gets even better with an equally great sequel following it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Romantic Movie I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not usually a fan of strictly romantic movies but heard this was good. I was stunned. Easily the most romantic thing I've ever seen in my life. Stunning. Brilliant, sweet, funny and full of heart. The chemistry is flawless as is the writing and directing.Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy are so natural and sweet together you really think they're a couple. The movies grabs you right away and doesn't let go. You can't look away nor can you stop listening to them. Even the little moments just melt your heart. This has jumped into the ranks of one of my favourite ever. A masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amazing movie that, in theory, should be boring but is delivered with subtlety and incredible acting that I have long despaired of ever finding. Instead of relying on clichés and overly dramatized moments the plot unfolds through a series of incredibly realistic moments. The lead characters are not perfect, and so relating to them as people you could know is easy. The movie is not trying to pull laughs, or push an ideal onto the audience but simply showing us the possibility of true love in any circumstance. I am now restless waiting for the weekend so I can see the sequel. A moving, thought provoking, funny look at love that I think should be an absolute romantic classic up there with Casablanca and Breakfast at Tiffany's. Will soften even the hardiest heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen "Before Sunrise" but I viewed "Before Sunset" and thought it was brilliant.It starts with Jesse (Ethan Hawke) who has successfully published a book detailing his one night with Celine (Julie Delpy) and well, she is in Paris and comes to see him.They end up walking the beautiful streets of Paris 9 years after they were supposed to meet to a charming café where they discuss all that has taken place since their last encounter. One is now married with a child one is dating but both are unhappy as memories of their one night keep either of them from successfully pursuing happiness with anyone else.Their dialog is enchanting, honest and brilliant and you can imagine saying exactly what they are saying to one another if you were in their shoes.Their interaction with one another is so natural and unrehearsed and you feel as though you are part of their very intimate conversation. The ending leaves you wondering if Jesse caught his flight back to New York or not but that is the beauty of it, you get to draw your own conclusions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>S10 Reviews: Before Sunrise (1995)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jesse and Celine (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy) are two strangers on a European train. The two come from widely different backgrounds, he's American and she's French, after they talk a bit on the train Jesse manages to get Celine to get off the train and explore Vienna with him. During the next several hours the two wander Vienna taking in all that the city has to offer and become madly infatuated with each other. But will this newfound relationship last past sunrise.This wonderful romantic-comedy is a breath of fresh air to a genre that has been in decline. Written and directed by Richard (Dazed and Confused) Linklater, "Before Sunrise" never bores because of its' small cast. In fact it flourishes due to the leads that make you love their characters and have a wonderful charisma between the two. Smart dialogue makes this a must for romance fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even though you cannot say it's love, the firm is a love story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like it because of my recent personal experience. Especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finite. The characters in the firm did not really enjoy their "real" lives, but they did enjoy themselves, i.e. what they were. The movie did a good job making this simple day a good memory. A good memory includes not only romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful European city, but definitely about the deeper discussion about their values of life. Many movies are like this in terms of discussion of the definitions of life or love or relationships or current problems in life or some sort of those. Before Sunrise dealt with it in a nice way, which makes the viewer pause and think and adjust her breath and go on watching the film. Before Sunrise did not try to instill a specific thought into your head. It just encouraged you to think about some issues in daily life and gave you some alternative possibilities. This made the conversations between the characters interesting, not just typical whining complaints or flowing dumb ideas. You would be still thinking about those issues for yourself and curious about the next line of the story. The end was not quite important after all. You could got something out of it and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie. Movies are supposed to be enjoyable. This is an enjoyable movie and worth of your time to watch it. I am on a journey too. The movie somehow represented some part of me and answered some of my questions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We start off with a great shot of what reminded me of a waterfall, a blurry torrent of color, which metamorphoses into moving train-tracks seen from above. This opening shot already had me hooked. On the train, Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke, the best screen couple that I have seen, meet by chance, and a fantastic, intelligent and also very sad love story evolves.What I love about this film is that it does not try to be Hollywood style in its dealing with love. There are no dumb subplots going on, no comic relief - a welcome relief from the mass of romantic comedies being pumped out these days - and no Hollywood ending. The story is stripped bare, and in its simplicity is uncannily real. This stark, real-life story is brilliantly portrayed by hugely long scenes done on just one shot - I don't want to think how many takes some must have taken. The plot is basically that an American boy meets a French girl on a train, they talk, get off together, talk a lot more, and fall in love. I won't even try to summarize it more than that: the plot is not important in this film. The dialog and the characters are what it focuses on. The actors portray them beautifully with some really sweet scenes, and the dialog is stunning. All in all, I was blown away when I saw this film. It put me in a very reflective mood, and left me stunned by its frank and realistic approach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slacker for romantics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Sunrise is a quiet gem from Richard Linklater, the director of such quirky, era-defining films such as Slacker and Dazed and Confused. His film could be described as a post-slacker romance with heart as two twenty-somethings meet on a train headed for Vienna, and develop an instant attraction and rapport, so much so that both decide to spend the next day together in Vienna until sunrise marks their departure. French actress Julie Delpy, best known for her contribution to Three Colours White, plays Celine, a Sorbonne student; while Ethan Hawke plays Jesse, an American who has just split with his girlfriend in Spain and decides to euro-rail his way back to some sense of normality. What follows is a delightful use of off-the-wall dialog and picturesque locations, but rather than show us the tourist Vienna, Linklater opts for less-likely haunts: an eerie cemetery for unknown people; small side streets; slightly seedy bars. Along the way both meet a a variety of Slacker-like types, from a theatrical duo with a wry sense of humor to a Viennese poet-in-demand. Such exchanges feel like Linklater's insistence on brining the arbitrary exchanges of Slacker to his first romantic feature and although the scenes have an eccentric edge, some feel forced and contrived as if Linklater was too fond of Slacker to let its influence wane in this work.The performance of both leads is excellent. Delpy has a natural presence in front of the camera and has iconic looks to grace many a cineaste critique in year's to come; while Hawke plays against type as the sensitive, poetic American so alien to the teen trash peddled by Hollywood. The film demands the viewer's patience at times but the journey is well worth the ticket price. This is probably one of the most engaging romances in recent times ad one which paved the way for the equally brilliant sequel, Before Sunset.</fullReview>

Not many like this out there. My only complaint was that they didnt show enough of Vienna. Then again, that probably added to the realism of the picture.

		<fullReview>If you ever look at someone acting, ask yourself the question if the character is real enough to meet in true life. This is something you rarely see in a movie and this movie is one of those rare occasions. The characters draw you in; sometimes wishing you could join their conversations. This also because the writers and director give the actors the chance to portray the moods of the situations (which is something you also rarely see) So this movie is not about dolly shots, love at first site or "Oeh, I did not expect that ending!" but it is about human honesty. All in all, a perfect example how a good movie can be made without the standard hollywood necessity to add commercially viable elements. Great work!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie only once when I was a first-year student. It was shown on a local TV and I started watching it not from the very begin so I didn't know the title. The movie made me feel how romantic life can be and that you can meet your destiny any place and any time and have to be ready for that. It is a great story about a guy and a girl who meet each other in a train by chance, fall in love and leave the train in Venice for a night together. The final of the movie is sad (they departed in the morning 'cause both had to go on their own way) but without it the movie would be too sweet and unreal. Since that year (1995) I've been looking for this video without even knowing it's title. Due to this fantastic site I found out what the title is by "plot search" but still can't find it at the video shops. Hope I will some day...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very boring in some places, a little corny in others, and sort of awkward in yet other parts. But overall, this movie charmed the very essence of the romance genre to a whole level. Although the entire movie is one long, drawn-out conversation, it cites philosophical and universally deep material that makes the viewer question his/her own relationships and pursuits. From beginning to end, this film attempts and succeeds admirably in capturing the timeless ritual of fundamental human interaction and courtship. Decent acting, amazing scenery, and an illustrious script all cooperate to make this movie a revitalizing breath of fresh air to romance watchers tired of stale, overused plots and predictable characters and stories. From its mundane beginning to its unique and worthwhile ending, Before Sunrise will have its loyal viewers aching for more, and its disappointed viewers at least thinking, in the back of their minds, about the meanings of their own lives.</fullReview>

They talk about such mundane things which suddenly seems to make sense.I think everyone goes through the cycle of emotions just like Celine and Jesse.Well, for anyone about to fall in love or anyone who has fallen in love or anyone just looking to rekindle the romance in their life , this is just the movie you may want to watch with your loved one on a rainy,cozy Sunday afternoon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: (DVD) Before Sunrise (1995)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Parting is such sweet sorrow. I think it's always heartbreaking to say the least, when you have to part ways with someone whom you feel an immense connection with. Be it after a single date of the evening, and definitely when the separation is going to be longer. And Richard Linklater has encapsulated this feeling in Before Sunrise perfectly.11 years is a long time, and that's exactly how old this movie is, but it never felt dated as I watched it for the very first time today. I too have heard about the premise, and wondered whether it would be possible to try and do what they did. No such luck :P But romanticism doesn't die, and I think I'm still holding on to that sliver of hope to be swept and sweep someone off their feet in the same manner, under mutually attractive circumstances, exploring a new city without any plan whatsoever on what will happen. Junk plans, order, and processes, and just welcome and embrace the unknown, together with a special someone.It's all about moments, and the seizing of chances as they come along. This movie is dialogue laden, but it doesn't bore. The characters discuss a vast range of topics, from their fears, family, their past relationships, and of course, love. They flirt with each other through an overnight stay in Vienna, Austria, all the while conscious that their impromptu and spontaneous decision to join each other in a night about town, will have to end come the next morning, with each going about their separate ways. It's easy to exploit the film and turn it into a "Visit Austria" commercial, and I'm glad that it didn't. Rather, having it serve as a backdrop to an intense, short relationship worked wonders both ways. The performances by Ethan Hawke (as the American Jesse) and Julie Delpjy (as French student Celine) are top notch, and would have you believe right away that these are two lovebirds falling in love with each other in the early stages of their relationship. I believed.However, despite the upbeat premise about love, the movie somehow had this sense of gloom hanging over it, and it is uncomfortable, though the feeling's made lighter by the lovers having great conversation, and having a great time hanging out. They don't skirt unhappy issues either, as past relationships which didn't worked were discussed, and that too struck a chord within me, especially Jesse's recollection of what happened just before he boarded the train, the bit about how little others have thought about you. Definite ouch in my direction.There are many beautiful moments in the movie, but my absolute love is the one where the couple enters a listening booth to sample a vinyl. Everything there is to say about love, just happened to be captured so succinctly. Despite being a talkie movie, there is totally no need for any dialogue. The stealing of glances of each other, is done to perfection, it just brings back any memories you have of yourself stealing glances at your other half. Everything about this scene is perfect, and I can rave about it till the cows come home. Simply amazing, and you have to see it to believe! This scene alone will justify watching the movie!This movie is so damn good, I just wanna watch it again, before I pop the sequel into the DVD player. Watch this! And it goes into my list of all time favourites!Warner Bros Code 3 DVD contains no extras, save for the theatrical trailer. Which is kind of disappointing. Visual and audio transfers are great though, with 4 different subtitles to choose from, and scene selection features.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a movie about innocence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS THROUGH: I'll join the large amount of fans of this film in commenting how outstanding it was. I had heard about this movie for so long. Although I've yet to see the second part, I loved this movie and thought it was an extremely well done, thoughtful film. The characters of Jesse and Celine were developed beautifully and the whole movie had a sweetness about it in general. It's a beautiful film and one that any major film buff should see.One might not imagine that two people walking around just having random conversations about..well..everything, could be all that interesting. But it is. This movie struck Me as being about innocence. That and connection. It sometimes seems that the older one gets the more difficult it is to really connect in the way one can when their young. This movie really brings home how great it is to just meet someone who gets and understands you immediately. It's about the mental click where so many movies are concentrated on the physical click. It develops the relationship flawlessly and gets you involved in the characters' lives.It also may make one reminiscent for times gone by. Connections like the one Jesse and Celine share, that almost effortless click, are few and far between and when they do come, they are precious. It's good to see a movie that's light on dramatics and special effects but deep on introspection and dialog. It's a very lovely film and one that really shouldn't be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Small True moments make this movie an instant classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I think about it I realized one day that I never once questioned whether or not the events in "Before Sunrise" were truly as believable as they make it out to be. Then I also realized right after that I didn't care, and if any movie could make me believe in that kind of moment and love its this one.What makes this movie so great are the small detailed true-to-life-moments that other movies don't even think to pay attention to which is their unfortunate downfall. One of my all time favorite images from the movie has to be in the bus when Jesse has to do everything he can from fully reaching out and touching a stray lock of Celine's hair. Another is in the elevator when each looks at one another and then looks away once eye contact is made. Or when they tentatively kiss for the first time which is touching.Moments like these are often never seen because the common romantic movie overlooks them when if they were truly smart they would realize that the cornerstone of any great romantic movie should be moments like these. Chemistry too is something most of these movies never seem to really achieve, but which this movie does without trying.The love in this movie is real. You never once question whether or not their love is real because your ready to believe it halfway through the movie even before they fully realize it. No grand gestures of love, or sickening melodramatic moments that make you roll your eyes and groan. The simplicity in this love is the truth of what love is. Fully accepting the person and really making a connection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A romantic movie for the thinking man and woman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hadn't heard of "Before Sunrise", until the sequel "Before Sunset" was released. Because there was quite some hype around the sequel and the first one was broad-casted a few days later, I gave it a try. At first I wasn't too convinced about this movie's quality, but I kept watching it anyway and gradually I started to like it more and more. I guess this is the kind of movie that you have to see a couple of times before you can like it at its fullest."Before Sunrise" tells the story of a French graduate student named Celine (Julie Delpy) who meets a young American named Jesse (Ethan Hawke) on the Budapest-Vienna train. She is returning to Paris and he's making a trip through Europe. But instead of continuing their trip on their own, they decide to get of the train in Vienna, where they will spend the entire day and night together. During their stay of 14 hours, they get to know the city and each other, but when the night ends and another day begins, they have to say goodbye to each other, not knowing if they will ever meet again...This isn't yet another romantic movie based on the all too known concept of boy meets girl, boy and girl have a fight, boy and girl realize they love each other too much and live happily ever after. I guess you could call this a romantic movie for the thinking man and woman. This isn't just a corny flick, but a very intelligent and beautiful movie that will offer you the chance to really get to know its characters in a profound way.Overall this is a romantic movie with a well written story, interesting characters and of course a beautiful city as a setting. What more could you possibly expect? Not much, and that's why I give this movie at least a 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best "cinema" of 1995</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of 350 films that I had managed to see that year, "Before Sunrise" caught my attention, imagination and passion for the true cinematic art. It rose above the other entries of the year to stand out as my number one pick of 1995.The thought of finding oneself in a foreign country and discovering the country with a beautiful stranger is a fantasy I think many people can relate to and wish upon themselves. The exotic location of Vienna is a perfect setting for the adventures of two university students meeting up during the last days of their summer vacation. Their discovery of each other is matched beautifully with the sights and scenes of the city, getting wonderful vistas as the couple walks around discovering tings about themselves, each other, and the world that they have been born into.Obviously what makes this film work is the chemistry between the actors. Them seem genuinely interested in each other and throughout the film you want to learn more about them and hope that there is some foreshadowing of what might happen to them in the coming years. But, until 2004, all you had was the 105 mins of them together, walking and talking through the streets. Some might consider this to be a boring way to spend their time, but I think being within the age group of the actors I could relate to many of their conversations and ideals. SO very few films these days are dialogue driven so this was a very refreshing treat indeed.I have seen this film about 5 times and it was like rediscovering it each time. Only the last time did it seem to lose a bit of it's mystery when I knew that it's sequel "Before Sunset" was being released this summer. And as you may have already guessed it's sequel is currently in the running for my favorite picture of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love small movies in perfect plausible settings. I love believable romances. My favorite feel-good movies are "Running on Empty," "Ruby in Paradise," and now "Before Sunrise," which I just discovered, in time to watch it before seeing its 2004 sequel, "Before Sunset." Although now 9 years old, "Before Sunrise" still feels timely and brand new. All the essential elements came together: wonderful natural writing (the hardest kind to do), perfect casting, superb direction and performances, lovely photography, great use of unconventional locations in and around Vienna. This movie has little action, no violence, no explicit sex, no special effects, minimal supporting cast (just the two principal characters), and the whole story spans less than a day. This only goes to show how much 'stuff' is not needed for making a great movie, as long as the essential elements are all present. And no amount of 'stuff' can compensate if any of those elements are missing. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Love Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why on Earth didn't someone tell me Linklater created what may possibly be the greatest love story ever filmed?I started seeing rave reviews of Before Sunset. So I thought it might be prudent to see Before Sunrise. Having just watched it, I'm uncertain how it is that the vast majority of reviewers believe Before Sunset tops Before Sunrise. I hope that when I venture into a theatre in the next few days, I'll be pleasantly surprised.Before Sunrise is, as I'm sure the "plot summary" tells you, the story of a Parisian and an American wandering around Vienna. Of course, the backdrop is wonderful. Vienna is a beautiful city. I loved it in The Third Man, and I love it here. Including what appears to be the very same ferris wheel.But what is fascinating about Before Sunrise is the riveting dialogue. Rather than the typical one-liners or silence, Linklater follows the lead of his earlier self (see, e.g., Slacker) and comes up with some very listenable words. While Waking Life tops Sunrise on philosophical depth by a slim margin, Sunrise follows our leads closely, which makes for somehow more impactful audio. These characters are more real than most I've seen in most films. Especially romances, which tend strongly toward cliches and other assorted love songs, already documented. Before Sunrise develops our leads into humans. Not an unheard of feat, but unusual. But then it develops our leads into humans with insight. Very unusual.Magical, beautiful, insightful into the human condition, and entertaining. 10/10. On par with Amelie. Rent it now. [Update on Before Sunset soon.]</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie on release and fell in love with it. It's a film with a lot of talking (but then, so are Tarantino's) yet never feels 'talky'. It's heartbreaking, though ultimately - because we have been party to a compassionate work of art - uplifting. Delpy &amp; Hawke are perfect, and all in all this is a small, all too easily overlooked, gem. (Incidentally, I remember that Barry Norman, in his round-up of Best Of films for its year, completely ignored it - as he did that other modest pearl, Bagdad Cafe - which prompts me to wonder when British TV is going to get a film programme worthy of the name. Jonathan Ross? Huh! A better-dressed BN.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Before Sunrise": the progenitor of Delpy's rise to mainstream stardom ... maybe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the movie again yesterday, on VHS, and in full-screen. It was my third or fourth viewing, all on VHS. I didn't know of the movie's existence when it was in the movie houses in the mid-'90s, and I was ignorant of Ms. Delpy until I saw her in "An American Werewolf in Paris" in 1998. Like another poster, my last girlfriend somewhat/somehow resembled Ms. Delpy, and in the wake of that cataclysm, out of a veiled curiosity I began buying Julie's movies on "eBay". WOW! Not only was (is) she stunningly beautiful (and that sweet French-accented voice ... mon Dieu!), but she exuded a true depth of talent in the portrayal of her characters. Since "Before Sunrise" has now begotten "Before Sunset", my belief is that JD will now be looked at seriously for more parts in Hollywood, and perhaps a shot at a break-through major role. Still, I want her to continue to pick and choose her venues, her roles and her characters wisely. Bon chance, Julie! My fear is that in the current national (American) state of anti-French sentiment, her origin and accent might be seen as poison to casting agents and producers. In my heart, I hope that this is not so, but who knows? Anyway, think of what France has given to us: the Statue of Liberty, the croissant and Julie Delpy! Oh yeah, and the Reneault, that's true.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will admit that this film has no real focus except for the two main characters to travel around Europe and discuss whatever comes to mind. But I'll tell you that I really liked this film and enjoyed the performances from the two leads. You know for some peoples' lives reality doesn't have a plot thread. Why can't a movie follow people around and watch two total strangers fall in love. Sure, at first, they were attracted to each other. Yet, they soon find out how much they enjoy spending time together and throwing caution to the wind and simply just waste time with beautiful locales as their backdrop. I have always liked Ethan Hawke and think he's a joy to watch here. The conversation is interesting and broad. Yes the film meanders, but this isn't full of explosions or violence. It is simply a film about two young adults getting to know each other.</fullReview>

If you haven't seen the film it is worthwhile just to hear this line. I've even used it myself, though it didn't quite work as well as it did in the movie.

Just like the first time, I felt such a delight and I wondered if anyone else felt the same way (because we are used to watch over media exposed and overrated and often pretentious Hollywood movies - O.K it is not that I don't like watching many of them). That's why I for the first time started to read user comments and for this film only. I was surprised how many people from over the Globe share the same or similar feeling and insight about it. But, now, it seems to me so normal. The beauty is in simplicity. This is the most beautiful romance movie ever, because there is nothing too much but everything enough. That everything is just that pure first emotion of newborn love, it's blossom and acknowledgement that it must end soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect little gem of a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had never heard of this film until I went to a review site and it was on my favorite online critic's top 20 films of the decade. About a week later I watched it and it surpassed all my expectations. It is a genuine depiction of love and emotion. It's also a film that shows us how fun it is to listen to conversation as long as it's interesting. The premise may sound boring and dull, and maybe it is, but the set up and execution are flawless.The acting is perfect. Ethan Hawke gives his greatest performance ever, and Julie Deply is exceptional. They both capture the essence of their characters so vividly that you start to believe their feelings from their first spoken word.Richard Linklater is the king at making movies that are set over the course of one day. This is a big step forward for him as a writer.The film is one of the best romantic comedies ever. It makes you feel good about love, life, and the future. It doesn't resort to sentimentality or cliched lines to fix your emotions. All it does is allow you to observe, absorb, and feel.The film is nothing short of brilliant. It is so simple, because, believe or not life is. This is a perfect little film, and I hope it gets more recognition as the years go by.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not many films like this exist, which is a pity. The simplicity of this film greatly enhances the beauty of the background surroundings, which incidently are based in Vienna, Austria. The film has hardly any background music, no special effects, but Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have acted so well, that the film doesn't need any. It is a pity that films like these hardly do well at the box office. This is a very romantic film and romantics will really like it. It leaves a very big impression on you. I kept thinking about it long after it had finished. I saw it late at night, and this film was just starting and I started watching and finally slept at about 8am because i couldnt sleep till it finished.The ending is very sad, and its probably the ending that leaves such an impression in your heart.The simplicity of true love, which is the most beautiful thing in this world, is very well pronounced in this film. The passion felt for the other, the urge to give, the simplicity of verbal communication, are acted out beautifully.I only say that there should be more beautiful movies like this one. Great Expectations was one, also starring Ethan Hawke, and I think that was simply the best movie ever made(though now I may have to change my opinion to two best movies).But then, as someone has mentioned on this page, if there are too many movies like these, the value of these movies would diminish.This movie has given me an incentive to visit Vienna, one of the few places I haven't visited. I would like to go there at least once.See this movie with an open heart and no disturbances and you will surely like it. See it with an action oriented mind, and you will hate it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is about a short but strong relationship between 2 strangers. The location is unique and spectacular. The actors are amazing, both Hawke and Delpy are absolutely believable. The writing is sooooo damn natural and realistic you forget it's a movie - instead YOU will have a relationship with either Hawke or Delpy (depending on how you're inclined).This movie is a MUST for all hopeless romantics! Although most of it is just these 2 conversing among themselves, that for me was the BEST aspect of this movie. Movies like these show us once again (as many of us have forgotten) the raw power of a beautiful film. By the end you will have been through the relationship yourself and feel the same mixed feelings of contentment, sadness, exhaustion and whatever else the actors are supposed to be feeling. RENT THIS ONE NOW!!! TRUST ME, YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS IT!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Before Sunrise" is not one of my favorite movies because of the beautiful cast,the hopelessly romantic theme, or even the stunning scenery. It goes deeper than that and resonates with me in ways when I least expect it. This movie is intelligent, witty, gorgeous, uncomfortable, real and yet fantastic all at the same time. Some people may get bored with all the dialogue, but to me that is what the greatest movies are about. It's about truth and honesty, people sharing and experiencing together. The conversations between Jesse and Celine are not contrived, and on the contrary are some of the most sincere and refreshing I've ever heard. One of the most poignant scenes is in the record store, where they share the listening booth to hear a record she loves. It is in the beginning of their relationship and Linklater does nothing to disguise the discomfort and awkwardness they both feel. She looks away but enjoys him staring at her, while Jesse's desire just to touch her is almost too much to resist. But he does, as anyone would have done if they were him. That's what makes this movie so powerful. Not that the story is too good to be true but that it's so easy to relate to and yet it makes you feel as if you are experiencing it with them. Linklater pays very close attention to the details, and in doing so he creates a wonderfully layered and vital backdrop. Vienna is not so much gorgeous as it is rich in character. But yet, using old Europe as a backdrop also allows the film to appear timeless and not easy to date. Its characters take on lives of their own, creating substories that you know continue long after the camera has moved on. Everyone from the actors in the play to the poet on the bank to the foreigners in the cafe all give a sense of time and place, that even though Celine and Jesse are living in a moment of stopped time, things are alive and happening around them. Although it almost seems as if it is also happening for them, as their environment is as important as their adventure together. I have seen this movie countless times, and every time I see it I discover something new. I am drawn to these two characters and the vulnerability their share with each other. The stories they tell may seem inconsequential, but they are no more inconsequential to the stories we tell each other, stories that make up a person's life, each explaining in a tiny way why a person is who he or she is. They are of utmost importance, and yet it is these very things that can get brushed aside, seemingly irrelevant. Linklater is extraordinary at capturing this in such a way that this film makes me feel reminiscent of something I'm not sure of. I can be sitting in a dark wooded bar, and the faintest sound of a conversation in a foreign accent can transport me to a scene in this movie, as if I've lived it myself. In a movie that could easily be filled with cliches and uninspired conversation, Linklater has instead created a truly beautiful, intelligent, passionate, and honest love story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie which to me brings out the best and worst in Film Making today. Actually it is truly more of a film than a movie.The best? That movies like this can be made.; The worst? Unfortunately very few people see it and it receives no award recognition. After seeing this movie, who would not say that it was not deserving of Oscar nominations (For Director, Film, Actor and Actress). But I know why: it is too intelligent and too sensitive.I think all of us can relate to Jesse and Celine. I think we all have had a similar experience (maybe not with Vienna as a background) in that we met somebody (not always as a love interest) we liked the person, we talked and then we move on. Our lives are changed just a little by the encounter/relationship and we often wondered what happened to the person.I have recommended this film to many people. For one exception (and even that person re-thought it afterwards and changed their mind)everyone has said WOW and really liked it. Alas, everybody sees the same thing in the ending as me: . But to me, that is what makes the movie so special. Jesse and Celine are changed forever by their time BEFORE SUNRISE but will never meet again. Sad but realistic; sad but true. You can see it in each of their final expressions in the movie. A smile and then they close their eyes; their time together is already becoming a memory.Other than the ending, the scene in which they are in a bar and in which they have a telephone conversation with their friends is one of the most magical scenes I have ever seen in a movie. It was great and gets better each time I view the movie.This is a terrific film. We need more movies like this; but maybe what makes the movie so special is that we have too few movies like this - that is why I enjoy it so much. I read in one review that maybe a sequel would be in the works; I hope not as that would ruin the one thing about BEFORE SUNRISE that sets it apart: that Jesse and Celine will never meet again. And in all honesty, they never do.So, here's to Jesse and Celine; let's hope they both have found happiness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most thoughtful and honest romantic movies I've seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found Before Sunrise by chance when it was first released on video a few years ago. Watching it then, I felt it was a well-written movie and an event that I would one day hope to experience myself. Watching it now as a person in my young/mid twenties, I realize that I've experienced a feeling very similar to this movie: Being independent and actually falling in love.That experience was brief, honest, and fulfilling, leaving an impression on me that I'll always remember. This film generates those same feelings for me, and watching this movie after my own experience, I can only see myself in Jesse's place, living out my own similar situations.This movie is one of the finest, most underappreciated (in my opinion) romantic stories of the '90's. It's a very real movie, and it's an accurate portrayal of what it feels like to meet someone who you just instantly "click" with. No gripping score, no dramatic good-bye only to be "surprise" reunited at the end. Before Sunrise portrays all of its messages with the sincere awkwardness of a beginning relationship, a bit of insightful conversation, and two people with similar views and interests finding each other. Delpy and Hawke don't play stereotypes in this movie. They play people, and that's what makes this film so interesting. The pacing of the film is slow, yet time seems to rush by. These are people you could actually meet. These people could actually be you.When Before Sunrise ends, there's no contrived, cheesy good-bye, it just ends, which is how life works. It leaves the possibilities open, but not in the way that you could see a sequel being made. If anyone has ever felt like this in a relationship, this movie will never ring truer than it does. For those who have yet to find that bit of spontaneous adventure, Before Sunrise is a good guide of what to look for.I can't recommend this movie highly enough. An intelligent, inspiring film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>O.K in a word: The Best! I'm a total movie freak and I have seen, belive me , A LOT of movies! But this movie beats them all! Before Sunrise is everything you can hope from a movie it makes you laugh and it makes you cry and it's a brilliant combination of good script and great actors! The script couldn't be more simple, everyday conversations and jokes that you've already heard! But the way it's made alive, The beautiful nightly Vienna is a perfect place for this movie to be filmed and Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy fit perfectly to their roles as Jesse and Celine! I have seen this movie about ten times and it just gets better every time I see it again! If you haven't seen this movie by now I suggest that you run straight to your local video store and rent it, I guarantee that you'll love it!By the way Ich möchte deine Hand lesen...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>She's SO French, he's SO American</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the music (hey, where can I find that Kath Bloom song, Come Here ?). I loved the scene in the listening box of the music shop where their eyes both searched and avoided each other, and almost but actually never met.And I loved the dialogues. She's SO French ! He's SO American ! Having grown up in France and having spent the last 5 years studying in the US, I realize how their conversation was incredibly real: the right tone, the right attitude, the right topics. You may say that their conversation is lengthy at times, but I think it's exactly how it would be. She dresses and talks and thinks exactly like a French student at the Sorbonne. He looks and thinks and expresses himself exactly like a US college student. I wonder who wrote the script ? I may sound a little over-enthusiastic but there were times when I was so much into the movie that it felt like I was sitting next to them in the train or in a restaurant, overhearing their conversation. And I almost wanted to interrupt them, in order to explain to her what he really means or to tell him what she had in mind. I am so glad to see that other people did also enjoy this movie. I had been wondering if anyone else ever watched this unknown film ... I bumped into it by chance when I turned my cable box on late at night. "The kind of little low-budget movie they would only play at 1 AM", I first thought. Now it's one of my all-time favorites !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was a fellow whose home videos invariably annoyed me. One day I realized why; each time a conversation began -- something beyond "Hi, mom!" and waving -- the tape would cut and the next scene would begin.One begins to wonder -- does this person even LIKE people? Apparently the stuff of real life seems too dull for some, and they need Entertainment; the amperage on that entertainment has to keep going up and up, also, because we develop immunity toward all of our fixes. Thus, we wind up with ARMAGEDDON, GODZILLA, et al, or soap opera hysterics; everything pushing the envelope just so we can feel a little (and recognize a movie's cues to us).I thought BEFORE SUNRISE was great not as a reaction against that, but because it's so obvious Linklater and his actors give a hoot about human beings. Yes, some of the dialogue -- which is very, very sharply observed -- is silly and pretentious; these are kids who want to impress each other, like each other, and enjoy "deep thoughts." It reminded me so much of college: that thrill of ideas, possibilities, yearnings.The movie looks beautiful and is terribly romantic. Thank God Linklater is savvy enough to play out some conversations in long takes; a cumulative effect and rapport is built between Delpy and Hawke, their pinball game, and us. They're both movie-star beautiful, but for a while, they're just regular folk.Kubrick and Hitchcock may be better directors than say, Linklater or Levinson, but their cold formalism does make one wonder what grudge they hold against people. The Coens seem to be warming as well -- FARGO and THE BIG LEBOWSKI bespeak a new affection in their clever hearts. But, for my money, give me a director who loves people -- a Sturges, a Lubitsch, and, yes, Linklater -- and their works will shine in a way that some geniuses' never do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>straight romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is the purest form of romance. No comedy or drama, just straight boy-meets-girl. It's entertaining and occasionally quite funny, but it won't work for you unless you are a romantic at heart. The movie is very sweet, has no plot, and is the most gentle picture I can recall at the moment. Nothing even slightly scary happens, and other than a little mild necking, there isn't any sex in it, either. I guess that Ethan Hawke is cute (I'll ask my wife), Julie Delpy is quite beautiful in the movie, and both of the characters are extremely likable.This is a normal Linklater movie, which means that it's about people instead of plot, so if you like his other movies you really should give this one a try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While Breakfast at Tiffany's is my all time favorite movie, this has to be right up there. I really enjoyed it from beginning to end and watch it many times. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy make this believable and enjoyable from start to finish. Ethan gives a good performance as the somewhat pessimistic American and, Julie gives a great performance as the destiny starved French girl going home. They have great conversations and it almost plays like a documentary. I hope everyone one in life can have one night as great as this. Lastly, I think the best thing about this movie is the ending. It is realistic not a Hollywood contrived.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never before has conversation been this interesting! This movie is so realistic that you almost feel like you're eavesdropping... all the little nuances of a beginning relationship are captured, from the nervous glances in the listening booth to the awkward proposal of the first kiss. Never does this wander into cliches, it sticks to its own pace and captures the magic between this couple. I have never felt so personally involved in a movie- when the sun rose I felt like crying. I was screaming, GET ON THE TRAIN JESSE!!! And yet it ends realistically, without fully satisfying the audience with the "yay everything's perfect" ending. However, it's an appropriate ending, and leaves you wishing for a sequel you know will never come. Filmmaking at its best, Linklater deserves a lot of respect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a wonderfully romantic film. It is played so realistically that you feel that it could really happen, if only. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy fill the screen with realism, both of love and the script. What a date flick, and one you would never call a chick flick. I can't believe that love stories like this don't appear that often and we have to put up all the other ones that have relationships that are destined for a happy ending from the outset. Love stories by independent film makers seem to fill that gap created by Hollywood, a filling craved by intelligent audiences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most romantic movies I've ever watched. It's so real to me, the way the two characters, meet, talk, and fell in love with each other. It's very simply and sincere. It's like watching some special moments in time in the life of two people, who may or may not going to meet each other again. Some people say that a movie shouldn't base on dialog, but I think this one is an exception. The realistic dialog and acting really grips my attention and pull me in. I felt like I was watching two people falling in love.I know that people can view this differently. Some may say that it's impossible that such a thing can happen and two people are talking this way. But what I want to say is, this thing can happen and two people can talk this way.The film even reminds of some experience that I had in my real life.For me, the timing of this film is just perfect. The music used is just right and fit in with the mood of the film. The cinematography captures the romantic atmosphere of Vienna. I've got my favorite scenes and I can watch this movie over and over again. It will surely stay in my heart.Thanks to the director for creating such a unique and magnificent piece of work. Never watch anything like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone I've asked has maintained the sequel to Before Sunrise is superior. I disagree. Perhaps they related to Jesse and Celine later in their lives, or maybe they just prefer Paris to Vienna. In baseball, however, when the ball and the runner reach the base at the same time, the tie goes to the runner. In the case of originals and sequels, ceteras para bus, the tie should go to the original: without it, there would be no sequel. The characters, the tone and the structure were developed in Sunrise first. I suppose this is the place where I would review the film, but it seems unfair to divulge any of the lovely secrets embedded in almost each scene, lest the reader hasn't seen the film. You really ought to discover these things on your own. But for what they are ? well-plotted, exceptionally well-written conversations perfectly synthesized by the actors and shot in a glorious cinematic style ? these films are perfect. Frost once wrote that great art came from freedom within the reins. Linklater adheres to this, allowing his premise to guide him. THe result is his films never try to be too much, yet they build tension like no Michael Bay film.</fullReview>

OK, I'm not usually into romance/love stories (aside from Casablanca, Brief Encounter, and Now Voyager -- all right, maybe I *am* into them), but this one is different. You don't feel like you're watching a movie, the dialog rings so true. And the scene where they make their pretend phone calls -- top 10 movie scenes of all time. Next time you watch this movie, watch them watching each other. Their relationship grows so subtly that you don't realize how into each other they are becoming. What is it about trains and lovers and Europe? Linklater found the perfect story and location and actors. What more do you want? Please, give this one a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-done film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an extremely well-done film about an experience everyone has -- or should have -- had in their lives. If you don't find a bit of yourself in either of these two people, you have a cold heart. The dialogue is intelligently written but it's the acting and the delivery of such realistic repartee between two people that makes this movie exceptional. Nothing is forced or stilted, everything true and situationally apropos, from the way they nervously play with the S&amp;P shakers on the train to their discussion about whether or not to have sex. Many touching and poignant moments -- but never overly sentimental or trite.A bit slow in places, but that's its only downside and possibly serves to make it even more realistic, as life does have its slow moments. But if you like character studies about the self-conscious and intricate dances we perform with new relationships, like "Lost in Translation" or "Sideways," you will find this movie extremely rewarding. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm on my way over to Netflix to order "Before Sunset." And if you have never had the bittersweet and life-altering experience of a fleeting romance with a total stranger, get yourself to Vienna. Pronto.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engaging, charming, delightful, and real.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Linklater's film reminds me of a professional sports performance: he makes it look so easy! The sense of ease and delight, the languid pace and rich dialogue are not for everyone. These are largely intellectual charms we are offered as we sit at one remove, voyeurs after all, and watch romantic love spark and catch fire. This is a love story that sets us free to witness a very real world, slightly overwrought, charmingly self-conscious, and entirely engaging. It feels like a real-time record of a first meeting and the non-stop conversation that ensues, the kind every thinking person has enjoyed at some point and remembers with sweet nostalgia. The sex is all in the words, deeply embedded and all the more passionate for the energetic connection between the two main characters. Idealism, youth, and naiveté engage levels of honesty and courage rarely seen on film, expertly rendered by two actors willing to bring more of themselves into the frame. Relax and enjoy - this film will invoke your best memories of youthful idealism and the deep joy of sharing ideas, however briefly, with another person.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best romantic movies ever ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is not much that can be said about this movie that was not said before. Linklater has accomplished the impossible and has landed 2 of his movies (Dazed and Confused and Before Sunrise) in my Top 10 list of favorite movies.This movie is quite frankly one of the most overlooked gems of modern cinema. I am a guy, 32, and have seen this movie at least over a dozen times and has always left me with a teary eye. Julie Delpy is like and angel from heaven that has unsuspectedly landed in Ethan Hawke's life and ours. All the key scenes have been mentioned before, the record shop listening booth (this one had to be improvised, as I don't think this is possible to be pulled of by the most talented of actors), the imaginary phone calls, the kiss on top of the Prater, the talk about having/not having sex. The sadness of the empty spaces without them at the end ...Maybe it has more meaning for me than for others as my ex-girlfriend looked like Delpy somewhat and out last encounter was in an airport under similar circumstances and promises as the ending of the movie, but this is a definite recommendation for anyone that thrives on that great feeling when you have with someone that just invades your soul and you want to spend every waking moment with them. Kudos for Linklater for being able to capture this so faithfully and unpretentiously. A once in a lifetime achievement! One of the best films ever!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "Before sunrise" first time about five years ago in Finnish television. I watched it because it got really good review in a local newspaper. Thanks to reviewer for emphasizing the greatness of this movie - otherwise I may have never seen it."Before sunrise" really stamped its mark into my mind. As I said it has been something like five years now since I first saw it. During the years I forgot most of the films plot but still remembered how strongly it had touched me at one time.About a week ago I found a copy of "Before sunrise" in a shelf in library and lent it. I had tried to find it from video stores few times but hadn't succeed. I watched it three times during the weekend and I have to point out that this film is even greater than I remembered it to be. It's a little story about two quite ordinary people getting to know, like and love each other. It's about two everyday people - you or me, anyone of us - sitting in a train, walking in streets and doing basically nothing exceptional, and still it avoids being banal nor boring in any way. Its strength is in its realism; everything Celine and Jesse do and say is captured to a tape in so natural way. Identifying yourself with the characters is inevitable. Ending is perfect - it makes a watcher to continue the film in his/hers own mind as he/she likes and so the movie keeps one in tight grip long after it has ended. I suppose that experiencing a love bigger than life is a fantasy number 1 for most people and describing that fantasy is what this film does without doing a single mistake.I love "Before sunrise". It hasn't any special effects or unbelievable turns in a plot but it has touched my heart deeper than any other film before (sunrise, sunset or whatever, ha ha), and I think that it's all that matters in a subjective level. The stronger emotional experience a movie gives, the higher I rank it. I'm sure there's a lot of people out there who can enjoy "Before sunrise" as much as I did (and do) if they just give it a chance. On the other hand I'm afraid that people who are totally happy with their lives won't enjoy this film so much. It requires some kind of miserable mentality combined to hopes for better times."Before sunrise" is a film that uses little maneuvers in portraying big emotions. It makes me feel like it could be me on the screen. I hope that some day I have a chance to love some woman as much as I love this film.Fantastic piece of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incomprehensible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I simply do not understand the "10" votes on this film. A young man and woman meet on a train. They start talking and the man convinces the woman to get off the train and walk around Vienna with him until it's time to catch his plane back to America instead of her original plan, which was to take the train back to Paris. This initially somewhat charming "inciting incident" is then followed for what seems like 24 excruciating hours of babbling and rambling discourse that sounds like it was made up on the spot. I didn't care about either one of these people, although the female character initially seemed much, much more intelligent and balanced than the male character. And yet she too got into the blab-fest and started to drive me insane. The man was judgmental and critical and dismissive of almost everything and I did not find anything about him remotely likable. If you think it is interesting to watch people playing pinball machines, walking through cemeteries, drinking beer out of bottles, wandering up and down streets, all while making peculiarly mundane commentary and observations and comments about life, you'll have a blast. If that sounds like a cure for insomnia, you'll be sound asleep about 10 minutes in to it. Absolutely deadly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOT "My Dinner With Andre"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my all time favorite films "My Dinner With Andre" is also about a conversation between two people. I loved that film! I was fascinated and mesmerized by the stories Andre told and the pictures he painted with words. I was hoping "Before Sunrise" would be just as good, but I was disappointed.Maybe I just didn't "get it." Maybe I was not in the proper frame of mind when I viewed it. Maybe my expectations were too high. Whatever the reason, I did not have the same experience many of the other reviewers had. While I did enjoy watching, there were times it became tedious, and it seemed like they were saying lines rather than having a real conversation. I wished it had been more. The film is mostly about their conversations on a variety of subjects, but I never really felt any one topic was explored in much depth. It was no "My Dinner with Andre." Maybe that was because the characters were too young to possess the experience and wisdom to explore more esoteric topics. But since they were both college students I think they could have had some deeper discussions. The screenplay indicates that there is an attraction between the two. I guess there was, but I didn't feel there was any passion between them. At least I did not feel or see any sparks. I did feel they were enjoying each other's company, but I didn't feel any sexual tension. It's definitely not a bad movie and I did enjoy watching, but for me it was not a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those ideas that looks good on paper but is a gigantic bore on film. Bore? No, worse than that - major annoyance. You follow a couple through a day as they meet, become attracted to each other, walk around, talk, share ideas and experiences and feelings and experience love. Aww, ya can't not like that, right? Well, yes, you can. After half an hour I wanted to run out screaming. They may both be attractive young actors, but as time went on and I had to watch their faces FOREVER, without a break, without anything else breaking the focus, I couldn't stand seeing them any longer. And their voices, their voices! endlessly yakking away so earnestly, so incessantly, started to sound like fingernails scratching on a blackboard. I just wanted them to shut up. Then there was the look on their faces as the listened to each other, their faces responding to every nuance, listening so intently, so yearningly, with so much empathy and sympathy and understanding and two hearts beating as one ... Help! Let me out of here! Is this love? Sure, probably it is, but if it is, it's definitely something to be experienced, and enjoyed as a participant, not watched as an outsider, especially not watched so long and so closely as this movie forced you to do. You know when lovers call each other "pookie" and "snookums" and "koochie," how it's terribly affectionate and heartfelt and meaningful to them but you want to retch and just get away as fast as you can? That's how this film affected me. I still shiver at the thought of it. I'm not sure I'll be able to enjoy another movie with either of these actors in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The reason I'm giving this film a 5 is that I didn't make it halfway through, so I don't feel quite qualified to judge it as a whole. I almost never give up on movies in that manner, but I found this one the opposite of what I thought it was going to be, which was intensely romantic and poignant. Instead of charming and wistful, the characters came over as jaded and pretentious. The looks exchanged by the two leads in the listening room felt contrived, and their first kiss was not built-up-to with any kind of real tension.I often hear people say they prefer old movies to new ones because they aren't as sexually explicit, and I always find it a little ironic, because the sexual tension of the old ones is so much more appealing to me--guess I'm into the sublimation thing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bought this movie as a double feature with its sequel, "Before Sunset", because my sister told me that I'd like them.Not knowing what to expect, I put the disc in... and waited... and waited... and waited, as the actors did a lot of talking.The central characters met by chance on a train, and spent a night together in Vienna before each had to move on to separate destinations. From my perspective, it felt like a thousand and one nights.The character of Celine was what you'd expect a stereotypical young Parisienne to be - stars in her eyes, dreamily romantic, believing in things mystical, while he was the cynical American who shot down everything she found special. So what did she see in him, I ask? They talked about how they 'connected', but they didn't appear, to me, to be connected at all. I didn't see two characters into whom I could become immersed, or believe their developing passion. All I saw were two actors.As a general rule, I wouldn't go out of my way to watch romance movies. That is not to say that I am not capable of being moved by one that is well-cast and well-made. There are many that have stirred my emotions, some even to the point of tears ("An Affair to Remember", for example, which this kind of takes a page from). But not this one. The Kleenex was left undisturbed in its little box, this time.Maybe the other users who've given this movie its high rating are hopeless romantics who'd cry over a sentimental TV commercial. I don't know. I don't mean to demean them in any way, but maybe some people have a lower 'romance' threshold than others...I simply could not get involved with the characters. They didn't do anything for me but leave me cold.The reason I gave this a 4 out of 10 instead of a 3, is for the Viennese scenery.Watch this if there's nothing else on, and if you're doing something else at the same time so that you're not too bored.</fullReview>

That's pretty uncommon for a country where the use of foreign languages is officially forbidden, but you don't want to be too picky, right? This is a movie after all! Now pick your average American boy, coming to Old Europe to meet his girlfriend -- but she is a really average girlfriend, one that comes to Old Europe for some kind of art study (we are allowed to think that this is not the real reason, or that art studies are useless - you choose); however, she is pretty average, so she ended up cheating on him and when he arrives, he soon realizes he's going to be dumped.He buys an interrail ticket and he too ends up on a Budapest-Paris train, only to bump into that not-so-average french girl who's still a student at Sorbonne because she doesn't feel like she's ready for a real life (and she's only 23 yo) Could they avoid falling in love? The answer is no. This is all the plot. The rest is about 90' of them getting closer, with Wien as a cute backdrop for their story.In this 'wannabe art' movie we can really see how nothingness can be stirred to fill up the standard Hollywood length of 100 minutes: two people chatting about nothing and trying hard to make it feel real.But this IS Hollywood: because there's not even a little bit of something real in this movie. It's a movie that leverages the dream that you, as a foreigner in a foreign country, could start chatting with a beautiful stranger and then fall in love.I could stand the cute 'what if' scenario, if only it managed to build up something for you to ponder - but there is no food for the mind here to be found.I watched 'Before Sunrise' out of curiosity because I've read so much good about it, but now I understand that the only people who cared about it are the ones who like to view themselves as 'romantic'.Look in the mirror: are you a so-called 'romantic' kind of person? then this movie is for you. Otherwise, keep away!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very few romantic dramas come as original and moving as this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the years pass, filmmakers are running low on ideas for the romance genre faster than some may expect. Many films manage to spit evidence of this, take the film adaptations for Nicholas Sparks' novels for an example (though a few of them are okay). That is not to say the romance genre is dead. Every now and then, Hollywood manages to surprise us with some surprisingly riveting and original love tales such as 'The English Patient', 'Romeo + Juliet', 'There's Something About Mary', and James Cameron ever popular 'Titanic'. But most of time, filmmakers choose to follow down almost same formulaic route: a guy meets a girl, they fall in love, hit some obstacles that put their relationship to the test, and in the end they get back together, a formula that's grown tiresome long before we knew it. This romantic drama directed by Richard Linklater supplies an entirely original love story that completely devoid from the typical romantic clichés that have long plagued the genre. The film opens up with Jesse (played by Ethan Hawke), a young man in his late teens or early 20s on a train to heading back to Vienna (France) where he will be flying back to America at 9:30 the following morning. In escape of a bickering German couple, young woman named Celine (played by Julia Delpy) moves down the aisle where she and Jesse come face-to-face. After engaging in a heart-warming friendly conversation, Jesse convinces her to tour with him around the city of Vienna before he leaves for his flight in the morning which she agrees. Before we know, a heart-touching romance develops between the two in what is their only night together.This love tale takes just about everything we've grown familiar with in romance flicks and pushes them to the sidelines. This is not a story of a man and a woman falling in love in the midst of a sinking boat, a teenage girl finding the hots of a vampire, or a woman developing a relationship with a soldier returning home from war; this follows two college- aged individuals who meet as complete strangers and decide to take the day to know each other before developing a sudden relationship that leads to the night of their lives. Though the film is lacks a cohesive plot is there is very little action other than the characters walking and talking, this film conceives a romantic tale that veers closest to reality than any romance flick has ever before. With most of the film consisting the characters engaging thought-provoking and philosophical conversations about life or revisiting past memories, the film gives audience a long opportunity to immerse with the lead characters and witness the powerful chemistry grow between them. Whether viewers become fascinated by the clever dialogue or the genuine performances by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, there is plenty of magic to experience. Though there are occasional lines that come off rather awkward, particularly when sex becomes the topic. The characters are developed to individuals many can relate to. At certain times, the characters allow us feel their emotions. We experience their anxiety of knowing the next morning they will both be departing separate ways and may never see each other again. Typically, many movies try to the emotional manipulation route by adding syrupy dialogue or overly sentimental music score. Good news! This movie steers away from that.Before Sunrise is a solidly original and riveting romantic tale granted by the graceful talent of Richard Linklater. This is a movie that defies expectations and slams the door on tedious rom-com clichés, very few love stories come as original as this one. However, those expecting a groundbreaking plot are more than likely up for a disappointment. Otherwise, this movie is worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romance in youth seen through the eyes of an older man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, I'm not one for romance, be it in the streets, in books or on screen. However, I like to consider myself as an open-minded person an very much looked forward to watching this film from a director whose work I have sometimes loved (dazed and confused).The story is simple, two people meet on a train, somehow manage to like each others' company in very short time and then spend a night walking the streets of Vienna, handing money to every beggar they meet and sucking up to the Austrian counter-culture.I really did not like this film. Firstly, the characters are uninteresting. Hawke's Jesse appears to be mentally challenged and Delpy's Céline is a pretentious intellectual snob. Anyway, these guys spend a night talking about their half-cooked philosophy of the world and their idea of true, perfect love. You'll get the usual: rebel against your parents, true love never lasts, capitalism is bad, youth is good.It seems obvious that the idea of this movie is to show two young people falling in true love. A type of love that everyone should wish for because it is pure. The viewer is supposed to be moved by the honesty and maybe naivety of these guys. And this is what seriously bothers me. This is a relationship seen through the eyes of an older person, nostalgic of the innocence of his youth. The result is that Jesse and Céline aren't authentic, they are not convincing, rather clichés, they are just somebody else's fantasies.I did however enjoy the simplicity of this movie. The plot, the pace, etc.Enough said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautiful And Unique Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one unique movie. Such an uncommon theme; Before Sunrise depicts the "love at first sight" philosophy exceedingly well. At times, the movie felt very boring, but otherwise it was a great pure romantic movie. Ethan Hawke was my favourite actor in Dead Poets Society, where he played an introvert Todd Anderson. His character in Before Sunrise is totally, like polar opposite, different to that in Dead Poets Society. And he was brilliant. I could hardly believe that this is the same guy who played Todd Anderson in Dead Poets.Nothing much can be said about this movie; just that it is a good romantic movie with some mesmerising scenes and unique story-line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>truly one of a kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a hard time explaining Before Sunrise or even categorizing it. It is hard to call it a "romantic comedy" because it is so different from the other movies we have come to know as romantic comedies. It is hard to call it a drama with a little touch of romance because it makes the movie sound too depressing. I believe this is a pure romantic movie.I would hate to alienate men by calling this a romantic movie. I believe it's a romantic movie that everybody should see, especially teenagers. I was a bit surprised to see, on IMDb, that the movie is R rated, since the movie struck me as being very innocent.The movie follows the story of Jesse and Celine (the only characters with a name in the movie) who meet on a train and abruptly decide to spend the rest of the day (and night) walking together. It would be an understatement to say that these characters connected quickly (since the movie would have ended very fast if they hadn't), but what's surprising is that how Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawk make it look so real and convincing. There is no hint of the underlining factor that they are just acting. Hawk does all of his scenes effortlessly but Delpy is something else. She makes you fall in love with her character's mannerisms, gestures and accent from the onset but what is even more impressive is how irresistibly gorgeous she actually is. I like paying close attention to the technical stuff in movies, like camera movement, color composition, sound and so on, but this is all so hard to do with Deply around.The movie is of course co-written and directed by Richard Linklater. He was introduced to the film world with his brilliant independent film, Slacker. After the release of Slacker, he had become the equivalent of a superstar in the indie film world and this was his chance to show that he wasn't just a guy that got lucky the first time around. It is obvious that he pulled out this movie, with his co-writer, out of his personal experiences. I am saying this because the movie would have never been pulled off by just great writers but by great writers who know about human being's innate personal emotions.Anyway, this is a truly remarkable movie and an even better romantic film (not inflicted by Hollywood's cheesy imprinting's of course).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jesse (Ethan Hawke), an American, has been traveling around Europe on his own aimlessly for the past few weeks on his Eurail pass. His last stop, where he is currently heading, is Vienna, from where he will catch a flight home tomorrow morning. Celine (Julie Delphy), a Parisienne, had been in Budapest visiting her grandmother. She is currently heading back to Paris to resume her studies at the Sorbonne. Jesse and Celine meet by chance on the same westbound train out of Budapest. The connection they feel from their short conversation on the train is enough for Jesse to suggest at the last minute that she get off the train with him in Vienna and that they spend time together in Vienna - just wandering around the city as was his original plan as he doesn't have the money for a hotel - before he needs to go to the airport, and at which time she will board the next train to Paris. If it ends up she feels uncomfortable with him as time progresses, she could ditch him at any point. Celine agrees. As they wander from place to place in Vienna, they talk about their philosophies of life and love. They also talk about logistical issues regarding their time, such as why Jesse was in Europe to begin with, what they are feeling for each other, if there is a future for them together and if so what that future may look like taking into consideration both their current lots in life.Who wouldn't want something like this to happen to them? Its a dream come true to realize that you found the love of your life so unexpectedly in the most unexpected of places and clicked instantly. Of course, its near impossible not to stay in connection with each other nowadays, but the setting in the nineties and the characteristics of these people and their beliefs works wonders here. This is a simple story of love set in the beautiful city of Vienna over the course of a night between an American guy and a French girl, that's told in the most realistic, infectious and delightful way possible. The chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy is amazing. You might or might not warm up to Jesse who craves attention and generally has this snobbish attitude but is a romantic inside his heart, but no one, absolutely no one, will not love the free-spirited Celine who may come off as naive, but is so very hopeful and endearing. The sexual tension runs rampant beneath the surface. There are these most inane of conversations about their lives and how they feel about stuff, yet it is scintillating in the hands of these very capable actors who bring such joy, uncertainty, hope and fear to the table. There's no villain, action, slapstick comedy or any of the regular stuff that you expect from movies. The almost loving emphasis on breezy character interaction is quite remarkable. The dialogues flow naturally and is so good that I didn't want it to end. Definitely looking forward to the rest of the movies in the Before trilogy.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"how about six months?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Sunrise is one of the most acclaimed films of Richard Linklater, well just his most acclaimed film. The very first time I saw a Linklater film was back in 2004 when I saw on the big screen the School of Rock, back then I came to see that film as a Jack Black one, certainly not as a Linklater one. It was probably because of Quentin Tarantino that Linklater's Dazed and Confused became for me a must-wanted film (it is one of Tarantino's top 10 films), and in 2007 was when Linklater really blew me away and not only because I finally saw Dazed and Confused (I own the amazing Criterion DVD edition, and I think is about time to visit Dazed and Confused again) but also because I saw the awesome A Scanner Darkly (hell, it's also time to see this amazing film again). Two years later I finally saw Before Sunrise (I saw almost one week ago, exactly on 15 July 2009) and more than a year later I saw again a Linklater film. The last one was Bad News Bear (I'm not really a big fan of that film as I'm of Dazed and Confused, A Scanner Darkly and The School of Rock but still I like it) back in January 2008. I came first to a Linklater film that is a remake and had very weak reviews, I mean is very easy to find Bad News Bears on R4 DVD just as is very easy to find Before Sunrise on R4 DVD but frankly every time I came across Before Sunrise it looked like anything but like my cup of tea, I don't know it looked like a really sentimental film, like the kind of film that probably my girlfriend would enjoy much more than me. So while very quickly I got the R4 DVD of Bad News Bears (mostly because I enjoyed a lot Bad Santa back in 2007) it was just some weeks ago when I finally decided to get Before Sunrise, why? I found its R1 DVD in offer so I was like "hell, it's Linklater and well who knows maybe I will end loving and regretting for not seeing it before". I have seen few films that have Hawke but recently I was totally blown away by his performance in Sidney Lumet's Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, it's a fantastic performance and here 12 years before Hawke isn't as great yet he and Delpy (apart of this one I have seen only other film with Delpy in it: Broken Flowers) are quite good. Like I think you already know, the set of this is simple: a man (Hawke, certainly, is the American Jesse) meets a woman (Delpy, certainly, is the French Celine) on a train, he ask her to leave the train with him in Vienna, they will be together until the sunrise. I think this is a success in that way that it gets really engaging with nothing but dialog between the two characters. I love the part when both say to the other their feelings, both "call" to their respective "friends", they tell to their respective "friend" what they felt when they meet the other and stuff, is like "let's sit down and think about this whole thing" and the stuff of "are you going to see him/her again?" begins, her "friend" ask her "you gonna see him again?" and she says "we haven't talked about that yet". But they will and they agree to make of that the one and only night together, they acted like "rational" adults but certainly is not the same to talk about a moment that live that moment, "how about six months?". This is a good film but NOTHING REALLY IMPRESSIVE, not a great masterpiece, not my favourite from Linklater. I guess by saying that I do have interest in checking out the sequel (the 2004 Before Sunset) I'm giving a compliment to this film because yes, I want to know what happens once Ethan Hawke's character and Julie Delpy's character see each other again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aha - So This is Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That was the first thing that came into my mind just after i saw this film. They are right then - it's the greatest feeling of all. And it makes me a little bit sad because i once thought i was really in love too but it turns out that it was not a big deal at all - at least compared to the relationship between Jesse and Celine.Of course i'm aware that such connection is actually really rare and it doesn't happen all the time and to everyone and yet it felt so real, especially compared to those idiotic Hollywood romantic comedies. The funny thing s that i think that "Befire Sunrise" is much more romantic than "You've Got Mail" for example. I find it even funnier that it's actually an American movie. But don't forget that it was shot in Europe.Jesse is a young American who of course "don't speak any other languages" but is really charming and reminds of a Kerouac type of character, traveling around after a bitter break up with his girlfriend. Celine is french, also very charming, witty, sweet, vulnerable and a little bit neurotic and she is traveling to Paris where she studies in the Sorbonne. So they meet in the train to Vienna and after they talk for a while he persuades her to come with him and hang around the city. That's how one of the greatest love stories in the history of cinema begins(that's just my opinion of course).Are they going to meet again after six months on 16 of December(my birthday actually). Are they going to get married, have children, grow old together and so on? You'll find out if watch the second part - "Before Sunset"(actually this sequel doesn't give all the answers but i assure you that it's simply great, maybe even better than the first film). And i assure you also that if you watch "Before Sunrise" and after a couple of days "Before Sunset", you'll have a great cinematic experience. I was really heartbroken after the end of the first film but you know - the ending can't be any other cause otherwise it could have become a standard American romantic movie, maybe not so dumb but not so great either. That was one of the very few movies when i was actually longing for a happy end. I was lucky that i saw it relatively late and i didn't have to Waite 9 years for the sequel.What makes this film so great. Well first of all - Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are simply amazing. The scene at the listening booth, the scene at the cemetery, the ending - they could have received an Oscar for any of this scenes alone. The direction is superb - to watch two young people walking around and talking and yet to feel so compelled. The cinematography is also very good. The script - i don't have words to tell you how great it is. Along with the scenes mentioned above i would like to mention a couple more too - the scene with the bum who writes poetry, very fascinating as an idea; the scene in the morning where they dance on the street and then when they rest and he impersonates Dylan Thomas. Oh please watch this film...or don't...I don't know. It's amazing but it's not for everybody. Personally i thought it was great.</fullReview>

I knew I was in for a dialogue-filled 90 minutes but I was not ready for what I was about to endure.I love dialogue based films but this one is different. The whole movie is just one big dialogue from start to finish. And it isn't funny or original dialogue, it's mainly clich?s about love and lame anecdotes. It gets so pretentious I laughed during some scenes. The characters try too hard to be emotionally deep and intellectually different, and it gets to a point where it's just plain boring.The acting is good in some points and horrible in others, some lines are delivered with so little conviction you start to wonder whether some of it is supposed to be sarcasm.Anyways I still give it 5 stars for the idea but I would definitely not watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this on DVD. I saw the "sequel" first--BEFORE SUNSET--a couple years ago. I'm (now) much older than the characters in this film and I thought I might find it corny or overdone--but it really got to me--but like in a natural, kind of subtle way. I guess I really believed it or identified with it. It didn't seem like just a fantasy fulfillment movie--which Hollywood is so good at doing.All the next day it made me feel kind of high and happy--after watching this movie. And of course,every attractive female I saw all that day I thought we'd suddenly fall in love with each other.--Too bad--it did not happen!I was in Europe with my girlfriend one summer quite a few years back, and I've had to travel alone on bus, trains and even via thumb through the US over the years. Nothing quite so dramatic or romantic ever happened to me when I was alone, but even so, I think this movie captured a lot of that feeling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before Sunrise, while the story is really meant to be taken at face value, in combination with obvious film techniques such as shot composition, lighting, and the changes from "real-time," to "created-time," certainly creates this wandering aspect, representative of the "Slacker genre," of film relating to Generation X.The story being a simple, open-ended love story is an effective means of breaking the conventional strategies of story-telling (Protagonist vs Antagonist, conflict, epiphany and a decisive conclusion). The film gives the viewer a sense of the wandering, loose, flimsy, and sometimes clumsy reality of a date (even though this would be an exceptional date between two people) between two people who share a sense of being overwhelmed by their post-modern condition, where they struggle to think of or do anything original or particularly substantial. through the film having very little conventionally shot scenes, and very normal dialogue (which is unconventional in Hollywood films), helps with that sense of realism.In any case, I was pleasantly surprised by this film, not thinking it will be all that interesting, but if you are a film-buff, it is not your run-of-the-mill Hollywood romance movie. It achieves a sense of realism with this ideal date scenario far more successfully than anything I've seen in the past 5 or so years, as trends are currently to create a fantasy that viewers can relate to, rather than realistic scenarios in any genre really (even the news is susceptible, nowadays).I would give this movie an 8, however I think of it as an, "acquired taste," so I gave it a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...but it might improve your enjoyment.HAving said that,I think that this is a film for anyone who appreciates character over plot and wants a film to respect his or her ability to follow a story. Jesse(Ethan Hawke in a roll where,to me,he became A LOT more likable),a college student on vacation(more of a wanderlust)in Europe meets,via chance encounter,Celine(Julie Delpy,ethereal,beautiful and bright),a French student also on roam. They hit it off instantly,stop off in Vienna on wait for each others' trains taking them in different directions,and spend a thoughtful,chatty evening-into-overnight-into-morning together,taking in the aged,beautiful scenery of the old German city. As they bond over their conversation,an attraction builds,but then a dilemma ensues:should they indulge in a physical relationship,fully aware of the fact that once they part they may never see each other again? Decisions,decisions...Director Richard Linklater,to the best of my knowledge,had never filmed a movie outside of his home state of Texas(and mostly Austin)prior to this offering,but his slow-moving,attentive camera and sound are able to capture much of the beauty and warmth of old Europe and the people who roam the streets as well as the central characters. Some may dismiss this as a "Date movie" or a "Chick flick",but to me,this film is FAR above either of these genres:this is a romance that's made around real,human character,that has no easy answers and no clean lines of plot denouement. I have,I must confess,some fond memories of seeing this. I was back in college,and my school's arts,entertainment and activities organization(I think most colleges have one)had agreed,through its films department,to screen films not yet released to local(read:mostly students)audiences,with the admission to the screenings being free. Previously,we'd screened films like "Trapped in Paradise"(bad)and "Mixed Nuts"(very bad)and I felt like we'd gotten what we'd paid for. This was next up,and it was like a revelation: a free,thoughtfully,well-made large studio production that I(and about two hundred other lucky sorts)got to see for free! I can say that whether you pay for it(And as a twelve-year old movie,it can't be more than a cheap rent anymore)or see it for(almost)free on cable,you'll be getting high quality. All that's left is you,the viewer,and your ability to enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I possibly say about "Before Sunrise"? It was a great film? It was realistic film? It was a genuinely romantic film? These descriptions may all be true in the broadest sense, but to truly describe the film I would need to cover every moment in ultra-descriptive detail. Unlike most other films that waste the majority of their time in building up to yet more wasted time, "Before Sunrise" keeps every scene within its own skin, a moment to be cherished. This would be why writing a review (with all its broad descriptions) on the film is nearly impossible. Not only does the audience know the hardly describable intimacy of each moment, but so do Jess and Celine, the lovebird protagonists of the film. Just as we do, they do not want the night to end, or the climax to ever come. This is in direct contrast to the climax-pushing plots of most films.The simple plot line revolves around the aforementioned Jess and Celine meeting on a train and proceeding to spend a night wandering the streets of Vienna. And that is it, two people falling in love in natural time. This device strips down all movie pretense and confronts love directly, honestly, and, in all sincerity, beautifully. At the end, they part ways, promising to meet again in six months, at the same train stop in Vienna. I feel safe mentioning this because what they do afterwards (or even how the plot is involved in the moment) is not really important, it is the moment that matters.Rather then feeling gypped at the end, we feel satisfied knowing that although the story is over, as the couple have parted company, we have spent a night together with these characters, just as the characters have done themselves. What they and we have left are our memories of each other.Thanks for the memories "Before Sunrise".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As with the characters there is profoundness, as well as simplicity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You really can't rate Before Sunrise properly without including Before Sunset.Before Sunrise is actually the first part of a two part set, the second part being Before Sunset. I thought that movie might be a sequel, as sequels go. It is not. It is the other essential part of the whole. I will critique them as an essential pair.The movies are difficult to rate. This is because if they mean something to you they should mean a lot. If they do not mean anything in particular, then you probably didn't like them at all - and probably didn't bother with the sequel. Without going into any details (I don't need to - you can get the official storyline from the general critic's reviews), here is how I rate them.Before seeing Before Sunset, I gave Before Sunrise a 3 out of 4. But the two together rate a 4, or more precisely an 8.5 out of 10. I have to leave room for such masterpieces as Hotel Rwanda and films in that class - totally different. It is also interesting that these movies are played out in real time. But I won't elaborate in order not to spoil the plot of the movies as a pair. We are lucky that as of now, we can see them together, or even better, one night apart, as I did.As with the characters there is profoundness, as well as simplicity to these movies and a nagging question which is resolved at the end (of Sunset).What do you think?

		<shortDescription>Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I attempted to see this movie in 1994; however, I was in high school and just lost interest within the first 20 minutes. Then the sequel came out and so I rented Before Sunrise, not only to understand the characters background, but also to give this movie another chance. It's kind of like when I was 7 and my older cousin took me to see The Breakfast Club. I had no idea what the dialogue meant and really was there because she wanted to see it. Naturally I was a good kid and fell asleep rather than fussing. Now, I love Breakfast Club. Anyhow, it's nine years later and I watched both Before Sunrise and After Sunset back to back. The characters completely drew me in as I reminisced about being young and in love, growing up and leaving people behind. It's so haunting and sad yet beautiful. This movie is brilliant because we live in a world where communication and finding lost friends is at our fingertips. Jesse did it by writing a book to find her, however, we all think about old friends and what they might be doing now. We can just find them on the internet and email them. I think we all wonder if we can pick up where we left off with these people. Would this mean that it was true love or true friendship? Do we base that on how well we connect with people? Sure, I do. In the movie, I listened to every word they exchanged. At this point, I loved that it was made and that I got a chance to discover it after 9 years. I was moved at the end but not as sad because I also had the sequel to watch. I knew it didn't leave me hanging like it did for most of the audiences who watched it years ago and thought, "what happened to them"? I wonder how I would have felt if I watched the entire movie back in 1994? Would I have cared about these characters as much as I do today? I think this movie will remind people of their youth and how life changes them. I think this story (along with the sequel) will touch people somehow someway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a guy, not many romantic movies touched me. This is one of those who did.The two main characters are very good looking, but Ethan Hawke is not incredibly handsome like Richard Gere and Julie Delpy is not unbeliveably pretty like Julia Roberts. And the set-up of the story is completely natural. This makes the movie stand out from the rest of the Hollywood make-believe "love stories".I like the way the romance goes naturally, right from the moment Jesse and Celine met on the train. Nothing looks or sounds awkward. It also reminds me of the kind of relationship I long for - how two people can be 100% comfortable when being together. Let's not forget they have met less than 24 hours ago! They can share conversation about anything: families, friends, love, life and death etc etc. You can tell that they are genuinely interested in each other romantically.There are lots of dialogues in this movies, but I don't find anything they said is bullshit. Witty words that give me some food for soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tender, understated romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a beautiful movie, a wonderfully understated story of an extended date between 2 strangers: an awkward and goateed American slacker and a stunning French woman . he is on the rebound - having followed his girlfriend to Europe, only to find that she's dumped him. On a train to Vienna, he meets her. The two hit it off in a sort of cute way, and Celine agrees to keep Jesse company in Vienna overnight, as he wiles the hours away until morning for his flight back to the US. They spend most of the time ambling through Vienna - through its old streets, along the Danube and the even check out that Ferris Wheel from "The Third Man" (Harry Lime does not make an appearance, and neither of our heroes brave the Viennese sewers). "Before" may be a scripted follow-up to Linklater's earlier "Slacker" - substituting Austin, TX with Vienna. Though the flick boils down to an extended conversation, Delpy and Hawke develop a tender chemistry that goes beyond the abstract philosophy of their conversation (Jesse muses that rich and poor children are similarly neglected; Celine muses that some people easily and unwittingly give their lives up to work, never thinking of their own enjoyment). The plot never builds up any tension - any sense that their relationship is heading for something, but that's the point. By the time they part ways, we realize that both of our heroes struggled to be as open and friendly as possible with a total stranger each knows will never be seen again. The pay-off comes at the end as we say the pain of their separation. In a montage of Vienna the next morning, as the camera lingers on those spots graced by Jesse and Celine - now washed by sunshine but bereft of their company (or anybody else's). The loss is palpable. Unlike Paris, Linklater seems to be saying, Vienna is delicacy that you can't take with you.The soundtrack isn't bad either, my favorite track being Je T'Aime Tant by Julie Delpy should sound good to most ears even if you don't understand much of French.I think it is one of the best romances I've ever seen. So stick around as long as you can, and savor every bite. Either way, you know you'll never leave satisfied.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better then most romantic movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most romantic movies of all time and by this I do not mean sexual. The story of two young people getting to know each other and falling in love over night in Vienna is very refreshing and real. I got the feeling that this was not a movie but a real experience between two people. Very romantic. I can see a time where either something like this has or can happen to me. Definitely the most "real" romantic film I have seen. The actors are well matched and it is refreshing not to see a 60 yr old actor romancing a 30 yr old women. I really felt for these people which you do not find many times in movies today.I hope it gets a much bigger audience now that Before Sunset has been released on DVD</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the quintessential movie for all of us hopeless romantics out there, who believe that the feeling you get when you are with someone is more important than anything else in the whole world, at the time. This movie proves that in all it's wonderful simplicity with conversation being the focal point of two young people who have a connection from the get-go. I cannot WAIT to see Before Sunset when the two hook up again in 7 years. (It comes out on DVD in November...I just missed it in the theaters). I'll let you guys know what I think of that one too as this prequel left me hanging in what I guess I would call, a curious, wonderful sort of way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Young love.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing Richard Linklater's "Before Sunset", and loving every minute of it, I resolved to find the film that "Sunset" was a followup to: 1995's "Before Sunset". Both films star Ethan Hawke ("Dead Poets Society") and Julie Delpy ("White") as Jesse and Celine, two star-crossed lovers who have a penchant for engaging in long conversations on a wide variety of topics. In "Sunrise", Jesse and Celine meet while on a train to Vienna. Jesse is sightseeing in Europe, having been dumped by his girlfriend who he had originally intended to spend his vacation with. Celine is on her way back from a visit to her grandmother. Jesse is going to catch a plane in Vienna back to the United States, and convinces Celine to get off with him. The two wander around Vienna, talking, encountering the locals, and, of course, falling in love. The plot of "Before Sunrise" is minimalist; the film depends on the strength of the two lead actors, and the dialogue they are given. Fortunately, both are very strong. I prefer "Sunset" to "Sunrise", but both are excellent productions. I give "Sunrise" an 8, compared to the 10 I gave "Sunset".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is fairly low budget, there are only 2 main characters and it ismostly all dialogue and the whole movie takes place over about 24hours (less actually). There are no special effects, action scenes, etc.. but what there isis beautiful scenery of Vienna, Austria in the summer time..The whole plot is based on what these 2 people talk about.I would highly recommend it to anyone between the ages of say16-23 when you're at the stage in your life where you wonder aboutwhat you're gonna do with the rest of it.. and you ponder about love,life, and the universe... etc. Of course the movie is also great for older people. I am almost 28and can still relate to it. I saw it when it first came out and I was 18and it still means as much to me now as back then.I can't wait to see the sequel which will be here in a few weekstime! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than I expected.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start this commentary off by saying, I am NOT an Ethan Hawke fan; he's always struck me as someone who thinks he's more interesting than he actually is. And Julie Deply's always struck me as French Lite, especially in comparison to Juliette Binoche and Audrey Tautou (don't use "Amelie" as your sole reference to her talent and depth; check out "He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not", she's spooky). But a friend finally convinced me to watch "Before Sunrise" by emphasizing how much it is like "My Dinner With Andre" (a movie I very much enjoyed). Well...he conned me. This film doesn't have anywhere near the beauty of language and depth of ideas as "...Andre", but it DOES have a pair of perfectly matched performances by actors who manage to build an uncertain situation into a series of what I felt to be real moments between the two of them.Wandering with them through a city that pretty much sleeps from ten till nine, I actually got to care about Jesse and Celine. Ethan Hawke made his character an endearing boy of a man who knows he's lost but cannot quite accept the idea that he has any other options. And Julie Delpy kept her character's sense of anger and ennui just enough below the surface to where it wasn't threatening but still seemed to be more in control of her than she wanted to admit. And scenes I feared would become dumb movie moments shifted into simple occurrences that kept the story going (the "poetry" scene is a perfect example of that; had the poem not been so Second Year College Poetry, it would have been too cutesy, but mingled with Jesse's near screw-up of the glow it brought Celine, the bit some bite).Overall, this movie was much better than I expected. It went on about 10 minutes too long...but that's a minor complaint. The true test is did it make me want to see "Before Sunset"? I do...even though I don't. And I will...I just wonder how I'll feel once I see how they've changed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't quite seem to shake it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good day to you all,Having read all 129 comments on this fine little film, i finally decided to post my own random ones concerning it. It's been a recurring (if increasingly rare) escape in my life for 8 years [confessional sigh].First off, i saw this when it came out on video in late 95, and loved it straight away. i was a pretty day-dreaming European-obsessed 18 year-old (whereas now I'm older. ha!), and probably disturbingly romantic (at least in mind if not execution), so pretty much i was/am the bullseye audience. I was always a little suspicious of being a sucker that I should like a film because I wanted it to happen to me, but, anyhow, you don't choose these things.The next summer, in a van-driving trip around europe with friends, i took a lone 3 day detour to visit vienna whilst my road-buddies made a break for the czech border (dreaming of cheap beer and czech ladies). Not just because of the film, but i might not have made the extra effort, otherwise. I spent 2 wonderful days walking around vienna, until my feet and legs were aching to a satisfied exhaustion. I stayed in a cheap youth hostel and spent very little money, ate bread and cheese, but had a perfect 'ghost in a beautiful unknown city' time. I even found Cemetery of the Nameless, which is frigging miles out of town, but worth a saunter. These are the things I wish I could do all the time....gets harder as you age (ahem, not to suggest i'm mature...).So now I've probably, over the years, watched it about 15-20 times. Its good to leave a couple years between viewings, I've found (hardly surprising, i shamefully admit), and I'm not gonna buy the DVD unless one with commentary or such is released [side point: the school of rock commentary richard did is brilliant, hes just an honest and interesting guy; something like that would be ace]. I love the cinematography, though, so errrr might buy it anyway.I've experienced a few connections a la jesse &amp; celine, but ultimately what is so refreshing about this film is the breeze of possibility - that clear rush of excitement for the future. The point where insecure confusion becomes limitless potential; its exciting when you sense it in other people. I felt it years ago when talking to this beautiful Greek girl about what she was going to do after her college exams: she looked down smiling soft with bright eyes, shuffled her feet, looked up again and said "i'm still waiting for it to fall from heaven". I watched this film for the first time in years last night and it still leaves me feeling the youthfulness of anything being possible (if not in one's control!); soaking up a beautiful day in a new city, meeting interesting creative people, falling in love with someone you'd never expect to meet, expressing very personal things in a relaxed way, discovering wonderful new things, basically. It is at heart a real humanism, and the older i get, the more i believe life is about seeking out and sharing with good people.2 negatives: 1.) sometimes a lot of the conversation between Jesse and Celine strikes me as cringe-inducingly middle class, self absorbed and a little smug. not surprising, given the situation i suppose. i often strike myself as such, minus the smug. 2.) I am sure, even if i cant prove, that this film injected its sweet-early-summer-viennese world irreversibly into my sweet-craving forlorn 18 yr old psyche, and with the aid of top-ups over the last 8 years has had a significantly destructive influence in encouraging a romantic idealism that leads inevitably to disappointment and low self-esteem. its as if i refuse to compromise to certain things, yet have no confirmation the things i am looking for actually exist.Still: i love trains, i love traveling in europe, i love vienna, i love trams, i definitely "have a thing" for french women (well, continental women in general), i love cafés in old squares, places without cars, i love sitting and watching people in unfamiliar cities/countries overhearing a few insights; people of all ages talking about books/films/gossip/music/existentialism/the price of donuts/love/why the other person shouldn't have slept with someone/a dog/can i get the check? etc., i love (good(?)) buskers, i love cobbled streets, i love candles outside, i love hearing languages i only vaguely/partially understand (often including English...), i love cellos and harpsichords and bach's sonatas...[mercy! i daren't bore you further!]. i also suspect i love all of these things even more because of before sunrise; it sort of validated and unified these ethereal things, even if it seems (as it should) a little more immature to me now. i guess you build on the things you identify with; its a shame its only a film...viva linklater!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the great things about this is the characterization, I've never seen a movie so effective that way like this. You really know what the 2 are thinking. Also, it's this whole nostalgic/being young/Westerberg syndrome kind of piece, it's so incredibly satisfying and romantic it's beyond the criteria of what a good film is, this a a film that can be very personal to people, that's what makes it so exciting. The best parts of their dialogue is not when they have philosophical discussions but when they talk about their own life, when Jesse talks about his girlfriend or about being a father, or when Celine talks about people making fun of her or when she makes fun of Jesse, so many moments that are so poignant, so sweet, it's hard to forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this movie this afternoon after flipping channels and stumbling on it. I became so engrossed in it as I was watching that I completely tuned everything else out. I read some of the other comments posted about it, and yeah, I can see your point if you didn't enjoy it or find it believable. It's not a movie that was made for everyone. But oh, it was definitely made for me!Last summer I actually had a frightfully similar experience while in Europe. I was in Paris and made a surreal connection with a Parisian named Seb one night, knowing I would be leaving him and our amazing connection behind. So, can it happen? Yes. Does it often? No. And that, my friends, is why we become so riveted and pricked in the heart and mind while watching this movie. Whether you have had an experience close to this or not, it still can strike a cord in all of us. We all long for personal connections. Even if you do not believe in love at first sight or chance occurrences that impact us forever, a 'what-if?' and 'maybe...' are always present.So take it or leave it, just realize that this movie was made for some of us more than others. I just wish I had it back in high school and could have used it in my Forensics or Drama class. Would have been a perfect intellectual, witty dialogue to use.</fullReview>

I can guarantee that any instantaneous scene in this movie will grab your attention and refuse to let go. The natural dialogue laced with smart/prudent truth and beautiful European milieu will entice you. I thank this movie for lacking those long-winded and pompous soliloquies delivered by none too often liked characters, typical of the pseudo-profound Hollywood fare. This is a love story how it should be, not debauched by schmaltz and pretension, unfolding in a magical little vessel in the world. The still-shots at the end of the movie, capturing the now vacant spots in which they had previously spent time together, is poignantly sad in its simplicity. This really is a beautiful and truthful story worthy of celluloid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to say which aspect of this film makes it most worthy of watching, but one thing is clear after seeing this: it makes you want to visit Vienna as soon as possible, because this city has never looked better than in any commercial, advertisement or postcard. But having said that, the films main attractions are the quality of dialogue and the performances by Hawke and Delpy. Although 'Before Sunrise' is what often is described as a "talky", the conversations are entertaining, very well written and performed, from its premise till the end. Unfortunately it's the only truly great film writer/director Linklater made ('Dazed and Confused is a little bit overrated). Last note: if you liked 'Before Sunrise' I can really recommend 'The Hottest State", Hawkes debut as a writer. It has the same kind of writing quality that 'Before Sunrise' has.</fullReview>

It's so dazzlingly true to life that I feel everyone will be able to get something out of it and make a connection to his/her own life. Although not very well known, this film is bound to become a romantic classic of the 90s, a film young people of now will put on again in ten or twenty years time to remember their youth by and to contemplate about what their life turned out to be. Nowhere is this, although very romantic, tale sugar-sweet or overdone. Nowhere is it boring, even though there isnt a big story-line. Vienna as a city didnt really appeal to me, but seeing the way they portrayed it in this film sure makes me want to go there now. An absolute jewel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simple, Original, and Romantic. "Before Sunrise" is about Chemistry. The casting of the two lead actors: Hawke, and Delpy was a master stroke. Sure, at times it looks like they are just saying their lines, but most times their reactions to each other are spontaneous. The scene in the listening booth, conveys so much while saying so little. The magical first meeting was also majestic, as two strangers meet as if they'd known each other for their whole lives. The scene in which they pretend to talk to their friend over the phone describing their meeting of each other, is a fascinating way of telling one another, how they feel.It'd be nice just once in life to have an encounter like the one depicted in this movie. The setting is also very romantic and adds to the genuine "magic" of the film. The conversation is interesting and not overwhelming. Most of all the pleasantness conveyed by both lead characters makes you wish for more. (Rating: 9.5/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Before Sunrise" left me with the feeling of "I'd really like to know if they met again." And my personal pessimism of course says they didn't. Okay, just my own life experience. But on the other hand the ending leaves room for imagination, so pick your own choice. The ending and actually the whole movie is unusual for an American made production and this courage should be honored. The actors were overall convincing, the camera staying realistic, not too much softtoning of a not so soft Vienna. I especially liked the look back in the morning on the places the two visited and the feeling of emptiness, at least for me, that now vibrated from them. Quite a fresh breeze after having watched kitsched romanticism in movies like "Titanic."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Before Sunrise" touched me very deeply. Jesse and Celine seem so real because Richard Linklater gives us the time to get to know them. And because they seem so real to us, we become more emotionally involved in the story and what happens to these two people. The shots near the end of the film (of places Jesse and Celine were the night before) are lovely and elegiac. Have you ever driven or walked by a place where something significant once happened to you? To anyone else, that place might seem like a drab alleyway or commonplace bench, but to you it holds a special memory. These shots capture that feeling perfectly.This entire movie plays like a beautiful memory...wonderful.If you enjoyed "Before Sunrise", I highly recommend "The Clock", a 1945 film with Judy Garland and Robert Walker. Walker is a soldier on leave who (literally) runs into Garland at New York's Penn Station, and they only have two days to get to know each other. While different in tone from "Before Sunrise", it is definitely of the same spirit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, a lot of the people that commented here went a little overboard and hail this as some cinematic masterpiece or the modern Last Tango in Paris. I wouldn't go that far but will say this was way better than I expected. This movie is pure romantic fantasy but the kind we don't see anymore. It is mostly dialouge exchanged between the American boy and French girl who meet and decide to spend one day together. They get to know eachother and discuss life, sex, relationships, etc. I'd say it's a giant step forward for Richard Linklater, more mature than Dazed and Confused or especially Suburbia. One other thing, even though this was all in English and an American movie, at times it didn't feel like one. Personal favorite scene is in the listening booth, that's just like real life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favourite films. For a start Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke had exactly the right type of chemistry together to pull this off. The locations are excellent, and they give the film exactly the right type of feel. Whether its believable is another matter entirely, but its nice to think that maybe it could happen. It has a no hold back approach when it comes to analysing relationships and career prospects of people in their early twenties. It also reminds us of what its like to fall in love. Highly recommended in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unpretentious, and romantic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea: Two people meet on a train, spend about 24 hours in Vienna together, and fall in love.  This idea is somewhat daring because it is not a "big" movie, and it isn't plot driven, which could be horrible. But instead, this movie is a thoughtful, moving romance. Dialogue driven, the conversations Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have aren't necessarily brilliant, but they're real. They discuss things anyone would discuss (family, friends, etc). The conversations are intriguing, however, and this draws us deeper into the film. Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke are completely natural in there roles. There is no acting her. They present these fictional characters honestly and openly. The thing I enjoyed most about this movie was how real it seemed. The idea may be slightly fantastic (although I don't think it is), but the execution is grounded solely in reality. A great film, one of the ten best of 1995.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hello. How do you do? Can I sleep with you?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Linklater is obsessed with strangers. He wants to connect with strangers. Is it some kind of coincidence they all happen to be female and attractive? In fact, this exact same theme is re-visited in Waking Life, a more creative Linklater production made after Before Sunrise. In one Waking Life scene, the protagonist walked past a stranger, their eyes met for a fleeting moment and then walked away. He, perhaps overcome by her attractiveness, ran back to her, and uttered these spontaneous musings: "I know we haven't met, but I don't want to be an ant, like some living thing going through life on ant autopilot, with nothing really human required of us. I want to see you. I want you to see me." And the girl actually goes, "Yeah! Me too!". Ahh...if only flirtation can be so easy.....What Linklater has done so successfully in Before Sunrise is to package a simple boy-girl romance story, sprinkle lots of random philosophical musings, and actually manages to churn out a romance full of bittersweet and wistfulness. The idea of this spontaneous combustion of two souls in the vast solitude of the universe is a beautiful idea. It could very well have worked but for some reasons.....What didn't work for me was how Jesse kept gushing about how he felt this connectedness with Celine. Any full-blooded male would, what with her quirky French accent, her pale white skin, her sensitive blue eyes and her ravishing blonde locks. The scene in the music booth seemed contrived. It was as if Linklater already had this idea and decided to do Before Sunrise just to accommodate this little game of darting nervous eyes. And the people all seemed so friendly and accommodating. Poetry-spouting beggar, honour-serving bartender.. who else are there in dear old Vienna? Lastly, while I won't condemn the script as pseudo-intellectual crap, I just can't help that there is this overwhelming physical attraction between Jesse and Celine which relegates the attraction of the minds to a secondary level. I just wonder that if this were a ghost story, a story of two faceless discarnates without the earthly bound of the human body, would the same combustion have happened?Rating : 6.9</fullReview>

You do believe they are romantically interested in each other, but that is not the main focus.It is a look at the various aspects of romance and relevant relationships, as the would-be lovers discuss away whilst walking through the city - which means, a LOT of talking.

		<shortDescription>Goodnight, Vienna</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is, in England, a venerable joke based on the schmaltzy musical show, 'Goodnight, Vienna' that was a mega hit way back in the twenties/thirties. After cleaning up in the West End the producer put out several Road companies and anxious to see how they were doing he visited each theatre in turn. Arriving in Stockton he made his way to the theatre and asked the manager how the show was doing. 'About as well as "Goodnight, Stockton" would do in Vienna', came the answer. I find that that story can be adapted to accommodate this terrific movie. Ask one of the Godard pseuds how this movie would do at the LSE and the answer would be about as well as Breathless at a Fred Astaire retrospective. I saw this film on its initial release and marvelled at its lack of pretension and the way it delivered PURE entertainment. Because of a self-imposed rule (I have seen, like most people who visit this site, literally thousands of movies but I won't rely on my memory alone so I wait til I see them again on TV or at a festival or they become available on DVD before posting a comment) I was unable to comment at the time but now, in its wisdom and probably not least because Before Sunset is doing so well, a cinema in London has seen fit to screen Before Sunrise and so I was able to see it again and make the happy discovery that is is just as good as I remember. One of the most impressive things about it is the fact that it is shot in very long takes so that, by definition, the actors have been obliged to learn large chunks of dialogue as opposed to the average film where they may need to learn a couple of sentences at most. Ethan Hawke and the gorgeous Julie Delpy are totally relaxed with each other and give the impression that they're just winging it, saying whatever comes into their heads and occasionally it does sound gauche but mostly it hits exactly the right note. This is a very 'continental' film inasmuch as virtually nothing happens, there are no computer graphics, no sex, no violence, no severed limbs, no peurile jokes, just two people clearly attracted to each other and slowly falling in love as we stop just short of feeling voyeuristic. Impossible to praise too highly and wonder of wonders, the sequel, nine years down the line is just as wonderful. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A highly disappointing attempt at movie making!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie without any preconceived notions and approached it with a good amount of respect for Ethan hawke and his acting capabilities. But the 120 minutes on this movie I felt could have been spent better at watching a cockfight or something.Jumping quickly to the story, it was very painful to watch the seemingly simple boring story being contorted with a lot of psychobabble bull s**t. Throughout the story, the characters were begging the audience to understand them and relate themselves to but the whole process could have been made a little easier on the viewers mind.Hawke talking about his dead grandma's image, his reaction to the palm reader, his sick desperation at humping her, all was too strenuous to watch. Julie bore this mysterious, soothsayer's demeanor throughout the movie which was constantly annoying and made me hope that the director would end the movie with both of them waking up in their beds back home and realizing it was all a dream, which would have been a far better ending.My single complaint with this movie and the reason for rating it 4 on 10 is the movie's attempt at showing the reality of life, relationships, family and friends which was very vexing on the mind. Any average man between 20 to 40 would have found some part of the movie to be a depiction of his life at some point of time and this is where the movie failed me, it was a trial and error situation and it was quite boring. other technical parameters of movie making don't even feature much and are better left alone.I would recommend a re view of eternal sunshine of the spotless mind which is far more satisfying.peace!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is 90% dialog. And the dialog is not at all convincing in the given situation. It is too contrived, too pseudo cleverly intellectual, it is irritating and not at all romantic. Whenever Linklater switches to body language (the looks between the couple in the music booth) and purely visual shots (the morning scenes without actors) one begins to feel the deeper emotions that would be present in the given situation. But these moments are way too few and they are drowned in the veritable deluge of "adolescent" conversation between the two main characters. Now I will go and see the next episode "Before Sunset", to see if the director himself has picked up on this grave shortcoming of "Before Sunset". If he has, part 2 might well be a really nice film....!</fullReview>

I also think that the selection of the city of Vienna it was really nice because it's a romantic city in which you have to see many beautiful sight seeings as we watch in this movie.Finally I want to tell you that when I saw the rest of this trilogy I reconsider how bad it was and I changed my opinion for such a movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before Sunrise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I may have heard about this film and its sequel together, and perhaps one of the two separately, but when I read more about this one, the first, it definitely sounded like something that may be really interesting to see pan out, from writer / director Richard Linklater (Waking Life, School of Rock, A Scanner Darkly, Me and Orson Welles). Basically on a train from Budapest travelling through Europe, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) is a young American man going to Vienna to catch a flight back to the United States, and Céline (Broken Flowers' Julie Delpy) is a young French woman heading back to University in Paris having been to visit her grandmother. When she moves seats he notices her and moves himself, they slowly introduce themselves and start a really flowing conversation, until the train journey reaches Jesse's destination, but he thinks because they are getting on so well that he suggests she should join him for one day, mentioning the thought of unhappy marriage. As Jesse does not have much money he and Céline decide to roam the streets of Venice, filled with many landmarks and beautiful sights, fun things to do and interesting people to meet along the way. Eventually they share a romantic kiss at the top of Riesenrad ferris wheel (just like Timothy Dalton as James Bond 007 did with Kara in The Living Daylights), and they are able to open up much more about their opinions and thoughts about the city, relationships, love, marriage, religion, the differences between men and women, and even sex. Céline reveals that she did have a boyfriend, but they broke up after six months because she felt she was getting too close for comfort or whatever, and Jesse says that he was in fact on his way to a girlfriend who was with him in Madrid, but they broke up too because she was avoiding him. Continuing to walk around Venice they approached by and watch a few people who give them services or entertainment and they pay for them, these include an eccentric Palm Reader (Erni Mangold) who gives them vague predictions, and along the canal Street Poet (Dominik Castell) who asks them for a word to include in a poem that he quickly writes for them, they chose the word "milkshake", and he reads his poem Delusion Angel (written by David Jewell) to them which they are happy with. It has been dark in the city for a while, and Jesse and Céline stop in a café to talk some more, and there they have fake phone call conversations, playing each other's friends, and doing this she reveals that she was going to get off the train anyway, and he reveals that he wanted an escape from his life in his travelling. They admit their feelings to each other, they are both attracted to one another, but they are sure they won't see each other when they will leave the next day, so they decide to make the most of the time they have left together, it is unsure whether they actually did anything but a sexual encounter is implied. The film ends when the next day they rush to the train station where Céline catches the train, but before Jesse leaves her they agree that they will meet again in the spot they are in six months' time to rekindle their love, and as both head for their destinations they reflect on their time together and obviously miss each other. Hawke and Delpy give exceptional and heart-warming performances as the strangers who meet, spend twenty four hours together as friends and by the end of it end up deeply in love with each other, the direction and writing and Linklater is really clever and witty that it makes a film where almost little goes on move at a great pace and is carried simply by words and expressions, it is a marvellous romantic drama. Very good!</fullReview>

This added to the film's rawness, and helped with a sense of realism; like you are right there with them. It's more than an average romance, because their conversations are deep, and philosophical. They delve into personal views on love, life, death and everything in between. The dialogue is incredibly insightful, showing the man as slightly more analytical and cynical, and the woman as analytical, but also allowing herself to be swept away more without over-thinking it. This is an excellent movie; I would recommend watching it with someone special.</fullReview>

But this is definitely not my fare... all i could see in the film was minutes and agonizing minutes of dialog, which isn't the least bit interesting. I read the comments of other users lavishing praise on the dialogs being very real and close to life. But seriously, don't you find the musings of the lead pair too immature? And whatever humor there was, it was lifeless just like the rest of the rantings they exchange. The concept of two strangers meeting in an alien land, falling in love, only to depart the next morning had premise for such high romance potential. But what we get is a boring as hell movie. Julie looks pretty and very desirable, and Ethan looks dumb with a 'hey look at me, i am a cool dude' sort of sneer and calculated callousness. Lousy acting... they should've cast someone instead of Ethan. Overall, all the pages of excellent reviews aside, my take on the film is that it sucks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so much Solipsism as Universality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A friend of mine had asked me to goto the city to check out this movie. However I'd never seen nor heard of the original, let alone the sequel. After his strong recommendation and the mention of the movie consisting primarily of intellectual dialogue between the main characters, I knew it was gonna be my type of movie.. (being the conversationalist that I am .. voted most talkative in school, labeled the queen of intellectual babble..) but enough about me. I wouldn't want to come off as a "solipsist" as one of the commentators put it in describing Jesse and Celine.. but wait.. is it so bad to be characterized as such at some level? This same commentator mentioned that the rather self-absorbed characters discuss nothing of the universe and solely of themselves.. However, I completely disagree. Foremost, I believe that in discussing themselves as humans, they are in a fact discussing the universe, in that they themselves are very much a significant part of the universe. But of course I'm not trying to make a point solely on such a technicality, I also feel that the content of their discussions (perceived as solely about themselves) did not contain so much idiosyncratic traits as more so universal desires, hesitations, expectations and patterns of relationship behavior that the young and naive novice to the "game" may initially feel as being semi-unique to themselves. Another commentator especially recommended this movie for the age range of 16-23.. well i just recently turned 23 a few days back and I must say it was quite poignant for a hopeless romantic whose not quite so hopeless.. for someone whose known many of the feelings and experiences depicted in the film personally but never so impersonally.. who gained insight, insight I already had but not in the same form.. I don't know if I'm articulating what I'm trying to say correctly or just coming off as very contradictory. However, partially in accordance to what Jesse says in the movie, as much as love is selfless and giving, "if you really think about it, there's nothing more selfish," thus, love itself is filled with contradictions. Oh and one last thing.. I don't feel that this experience is unique to the characters, for those who hope for such interactions, I feel they very much exist; this is essentially why this movie is so exceptional.. I'm lucky and not so lucky to say that I've had interactions/relationships with others that initiated w/such intensity and passion, and experienced the feeling of "that clear rush of excitement for the future. The point where insecure confusion becomes limitless potential;" as I've read many of u have experienced.. but of course it somehow comes to an end for whatever reason.. but who says it wasn't special, true, real or pure just because it ends.. and that just because it doesn't that it is? I'm some what ambivalent about watching the sequel, unfortunately by the time I saw the original, my friend and I missed the sequel in the theaters..Ciao</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back in 1980 I saw the movie "Somewhere In Time". I thought it was the best love story ever filmed. It was written by science-fiction author Richard Matheson of all people! That changed in 1995 when I saw "Before Sunrise". This was the best love story ever filmed. In October, 2002, I met Quentin Tarantino at the "Frolic Room" in Hollywood, California. I mentioned to him that I thought "Before Sunrise" was the best love story ever filmed. He agreed. This coming from the writer/director of the greatest martial-arts film ever, "Kill Bill - Volume One. Need I say more?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really enjoyed it...but I don't buy it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found the thoughts brought up in this movie fascinating. The screenwriter obviously put a lot of thought into philosophical issues and many of the characters' thought, were ones that he had had. In this sense the movie was so true. It was also true in the way it was executed. The way the actors spoke to eachother was relaxed and realistic - true to life. I just felt that in real life people, whether they be twenty three or seventy three, don't go around spewing all of the deep thoughts they have had to random people on the train and if they do, that isn't all they talk about! I really loved the ideas the characters had and they made me think, but I don't buy the fact that these characters had that many thoughts of their own. And if two people spent twenty four consecutive hours only discussing the meaning of the world and the like, they would be mentally exausted! Their pseudo-intellectual comments became eccessive at times. But this is not to say that I didn't enjoy the film. It was very beautiful in its simplicity and a joy to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, feels more like being with a couple, than a film about them.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recall hearing good reviews about this film when it came out in 1995, but only this week had the chance to see it when I bought it as a budget DVD for under $6 US. Good little film. Simple premise, boy (Hawke) traveling by train in Europe to fly out of Vienna the next morning. Meets French girl (Delpy) who is traveling back to Paris. As they are about to part, he asks her to stay with him and walk and talk all over Vienna all night, then she can take the train to Paris as he flies back to the States. She accepts, and the whole rest of the film is them getting to know each other, meeting up with various people, and after the evening realizing they have a connection.some SPOILERS - read with caution. At the very end, as she is about to board her train, and he is about to board the bus to the airport, their logoc says "that was fun and we'll have good memories, but probably never see each other again." But in an emotional moment he says, "let's meet right here in exactly one year. No! Make it six months, right at this spot." It would be December. Although they agree, and part ways, you know that they will not carry through with it. Or will they? Maybe one will and the other won't? Good film, good video transfer for a cheap DVD. No extras.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do enjoy B4 Sunrise. i think its very interesting that the two characters who seemingly have nothing in common, apart form a train journey, get to know more about each other just through the simple act of communication.However i do not think that Jessy and Celine fall in love. i think that they are enraputred with each other. Their world is contained, they have no hidden agendas indeed nothing but a defined amount of time to get to know some one well. Unforchantly for them i think there is no going back, once they say their good byes thats it. They can never ever recreate that night again.SO yeh, i know i don't quite make sense but if u think about when you were younger watching a cartoon, how much u enjoyed it etc... and then compare it to watching the same cartoon now, its different, you can still enjoy it, but its just not the same.Fairy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No expectations.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know how long train travels feel like. Sleeping on a train, the perpetual movement, the sound of it. Then waking up early in the morning and walking down the corridors, seeing the sun rise. You'll never forget the colors of that early morning, or the metallic smell, or the face of someone you passed by, someone you've never seen before but who smiled and said hello.So here's Jesse with a Rail-Pass traveling Europe by train for some weeks now, on his way to Vienna, his last stop before taking a plane to the States. He meets this french girl, Celine, and they start talking. The film is just so natural that everything feels reasonable and real. And it takes you on that ride so smoothly that you won't see it coming, the pain of that inevitable goodbye.Before sunrise is the wonderful story of two characters with a bond and no expectations. Because they know right from the start that there's no possibility of a real long term relationship for them, they share things they probably wouldn't share with their friends. It is a romantic picture, but it never falls into postcard-like long shots of Vienna. Instead, it shows you Vienna like you would really experience it if you were there. And it shows you love, not as a packaged easy to consume feeling, but as something that can get inside your life and shake it from the inside out. The choices you make from there, well, they are up to you. And I still wonder what choices Jesse and Celine would have made from there...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is unique</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Before Sunrise" is a very good film,it is a shame that lots of people haven't seen it. It is not one of those typical Hollywood lovestory movies, but a film about pure "love" and about simple things in life, and that is why, I think, everybody who has seen it like it, to put it mildly. That it takes place in Europe makes this film only more special and "clean" and for the maybe first time, characters in this film don't have the perfect clothes on and don't lead a perfect shiny Hollywood life. It is very hard to explain what makes this film so good, especially to people who haven't seen it, and that is maybe a paradox because the film is very simple and it shouldn't be hard to explain. But as said, it is, and the reason to that is maybe because everybody these days are used to big, overrated, pompous and "perfect ending movies" that we longer can't explain the most simple things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American or European?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Commentary on the movie "Before Sunrise" A consideration on whether the movie is an American movie with an international slant or a European movie made from an American point of view.After having seen the movie "Before Sunrise" by Richard Linklater starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy several times, this paper has given me the opportunity to watch it in a completely different manner with a more critical eye instead of as a common spectator. Set completely in the streets of Vienna, it's the improbable story of an American College student (Ethan Hawke) looking for his answers to a crushed love life during an extended vacation through Europe on an Eurail pass. On his way to Vienna he meets a French student (Julie Delpy) on her way back to Paris after a vacation with her grandmother, and asks her to spend his last day in Europe with him before he has to catch his plane back to the States.Richard Linklater, having made such movies as "Slackers" and "Dazed and Confused", had people pretty set in their beliefs of what to expect: Another flick based on the aggravations and twists of the usual All-American-Teen's life. To everyone's great astonishment though, he gave them a whole lot more than what they had bargained for, as well as giving critics a definite run for their money when they saw that Linklater was capable of a lot more than just your roll-of-the-mill teen movie. I've had a quite a bit of difficulty pondering over the dilemma as to whether the movie is either American, or "European" . Some aspects of the movie force you to immediately decide on either one or the other, but, once you look over the other facets, you soon see that there's a lot more too it than a simple decision of one or the other. This movie is far from being a "Black or White" standard, but more of a plethora of shades of gray that have to be sorted through one by one. So taking each and every point on which the movie could either be classified as being one or the other, and coming up with the most with a valid reasoning as to whether it is either an American or "European" movie seems to be the most plausible solution. First of all, the filming could be much more readily compared to that of a "European" movie than an American movie's. For example, there are quite a few scenes where nothing is said, and the characters either look out at the scenery or onto some event (the belly dancer, or looking out the window on the train), at each other (the café scene), or are plainly seen strolling down some lost Viennese back street in deep thought (pick your choose). Even when they are talking, there are usually several shots of both characters which, unlike the more common close up shots of the speaker in American movies, are a lot more decentralized, and obscure. These can differ from a distant shot over the shoulder of one of the two characters, a shot from the end of the street or square where they are talking, or a ground shot of both characters at once. Whereas in an American movie there is a definite transition between different places, with a quick explanation of the change of scenery, there are no definite transitions of movement in "Before Sunrise". The characters will sometimes suddenly turn up in another location with no explanation as to how they got their, talking on a completely different subject than two seconds ago in the previous location. Of course due to the set time of the movie, and the necessity of capturing it all in a standard film length, this is an obvious necessity, if not a little unnerving at the beginning if we haven't caught on to what's going on. Unfortunately though, for someone who knows Vienna the transitions may seem a little confusing, as they often switch from one locale to another on the complete other side of the city, and then suddenly appear two minutes walk from their first position. The movie is completely devoid of any action, and sports little music whatsoever other than what the two characters hear as they stroll though the city, which is quite a change from the continuous barrage of sound and movement we've come to expect from even the most docile of American movies. Even though it may feel unerringly quiet, and obscure at the beginning with everything so lighthearted, and calm, you learn to sink into the atmosphere, and start to truly believe the movie as being a plausible if not true story. This makes for a pleasing relief from most movies out today, which have a constant watermark of "Fiction" just visible throughout the movie, and where each of the main characters has his own theme song. As for the story, I feel that it greatly differs from both American, and "European" movies altogether. No one is out to kill anyone, no one has a deep dark family secret, neither of the two is in the middle of a psychological crisis bordering on suicidal, nor does the world get shattered by some freak natural disaster in which both characters become the unlikely heroes. Instead it's simply about the two college students, and their mutual stay in Vienna. The whole story revolves around their lives, their desires, their personal philosophies, and basically any crazy thoughts that may pop into their minds. That's it. No thrilling underlying plot, just bursting at the seams to get out and surprise us, no irrelevant twist in character or story to confuse or defy us to believe the impossible. Just the simple, but short relation between two people and their conversations among themselves and those they meet during their stay. Neither of the two turn into an alien a la George Arrakis, nor are they in search the long awaited "first time" as in "American Pie" (well, at least not to that extent). But regardless the lack of an incredibly complex plot, the movie ends up to be more than satisfying if you ever found yourself in a similar conversation, ever lived through any of their many points of conversation, or even wished you were in the shoes of either of the two to enjoy such a simple yet gratifying moment.The actors are even harder to classify than the story due to their insistence on avoiding the regular stereotypes of being either plain American or French. Even if the movie were seen purely from the point of view from one of the two characters, the two would still resist classification due to the free manner in which they act, and the simplicity with which they blend into each other. Hawke may start off as the suave college guy that thinks he's going to get himself the girl, but he soon turns out to be a thoughtful romantic who doesn't seem to be completely at ease with women for the simple reason that he doesn't understand them; especially those that can put up with his ways, and effortlessly return his remarks bite for bite. Delpy on the other hand emanates a strong air of cool intellectual sophistication seeming to have everything clear in her head, but quickly proves herself to be a lot more free-speaking, and confused than Hawke, who was meant to be the one with the irresolvable problems. They definitely manage to pull their roles off very well on both sides (if not a little less at the end when they both turn into bumbling adolescents), keeping to their characters in both words and actions. Even when they stray off from their usual selves (For example, Hawke's romanticism in the Ferris wheel compared to his comments on the fortune teller), there always seems to be a probable explanation later on in the movie for their apparent deviation, and even then they never wander very far from what one would expect of someone in a similar situation. Their conversation, like their acting is very hard to lock down as being either of one or the other genre, as both American and "European" filmmakers have hardly ever touched onto movies that are based purely on conversation and so little action. To make life simple, you could just tag it as being "European" for the simple reason that there is nothing but conversation in the movie, which would be more probable in a "European" movie than in an American movie, but that would be taking a very simplistic path out of a much more complicated question. The question isn't really whether the conversation is more American or European, as it touches equally on both styles, but in different degrees, as well as in different circumstances. The question thus becomes, are both characters truly one or the other type (notwithstanding the fact that they both act very much out of their stereotypes), or are they simply a smorgasbord of both American and European views, giving the scriptwriter a way of creating the situations at his own guise? One could break down their conversation into several different categories: memories, thoughts and philosophies, explanations, and simple "down-time" conversation. At the beginning of the movie, Delpy has little trouble discussing memories, and past events, while Hawke has a lot of trouble telling Delpy any of his due to their social background. He hasn't gotten used to the fact that he'll be spending the next fourteen hours with her, and still hasn't gotten a feel for her what she's actually like, so he's reticent of letting too many personal thoughts out. Delpy on the other hand finds it a way to get the conversation going, jumping onto new conversations as a way of getting to know Hawke, expecting him to respond with similar memories or events. Delpy doesn't wait to point out that it was Hawke that had started the game of asking each other a question, but this only makes Hawke all the more uncomfortable with the situation. When they start discussing their points of view on different subjects, such as feminism, and views on life, they both seem to hold to their respective nationality's theories, but often explain themselves in ways that would be more probably for the other person's upbringing. Hawke for instance is often quoting lines from authors and poets that he heard or read, while Delpy bases most of her points on personal experience. She also seems a lot more inflexible in her views while Hawke easily ends up swaying to her objections, accepting her comments with very little retort. While we could expect this to be the other way around due to their national educational backgrounds, this could of course be entirely owing to the personality of the two characters instead of being seen as a stereotype, but it would seem to be a very sudden change from the "opposing nations" pattern readily visible throughout the rest of the movie. As for their explanations for their situations in life and love, they seem to correspond to their respective stereotypes more than in any other aspect of the movie. For example, Delpy takes a lot longer to describe her relationship with her ex-boyfriend than Hawke does, but for a completely different reason than he expects. Hawke is simply on a guilt-trip over the fact that he's with his newfound companion so soon after having broken up with his girlfriend only several days prior. Delpy, on the other hand sees her relational break-up with her ex-boyfriend as more of a moral experience that has formed her life into something new and utterly confusing, which must have some higher meaning that she hasn't been able to grasp yet. When they finally explain their situations to one another, Hawke quickly finds himself at a loss for words in Delpy's explanations on how she imagines herself getting over her metaphysical dilemma while banging her frustration away on a pinball machine. For Hawke, the question was simply whether it was right to be in the arms of another woman so soon after breaking off his last relationship, but this doesn't comply with her complex dissection of a similar event, but taken in a completely different fashion. Their opposing views could be put aside as being a man's views on a relationship clashing with those of a woman, but they fall into similar situations several times in the movie on completely different subjects, with Delpy in full sway on a certain point, and Hawke completely lost, only just able to keep up his end of the dialogue. At certain moments of the movie, usually after a long debate on one of their philosophies of life or a session of frank justifications, the two end up talking about nothing. By nothing, I mean the type of conversation one has when there isn't much to talk about, or simply babbling while waiting for a new topic of interest to liven up the dialogue (such as the scene under the statue in front of the Natural History Museum, or at the café before the fortune-teller comes by). During these times both Hawke and Delpy seem to find an equal ground where they both just let out what's on their minds, and more often than not find that they both hold similar views on a lot of things. While all their heated discussions that dominate prove that they both have their own opinions on different facts of life, these moments allow them to see that they're closer than they had imagined, despite differing opinions. I don't believe this belongs to either one of the two stereotypes, but becomes more of a conciliation between the two of them. If they had spent the whole movie bickering and biting at each other without ever finding a subject on which they held a common viewpoint, the ending would have been quite different indeed, and the movie would quite tiresome. But with those moments when they find themselves coming closer to one another and understanding the other's views is proof that everything could still work out.After having gone over the myriad of possibilities that could categorize this movie as being either American or "European" I think it would be most accurate to say that it is neither of the two, but more of a halfway stretch between both worlds. True, in considering the filming, music, and basic story line, it would be easy to label it as being "European", but the truth, as always, is always a lot more complicated than that. The movie treats every subject from relationships, to biases of different nationalities, from philosophy to gender contrasts. In nearly all of their conversations they end up agreeing on a halfway point of understanding. Were either of the two characters in their home country, it would have been a completely different story. But due to the fact that their meeting took place in a country equally foreign to both parties put them both at a disadvantage, and finally proved that, all dissimilarities notwithstanding, there's always a way of finding a satisfactory compromise that'll leave both parties even happier with the outcome than they had thought possible. If it were up to me, I'd have every European and American Company that had to work collaborate with one another watch the movie to demonstrate the fact that it is possible to get along, no matter how complicated it may seem at the beginning</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Barely after a few minutes have passed, you begin to realise what mess you have put yourself into.Indeed, Before Sunrise is just a succession of ultra verbose, conceptual or pseudo-psychological discussions (or even monologues) between these two characters that are Céline and Jesse. There is, so to speak, no real plot, and that is what makes this movie boring and uninteresting. Piling up soporific dialogues about anything and everything, without any specific purpose, can't make a good film.As for the direction, it is flat and uninteresting as the scenario. And Vienna, in the end, is rather badly used and doesn't sublime the movie (and vice-versa).Only Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke managed to extricate themselves, they are refreshing and there is a good chemistry between them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film you're likely to find with the most basic of plots and fewest characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unless you're actually doing something such as watching a film or reading a book, train journeys can seem rather dull. This simple yet now effective fact is used to kick start one of the most underrated, unknown yet oddly attractive films of the 1990's and possibly of all time.The train has been used as a setting in film for decades and romance is never too far away when it is the setting; whether it features in 'Some Like it Hot' (1959) and Jack Lemmon's undeniable attraction to Sugar Kane or in this film: Before Sunrise; a simple yet effective romantic drama (not a comedy) revolving solely around a mere two people and their seemingly random conversations.A film like this one does not have to be glamorous. It does not need to draw the audience in with spectacular visuals or dramatic opening sequences nor does it need to introduce a number of different characters through dialogue or otherwise to prove its point. Instead it takes a 'fly on the wall' approach. Wherever our hero's go; we go. Whatever our hero's hear; we hear. Whatever our hero's talk about; we listen and this carries on throughout. The early portion of this film is fairly light-hearted, even fun. The two people obviously have never spoken to one another in their lives and the seemingly nervous banter early on is real ice-breaker stuff which reeks of originality. The dialogue is original and uses a technique only really exploited with any real mainstream purpose by Tarantino whom, himself, was still basking in the glory of 'Pulp Fiction' (1994) which had only been around for a solitary year when this was made and released. In fact, Ethan Hawke's character's acting and much of his dialogue will remind you of Tarantino himself in the way in which he delivers his lines early on! The nervousness which Celine (Delpy) gives off is counter acted with the rather disturbing confidence that Jesse (Hawke) has throughout the opening half an hour of this film and it creates a rather fascinating juxtaposition as the two counteract each other. Here we have two seemingly complete strangers sharing pretty personal information, pretty early on in the 'relationship' and you really have to watch as to what might happen next. Will Celine accept what this rough, tough looking American has to say? Or will the character slap him and get off at the next tram stop? Interesting stuff as any thing can happen given the fact everything is happening in real time and in a very simple/real environment ? no strings attached. This creates a good atmosphere and is complimented by the long takes which stretch out our interest.Once off the train (or any other transport) the normal, familiar settings of a town/cityscape has never worked so well when in conjunction with a story as pleasant or as natural as this. The city; albeit with all its culture, beauty and so fourth - never seems too glamorous nor does it act as an arrogant, over the top setting for a story so subtle as this one yet at the same, it's more than just 'effective'.Given the simplicity of the film, there are flaws. One thing that really bothered me and seemed a little too convenient was that of the bilingual tramp/artist whom they both met during the evening. That seemed a little too forced and a little too coincidental for me, even though the whole premise is, in fact, coincidence as that's how they meet in the first place. Another thing is the certain arrogance the camera takes on. The long takes seem to drag on a little during the film, especially when we are not given any interesting background to catch a breather from. This includes the pinball machine scene in the club and should be compared to the tram scene from earlier on in the film. During these bad examples, the actors seem a little less bothered and the dialogue starts to grate a little which is not a pleasant experience. At least in 'Pulp Fiction', the characters are almost always moving on to the next setting, there's always a bit of colour or background activity and there's no annoying pinball machine noises to distract you! Overall, if you like to travel a lot or if you've visited mainland Europe before or maybe even gone through something like this yourself, you'll like this film. Don't expect anything fantastic, just a decent, well made romance which uses its settings and situation to good effect AND that leaves a fair bit of ambiguity in the air afterwards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What this movie is, quite simply, is the transition between Richard Linklater's "Slacker" and Linklater's "Waking Life"... with just a touch of romance.Two people, one played by "Explorers" star Ethan Hawke, meet on a train through Europe. After a quick chat, Hawke convinces the other (a French girl) to get off with him in Vienna for a night the two of them will never forget. We then follow them, meeting a fortune teller, some Austrian amateur actors and a bartender who gives away wine to conniving Americans.It comes down to this: if you like intimate conversations about random topics, and have liked Linklater in other films, you need to see this movie (it's only 4.88 at Wal-Mart!).

		<fullReview>Before Sunsrise is a film of dialogue. Nothing much else to say about it. Well maybe that it is very romantic. It has very little real plot. The little plot it has revolves around two people who meet on a train going through Europe. They are Jesse and Celine. Jesse is an American who is not completely sure why he is traveling through Austria and plans to get of in Venice. Celine is a french woman who is on her way back to Paris for her college term. They talk for maybe an hour before they get to the stop at Venice and Jesse has to get off. He of course convinces her to come with them and because neither have very much money they just wander around talking until sunrise when they must part for ever. They of course fall in love, have sex, and plan to meet again but deep down know they won't. It is the usual cliché of a romance but somehow it works well. Mostly because of the wonderful dialogue and the performance by Ethan Hawke. The direction is also better than usual. Somehow it works very well, much better than it probably sounds. It is also very funny.</fullReview>

Walking around that monumental city, chats about anything, poetry, wine, sex under the light of the stars. Kind of a mix between "Brief Encounter" and Rohmer's "Tales of the four seasons". It is a simple movie, with such an existentialist touch, which leans on the naturalness of Delpi and Hawke, and the chemistry between them. "Before sunrise" is a good example of how to make a romantic movie without being sickly sweet.*My rate: 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The test on whether or not you'll like this movie comes in the first 10 minutes of the film. Jesse (Ethan Hawk) is a young American touring Europe by train. Celine (Julie Delpy) is a French student returning to Paris on the same train. When Jesse breaks the ice and speaks to Celine, we share with him that awkward moment of anticipation that follows after you find the courage to "hit" on someone you find attractive. Is she interested or will she brush him off? For the film to work his "line" has to work on the audience as well as Celine. Luckily Jesse avoids lines like "What's your sign" or "Do you ride this train often". Their conversation seems to flow naturally and we don't gasp with disbelief when she agrees to join him in the dining car.What follows is basically a twenty-something, romantic version of "My Dinner With Andre", with the beautiful city of Vienna subbing for the restaurant. The elements that make this film work are 1) Intelligent, believable conversation, 2) Palpable chemistry between the leads, and 3) The gorgeous Vienna locations. Hawk's Jesse exposes enough of his insecurities and is charming enough (not to mention good-looking enough) that you believe the bright, rational Celine would get off the train to spend some time with this intriguing American. They are not a mindless Ken and Barbie couple. They are both flawed. During their wandering Jesse can't help but let his over-analytical, immature side peek through his boyish charm. Celine admits to a rebellious urge, though she's unsure what windmills she's trying to topple. Their conversations are revealing and insightful without seeming forced, and they become the basis for an understandably intense affection. They're smart enough to realize they shouldn't be falling for each other this quickly, and idealistic enough to enjoy letting it happen."Before Sunrise" is sort of a thinking man's romance, but it's still messy and dangerous and exhilarating. It's a challenging love story with a wistful, bittersweet quality that makes it a great anti-dote to all the fluffy, brainless, teen-heartthrob flicks Hollywood normally churns out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I see what everyone means by the movie being romantic and honest and a great insight into these two character's lives. But, it wasn't exactly the most entertaining movie. It was long and dragged out...I felt like we were there for the whole 24 hours they were together. A man and a woman meet on a train, decide to leave together to spend the rest of the day and night together doing nothing but talk...and thats all they did - talk. Some of the conversations were pretty interesting, but the others were just chit chat, that though i like to have with others, i do not like to watch other peoples. But, what really really drove me nuts is that we have no idea if they meet in 6 months like planned. I know, i have no imagination, but i was really disappointed when the end credits came up. I hoped they would at least show a clip of them meeting 6 months after...oh well...obviously most people liked this movie, so you should try it yourself to see if its something your would like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before Sunrise is an exceptionally boring movie. It stars Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke as a couple people who meet on a train, spend the night wandering through Vienna, and then go their separate ways at sunrise. I have to admit that there are moments that feel very genuine, and it seems more realistic and heartfelt than most romance movies. The problem is that you have to hear these two people talk, and talk, and talk for an hour and forty-five minutes and neither of them has anything interesting to say. You get to hear Hawke's ideas about reincarnation and Delpy's story about going into therapy after breaking up from a boyfriend she didn't like that much anyway, and yadda, yadda, yadda, blah, blah, blah . . . I wanted to shoot myself in the head.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This terrible, pretentious, garbage-filled dumpster-fest of a film should not exist. It is a story of two young people, an American man and a French woman who happen upon each other on a train in Europe. The man is on his way to Vienna to catch a plane the next day home. He invites the girl to travel through the city that night with him in one long romantic adventure. The entire night they talk to each other, spewing the most pretentious, pseudo poetic, fake intellectual acid speak at one another. It seems the entire movie is a competition to see who can be the most pretentious. This movie seems like the birthplace of the hipster generation. It is nauseating and not worth anyone's time.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankly, this is not the sort of film one usually expects to find in multiplexes. In fact, if it weren't in English, it might be possible to mistake this for the work of someone like Eric Rohmer. The plentiful and varied dialogue has a richness that few screenplays manage to capture. Most of Before Sunrise is talking. The characters touch on subjects ranging from language and reincarnation to sexuality and cable access shows.Jesse (Ethan Hawke) meets Celine (Julie Delpy) on a train traveling through Europe. His destination is Vienna, where a flight back to America awaits him the next morning. She's on her way to Paris, where she starts classes at the Sorbonne next week. From their first moment of eye contact, they're drawn to each other. They share a meal in the lounge car, savoring the conversation more than the food, and when they arrive in Vienna, Jesse persuades Celine to disembark with him and keep him company wandering the streets until the time comes for his plane to depart. Thus begins an unforgettable screen romance.One of the first things to notice about Before Sunrise is how completely natural it all seems. Credit both director Linklater and his two leads. The rapport between Jesse and Celine is so lacking in artifice that at times the viewer feels like a voyeur. We are privy to everything, including the sort of "unimportant" dialogue that most films shy away from. Here, its inclusion is just one of many fresh elements.Hawke (the American grunge actor who starred opposite Winona Ryder in Reality Bites) and Delpy (the French actress from Europa Europa, White, and Killing Zoe) are nothing short of perfect. For this film to work, they have a threefold task: embrace their characters, attract each other, and connect with the audience. Needless to say, all are accomplished flawlessly. From the first stolen glance, there's never any question about their chemistry, and it takes no more time for the audience to be enraptured by Jesse and Celine than it does for them to fall for each other.Before Sunrise is about life, romance, and love. It magnifies the little things, paying scrupulous attention to the subtleties and mannerisms of body language. There's one scene where Jesse has to restrain himself from brushing away a stray lock of Celine's hair, and another wonderful moment in a music listening booth where the characters nervously avoid eye contact.This film is an amalgamation of such memorable scenes, yet, as they saying goes, the whole is more than a sum of its parts. Questions about fate and the transitory nature of relationships are raised, then left open for the audience to ponder. There are moments of unforced humor, and times of bittersweet poignancy. Before Sunrise speaks as much to the mind as to the heart, and much of what it says is likely to strike a responsive chord -- a rare and special accomplishment for any motion picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Economical if dramatically uneventful romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A man is travelling home. He makes an interim stop in an alien city. There he falls in love; but at dawn the next morning he is obliged to head off once again. The abandoned woman kills herself.No (don't worry!), not the plot of this film. Rather that's the rough outline of Dido and Aeneas, an opera by Henry Purcell whose overture is the music that underpins the title sequence. Making such allusions to the melodrama of a great romance is typical of this understated film. Throughout we are given a record of the brief encounter but we are never coerced into getting mushy about it; Linklater wants us to connect the story with our own experiences or fantasies. The romance is in our imagination, not on the screen.It's an impressive (and successful) high-concept stance to have taken but it does mean there's little drama. What the film lacks in this it makes up for in an open-faced honesty and charm. There is no resorting to the occasional tumescence of an argument to move the plot along. I found it fairly trying, although Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke make it watchable. A wide-eyed youngster's film executed by a grown-up. 6/10</fullReview>

After a half hour or so, you know where this is going.Nonetheless, the acting by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy is fine.Will they meet in 6 months as promised?

		<shortDescription>Empty spiritedness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By now you may know that this is about two people falling in love around Vienna and otherwise cinematically plain. Beautiful young faces, beautiful old Europe, in principle very much a European film such as Woody Allen has fantasized about it, if not in actual spirit. He is cynical and boyish, she is a dreamer, excited, open to the flows of life. They listen to music, talk, walk, have their palms read, a really dreamy summer night of sharing and intimacy.We stick it out because at dawn it expires, and the lives of mundane responsibilities are resumed. It is a parting like death of sorts, like someone is going out of life. How will they handle it? Will they fiercely cling at what they shared? Will they accept the memory of it?There is however a second movie that came out 10 years later, where we get to find out whatever happened between these two, or didn't. So for all intents and purposes, whether originally designed so or merely improvised along the way, this is only one half of a full movie - very much like Wong Kar Wai's In the Mood for Love. The resolution is predictable, the heartbreak postponed for another sunrise. Oh, we get to know these two really well, whether we like it or not. They are full of opinions, dreams, rebellions, a lot of empty spiritedness like is common in youth discovering a larger world. We get to know them well enough to imagine some pain ahead of them, the bill for the good times enjoyed here. But unlike In the Mood for Love, this has none - perhaps one, the big ferris wheel at sunset - of the melancholy moods to wrap around us, that will allow us to permeate the silence behind words where love runs deeper, richer. It is not cinematically succulent in any ways that I am seeking out.Being from that slacker generation that gave us Tarantino and Kevin Smith, it's a film illustrating a screenplay. The effort is for quirky emotion and smartness. A romance and connection from words, instead of romance from the profoundness of rhythms and gestures. Forgettable work.</fullReview>

I guess we can all relax how: Rick Linklater's been to Europe!Hawke and especially Delphy: there's nothing wrong with them - but you have to understand the premise of this one before you take the plunge. It's going to be stupid conversation followed by stupid conversation followed by stupid conversation. That's it. You don't get more, Bubba.They say a work of art should aspire to communicating something that cannot be communicated in words. The movie communicates nothing - it is boring. It is worse than every dumb conversation you've overheard at Gare du Nord or in Hamburg or whatever city you want to pick. It's trivial, it's banal, and it's not particularly sophisticated at all. And the work of the two principals can't change a thing.I will go this far: anyone who thinks this is class movie making needs to get out more. Anyone who thinks this movie is good is a bloody idiot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>well, coming from the director of Dazed and Confuse, what would you expect?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The bottom line is whether or not the film was entertaining or not. Yes and no. The story depicts two people falling in love for the evening. But did the viewer become attached to their situation by the end? No, at the end of the film, the two forget the idea o never seeing each other again and decide to meet there exactly six months from that date, no matter the circumstances. At times the realness of the characters sort of turns a part of the audience off by giving away too much of the character's personalities. The part of the audience that could identify with particular traits of the characters was pleased, but the other became a bit alienated by doing this. This latter part of the audience, the part that was not so swayed by the character's identities, must have been thankful that the 18 plus hours of the adventure were not actually shot in real-time, or more relationships would have been weakened rather than strengthened due to one of the two leaving the movie theater out of pure boredom. The point is that the story was not maximized to its full potential. The characters were lacking traits that could have made them dynamic. Although Linklater was playing off of the realistic atmosphere he was trying to create, often this does not describe the reason people go to the movies: to fulfill a fantasy; to enter a new, entertaining world for a ninety minute time span. If the viewer is not entranced by the artificial world created within the movie, then viewers will not be inspired. And if there exists no inspiration, then life would get, well, boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen this movie once before I was excited to watch it again. I remembered enjoying the dialogue, characters, and uniqueness of the plot. However, it is not good. It really isn't. This is a bad movie. It doesn't capture my attention, I'm bored, the dialogue though good, isn't enough. Perhaps this is the perfect movie for hopeless romantics who have nothing better to do than watch sappy movies. For a romantic comedy this movie leans far too much towards the romantic and far to little towards the comedy. The awkward interactions and revealing moments, the silences that say so much are all very real, but am I having a good time watching this? No. Will I come away from this with anything? No. The only reason I can understand someone watching this is because they have recently had their heart broken or are trying to get into a girls pants. As far as the former is concerned-this movie won't mend your broken heart. And for the latter-she decided before the movie started whether or not you were getting any, so don't waste your time or hers.</fullReview>

We kept expecting something more exciting to happen, which never materialized. In the end, we could not understand the high ratings it received when compared to films like The English Patient and many others, which had slightly lower ratings on IMDb. We also felt this was a rather low budget film, basically over-rated and would never take the time to watch it a second time 5 or 10 years later - unlike many other well done films worth seeing again.

		<fullReview>The scenery was beautiful as the train moved across Europe. I sort of liked the classical music that was playing. The train crossed a nice bridge, but unfortunately soon after that we had to find out what was going on inside the train. Jesse and Celine met, and while the actors did a good job playing them and the characters were likeable and sometimes funny, I found myself more interested in what was outside the window of the train.The two main characters got off the train in Vienna. It's a beautiful city, with lots of elegant, classic buildings. And from high above the city at one point, we could see lots of trees. We also got to see the inside of a magnificent church. The couple crossed another nice-looking bridge and, finally, I thought the movie was about to get good. Jesse and Celine met two actors who were really funny right from the start, and quite appealing. But we never saw those two again. The best part of the movie for me was the amusement park. Not that there was much to that, but the couple danced (for all of maybe ten seconds) to Boots Randolph's 'Yakety Sax' in front of a game that I believe said 'Punch Belly' with a funny-looking man painted on it. There were several scenes with guitar-based folk music or folk rock that didn't do much for me. I wanted the classical music back. Or Boots Randolph.Some people might enjoy the quirky characters, such as a fortune teller, or the poet who didn't beg for money but offered to write a poem based on a word he was given in exchange for whatever the recipient felt it was worth (He had probably already written the poem). I can see people enjoying a movie like this. It just wasn't for me.</fullReview>

The scene where they make imaginary phone-calls to their friends to talk about each other was wonderful. But if they fell so hard for each other then why didn't they feel the need to call or write? Because that would require too much effort? The ending causes this movie to fall short. The 'lets leave everything to chance' routine has been used so much in recent years its become groan inducing. Jesse says that people in a committed relationship become bored with each other once they've learned everything there is to know. That didn't sound real to me. It sounded like an excuse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ALL MY REVIEWS CONTAIN SPOILERS. EVERY ONE OF THEM.I've always considered myself a reasonable man. If a movie isn't chock-full of nudity, sure, I may be p***ed, but at least give me wall to wall violence. If the movie isn't overflowing with blood, I may be disappointed, but at least give me some form of conflict. I'm a big fan of chaos, confusion, and disorder; in reality as well as in the movies. To put it plainly...DRAMA. Movies do not need comedy to work, nor horror, nor sex-- but DRAMA is a necessity. It is an absolute must. And what's the definition of drama? Conflict of some kind. Before Sunrise is the only movie known to mankind with no drama.Before you applaud the film's originality, understand this: ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAPPENS DURING THE COURSE OF THE ENTIRE MOVIE. Let me repeat that. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAPPENS DURING THE COURSE OF THE ENTIRE MOVIE. When I say nothing, I mean NOTHING. Trust me, reader I understand movies don't all have to have warehouse explosions, truck explosions, and people explosions (that would be Utopia) but at least have something happen!!! This movie is hardcore proof that hell exists. Because here is a 2 hour slice of it. I do not see how Satan can run his underground operation without including this movie in some way.Yes, we want our movies to be true to life. But not at entertainment's expense. And don't gimme that "Oh, how interesting and realistic this film was" crap either. My own personal life on any given day is more interesting than this movie!! If I wake up puking from last night's beer escapade, at least that's SOMETHING. And I don't wanna hear that "It's a chick flick, guys won't get it" crap either. The chick I was watching it with was BEGGING me to turn it off, but I am stubborn and I can never let a movie beat me.The movie stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. Here is the plot: Two people, one whom you can't even understand, talk for 2 hours. Period. That's it. They never argue. No one bothers them. There isn't even conflict in the general conversation! And you people call this realistic?? Guys, you mean to tell me it is possible to chat with a woman without wondering "What the hell is she even talking about?" I think not. And women, you mean to tell me it is possible to meet a man who is so sensitive and understanding to your needs that he just wants to "listen" without any thought of reward for his troubles? Yeah, keep dreaming. And keep watching these Hollywood romance movies.See, here is the difference between how men and women watch movies. A guy can watch Bruce Willis run through a building barefoot and take on a dozen terrorists all by himself and dismiss it as the sheer entertainment of a movie. We know this will never happen, and if we find ourselves in that situation, we will be the first ones to run away screaming and looking for a phone to dial 911. But women can't seem to differentiate movie from reality. Especially when it comes to these Hollywood romances. So let me tell you women a few things...1.) Men and women do NOT meet by crashing their cars together at a red light and exchanging phone numbers! Every time I've ever been in a car wreck, whether male or female, I had to prepare for a fight.2.) If he starts off perfect at first, unlike television, he will not end that way, too. You wanna know why he started nice? He wants the panties!! This is not Quantum physics here! I thought you ladies were the smarter of the 2 genders. It sure doesn't seem like it. And if you're waiting for your own personal Ben Affleck, Luke Wilson, or Matthew McConaughey to come and sweep you off your feet, guess what? Even THEY are the same way. They are only playing characters in a movie! That's why they call it ACTING. It's all pretend!!3.) No man will ever, and I mean EVER, propose to you on the screen of a Jumbo-Tron at a baseball game. What man would risk that type of possible embarrassment? Not only that, no man wants the world (especially other ladies) to see that he has officially become a fool by taking himself off the open market. Ladies, be grateful he even proposes! If he does it on an answering machine, email, or through Morse code, thank your lucky stars every day of your life.After suffering through the nonsense called Before Sunrise, you'd think the director would have the common curtesy to thank the audience by AT LEAST showing a sex scene, right? Wrong. The sex is done off camera. I mean, what is this movie even trying to prove??? After about 45 minutes, I mean, it's not even funny anymore. Something has GOT to happen! But it doesn't. It goes on and on, with no resolution. Then on top of that, it ends like there will be a sequel. Not in my life time. I never thought movies could get worse than Magnolia, but this one wins with flying colors. Before Sunrise is the absolute worst movie of all time.Zero stars out of 5.</fullReview>

However , I found it really boring. The plot is unbelievable. Would a girl really get off the train with a total stranger? They don't even know each other's names yet at that stage! I find the lines are twisted and winding. Ethan Hawke's character tries hard to be philosophical and smart. It would have been good in a drama, but in a romantic comedy, I find that annoying. There is too much dialog in the film, and there are many times I wish they talked less.This film disappoints me given the good word of mouth it is getting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to stress again that the chemistry between Hawke and Delpy was near to nothing. I saw no sparks, no interest, and no bond. It was as if Hawke hated everything that Delpy did (see the poet and the fortuneteller), while Delpy just was looking for an American man to spend the day with. I felt as if she was trying to create that special moment from nothing, as if it was her goal for the entire evening with Hawke. She wanted to have one of those romantic evening for two in Vienna, and I caught from her character that anyone with half-a-brain would do well for the adventure. That person, in this case, happened to be Ethan Hawke. So, they attempt to have these moments, forcibly interrupted by Hawke trying to throw a kiss in there every once in awhile that wasn't scripted (to seem more "real") that only made Delpy seem disgusted. I just felt that when these two did kiss, they didn't really enjoy it as much as they should have. As I think about this point, I can't help but think of a line that Celine uses in this film. She states, "No, then it sounds like a male fantasy. Meet a French girl on the train, have her, and never see her again." What if this was reversed on Celine, perhaps she was trying to find a man on a train, have him, then never sees him again. When I first met these characters, that was my initial thought. I did not see them together for the long haul, but after they talked for an hour and a half, I guess they had to fall in love. This was a totally mismatched pair by director Richard Linklater, and when you only have two main focuses in the film, I would have to say that should be your only job ? ensuring that you have two people that actually build chemistry on the scene. Hawke and Delpy did not.Speaking of Richard Linklater (director of School of Rock), I do not think that he had a good grasp of this film from the beginning. I think he was attempting to show, without too much of a script, if two people could fall in love after a chance meeting on a train. What would be the "real" reactions, and how would it ultimately end? Sorry to say that Linklater does a poor job with this film, especially the ending where it doesn't even have a successful climax. That's the worst part of the film-it keeps on going and going, but it really overstays its welcome and becomes too repetitive towards the end. That was not helping him at all by having this slow ending.I have heard people quote this film as the "greatest love story" ever. I would have to differ with them because of the characterization and portrayal of our Jesse and Celine. Both were uncomfortable, unstructured, and fractured in their parts and it was obvious through the screen. I have seen better love stories, and better stories will continue to be released!Grade: ** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most difficult scenes in acting is when a fictitious character is to naturally recount an old memory. Often in dramatics, an actor tells of some old memory with just a hint of averted eyes and awkward facial expressions. It is difficult to act out the natural timing of facial expressions as a person taps their own memory. In real life, we all do this with ease with our true memories. But actors in a movie are dealing with make-believe, so there is nothing in their brains to be retrieved and it is very easy to see through the acting.From beginning to end, BEFORE SUNRISE is a movie with two main characters who do almost nothing but recount to each other happenings from their individual pasts. Unfortunately, the actors are not up to this difficult task.Apparently, most of these many strolls down memory lane are meant to end with some clever insight on humanity. About one in one hundred succeeds.There is no catchy music, no passion, and very little to maintain interest. The viewer's mind begins to ponder side items, such as the facial structure of the actors chosen for this movie. The lead actor and actress have the same nose and chin and eyes. They could be brother and sister. And the palm reader looked to be the mother of the lead actress.Last, the script has some unmissable glitches. The audience that was around me murmured much disapproval during the bar scene when the bar owner and the lead actor shake hands on a deal in which the bar owner would give the lead actor the mailing address to the bar so that the lead actor can later mail payment for wine given out. Just when we expect the address to be given, the lead actor walks away and he and the bar owner act as if the deal never happened.The characters learn about each other in an impractical backwards manner in terms of the science of mating. No digits are exchanged. No addresses or such personal data perhaps only because the script gives highest priority to the retelling of old memories -- old memories that are fake. Unsatisfying. Unentertaining. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this piece of crap last month and I have one suggestion for all; don't waste your money to rent this piece of garbage. I really can't understand how anyone could enjoy this movie and have a hard time getting it through my head why it was made in the first place. As a matter of fact, I don't know why I'm wasting my time even talking about such a lousy movie. The main characters acting as if they an ounce of intelligence is not believable. The movie goes nowhere and all copies of this movie should be destroyed.......blaaagh!!!</fullReview>
